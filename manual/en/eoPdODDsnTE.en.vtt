00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.100
Last week, we talked about creating game assets
using a sketch-like approach. In this video,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.040
we are going to take a first look at a second
method: drawing with shapes.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.060
The idea behind this technique is to avoid
sketching the outlines of your assets. Instead,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.920
we are going to play with their shapes or
silhouettes right away. This is an approach

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.170
that concept artists love to use. It is a
great way to generate very strong silhouettes

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.480
and poses fast.
As I said in the last video, this is an approach

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.390
that painters are comfortable with. Traditional
painters have to visualize their characters'

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.090
silhouettes to put them down on the canvas.
This makes sense as they generally use a somewhat

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.080
thick brush to paint. At least they cover
a surface faster than using a pen.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.180
For an experienced painter, drawing outlines
first is often a slowdown.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.100
Vector artists are also familiar with that
technique. By nature, most vector tools are

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.029
shape-friendly more so than sketch-friendly.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.060
In any case, working with shapes and silhouettes is an efficient way to create game assets.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.960
There are a few ways we can approach silhouette-based

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.530
game asset creation. We can use:
Selection tools. In particular the lasso selection.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.730
Brushes. That is probably the one tool concept
artists use the most.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.480
And custom shapes or stencils.
Today, we are going to see how we can use selections.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.600
You may ask: why selections? Selection tools

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.970
simply give us an uncluttered drawing experience.
You can very quickly not only add, but also

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.640
subtract and intersect selections together.
Selections also force you to visualize your

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.530
shapes before drawing them. Which is great!
As digital artists, we tend to lack opportunities

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.210
to train our visualization skills. But they
are essential! In particular for designers

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.390
and visual storytellers. With selections,
you cannot simply draw random shapes. You

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.860
cannot lay down lucky strokes on the canvas
and try to extend them, like you would with

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.840
a brush. You have to think about the shape
you are going to select before you draw it.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.070
The power of selections goes beyond that.
On top of filling the selection, you can simply

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.790
paint inside it with a brush. This opens up
a wide array of possibilities.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.100
There are 2 selection tools we are going to
focus on: the freehand lasso and the polygonal

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.230
lasso. Although the rectangular and circular
selection tools are useful too, a game artist

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.650
rarely needs them to create silhouettes.
The freehand lasso tool, as its name suggests,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.280
is a freehand selection tool. Its default
shortcut is the L key. I personally assigned

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.510
it to the Q key, which I can tap with my fourth
finger. Once you have selected the tool, you

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.490
just have to click and drag on the canvas
to draw a selection. Once you release your

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.880
click, the selection is automatically closed.
The polygonal lasso tool only slightly differs

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.010
from its freehand counterpart. With it, you
don’t drag the mouse freely around the canvas

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.430
to draw a selection. Instead, you click to
define points and segments of selection. You

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.340
can use as many points as you want. Whenever
you click on the first point or Ctrl click,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.260
you close the selection, which creates a polygon.
You can also close the selection by pressing enter.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.980
The polygonal lasso is useful whenever you

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.260
need to create mechanical objects, buildings,
rocks, etc. It can also be useful for stylistic

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.720
effects. If you want to make a chunky art
style, for instance.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.260
In Photoshop, you can combine polygonal and
freehand selections at the same time with

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.800
the polygonal lasso tool. You simply need
to hold the Alt key down, and click and drag.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.420
It is a bit like using the vector pen tool.
But with a fast, forward only approach: you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.100
cannot edit your selection as you can edit
a vector shape.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.080
It gets some time getting used to, so be sure
to practice this technique a bit!

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.280
In all good digital drawing software, and
in Photoshop in particular, you can combine

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.280
selections in a few ways. With any selection
tool, you can:

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.470
Add selections, Subtract selections

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.630
and Intersect selections. The most common Boolean operation with selections

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.440
is probably the addition. In Photoshop, you
can easily add a selection to an existing

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.630
one. If you keep the shift key down while
you have a selection tool active, you will

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.120
see a little plus sign next to your cursor.
This means that the selection you’re going

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.480
to make will be added to the existing selection.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.720
There are two other operations available with

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.690
selections: subtraction and intersection.
To subtract a selection, you simply need to

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.639
keep the alt key down with any selection tool
active. A little minus icon should appear

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.260
next to your cursor.
To get the intersection of two selections,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.710
you want to keep both the shift and alt keys
down at the same time. A multiply sign should

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.230
show up next to your cursor.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.110
That’s it for this video! This week, I decided

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.110
to focus on talking about the tools. I want
to give the example process its own video.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.360
It is a bit like separating theory and practice.
What do you think: do you like this choice?

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.250
Please tell me in the comments below.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.520
There are numerous ways to draw with shapes.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.000
Future videos will be dedicated to other tools
like custom shapes and the vector pen tool.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.180
Working with selections is pretty hard to
get into at first. In particular if you don’t

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.490
have a background in painting. So if you want
to try it, give it some time! You can experiment

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.260
with just some or all of the techniques exposed
in this video. What matters the most is that

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.620
you take your time and enjoy the process.
