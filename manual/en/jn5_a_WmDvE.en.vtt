BOB'S RED MILL OLD COUNTRY STYLE MUESLI SCRIPT
[BOB] Hi folks.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.530
I'm Bob Moore, founder and president of Bob's
Red Mill Natural Foods.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.330
I'm here with Matthew Cox, our director of
marketing, to tell you about one of our most

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.180
popular products—Bob's Red Mill Old Country
Style Muesli.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.689
Many years ago, my wife Charlee and I stayed
at a beautiful bed and breakfast in the Scottish

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:27.689
countryside.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.330
One morning, our hostess served us the most
amazing cereal.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.040
It was full of rolled grains, nuts, seeds
and dried fruit.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:45.420
This was my first contact with the traditional
European cereal known as Muesli, and Charlee

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.410
and I just could not get enough of it.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.080
In fact, we enjoyed it so much that we were
inspired with the idea to make our very own

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.880
version of this nutritious cereal—and when
we came back from our trip, we did just that.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:11.570
We started with a combination of five flavorful
rolled grains—oats, wheat, barley, rye and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.600
triticale.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.080
Then we added sweet dates and raisins from
California, crunchy sunflower seeds, almond

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.990
slices and walnut pieces—and finally, for
an extra boost of nutrition, we topped it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.909
off with a good handful of flaxseed meal,
which is full of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.150
Voila!

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.480
Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli!

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.950
[MATT] A quick bit of Muesli history: it was
invented over a century ago by a Swiss doctor

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.741
who was way ahead of his time when it came
to understanding the health benefits of whole

00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:53.930
grains.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.930
He made all of his patients eat muesli every
day—and they loved it.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.930
The traditional Swiss way to eat muesli is
to mix it up with yogurt and let it soak overnight.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.840
The combination of whole grain fiber in the
muesli and live cultures in the yogurt is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.189
the perfect pairing of pre- and pro-biotics.

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:18.629
That makes the beneficial bacteria in your
gut thrive, which helps your immune system

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.189
to be healthy and strong.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.049
[BOB] And it certainly helps body function!

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.780
--- Muesli soaked in yogurt is delicious,
but the way I like it best as a hot cereal,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.629
cooked on the stove like oatmeal.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.810
There are really so many ways to enjoy this
fabulous elixir of life—hot or cold, or

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.060
even baked into cookies.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.920
One of the beautiful thing about our muesli,
and it's a little known fact, is that all

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.049
the grains are lightly steamed before they're
rolled—so they've already been cooked, just

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.219
a little bit, and can be eaten right out of
the bag, just like that!

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:03.269
[MATT] Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli
is actually one of our most popular items.

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.599
Nowadays there are so many cereals out there
that are chock-full of added sweeteners, artificial

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.140
flavors and other junk, but our muesli goes
against that trend—it has a short list of

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.999
whole-food, whole grain ingredients, and all
the sweetness comes from the natural sugars

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.279
in the dried fruit.

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:27.810
I think that's why our muesli has become a
favorite for so many—it's just a simple,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.870
wholesome cereal that tastes good!

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.640

Style Muesli wherever you shop—at your favorite
