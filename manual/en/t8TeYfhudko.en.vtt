00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:32.749
I come to the garden alone 
while the dew is still on the roses

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:48.174
and the voice I hear falling on
my ear the Son of God discloses

00:00:48.174 --> 00:01:02.863
And He walks with me, and He talks
with me, and He tells me I am His own

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:17.387
And the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:31.227
He speaks and the sound of His voice is
so sweet the birds hush their singing

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:45.947
And the melody that He gave to me
within my heart is ringing

00:01:45.947 --> 00:02:00.451
And He walks with me, and He talks
with me, and He tells me I am His own

00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:15.192
And the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:29.537
Iâ€™d stay in the garden with Him
though the night around me be falling

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:47.096
But He bids me go, through the voice
of woe His voice to me is calling

00:02:47.096 --> 00:03:02.053
And He walks with me, and He talks
with me, and He tells me I am His own

00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:16.125
And the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:34.929
And the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known
