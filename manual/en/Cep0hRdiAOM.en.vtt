00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm Jerry Monkman. I'm a nature and adventure photographer

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.170
from Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.700
I'm also co-author, with my wife Marcy, of Discover Acadia National Park, a guide to the best

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.600
hiking, biking, and paddling in Acadia.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.980
I'm here on Sand Beach in Acadia today to
talk about some simple things you can do

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.460
to improve your outdoor photography.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.320
Now the following three tips just scratch
the surface when it comes to making

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.289
great images.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.020
But even if you the most beginner of
photographers, by practicing these

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.040
concepts you can greatly improve your
photography.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.500
Now, before we get started I want to really
encourage you to get out and tune in

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.309
to the place you're photographing. You can't just pull over to the scenic view

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.120
sign and get out and snap off a few. You really need to get on your hiking boots,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.530
get on a bike,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.580
or go out on a boat and paddle around. This forces you to relax and get in touch with

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.269
yoursurroundings.

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.280
The great Galen Rowell called this
participating in the landscape

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.239
and I feel it is imperative to finding new
and interesting subject matter

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.780
and the photo stories that only come from
truly understanding

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.330
a place. By the way, Acadia is a great place to explore

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.979
on foot, on a bike, or with a paddle.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.880
Nowâ€”on to the tips. Tip number 1:

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.330
Follow the rule of thirds. The rule of
third is an old composition technique

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.950
that basically says don't place your main subject in the center of the photo. Now imagine

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.640
your camera's viewfinder

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.600
is divided into thirds, both vertically and horizontally. Now instead of placing

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.900
your main subject in the  middle of the picture

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.970
place it at one of those points where these lines intersect. This gives your photo a more

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.680
pleasing balance. But more importantly

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.610
it forces you to really work your composition. As you try placing your main subject

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.070
in different parts

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.500
of the photo it changes how it relates to the
scene and eventually you'll end up with a

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.080
composition that works really well. For
landscape shots

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.460
avoid placing your horizon in the middle of the scene.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.660
Instead, try putting it in the top third or
the bottom third

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.270
of the frame. If you have an interesting foreground, try putting it in the top third to emphasize the foreground.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.500
With beautiful skies, place it on the bottom
third to highlight the sky.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.800
Basically, use composition as a way to
emphasize that part of the photo that is

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.860
most important to you.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.900
Tip two:

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.670
Shoot your subject in great light.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.050
No matter how well you

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.450
compose your photograph, you shoot it in mediocre light and it has no chance of being great.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.200
The scene here is beautiful, but it looks just OK in the mid-day sun. The light is harsh, casting

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.600
dark shadows and it has an unattractive blue tone to it. Big landscapes like this look best during the golden hour,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.050
that time of day around sunrise and sunset

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.280
That means stay out late or

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.400
get up early.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.170
Here on the coast of Maine, that can be before

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.500
4 or 4:30 in the summertime, but

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.300
it's worth it to see that great light.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.240
Like this! Now isn't this more beautiful? Golden hour light is softer, producing more detail in the shadows

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.030
and really highlighting the textures in the
landscape. It also has a warm orange tone

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.050
that imparts drama and is more pleasing to
the eye

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.880
than the harsh blue light of mid- day. On cloudy days

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.410
head into the woods where the diffuse overcast light is perfect for shooting forest

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.600
scenes, waterfalls, and close-ups like flowers

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.830
and ferns. And use a polarizing filter to really make those

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.700
colors pop. Tip number three: Keep it simple. The outdoors is a visually complex

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.880
three-dimensional space.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.130
It's the photographers goal to translate
that complexity

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.350
into a compelling two-dimensional photo. Now it's really hard to do

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.650
so you need to keep it simple by composing
your photo in a way that eliminates any

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.400
distracting elements or backgrounds.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.590
You're responsible for every little
millimeter in the frame

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.800
so if there's something in there that
distracts from your main subject and doesn't enhance

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.940
it, recompose to get rid of it.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.200
By simplifying your photograph you make
sure that it's obvious what your

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.980
pictures is about.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.980
If you have to explain what it is then you've failed.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.030
Those are your three photo tips.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.420
Follow the rule of thirds, shoot in the great light, and keep it simple.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.130
Now get out there and tune into the wonder that is Acadia National Park

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.750
with its miles of scenic coastline, over
100 miles of hiking trails, and

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.200
more than 50 miles of carriage roads, Acadia is a top-notch destination for

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.820
outdoor recreation.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.590
And in our book, Discover Acadia National
Park, we detail

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.100
50 hiking, biking, and paddling trips, all of which make great great

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.420
opportunities for experience the park with your camera.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.400
