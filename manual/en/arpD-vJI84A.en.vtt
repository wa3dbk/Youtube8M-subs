00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.569
this week we're gonna talk about the
difference between something is blurry

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.709
and something that's out of focus Adorama TV
presents exploring photography

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.770
with Mark Wallace where you will learn
innovative techniques

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.259
I'm shooting a wide range of photography
hi everybody welcome to another episode

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.070
of exploring photography I Mark Wallace
and I'm joined by Lee and she is our

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.630
model

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.490
and I remember this is brought to you by
Adorama is the camera store

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.820
the has everything for photographers
tripods and cameras lighting kids and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.750
flashes you name it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.289
Adorama has it is where I get my gear
and you should let their till but today

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.230
really talking about one of my pet
peeves

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.750
and that is when people interchange the
words blurry without a focus

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.890
and I get this comment all the time on
YouTube in email

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.090
and on Facebook people are saying hey
what's wrong with my image

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.350
it looks like is totally out of focus
I'm not sure why and I look at the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.670
picture and turns out it's blurry

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.109
or some real asked me how can I get that
blurry background they really nice

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.590
blurry background that you talk about

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.969
and that's not it's in our focus
background and the reason that those two

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.710
different things are really important to
understand is one

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.220
happens from the Lancer controlling that
from the lens as the focus

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.800
and the other one the blur you're
controlling with your camera shutter

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.950
so we need to understand the difference
between those two things because if you

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.190
can see this new things out

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.600
you can see the reproduce it every time
or you can fix it if you have a problem

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.020
to really talk about that but first
let's hear about some contests from

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.690
Adorama

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.010
I'm but it's Marc Wallace make sure you
check out at aromas latest contest

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.120
you could win some great prizes all
right let's start by talking about focus

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.670
I have right now is have my camera set
so it's focused right here

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.440
on Lee N so this is in focus and the
background back there is

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.100
out-of-focus so that's not a blurry
background is in our folks back and let

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.500
me show you exactly what I'm talking
about I had my camera set to an aperture

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.950
value

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.090
2.8 again is really shallow
depth-of-field

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.530
to know more about that the field to
check it out at the end of a learning

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.650
center its episode I believe twelve %uh

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
digital photography 1 on one people are
all about for you take a picture

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.280
the answer we look right at me and I am
focusing on her face

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.890
okay I got it focused right in your face
you can see we have a nice clear image

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.340
of her

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.450
the background is out of focus now watch
this ownership the manual focus

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.950
I'm going to twist my lens until I'm
focused in the background

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.969
take another picture and now you can see

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.079
that what we have is an out-of-focus
picture it's not blurry

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.540
she's out-of-focus to fix this image
many to do is

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.049
focus with the lens so I'll do that when
she won more here

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.939
yea perfect alright we fix that image

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.799
so that's focus no malice talk about
blur blurs class when your shutter is

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.150
open on your camera and the camera moves

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.909
and so what happens is when I shutters
open in everything's moving you're

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.989
getting all kinds like net causes blur

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.939
and say let me show you exactly what's
happening thread done here's a change my

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.030
aperture value to 16 have closed it way
down

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.749
and by doing that I could slow my
shutter speed down my shutter speed is

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.909
actually a twentieth a second to really

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.359
slow shutter speed but that this tripod
so when I first do here

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.879
as I'm going to focus on me and I
couldn't before lockdown my tripod

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.170
me and you really still not take a
picture

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.400
me to see that that looks pretty clear
but what would happen if I

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.569
loosen up my tripod here they took the
same picture

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.920
in my camera is moving now you can see
that that is a blurry

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.090
picture and so to fix that what we need
to do is we need to speed up our shutter

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.769
or use a tripod and that is the
difference between something it's blurry

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.829
and something that our focus to don't
confuse those two things because if

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.749
you're nice out-of-focus background

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.060
what you need to do is use your aperture
if you wanna blurry picture will you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.609
slow down your shutter speed we're gonna
fix the

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.489
blur speed up your shutter speed you get
the idea don't interchange blurry

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.540
without a focus they're not the same
thing once you know the difference

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.799
should be a better photographer

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.980
