00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.500
Hello and welcome to Gadget Guide USA. Thanks

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.040
for watching my 81997 Red and Green laser
Waterproof Outdoor Landscape Garden Projector

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.210
and Light Show Effect product review. As you
can see here I have it set up kind of in a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.730
wide space. The light is, I don’t know,
about 10 yards behind me so the projection

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.599
from light to the wall is about I don’t
know, 22 yards or so. It’s extremely bright.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.140
It’s really neat looking. You can illuminate
an entire tree or you know even large canopies

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.970
above this. I am really blown away by how
cool this looks and I just decided to go ahead

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.380
and start this one in the dark with the best
display I could set up within the confines

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.050
of my studio.
I hope you enjoyed that demo. I am just going

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.250
to say that demo did not do this product justice.
The laser beam reached way farther than the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.790
way I had it set up so really I don’t want
to say there’s a maximum to this but even

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.489
at 40 yards this thing was amazingly bright.
Of course I don’t have it on right now.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.409
I just…I’ve already tried to show you
the lighting show. Like I said my demo didn’t

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.580
do it justice. Maybe I’ll revisit it at
a later date but for now we’re going to

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.570
go ahead and go over the construction.
As you can see I’ve kind of neatened all

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.659
the chords back up and I got them tied. That’s
your standard 3 prong plug so a ground is

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.090
required. We move on down the line and we
can see this waterproof coating protecting

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.330
all the circuits there. That’s because this
device is actually rated IP65 so it is completely

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.890
waterproof and dustproof. You can see the
manufacturing here is very solid. Everything’s

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.450
well put together. There’s no room for you
know water to leak in. I mean I probably wouldn’t

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.689
try to submerge this but as you can see here
it does have a waterproof fitting so it’s

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.520
definitely going to take a rain. And as you
can see I just go ahead…you have to slide

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.729
these 2 ends in and lock them in and then
you grab this and you can see if you tighten

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.299
it all the way down we do in fact have a water
resistant coupling there. So I do like that.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.729
Everything’s well made. You have over 190
inches of chord. If you’d like to know the

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.939
exact dimensions I’ll measure it after this
video and of course it will always be at the

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.519
end. The chord seems to be…this doesn’t
seem to be heavy duty or anything but it seems

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.859
to be standard make and well made. All the
places where chords normally break at the

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:25.260
end here seem to be supported in multiple
ways. As you can see you have the watertight

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.620
coupling there. We have that heavy duty piece
there. We have this heavy duty piece there.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.549
So it all seems to be made to last. And as
you can see I’ll let that slide out there.

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.040
You can kind of see how this locks in. It
just has 2 little squares. I obviously didn’t

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.349
tighten it as much as I should have because
I just wanted to do a demo and I didn’t

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.180
actually stick it in the ground. But you can
see this is a ground stake. You can essentially…you

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.260
slide these in here and you can tighten it
down so you can get a lot of different angles

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.349
there. I will say this thing is incredibly
bright. The directions say specifically not

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.840
to look into the LED’s and of course I did
anyway because I’m hardheaded and I’m

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.590
pretty sure I still have a little green spot
floating around. So this thing was really

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.199
bright. I was really amazed by how bright
it in fact was. So you stick it in the ground

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:20.159
there and of course you can just tighten those
screws down. Of course I didn’t but you

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.569
can just tighten those screws down and get
pretty much any angle. You can spin it to

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.719
any angle according to the ground stake. So
that should be able to fit a lot of different

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:33.069
options. But as you can see this connection
where the chord comes in that’s normall

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.569
a place where a lot of chords fail you know
from tugging on it and so forth. It actually

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.809
has some type of epoxy or hardened resin around
the chord. That’s probably A to make sure

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:46.939
you don’t pull it out and B to make sure
any water gets in there. This is all the way

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.510
around it has a small seal in there so that
looks like its definitely water-resistant

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.939
as well. And that’s where the laser actually
comes out. And like I said it was really bright.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.519
In addition it also comes with 2 of these
little adapters. I believe that’s Australia.

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.019
If you need this then you’ll know what it
probably looks like. I’m pretty sure that’s

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.959
Australia and I’m almost absolutely sure
that that’s Europe. So basically you can

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.650
adjust it down to whether you’re in Europe
or you’re in Australia. I don’t know exactly

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.570
why those 2 were included specifically. Wow.
That’s pretty wobbly. Oh, maybe you have

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.520
to…ok there we go. We double up there. So
we have Australia, Europe, and United States.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.750
They’re actually the entire North American
continent Canada, Mexico, US it should work

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.730
all there.
It looks like you can have an input between

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.680
100 volts to 240 volts so that should cover
quite a few countries. 50 or 60 hertz so it

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.500
definitely will work in multiple countries
especially if you get your proper adapter.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.480
Now we’re going to go over the instruction
manual. It’s pretty simple. It just tells

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.030
you what to do, what not to do. It specifically
tells you not to stare into the LED which

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.380
I probably should have not done. One of the
things that bothers me is that it actually

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.800
has an optional remote control that I did
not purchase. And of course when you’re

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.120
buying things you’re like I don’t need
a remote control. I’m just going to put

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.180
it outside but once I saw how really awesome
it was I regret not finding the remote control.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.820
I don’t even know where to buy the remote
control to be perfectly honest. But I’m

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.250
pretty sure in the future my wife is going
to make me buy it just because this thing

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.980
is so cool. It does…one of the things that
do worry me about this is it says works 6

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.440
hours, needed to cool 30 minutes. I’m not
going to go outside and unplug it after 6

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.400
hours. I was just going to set it to a night
switch which is not included. I might add

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.350
once you plug it in its on so you have to
manually turn it on and off or hook it up

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:49.250
to a timer or something like that. My original
plan was to just hook it up to a light sensor

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.970
that turns off at night. You know for my outdoor
garden and it’s unfortunate that it says

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.940
that. I don’t know how set in stone that
is. I don’t if it will light on fire or

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.370
anything. I ran it for a good 4 hours and
this didn’t get too warm. But this got a

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.330
little bit warm. Not enough to make me worry
but saying it only needs to run 6 hours at

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.270
a time does kind of make me worry. I may just
go ahead and buy a timer instead of a night

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.690
switch. But other than that this product was
awesome. I was blown away with how bright

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:26.570
it was. Just the overall depth of the lights.
It has only red and green so not only would

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.730
this be great for a garden, this would also
be awesome for Christmas. If you use this

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.800
for Christmas you might win a couple of Clark
Griswold awards. It’s really that bright

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.880
and that awesome. So I definitely give a thumbs
up to this product. It’s well made. It’s

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.320
extremely bright. It’s extremely neat idea.
So aside from not buying the remote control

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.790
which is kind of my own fault I definitely
recommend this product.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.400
I hope you enjoyed my product review today.
