Welcome to the Gracie and Mommy Show. Hey
everybody, welcome to the Gracie and Mommy

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:18.960
Show. Okay. Today we are opening... a unicorn.
Pony Surprise, Toys R Us exclusive, Unicorn

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:27.060
Pony Surprise. Now there are - there are three.
There is Jazzy, Midnight, and Starburst. Midnight

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.460
is a pegasus. Yes. And we have Starburst,
yes. Midnight is a pegasus - Moonlight is

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.490
a pegasus, Jazzy is a horse, and Starburst
is a unicorn. Yes. Her babies don't have horns.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:54.130
Her babies don't have horns? How can that
be? I don't know. So okay - you must pause

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.250
the video right now - no I got it right here.
I got it. You must pause the video right now

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:10.909
and guess, how many babies will Starburst
have. Go ahead. Do it. Do it now. You can

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.349
do it. I believe in you.

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:23.780
Getting her out of the package. Have you guessed?
Be free! Freedom! So here she is. You gonna

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.010
feel her, see what you think. She feels pretty
full. Okay. She thinks there's 4. It feels

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:38.000
like 4. I haven't squeezed, so I'm just gonna
guess 3. Now let's see if there's anything

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.380
else - do any of these make noise? Because
I know some of the new Puppy Surprise and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.480
Kitty Surprise some of the babies make noise,
but these don't. So find out how many babies

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.540
- so she's actually a really cute - she's
cuter - I wasn't liking the horse faces, and

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.119
we saw - cause we - Mike and Holly and Jay
Squared opened one down at BronyCon, which

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.379
seemed appropriate, and I wasn't really digging
the horse face, but I like the colors on this

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:17.569
one. So yeah, let me get you guys a close
up. Her fur has tinsel in it. Okay let's give

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.599
birth. Alright, ready, here we go. Now let's
turn her towards the camera, so that they

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:30.819
can help us count. Are you ready? Oh... babies.
Babies. One baby baby. What is all over - oh

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:40.319
that's his tail. Oh. Any horns? No, it's just
a normal horse. Wait, let me see. With a strange

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.819
tail, and it's a girl, okay. Here we go. Got
another girl. Two horsie horsies. Their tails

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:56.270
are really yucky. Ew. What is that? Is that
supposed to be her tail? And we got another

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:11.100
girl... and that's it. These are hideous!
Sorry guys. Let me give you a close-up. Behold

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.319
the horror - we're sorry we called your babies
ugly. Yeah she's really mad at us right now.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:26.370
It sort of looks like a flattened pancake
with stuffing coming out of it, like that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:35.170
doesn't look like a tail. Wow. And we got
all girls, huh. And then there's this pink

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.599
one, and what's really nasty about this pink
one is you can actually see the sewing on

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.080
her tail, so you see this sort of like gross
beigeness right here, and it's all rough.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.890
I don't know if that's glue, and she has a
purple head, but she looks like a flattened

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.319
pancake. It looks like someone went --

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:05.080
And... Mom, help these poor children. This
one is purple, with a purple head, which makes

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:16.720
sense, and a pink tail which is also nasty.
So that's a disappointment. Very disappointed

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:27.000
in Pony Surprise. We're very disappointed
in you. I mean - I'm sure they're gonna grow

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.870
up to be beautiful, but right now they're
little pancake people. Why do they not have

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.919
horns, do they develop over time? Well that
would hurt, but... I feel so bad, cause she's

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.449
actually cute! Are they like moose? Do their
horns develop over time? I mean she's actually

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:50.530
a cute looking stuffed animal, these are so
- this was really, this one hardly has any

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.020
fur on her tail. I so disappointed! Have any
of you guys got Pony Surprise? I would maybe

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.479
stick with Puppy Surprise and Kitty Surprise,
what do you think? Yeah. Yeah, I think we

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.570
have to recommend that, because these are
not cute. Their babies are cute, these babies

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.500
are not cute. These babies scare me a little.
They're a little creepy. They're a little

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.920
creepy. Gracie, can you tell them - let's
put these back. Gracie, can you tell them

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.960
where to follow us on all the social media
stuff? Put that thing back where it came from

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.210
or so help me. I think they're not done yet.
Where can they follow us on social media?

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.030
Facebook, Instagram, Periscope, and Twitter.
Follow us those places, don't be a hater.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.550
Thank you so much for watching, please comment,
like, subscribe this video, and --I don't

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.449
think they were supposed to be born, I think
they came early. No, I think we should get

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.460
a Kitty or Puppy Surprise next. Those are
cute. Yeah we tried this out, but this is

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:54.080
not working out for us. Kitty Surprise or
Puppy Surprise. Oh they have the Dalmatian.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.000
We have to go to Toys R Us! Bye!
