"Emerson Fast Ballistic Helmet", provided by AirsoftPark

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:11.296
Pretty cool looking helmet, which comes with rails and velcro emplacements

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:19.896
Note it's an "airsoft" helmet, not made for actual protection (against bullets or even hits against concret floor)

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:28.176
This system allows to tight the helmet around the head, which is pretty useful

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:38.536
You can adjust all the pads inside the helmet, in order to make it fit as comfortable as possible

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:48.796
The helmet has been made so you can use communication system like Peltor

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:19.436
Here's how it looks like on me

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:32.436
A rail (included) allows to put accessories, like a flashlight

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:48.596
The helmet comes with instructions explaining precisely how to adjust it
