00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:04.067
The tank isn’t just a gun, an engine, and armor.

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:06.000
It is also the crew.

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:10.967
The crew mastery increases a vehicle’s effectiveness in a battle.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:15.400
On a new tank, the crew mastery is 50%.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.367
You can increase it for credits in Regimental School, or for gold in Tank Academy.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.167
You can earn crew experience in battles — the same amount as battle experience.

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:31.067
This experience can be spent on improving the crew mastery.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:37.167
If this figure is 100%, you can use crew experience to acquire skills.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.133
These can give your vehicles special abilities.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.600
It can aim quicker, maneuver better, or penetrate the enemy more frequently.

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:50.500
There are a lot of skills, and they are all very useful.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:57.467
They are divided into four categories, depending on the vehicles you play to acquire the skill.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:04.933
For example, to acquire “Breakthrough”, you can use only the experience earned on light tanks.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.000
To acquire “Close Combat Master”, go into a battle on heavy tanks.

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:17.233
After a skill’s training is complete, it is valid for vehicles of any class.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:25.867
As an example “Close Combat Master” is valid not only for heavy tanks; use it for medium and light tanks, and even for TDs.

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:28.400
Every skill has 5 levels.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.800
Every level has more of an effect than the previous one.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.033
The last level has five times more of an effect than the first one.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:41.767
To activate the skill, you will need 100% of mastery required to gain a level.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:48.833
So, if you have a level 3 skill, plus a bit more, the effect will be at level 3.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:54.167
If you haven’t reached level 1 yet, the skill will have no effect at all.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.300
To start training a skill, you should select it.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.467
You can train one skill per category at the same time.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.600
If you acquire a certain skill level, this experience cannot be cancelled, or redistributed.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.467
But you can do this easily if you are still in progress.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:20.567
If you do not want to train “Penetration Boost” anymore, you can relocate the experience to other skills within the same category.

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:22.800
But be alert!

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.433
You will need much more experience at higher levels.

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:37.233
Thus, if you transfer the experience for level 4 of “Penetration Boost” to some level 1 skill, it will gain several full levels at once.

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.433
You cannot reverse this.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:44.233
You will be able to relocate only what is left after completing the levels.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.867
You can train skills not only using crew experience, but with free experience as well.

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:55.600
You can earn free experience in battles; this totals 5% of the combat experience.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.967
You can also convert it for gold from elite vehicles.

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:04.467
A vehicle is elite if all modules are unlocked and the next vehicle is researched.

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:08.967
The Premium tanks are elite from the very beginning.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.300
The crew skills were introduced in the 1.5 Update.

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:17.967
All the experience earned before this date has been retroactively stored.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.067
You can now allocate it.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:22.733
Do that for every skill category.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.667
Otherwise, the skills won’t work.

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:30.433
If you see the message as shown here, the process is not completed yet.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.600
If you haven’t played World of Tanks Blitz before Update 1.5 was released, just select the skills you need, and go!

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.167
Good luck in battles!
