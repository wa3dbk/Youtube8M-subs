00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.800
&gt;&gt;Susan Sheep are hearty animals.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.800
They like to eat.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.069
They eat on a regular basis.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.630
They will graze all day long.

&gt;&gt;Susan Upper Dublin Township manager and

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.520
myself have been working together for several
years and he approached me about using farm

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.410
animals for a vegetative management pilot
project back in the spring, and we talked

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.050
about different angles and what we were going
to use and we decided to use the sheep.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.630

&gt;&gt;Susan These are my sheep they live at Sacks

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.700
Family Farm in Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.690
&gt;&gt;Laura The sheep are here to keep the vegetation
under control so we don't have to send mowers

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.690
out.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.989
Mowers have big wheels, so the mower will
compact the basin and that makes it perform

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.329
less efficiently because you can't infiltrate
as easily after you've mowed it a few times.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.440
The sheep on the other hand will have less
impact on that.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.539
They're natural mowers.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.000
[music]
&gt;&gt;Laura I've been looking at the water quality

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.400
effects of putting sheep in a basin, since
nobody has done extensive research on sheep

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.869
in a basin, we don't know anything about water
quality effects of putting them there.

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.170
This basin is meant to capture the storm water
coming off the neighborhoods to keep it from

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.999
rushing into the streams so fast and causing
damage.

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:24.219
So what I came up with was to put a sampler
on the inlet to the basin and on the outlet

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.140
so i sampled the water coming in from the
neighborhoods, it crosses the basin, and goes

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.850
out the outlet, I sample the outlet.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.689
I get a before and after.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.380
[music]
&gt;&gt;Laura If this takes off then I think more

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.540
people will be willing to use sheep.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.479

&gt;&gt;Susan Upper Dublin High School has embraced

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.320
the idea of using sheep as well, and using
them as an educational tool in their high

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320
school.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.310
They have several courtyards and they're currently
three sheep in the courtyard that have been

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.990
there since the beginning of the school year.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.179
[music]
&gt;&gt;Julie This is something that hasn't been

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.799
done very many place so I'm very excited that
we're able to be open minded and give it a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.799
try.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.679

[sheep baa-ing]

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.159
&gt;&gt;Susan The sheep have done exactly what we
thought they were going to do and this is

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.399
just another example of the different ways
that we're partnering and doing research and

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.150
just working with our local communities to
educate them and educate ourselves.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.670
&gt;&gt;Laura I think it's just part of Temple's
continuing commitment to our community.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.790
We do it not only downtown on main campus
but our here in the suburbs.
