Hi, I'm Beth Tweddle I'm a world champion gymnast.
I went to John Moores in Liverpool and I studied

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.389
Sports Science. I was very lucky in the
fact that I got a sports scholarship at John Moores

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.990
and my coach was quite encouraging towards
me going back to university

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.489
so straight after the olympics in 2004
I started there

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:26.079
my coach worked with the university
to ensure that my training schedule fit in

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.209
with my academic schedule.

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:33.370
Make sure you talk to the university, obviously I 
had conversations before I started at the university

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.400
saying that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.910
this is my training schedule I will be
disappearing for weeks here and there

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.900
but they were very understanding
straightaway and they basically wanted

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.810
to help me in every way can. Even if you 
don't go to university a lot of people are

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.870
benefiting from the system. I mean a lot of my
friends have gone into the research side of things

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.770
and obviously they're trying to find
new cures for things or just produce new products

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.600
produce new techniques and on the
sport science side of things there's a biomechanical

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.179
side that's helping myslef I mean we
have a lot of

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:04.910
video analysis so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.090
there is a lot of different aspects whether you
go to university that you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.640
probably don't realise in everyday life that
you are benefiting from. Within the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850
sporting world I think one of the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.840
things that's been most helpful for me is video
analysis I mean I'm in the gym thirty

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.250
hours a week training and sometimes my
coach can keep saying your leg's bent or your arms

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.550
aren't right or this technique's not quite right

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.770
and you can do it a thousand times and not feel it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.500
but as soon as a video's put in front of you, you can
watch it over and over again and

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.660
analyse

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.900
how it needs to be and sometimes that just
triggers it to get the skill. The olympics

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.120
to every athlete is a dream come true we're just
very lucky it only happens

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.400
once-in-a-lifetime for most a people that is
coming to the UK a lot of people have

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.350
said to me 'oh it's all about London, everyone's
going to benefit down there'

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.560
but I don't think that's true

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.940
a lot of the football prelims are being
played in the northwest so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.659
whether you're down there participating, down
there watching or just watching on

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.220
the television the whole of the UK
is going to be involved. I'm really proud

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.729
to be part of Universities Week not only 
did I learn a lot of life skills while I was at

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.750
university but it also helped my gymnastics
career I became my  first world champion

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.080
whilst I was still at university
