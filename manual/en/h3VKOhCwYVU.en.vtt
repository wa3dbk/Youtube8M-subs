Welcome, welcome to my studio today guys.
My name is Lars Robinson, I'm going to be

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.380
demonstrating to you guys how to draw a rose
easily. This is an interesting one because

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.231
a really good friend of mine, a family friend
of ours, have a flower shop, and it's, and

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:21.199
I created a logo for them for their, for that.
And what I basically did is I did a really

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.550
simple, I start with the front here, and you
start with a swirl. And you kind of think

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.090
about Goldilocks, almost like locks. You just
create it simple, a little twist there, and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:42.950
have it go around there. And then from there,
you can have the body of the flower come up,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.000
and then the stem could go up here like that.
So, now take, how to do it simple, you just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.600
take your marker, follow the line, make it
a twist, and let it end right there. Take

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.629
your, take a line and have it going in towards
the center of the rose. See how I'm creating

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:15.490
that center, the lines going in. Once again,
maybe there is another leaf right there. So,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:36.859
the stem, take your red, just pop it in there
real quick, like that. Gives it a little bold,

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:46.789
maybe there's a high light right here.
And it doesn't take much longer to add some

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:54.100
green there, to add a little color. And there's
how draw a rose very simple. Once again, circle,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.490
put your lines toward the center of the flower,
and then maybe create a little bit of a shadow

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.229
right there. And there you've got a simple
rose. Enjoy guys, have a wonderful day.
