00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:05.089
Halloween is coming up, so what better time
to turn off all the lights, sit down in front

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.089
of the computer, and scare the shit out of
yourself with some scary games? I'm Jay Davis,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
and today we're gonna count down the top 5
scary free games.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.730
Now keep in mind, we're rating games based
SOLELY on their "scare factor" and nothing

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.359
else. If the game's not scary, it's not gonna
do well on our countdown.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.420
At Number 5, we have "The House". One big
plus is that this is a Flash game, so you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.670
don't have to install any crap on your computer.
One big minus however is that the game's just

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.300
not THAT scary. It has a few jump-scares,
but nothing great. The object of the game

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.469
is to click on different objects in each room
of a haunted house to discover the mystery

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.829
of just what down there.The problem is- the
mystery just isn't that interesting. But if

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.430
you want a couple of good jolts without the
hassle of installing a game on your computer,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.430
this might be for you. The link to the game
is in the video description below.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.620
At Number 4, on our scary free games countdown,
there's the free playable demo of Afterfall

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.620
Insanity, which is not so much scary as it
is REALLY creepy. This game has great visuals

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.190
and a great soundtrack, especially for an
independent game. One thing that might turn

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.190
some horror game fans off is- well this game
just has a buttload of weapons. If someone

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.280
scares you in the game, you can beat them
to death with a crowbar, or hack their head

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.280
off with an ax, or just give them a good old
fashioned shotgun blast to the face. Afterfall

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.390
Insanity comes off as a cross between the
commercial games Half-Life and Dead Space,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.390
but just not QUITE as good as either one of
those. This playable demo includes the first

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.650
two chapters of the game and contains about
45 minutes of play time. The whopping 1.8GB

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.140
download link for this demo is in the video
description.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.480
At number 3, and now we're getting to the
really good stuff folks- There's "The House

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.750
2", which is the sequel to our number 5 pick
"The House". This game is also Flash-based

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.910
and plays just like the first House game.
BUT this time the scares have been expanded

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.910
bigger than your stomach after a few handfuls
of those Halloween mini-candy bars. mmm mini

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.030
twix ahhhhh

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.420
Anyway, just like The House 1, you'll still
be clicking around on objects in this game

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.820
until your index finger is ready to fall off,
but the jolts and jump scares you'll get in

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.290
return in this sequel actually make it worth
the effort. "But where is it?", you ask. "Where

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.030
can I find this game?" Link in the video description
below.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.830
At number 2 on the scary free games countdown,
we have the game Erie, a free downloadable

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.670
independent game. The object of Erie is to
run around an abandoned nuclear plant collecting

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.670
data, keycards, and bloody cats. Yes- bloody
cats... I have no idea why... but bloody cats.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.370
Anyway, it all sounds simple right? You run
around the place. You collect a few objects-

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.620
Bam- Done. Easy right? Oh wait, did I mention
that THIS thing will be chasing you the whole

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.910
time? Oh yeah, this mutated monster-thingy
is after you like he's a crazed chimpanzee

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.930
and you're wearing banana-flavored underwear.
...And he's hungry. So you better move quick

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.440
or you're a monster snack pack.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.920
And finally at number one on the scary free
games countdown... drumroll please- Wait stop

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.920
the drum roll. We all know what it is- It's
Slender : The Eight Pages, probably THE most

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.250
popular independent free horror game of all
time. Unless you're an 80 year old grandma

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.220
who can't even find the power button on a
computer, you've probably heard SOMETHING

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.340
about this game by now. But just in case you
haven't- the object of Slender is basically

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.690
to run around in the woods trying to collect
8 pages. The pages look kinda like some crap

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.790
a mentally disturbed kid drew just before
they locked him away in the nuthouse. Meanwhile

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.790
Slender Man, who is a ghost... or a monster...
or an 8ft tall Moby look-alike... okay I don't

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.290
know what Slender man is, but he's coming
after you, and if you stare at him too long

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.500
or you get too close, you're one dead mutha-fucka.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.940
And I know some of you are saying- "But I've
played Slender like 1000 times. I'm completely

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.940
sick of that game". Yep, that's you. That's
exactly what you sound like. ...No, I'm just

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.690
kidding, I happen to know that all my viewers
sound absolutely lovely. But back to my point-

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.310
if you're sick of the original Slender game,
there are now no less than 7 NEW Slender maps

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.240
to play through.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.780
You've got Slender man in a Hospice, Slender
man in an elementary school, Slender in a

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.780
mansion, Slender man in the ghetto, slender
man in prison, and finally even Slender in

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.360
a hedge maze. Which just seems to remind me
of something.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.720
Anyway, with all these maps you can be ducking
and dodging Slender Man all Halloween night

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.050
if you want.
The link to the original Slender game, plus

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:06.050
the links to all the new Slender maps are...
guess where... cmon guess... "Up my ass? How

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.090
dare you!" No, all of those download links
are below in the video description.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.260
So that's all for this edition of the top

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.010
