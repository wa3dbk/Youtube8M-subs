00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:27.449
In the mid to late 70’s and early 80’s,
there was no game company more well known

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.789
than Atari.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.340
With classic titles that many people still
love today, the company had it made.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.220
That was of course, until their 2600 became
saturated with low quality games and the market

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.750
crashed.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.480
In the present day, ask some younger kids
about Atari and see what they know.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.980
You might be surprised.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.470
But we aren’t here to talk about that today.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.100
We’re looking back at some of the best Atari
arcade games, re-released on the Game Boy

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.510
Advance in 2002.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.980
This is Atari Anniversary Advance.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.180
Atari Anniversary Advance consists of some
of the most popular Atari arcade games, like

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.940
Asteroids, Tempest, Super Breakout, Missile
Command, Centipede and Battlezones.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.230
These games appear to have virtually no change
in bringing them to the Game Boy Advance,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.660
and that’s a very good thing.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.651
They still very much have that old-school
arcade feel, even though you are playing it

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.390
on a much smaller screen.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.610
Since high scores can also be saved on the
game-pak, it might be fun to lend this out

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.800
to some friends and see who can beat you.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.300
Now, like I said, the games on this are just
like the arcade games, but controlling some

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.310
of them can be a bit of a pain when using
the d-pad.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.110
It just feels a little bit strange, especially
in games like Asteroids where momentum picks

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.909
up, and this is even harder if you’re using
the Game Boy Player for a bigger screen like

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.680
I was, since it gives you a very small delay.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.860
This issue isn’t present on every game,
though.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.280
Tempest, Centipede and BattleZones probably
made the best transition to this control set-up,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.100
while the worst for it by far is Super Breakout.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.750
The game is almost impossible to control with
either the d-pad or the GameCube analog stick,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.920
and it’s really a shame considering how
well liked it is.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.369
Missile Command is actually really well suited
for the GBA controls as well, with different

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:08.149
guns being assigned to the L, R, A and B buttons.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.930
Atari Anniversary Advance doesn’t feature
any type of Pong like past versions of the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.319
game had, but it does have an Atari Trivia
game that will make you feel like you don’t

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.680
know anything about Atari.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.510
I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable
about gaming, but I know a lot more about

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.170
the period from ’85 and up.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.739
Apparently though, people at Atari thought
red plastic wrap would work in a video game.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.900
I guess it did.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.439
I’m kind of surprised that there weren’t
more games put onto this, however.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.680
Yeah, most of the best arcade games are included,
but it would’ve been nice for some old 2600

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.120
games as well with the amount of info the
GBA carts can hold.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.420
Just don’t put that port of Pac-man on it.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.420
Ever.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.629
As this is mostly a game for fans of the originals,
you’ll obviously be pleased with its aesthetics.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.329
Everything has that old, classic feel that
looks awesome, especially on games like Tempest

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.530
and BattleZones.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.819
Sound effects are also excellent, even if
they are slightly primitive.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.019
Firing in Centipede is sure to put a big smile
on your face.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.680
While I can’t recommend this game to anyone
who really doesn’t care for games from this

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.370
time period, as it won’t change their mind,
Atari Anniversary Advance is a fantastic collection

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.969
of arcade titles that is sure to satisfy your
old-school appetite.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:21.150
Just don’t get too upset when your friend
beats your high score.
