00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.149
Just take a minute and look and just see 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.260
how much humanity is here. (PAUSE)

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.780
And get a sense of how many stories have come together 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.609
into this room - into this weekend --

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.560
into this program.  Each of these faces you see 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.089
has so much to say.  So many stories to tell.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:29.170
♫ ♫ ♫

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.180
John Seed's definition just makes me

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.750
tingle...glow inside. Ecopsychology 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.790
means "oikos psūkhē logos" knowing that earth is 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.440
home to the soul.  Knowing that earth

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.870
is home to the soul.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.060
And you can see why that would have so
many ramifications

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.680
in this time when so much of our dominant
culture seems to have forgotten this.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.870
And so our project in ecopsychology is
remembering. Remembering and then applying

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.970
this remembering in a strategic way

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.320
to help people seat back in themselves
in their deep

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.290
yumminess, both in as an individual and
in community.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.990
The ecopsychology program is one
of the programs at Naropa

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.600
that studies and aims to develop human
nature relationships.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.080
That deep enduring sustainable bond

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.880
between humans and the natural world. Our orientation in this program

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.979
includes contemplative education, a
contemplative approach

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.110
as well as a transpersonal approach
to ecopsychology. Both fields, transpersonal

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.710
psychology and ecopsychology 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.500
recognize a deep seamless

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.030
interconnection of all of existence.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.080
With ecpsychology the focus is on
the interconnection

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.280
of humans and the natural world. With
transpersonal psychology 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.070
it's a broader sense

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.920
of interconnection. I think we could even
say that both fields

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.140
recognize non duality or a unity

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.640
at their origin. At their roots.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.720
So I would say that ecopsychology is, by its nature 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.720
an inclusive approach.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.650
It's inclusive of empirical research.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.080
Good hard conceptual thinking and
critical thinking.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.170
A critique of the elements of culture
that have caused or

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.630
gone along with the separation of humans
and nature.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.790
And finally a recognition of the deep

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.160
personal bond that humans have with
their -- 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.460
the natural environment. How to strengthen

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.940
environmental activism, for example, how
to use what we know

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.360
about psychology to be effective, if
people are trying to make change rather than

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.570
appealing to fear or guilt or how can you drive that thing.  That really does not really make me wanna

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.120
change if someone comes to me that way.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.110
But what actually leads people to want
to make change,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.230
♫ ♫ ♫ I've been amazed

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.300
 at how deep the community

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.570
becomes through the online platform.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.940
So the first thing they do is they come
together and we have these

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.800
intense experiential sessions for
almost two weeks together.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.690
Two courses. And they bond. Students all
get to know each other.  They get to know the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.890
program. They get to know us. They get to  know Naropa

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.040
and then by the time they go out online they all know each other and then when the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.120
voices come in

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.200
as written form -- its like oh that's this
person. I'm so glad to know that's what

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.200
they're thinking.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.850
We are working to develop community among the students

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.260
and community with the faculty.  And community with the land.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.770
In our first summer intensives we spend
time outdoors.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.459
By the second summer intensive, students
are doing a week-long wilderness

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.540
immersion course -- essentially a right

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.170
of passage. And these 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.320
students tell us after they graduate are

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.540
some of the most important moments

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.980
in the whole program. Our students are
amazing!

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.090
These are people who recognize that
the world is

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.340
in crisis and they are impassioned to do
something about it.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.190
They want to understand what's going on
and they want to help it be better.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.190
And it's a great privilege to work with
people like that. ♫ ♫
