00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.299
Okay, next up we're going to show some sai
spins on how to spin the sai. Now, spinning

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.059
the sai when you use the weapon in general
it looks like it's a spin anyway, so we'll

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.470
go over a bunch of different ways to spin
the sai. We already went over the one, it's

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.260
just a basic flip out. And it looks like a
spin so we're going to bring those fingers

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.839
over straight out, and back. That's the basic.
Now, we're going to go straight over and back,

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:46.829
now that's a faster one, okay. All fingers
straight over and out and back. Now a more

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.180
advanced way of spinning we've done everything
going inside out, now we're going to go the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.679
opposite way, outside to in. So, we're going
to bring the sai around and back. Okay. All

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:09.920
we do here, remember, we have it tight, we
bring our finger, our pointer finger down,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:18.640
make sure you're gripping with your thumb,
flatten your hand out, so it's loose. Spin,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:37.141
and catch. Using your wrist mostly, and catch.
Okay. Spin and catch. Spin and catch. Spin

00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:49.270
and catch. Spin and catch. All right, this
is a real fast one. So it goes... and that's

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.700
one of the spins. All right, now, another
spin is one that we're going to use just as

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.990
a strike. Now remember, when I said about
holding the sai, and you have it out, you

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.479
don't want your fingers around it, okay. Where
in this spin you defy all of that because

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.439
it's more of just a strike. We're not trying
 - we're not going to - when our fingers are

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:20.600
like this we're not going to try to block.
You're going to block this way. Okay. So we're

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.290
going to have our fingers in the middle, two
on one, two on the other, thumbs around the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.660
edges right there. Just like we're doing a
regular bunch but we have sais in the middle.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:43.879
And we're just going to do a regular spin.
And we're going to go over, turn the wrist

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:54.749
around, and around. And around. Just going
sideways completely straight, both. Just like

00:02:54.749 --> 00:03:08.650
that. So you have them straight, relax. All
right, now I'll show you some of the spins

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:26.609
faster and just put together in a more extreme
manner, okay. And that was just putting some

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.319
of them together to make strikes, spins and
other things.
