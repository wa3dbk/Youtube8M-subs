Hi everyone, I'm Lily Pebbles and in today's
video I'm going to be showing you how to update

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.520
your makeup and nails just in time for Easter
weekend. When I think of Easter, I think of

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.020
really pretty pastel tones, so let's start
with the makeup and I'll show you just a few

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.520
products that can really lift your look. Starting
with the eyes, I'm going to apply a really

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.749
pretty pink base and this is an eyeshadow
from Kiko, it's number 220, I really like

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.140
this eyeshadow because it's pink but it's
got really nice kind of gold tones in it,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
so it really reflects off the light, it looks
very pretty. It's actually quite a wearable

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.840
pink and I just like to kind of blend that
all over the lid and it looks really soft

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.360
and pretty. On top of that eyeshadow, I'm
going to be applying this product from Max

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.080
Factor, it's their Excess Shimmer and I love
these products, it's a cream eyeshadow, they're

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.070
really long-lasting, I'm absolutely in love
with the bronze but this shade is quite different

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.440
for me, this is the shade Pink Opal and I
don't usually go for shades like this but

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.390
after trying it I absolutely love it. I just
dab a small amount on my finger and press

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.150
it onto the lid on top of the Kiko shadow.
It's this gorgeous kind of purpley-pink reflective

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.940
cream and because it is a cream shadow there's
no drop out, you don't get glitter all over

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.190
your face, it's just really pretty and I think
it's an easy way to wear purple and pink and

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.070
I've paired that with just a little bit of
mascara on the top and bottom lashes. Moving

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.490
on let's talk about blusher and I think blusher's
a really easy way to lift your look, add a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.830
bit of light, add a pretty pop of pink. this
blusher's from Max Factor, it's one of their

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.840
new Creme Puffs and this is the shade Lovely
Pink. It's got this pretty kind of swirl look,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.770
so it's really nice, it's like a blusher and
a highlighter all in one. And I just like

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.480
to add a small amount onto my apples of my
cheeks and slightly upwards towards my cheek

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.240
bones, it adds a really nice glow to the face
and again keeping with that sort of pinky

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.440
pastel theme. The final part for makeup is
a pretty pink lip gloss, I think this is a

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.140
really easy way to brighten up your makeup
look, this one is my favourite, it's from

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.040
Tanya Burr and it's Picnic in the Park. These
lip glosses smell amazing, they apply really

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.250
creamy, they don't at all feel sticky and
I think it matches the blush and the slightly

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.590
purpley-pink eyes perfectly. So let's talk
about nails, and don't worry if you're scared

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.030
of nail art because this one's really easy
to do. I love experimenting with my nails

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.810
and wearing really pretty pastel shades so
for this look I'm going to be using a mix

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.310
of Max Factor Glossfinity Nail Polishes and
Soigne, I think that's how you say it. I really

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.070
like the Max Factor Glossfinity nail polishes
because you only need one coat, they're really

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.819
opaque and glossy and it kind of speeds up
the process. So I'm going to start by painting

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.000
each nail a different pastel shade and then
I'm going to apply a second coat to any of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.760
the lighter shades that need it. You can buy
dotting tools off Amazon, they're really affordable

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.480
and I like this one which has a really big
dot on one end and a smaller one on the other.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.980
I like to use a piece of foil to put my nail
polish on because then you can just scrunch

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.520
it up and throw it away when you're done.
Taking a really opaque white nail polish,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.090
I like to take the bigger dot and apply it
just to the side of the nails, I think these

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.110
look really cute, they kind of look like Easter
eggs, it just adds something a little bit

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.830
different to the nail so I do that on all
the nails. Then if you want to take it one

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.380
step further, using the smaller dot on the
other end I like to take alternate colours

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.750
and fill in the white dots with another colour.
The tip would be just to wait for each layer

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.240
to dry before you do each step, it'll be much
easier. So I told you it was easy and once

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.980
you're finished you're left with a really
pretty pastel Easter look that kind of looks

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.590
like Easter eggs, I think it looks really
cute and make sure you completely wait for

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.860
it to dry before you put on a top coat. So
I hope you've found these tips useful and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.940
if you do try out the nail look please send
us some photos on Twitter at Beauty Recommended.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.239
Have a great Easter weekend and I'll see you
guys soon. Bye!
