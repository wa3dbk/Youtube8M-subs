00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.070
let's consider what's going on here for
a minute shall we, 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.149
the boats certainly in the video camera look mostly silhouetted against all these sparkles on 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.000
the water

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.440
which is being caused by the Sun which
is directedly smack in front of us, 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.230
and its ricocheting off the water and
coming back toward us.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.939
in the foreground we've got these little

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.779
dingy things going on they can't get
much more

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.810
sort of straight into the sun than we are here but look at these dingy things,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.429
for a moment

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.760
if you just put the camera so you're looking across the top of these two Jayne, 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.820
when you're looking across the top for
these

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.840
dingys like this there aren't really any shadows are there?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.820
this kinda flat yeah he just got us ago
got yellow we

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.820
yellow we yellowing going on everywhere
Jane just turns around and I will walk round

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.559
behind her

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.800
and we do the same shot going the other way 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.829
now you've got textures haven't you. because now you can see 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.920
there's a shadow, it's going on in here. There's a little one happening here, 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.090
that's running all the way down there are little tiny shadows like that one 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.689
and that one and the same on this one. It's giving the shapes 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.670
of these boats texture which is
completely missing

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.180
when we're looking in the other
direction with the Sun and that is what

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.909
works so well with shooting against the
light. So, 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.040
on around here let's take the picture.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.340
I'm just gonna lower myself down a little bit 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.200
so that I've got these little dingy board things I don't know what they're called

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.700
 in the foreground

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.040
we've got the light on the water, we've got the blue sky we're just gonna squeeze that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.040
shot of

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.500
and that's absolutely splendid.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.799
lovely and the backlight

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.979
the the shooting against the light is
putting that highlight on the water it's

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.990
giving all those textures and shapes 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.540
if we did this in the morning when the
Sun was coming the opposite way 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.439
all those shadows would be missing just like you saw a moment ago.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.850
so let's have a go at taking a picture of a thing

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.020
shall we? we've done landscapes let's go find a thing.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.310
Yeah what a beautiful thing she is too, 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.200
it's lovely mate, it's an old thing just like the wife 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.349
i'll tell her that in a minute thanks for lending it to us. This nice man called Paul

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.500
is going to let us borrow his beautiful beautiful triumph as you know i'm a bit of a biker 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.230
myself, so I love it.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.569
we set out here because although the light isn't directly behind it, the light 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.209
right behind where you are, 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.010
so if you look at where the shadows are going you can see Jayne's shadow but look 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.200
we got shadows here

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.670
which are just sort of coming this way so even though it's not fully back lit

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.050
it's still backlit to an extent and 
because there's a bit of light sort of coming

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.100
this way we do. little sparkles of the
crime and all that kinda stuff

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.470
and she's gonna lovely we have put it
here on purpose

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.239
because I really like the background. We've got the key, we've got you know 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.750
hengerspry head and all that sort of stuff going on over there 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.230
long lens I'm gonna use a long lens cuz
I want to exclude most to this and just so i'm gonna shoot it with a long lens, i'm gonna use a long lens because I wanna 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.440
exclude most of this to keep it fairly tight.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.800
Background, bike and a bit of separation blur, 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.900
but it's light we're thinking about here  really.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.409
We've got beautiful light going on but to shoot this with a long lens

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.159
I've gotta go all the way over there and start shooting from over there, i'll see you in a minute 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.840
Paul.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.800
Thanks mate. Right there are just so many bikes out here at

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.459
the moment it's brilliant. So I've got my lens long at 200 millimeters

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.000
can you hear me alright Jayne over the Harley's, all right I got a nod.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.900
Okay so i'm just gonna go a bit lower and just shoot that bike 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.300
in this fantastic

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.470
evening light, and my using my long lens and a wide aperture 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.439
I can separate it from the background, that mean I can make the background a bit 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.450
blurry.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.200
but what's most important is the majority of the light is behind the bike.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.459
and it brings up all those little sparkles

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.380
and stuff like that.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.870
and it's not like that that have a great
great looking to me that night

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.400
if we got the light, i'll go this side so you've got light on my face

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.230
square onto the side of it, it's not gonna look quite so brilliant

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.310
let's just do it quickly 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.060
and then you can compare the two Paul has kindly said he doesn't mind me moving it, 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.030
I used to have one of these

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.700
but it wasn't anything like as pretty as this one.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.270
this one is a honey let's just turn
around like that

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.650
so we've now got the light straight onto the side 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.080
and I'll just take a shot going the other way

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.650
I'll use the same sort of lens and it'll look nice 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.890
but personally I think I'm gonna prefer
the one

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.750
with the backlight, let's just shoot that one.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.230
yeah if we flick between the two, 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.360
personally I much prefer the earlier
shot.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.100
with the light coming in behind it so
get out there and go and play with it

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.290
something to remember if you're shooting
against the light sometimes your cameras

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.660
light meter may get

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.930
a little bit confused and create a
silhouette might the picture too dark

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.850
to always have a look at the histogram
and increase the exposure a bit if it does

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:24.940
look too dark

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.120
gum watch our exposure films to find
about how to do that

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.260
we need to do is just a little bit more
light in so that the backlit

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.400
thing in person all place that you're
photographing

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.870
has got sufficient light to record
nicely on the sensor

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.900
I hope you enjoy it and I'll catch you later
