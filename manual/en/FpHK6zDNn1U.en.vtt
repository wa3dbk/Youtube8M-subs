Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com.
Next we are going to talk about how to deadhead

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.650
flowers. So it is really not that complicated.
My theory in my garden is if it looks lush

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.870
and beautiful leave it alone and if it looks
dead cut it out. Deadheading is just like

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.660
it sounds. You are just cutting the heads
of the dead flowers out. So right now these

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.150
acidenthera have been blooming but there are
still some blooms on them. The bottom part

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.230
looks tacky so I'll just cut these little
parts that are done blooming out or I can

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.530
pull them right out too. A lot of times if
you leave them they'll go to seed and then

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.040
you can spread the seeds around but with deadheading
you are pretty much cutting them out before

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.850
they go to seed. As soon as they look tacky
you are chopping them out. So I am kind of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.700
just pulling these out that is a good way
to do it. I have got this agapanthus, it's

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.329
done blooming, the color is gone. It is making
seed pods so to deadhead it I am actually

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.700
just going to cut it to the ground and cut
the stem out. These are actually seed pods

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.290
so my rule of thumb is they are not completely
dry but there is still seeds in there so instead

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.220
of throwing them away what I have done is
just cut them out and I'm cutting the greens

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.570
out and I'm just letting those seeds drop
back down by my agapanthus or Lily of the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.820
Nile and a lot of times they will start new
starts that way. The same with my Cala Lilies,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.010
a lot of times towards the end of the blooming
cycle you will get what is called seed pods

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.500
and these actually are pods of bulbs. So I'm
deadheading but I'm actually saving these

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.780
seed pods and so my rule of thumb is I don't
usually hold anything because I am too busy

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.940
to deal with it later so I will turn around
as soon as I deadhead and plant that seed

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.590
pod back in the ground. It might not do anything
for a few years but eventually it will grow.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.930
That is what I've always been so amazed about.
The same with these Cana Lilies. They are

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.660
done blooming but the stem right here looks
tacky so I'm just chopping it to where the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.350
leaf is. The leaf is still helping. So again
I've got all these little seed pods so I could

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.180
just clear those out but again I always give
plants a chance to grow so I am actually cutting

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.871
the seed and I could save them and plant them
next Spring or I could throw them in the ground

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:27.459
now but I kind of just take the seeds and
sprinkle them around and over the years I

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.960
find that I get lost more plants in the future.
So a lot of times when I deadhead too, you

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.470
know this is still blooming but it has just
kind of fallen over and looks a little bit

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.540
tacky so I am actually going to cut it out
and these too. A lot of times just by straightening

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.620
them out a little bit they will look a lot
better and they won't fall over. So it is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.379
not necessarily the blooms that I cut out,
anything that turns brown or looks tacky I

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.879
have been chopping out of my garden and it
just makes it look better. It is like giving

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.430
my garden a haircut and there are all types
of plants that you can deadhead and the same

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.019
thing like this Galtonia is just about done
blooming so I'm just going to chop it out

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.530
and again I can save the seeds, sprinkle the
seeds around or I can throw them out. It really

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.709
doesn't matter, they're going to come back
no matter what I do. When you deadhead you

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.060
don't have to be that strict. I kind of just
go in and cut out the dead plants. I have

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.540
got a little tiny geranium here and I am just
cutting the dead flowers out. So eventually

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.481
as I keep clearing out everything I will find
that it just looks better and I do this maybe

00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:37.170
only once or twice a month and it seems to
make all the difference and it makes it a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.840
lot easier task at the end of the Summer when
everything dies back. So deadheading is something

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.190
that is easy to do. Do it when you think about
it and always compost your extra plants that

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.129
you don't need any more.
