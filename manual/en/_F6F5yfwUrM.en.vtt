00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:03.473
- Hello and welcome to the
Victorian Cosmetic Institute.

00:00:03.473 --> 00:00:05.907
My name is Dr. Gavin Chan
and today I'll do laser

00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:09.263
tattoo removal on Rebecca who
is one of our staff members.

00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:11.275
She has a tattoo on her
foot, on her left foot,

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:13.224
which she'd actually like to have removed.

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:14.890
And today we're going to do that

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.223
with out mid-light C6 laser.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.368
The mid-light laser removes tattoos

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:22.684
by shattering the tattoo pigment.

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:25.272
And it's very specific for tattoo ink.

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:28.511
And therefore it affects the
skin to a minimal extent.

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:31.480
And this allows you to remove your tattoos

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.147
with a minimum amount
of trauma to the skin

00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:36.595
and a very low risk of scarring.

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:39.576
The process actually takes
a number of sessions.

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:42.567
So today, we'll only be
doing one session on Rebecca.

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:45.422
The first step in performing
laser tattoo removal,

00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:48.341
is proper anesthesia for the tattoo.

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.698
Without proper anesthesia
or numbing for the tattoo,

00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:53.484
you're going to have a very,
very painful treatment.

00:00:53.484 --> 00:00:56.430
At the Victorian Cosmetic
Institute, we actually use

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.230
a combination of anesthetic agents.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.888
First, we apply a topical
anesthetic cream to the tattoo.

00:01:03.888 --> 00:01:06.030
This numbs the skin partially.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.661
Secondly, we inject a
local anesthetic solution

00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:14.398
into the tattoo which
actually numbs it completely.

00:01:14.398 --> 00:01:16.453
Then, finally the laser is applied.

00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:19.646
And at that point, you should
feel no discomfort at all.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.447
We're about to inject
Rebecca's tattoo now.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.719
Remember, she's had some
numbing cream on, as well,

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.471
so she shouldn't feel this too much.

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:30.546
Here we go, we'll just
start, a little sting.

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:33.944
And should feel a little bit of a string.

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:34.777
How is that feeling?

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:35.610
- [Rebecca] Can't feel it.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.383
- [Dr. Gavin Chan] Can't feel it? Oh good.

00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:42.230
The other option is that you
can also have some laughing gas

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.730
for this part of the procedure

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:48.963
if you're concerned about
needles or injections.

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:51.803
So, I'm virtually just covering the tattoo

00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:54.033
with local anesthetic.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:56.139
And this will make the procedure

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:58.722
virtually painless for Rebecca.

00:02:05.637 --> 00:02:07.655
Finally, we come to the
actual laser treatment itself.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.147
As you can see I'm
wearing protective goggles

00:02:09.147 --> 00:02:12.257
to protect my eyes from the laser.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:16.674
Now, if you'll focus down here
on the laser on the tattoo,

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:19.352
you can actually see
that it's a black tattoo.

00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:22.981
So, today we're using the
mid-light laser on this tattoo.

00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:27.006
And this laser is specifically
attracted to the black ink.

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:29.285
Different colors will require
different wave lengths.

00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:31.158
At the Victorian Cosmetic Institute,

00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:33.786
we have two lasers with
a total of 3 wavelengths

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.105
to cover all different colors.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:38.114
Now, I'll start, what
will happen is that it'll

00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:42.000
actually turn white and Rebecca
shouldn't feel any of this.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.833
Are you ready?

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.766
- [Rebecca] Yeah.

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:47.516
(laser clicking)

00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:51.644
- [Dr. Gavin Chan] So the tattoo

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:53.335
is actually frosted over here.

00:02:53.335 --> 00:02:55.252
This is only temporary.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:57.547
What will happen is it'll now proceed

00:02:57.547 --> 00:03:00.313
to swell a little bit and go a little red.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:03.225
And over the next week or two, it'll scab.

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:06.229
Rebecca will need to
put on bepanthen cream,

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.687
two to three times a day to
help reduce the scabbing.

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:12.140
And after about a month, she
should notice some recovery,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.808
some lightening in the tattoo.

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:17.297
So, repeat this process
every six to eight weeks.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.440
And usually after 10 to 20 sessions,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.383
we should get a nice
reduction in the color.

00:03:23.383 --> 00:03:27.550
So I'm just going to put
some dressings on the tattoo.

00:03:28.544 --> 00:03:31.157
And we leave the dressing on for 24 hours

00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:34.912
after the tattoo laser has been applied.

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:37.585
And this just helps reduce any injury

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:39.764
and helps the skin to heal.

00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:44.189
After that, Rebecca will apply
bepanthen cream regularly,

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.763
for about a week, until
the scabs falls off.
