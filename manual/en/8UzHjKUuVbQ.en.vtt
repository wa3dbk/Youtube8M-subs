00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:05.405
In the blink of an eye

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.410
Everything can change

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.015
Distracted driving can be just
as dangerous an drunk driving

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:19.419
So...

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.423
Leave the phone alone!

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.427
Distracted driving is
anything that takes:

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.030
Your eyes off the road

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.232
Your hands off the wheel

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.434
Your mind off the task

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.039
(A clock appears on screen
with the hands turning.)

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.243
You may say that it just takes
a second or two, but...

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.644
While you were looking
at your phone 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.647
(A Stop sign appears
on the screen.)

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.051
you drove through a stop sign.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.454
While you were searching
for a different song 

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.657
(An ambulance with its
emergency lights flashing.)

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.060
you held up an ambulance
rushing to the hospital.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.262
While you were
programming the GPS 

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.464
(A cellphone with a
"GPS" app on screen.)

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.666
You didn't see the cyclist.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.069
(A cyclist appears from
behind the cellphone.)

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.271
(A cellphone with a social
media/news app open.)

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:13.473
While you were checking
your newsfeed 

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:15.675
(A TV with the words
 Breaking News .)

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.078
you ended up making
the traffic news.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.281
(A person driving a snail while
texting is holding up traffic.)

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:26.319
In 4 out of 5 collisions,

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.088
the driver looked away 3
seconds prior to the accident.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.494
(A cellphone ringing.)

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:36.696
Because you picked
up that phone call 

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.100
(A faint image of a car that
has been in a collision.)

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.303
someone you care about
will be receiving one.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.506
Distracted Driving can lead to:

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:48.308
Fines and demerit points

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:50.110

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.513
Jail time,

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.315
Injury,

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.117
Death

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.522
Here s what you can do:

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:05.325
Ignore your devices.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.128
Or, pull over safely.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.730
Collisions can happen
in the blink of an eye.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.534
The impact is forever.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.146
Sign the pledge.
