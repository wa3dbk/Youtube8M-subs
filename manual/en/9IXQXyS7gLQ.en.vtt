00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.980
[Kris] Man, they are cool.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.980
They are really cool.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.980
They look prehistoric.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.220
[Dan] Seven foot tail can give a pretty good
whack.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.220
((laugh))

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.080
[Kris] But the cool thing about it is they
really are a pretty docile creature.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.490
[Dan] Obviously you have to watch for the
teeth.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.190
[Kris] You won’t see them outwardly snapping
at you trying to get at you with the teeth,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.050
they are just thrashing around, just like
any fish if you put them on the bottom of

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.580
a boat outside of water, they just simply
want to get back in the water…but never

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.580
bite or anything like that.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.980
Historically, alligator gar have been considered
both by anglers and by managers as essentially

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.980
a trash fish.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.230
No one really cared about them, no one really
fished for them.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.410
So the managers didn’t really spend time
collecting data either.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.040
[Narration]
But things have changed.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.220
And this large, long-lived species has caught
the angler’s eye.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.770
[Dan] The increase in popularity obviously
is putting greater pressure on our populations.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.500
Texas is home to the best populations of alligator
gar left in the United States and we want

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.500
to keep them that way.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.650
[Narration]
Thanks to funding from the Wildlife and Sport

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.390
Fish Restoration programs, biologists are
now collecting data and tagging alligator

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.140
gar so they can track them from year to year.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.180
[Dan] We know that alligator gar can live
longer than 50 years.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.610
They can get huge.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.250
[Narration]
Alligator gar are the largest of the four

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.310
species of gar in Texas.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.450
There’s the Spotted gar, Longnose gar and
Shortnose gar as well.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.860
Documentation shows that Alligator gar have
weighed over 300 pounds and are popular fish

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.810
for anglers.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.259
While anglers can keep one alligator gar per
day, catch and release is preferred.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.580
[Angler] Off he goes.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.000
So we are trying to collect as much information
as we can to try to protect, conserve, manage.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.720
To ensure the resource is available today,
tomorrow, and a hundred years from now.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.400
[Narration]
Biologists have reason to care.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.680
A similar large species, the Lake Sturgeon
in the Great Lakes, was commercially overfished

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.740
to one-percent of its historic abundance in
the early 1900s.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.340
They’re vulnerable because like gar, it
takes them years to reach reproductive maturity.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.840
[Dan] It takes a very long time for a species
with this type of life history to make a comeback

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.590
when the populations become depleted.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.540
We don’t want to get in a situation where
we have to react to over harvest.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.970
[Kris] I’ve fished a lot and I’ve never
fished for alligator gar but, I tell you what,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.570
after working with them, I would definitely
fish for alligator gar and I recommend anyone

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.570
to do that.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.570
It’s a tremendous angling opportunity for
folks to explore.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.560
[Narration]
For Texas Parks and Wildlife, this is Abe

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.720
