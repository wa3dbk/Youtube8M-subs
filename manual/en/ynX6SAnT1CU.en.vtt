00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.880
Hello everyone today I will present you

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.520
some of  the basic and most important things you need
in need in order to begin quilling

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.000
The first one is the quilling tool. Depending where you live you may have access to a store where you can buy

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.000
a nice quilling tool as this one or if you don´t you may create one for yourself

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.500
There are many ways of doing it and I will show you a few of them

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.430
For the first one you need a needle and a dowel

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.900
Or you can use a pencil or simply a piece of wood

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.570
You just break the upper part of the needle and then insert it in the dowel

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.220
I used myself this type of tool for several months before buying my nice quilling tool

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.380
For the second one you need a dowel or a piece of wood and with a cutter

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.000
just give it the quilling tool shape

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.239
For the third one you need a pen from which you remove

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.000
the lower cap and then have to remove the ink cartridge

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.879
and insert a toothpick previously sharpened and slotted in its place

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.660
For the third one you a mechanical pencil that has a plastic tip which

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.140
you can cut and transform in a quilling tool

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.170
The second thing you need is paper

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.000
Each quiller has their own idea about what type of paper is better for their quilling

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.970
And I think there is no best paper for quilling in general because it

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.840
depends of the person's preference, the paper´s availability in the place where the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.209
person lives, the price and the type of work one does

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.319
Therefore I will present you some different options you may have

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.670
The first one is to buy the already precut quilling paper

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.860
This paper comes in different colors and
sizes

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.310
and the advantage is that you don't have to spend time in cutting it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.000
You just have to use it in your quilling projects

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.599
This paper in my opinion has more disadvantages than advantages

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.509
and one is that it is usually more
expensive than if you buy and cut your own paper

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.000
and the second is that it is very thin and in my opinion it does not loos as nice as the thicker paper

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.479
The third disadvantage is that it limits you in terms of color

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.610
For example if I want to use different shades of a color

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.750
it may be more difficult because the
quilling paper is not as popular

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.820
and it does not come in hundreds of colors as the uncut paper comes

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.500
And the last disadvantage is that its cut size limits you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.540
if you want to use the same color for the background of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.000
a card or a frame or if you want to make a rose 
from a wider strip as I did for this flower

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.120
The second type of paper is the craft paper that comes as I said in a multitude of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.980
colors and shades, sizes, thickness and textures

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.500
The most important aspect you have to consider when you want to buy your

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.000
quilling paper is its thickness

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
In most countries the paper is differentiated by thickness and weight

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The normal copy paper for example has 80 grams/square meter

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.489
The paper you use in quilling should have between 120 and 180 grams

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.790
the one the one of 160 grams
being the best one in my opinion

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.360
The paper that has between 200 and 300 grams

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.580
is not good for quilling because it´s too thick

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.000
and not flexible but you can use it as a background for your cards or frames

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.280
In order to cut the paper you
have also different possibilities

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.000
The first one is to mark the paper with
a pencil using a ruler and cut it with a cutter

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.530
The disadvantage with this is that it takes a long time

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.269
It took me for example 8 minutes to measure and cut 30 strips of paper

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.340
Also if you choose this method you need to buy
a good quality cutter and a metallic ruler

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.000
instead of a wooden or plastic one

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.400
that may be damaged in the process
of cutting

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.540
The second one is to use a self healing mat
that already has measuring grids

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.000
The disadvantage with it is that the mat is usually expensive and many times does not actually self heal

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.000
If you don't have a self healing mat, you can use a
printed guideline

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.540
that you may glue on a cutting pad as I did for  this one

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.980
The fourth possibility is to use a manual paper shredder

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.410
The advantage is that you can cut a whole sheet of paper at once

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.000
and it only took me 12 seconds to
cut 30 strips of paper with my shredder

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.940
And this is because mine is
small, but if you buy a bigger one you can cut around

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.030
60 strips of paper in less than 15 second

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.340
The disadvantage with it is that the cutting is not so smooth

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.370
and it does not look as nice as the one cut with a cutter

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.060
If you decide to use this method please be aware that there are different brands of manual paper shredders

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.000
and some do a really ugly job and the cut has a jagged look

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I think I am pretty satisfied with mine but I have to admit that the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.500
hand cut paper looks more elegant so I will try to use it more

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.000
Here I have some teardrops made out of the different types of paper I talked about earlier

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
All these paper strips have the same length and I also used the same size in my circle sizer

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
For the first one I used the precut quilling strip and as you can see it´s pretty thin

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.500
For the second one I used 160 grams paper cut with the shredder

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.600
And for this one I used the same
paper cut manually with the cutter

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.000
You can see the difference between the two

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.900
For the last one I used 300 grams paper

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and in my opinion for the same shape and size the one manually cut with a cutter looks the best

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.000
Some of you asked me about the way I store my paper. I usually cut my paper only when I need it

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.880
but I always have leftovers that I store in a drawer or a box

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.400
I just use a small piece of a different color strip

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.000
and make like a small ring around them that will keep them from not mixing with the other colors

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.220
The third important thing
you need for quilling is glue

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.660
The glue comes also in many different
types and some types work better for

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.800
specific jobs

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.760
I know most quillers use the usual white school glue

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.840
and when I began quilling I bought a bottle that was thick

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.530
and would not dry transparent. I did not like it at all and I

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.740
decided to try a transparent glue that I really liked because it would dry faster and of course transparent

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.690
There is no best brand of glue to recommend. As I lived in different countries

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.880
I always found a good one to use

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.740
The disadvantage with the transparent glue
is that is thicker than the white one

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.000
and is not good to use for certain jobs
like for the drawing type

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I tried several types of them and the glue would leave a transparent but shiny mark in my drawing

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
which I did not like and that´s why I decided to try again the typical white glue

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.500
The thinner one that dries transparent of course and I was really pleased of the results

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.280
Another advantage of this one is that you can
also use it as a sealant for your

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.190
jewelry or other quilling objects

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.000
that hardens and makes it waterproof

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Of course there are special types of quilling sealant though

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.590
but I have no experience with them
and I cannot recommend them

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:53.250
In choosing you glue, my advice is to try both types and see which one you prefer better

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.460
The fourth one of the very important  tools are the scizzors

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.910
You can use any type you have in your home but if you want to buy them, buy the

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.050
ones that have the blades thinner

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.050
and the points sharper because they are better for

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.699
some quilling techniques like for example the fringing  I used for

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:11.000
creating this flower

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The last very important tool in quilling is the circle sizer

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.940
You need it if you want to have the same size for your shapes

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.800
If you measure them in your hand, the probability is for the sizes to be unequal

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.000
and the flower or leaf you create to look uneven

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.199
I really hope this video was useful to you. If you still have questions
