Walking Moon

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.389
Hi, I'm the lunar lady

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.080
And this is walking moon demo

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.670
Demonstrating moon phases from latitude40arts

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.389
Visually based education

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.769
We're going to demonstrate all of the major
phases of the moon

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.460
And first let's consider that the moon out
in space

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.900
Is always half in shadow and half in light

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.630
Just Like the earth is

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.750
Our first phase is new moon

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.800
This takes place when the moon is directly
in between the sun

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.960
Which has set behind me

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.070
And the earth, that's you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.290
Now when the moon moves out of that direct
alignment

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.050
You'll begin to see a small crescent

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.910
Which as the couple of days go by

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.860
Becomes a larger crescent

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.460
And then when about one week has passed

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.520
We've got the first quarter moon

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.640
As the moon continues on

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.590
We have the waxing gibbous phase

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.640
And one week after first quarter moon we have
the full moon

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.179
Rising in the east as the sun is setting in
the west

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.539
Now we've got waning gibbous phase

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.429
One week after the full moon we've got third
quarter moon

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.939
Also called last quarter moon

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.750
The moon then moves into its waning crescent
phase

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.600
Crescent gets smaller

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.850
And we're back to the new moon

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.170
And the word for moon and month both have
the same origin

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.569
It's just taken one month to complete the
entire lunation.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.719
