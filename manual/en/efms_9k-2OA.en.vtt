00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:09.205
Today I will show you how to simulate an asteroid impact in your kitchen.

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:18.006
For todays experiment you will need a deep plate filled with water

00:00:18.013 --> 00:00:20.801
and a little mabel or a small stone

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:26.167
that is almost coverred by the water when it inside of the plate.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:29.370
Then you need a small compact camera or a DSLR

00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:34.459
to record your self taking this little mabel and dropping it into the water.

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:35.369
Like this.

00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:41.656
And I would recommend to use a fast lens, like this 1.8G 50mm NIKKOR lens.

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:44.482
And also maybe you want to put a filter on here

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.376
to protect it from water

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.867
spilling around. So I put on a filter like this.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:53.956
Then we need a lot of light to have a small shutter speed.

00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:55.498
So we have one light here

00:00:55.493 --> 00:01:00.333
and also one light over there that will be going onto this tripod.

00:01:00.354 --> 00:01:03.602
So you take your camera and mount it onto the tripod

00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:06.857
focus onto the meteoroid, the small marble.

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:09.458
And then drop it into the water.

00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:14.064
I would recommend a drop height from around

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:16.603
one meter, it should be something like this.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.899
So you do this maybe like 30 times

00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:23.932
and make sure that the water is not dropping from the mabel like here.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.851
Wait till the water is cam.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.707
And then just let it fall into the water.

00:01:28.702 --> 00:01:32.544
And then take a look on the computer what you got.

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.054
Now we have imported our footage from the SD card

00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:39.172
and we can open it for example in iMovie.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.828
But this will also work the same way probably in Windows MovieMaker.

00:01:43.823 --> 00:01:48.479
In iMovie we have a new project and we need to import our footage.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:51.207
We go on import movies

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:54.473
and we select one of those in here.

00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:57.599
Click on Import, and this will take some minutes.

00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:03.209
Now it is done processing and we have here our footage.

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:05.204
We can now scrub trough the footage

00:02:05.212 --> 00:02:08.223
and an find an interesting spot.

00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:09.987
For example this one.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.464
And if we now use our arrow keys

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.032
we can go trough this footage frame by frame.

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.787
So we press to the right

00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:23.916
And we take a look what happens when the mabel drops into the water.

00:02:23.924 --> 00:02:27.248
So lets say we have decided for maybe

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:31.198
This impact here. We select it

00:02:31.206 --> 00:02:35.470
and then we drag it into the actual movie area

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:38.730
and here it's saying something about frame rates, we

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.903
don't want to change those.

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:44.216
And now we can go on clip

00:02:44.224 --> 00:02:48.763
Slow Motion and set this for example to 10%.

00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:50.758
And if we play it back now.

00:02:56.637 --> 00:02:58.637
You get a slow motion clip.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.591
Now you can do some editing and export your video

00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:04.586
and upload it maybe to YouTube

00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:06.886
as a video response to this one.

00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:11.145
I'm looking forward to see all of your home made meteoroid impacts.

00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:15.947
All right now it's time to analyse the data and discuss the results we will find.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:24.452
Let's take a look at the impact frame by frame.

00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:27.582
We see here how our meteoroid is coming from the top

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.159
and is hitting the water.

00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:33.857
The water is already repelled to the side as you can see by the shadow.

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:36.595
We would benefit from some additional frames here,

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.713
but unfortunately I could only record this in 30 frames per second.

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.888
However you can see here that the impact crater

00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:46.921
is a lot bigger than the actual asteroid.

00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:50.405
Also we can see how very find droplets of water

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:52.843
get ejected from the impact side.

00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:57.063
In the next frame we see how the impact matter gets ejected further out.

00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.880
On the left we see an secondary impact

00:03:59.888 --> 00:04:02.448
caused by material of the impact side.

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:05.940
We can see here how the impact wave is going further out

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:08.556
but is also going back together on the spot

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:10.271
where the meteoroid hit.

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.547
Now we have some tourbulences

00:04:12.555 --> 00:04:14.951
and that was our impact.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.170
Of cause it should be mentioned that the meteoroid would not remain intact like the mabel here

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:22.694
and would chatter into a lot of pieces.

00:04:22.702 --> 00:04:26.358
Also the actual impact might look a little bit different

00:04:26.378 --> 00:04:30.231
because we are using water here and it's a very small scale.

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:33.649
But I think this experiment can really give you an idea

00:04:33.644 --> 00:04:37.004
what an actual impact might look like.

00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:39.024
Let's enjoi some other impacts 

00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:58.953
We can also watch this impact from the top.

00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:04.099
this again shows how big the impact crater is compared to the actual meteorite

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.076
and you also see again very nice secondary impacts

00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:11.707
that are caused by matter thrown into the air by the main impact.

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:17.201
We can now compare our results with the craters we find on the earth

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:19.247
or for example also on the moon.

00:05:19.255 --> 00:05:24.119
The moon is here an easy example because the craters have not changed that much

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:25.759
like they did on the earth.

00:05:25.767 --> 00:05:29.604
If we take now a look at the moon,w e see there are a lot of craters.

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.209
And the craters have very special features.

00:05:32.204 --> 00:05:37.233
We can see some secondary impacts, that we also saw in our experiment.

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:40.843
And also we see there is a little peak in the middle

00:05:40.838 --> 00:05:44.981
and this is because the matter is bouncing back a little bit.

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:48.160
So it gets pushed to the side when the meteor hits

00:05:48.168 --> 00:05:52.088
but then the earth is a little bit bouncy, so it gets pulled up in the middle.

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:55.215
like with the water in our experiment.

00:05:55.223 --> 00:06:00.123
So I hope you enjoyed this video and you created your own little craters in your kitchen.

00:06:00.118 --> 00:06:03.276
And if you want to learn more about this topic, you can take a look

00:06:03.271 --> 00:06:06.196
in the book 21t century astronomy

00:06:06.204 --> 00:06:09.770
and I will put the exact reference in the description below.

00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:12.717
As always thank you for watching.

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:13.632
Bye Bye!
