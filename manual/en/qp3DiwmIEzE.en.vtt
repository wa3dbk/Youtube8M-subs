JOHN VANDEBROOKE: My name is John Vandebrooke
and on behalf of Expert Village, I want you

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.620
to take a look at beginning encaustic painting.
All right, when you want to start working

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.380
with the stylus, there's a loose screw at
the point here that you change the points

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.170
by loosening the screw. Just turn that screw
a half a turn and that will loosen the point

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.230
and you can then put another point in. If
you loosen it too much, it's going to fall

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.070
out. That screw is going to be hot and you're
going to heck a darn time to get that hot

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.030
screw back in there again. So, just turn it
a half a turn. We have different points to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.360
work with. We have this triangle-shaped piece,
this round piece, the little pen point like

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.399
this. Here is a very small mini iron shape
like that, which I thought I find this the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.969
most useful one right there, and a wire brush.
Now, the wire brush you can't really use like

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.399
a paint brush unless you want to just cause
yourself all kinds of grief because the little

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:08.060
wire bristles here will twist all up and then
you have to take a sharp tool and straighten

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.080
out each piece of wire. So, the way I use
this is mostly to drag it through wax in a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.400
dragging motion and create sort of a feathery
effect with it. It's just less trouble using

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.270
it that way, but let's take this pen point,
for instance. This lets you do all kinds of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.020
very detailed little lines like this. And
so, let's say I want to little bit later talk

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.700
about working with rubber stamps. This lets
you do very detailed designs with the point.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.830
For instance, you can just touch that to the
wax block and the wax sucks up inside that

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.990
little pen point like an old quill pen, holds
the melted wax right between the two nibs

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.750
like that. And you could touch it to the card
and let's say we just do a little bird right

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.729
here. See, we can just put a little bird up
here. Touch the wax, make a little point,

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.240
pull a wax up like that. So you can put little
details in your painting like that. If you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:16.730
wanted to take this nub and start to work
with a painting and say--let's say we just,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.400
you know, put in a tree here. Now, we could
come up and just start making images with

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.590
this point, very nice for making flowers,
trees. It also makes a wonderful cactus very

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.569
simply just by touching to the green and pulling
straight down, you can make a nice little

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.090
cactus. And then you would come back with
this point and do all the little detail thorns

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.069
that come off the cactus with that point.
But exploring the different tips is really

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.879
fun especially here's this little round image
that can just be set down like that on top

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.560
of your card, lift it up and you'll have a
little moon or sun in your picture.
