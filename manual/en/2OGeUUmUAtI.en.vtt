00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.780
During the early 90s, Sega was the only company to truly challenge Nintendo

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.300
For control of the video game market.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.320
The genesis was the system responsible.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.420
Introduced to North America in 1989,  it deeply cut into Nintendo's market share until it was

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.740
discontinued in 1997.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.480
Now everyone is probably familiar with these two variations of the Sega Genesis.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.100
The model one was the original. It was big and had funky stuff on it.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.360
"High Definition Graphics"? A headphone jack... with volume control?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.320
Any who.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.380
In 1993 Sega released the Genesis Model Two

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.580
It was lighter, had stereo sound, and is the most common version of the system.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.580
But in 1998, stores started selling this:

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.740
The Genesis 3? What?

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:14.640
The Genesis 3, Model Number MK-1461, was released by Majesco under license from Sega

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.620
It shipped with a six-button controller and retailed for about $50.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.340
Now who exactly is Majesco? Well they're a video game publisher. Still around today actually.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.860
But back in the 90s, their main focus was re-releasing games.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.100
Supposedly, the company would buy a surplus of games from the publisher,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.000
repackage them, print off a label, and sell it, all with permission from the original publisher of course.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.060
Some notable Majesco re-releases include Castlevania IV, Sonic 3D Blast, and World of Illusion.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.700
One dead giveaway for a Majesco re-release is the packaging.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.140
They were always sold in a paper box, and the manual is in black &amp; white.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.760
It should also say "Assembled in Mexico" somewhere on the box.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.520
Chances are if you buy retro games, you probably have at least one Majesco re-release.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.820
Majesco is also responsible for the re-release of the Sega Game Gear in 2000.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.400
So back to the Genesis 3. Let's go over the system itself.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.720
First of all, it's tiny and weighs practically nothing.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.060
Maybe even too light. Seriously, if you jerk your controller around at all, this thing might come

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.760
flying off the shelf.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.160
The system also lacks an LED light, which is similar to two other redesigns I've already talked about.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.440
However, Majesco was nice enough to a bright orange color under the switch,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.260
letting you know when the system is turned on.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.460
The cartridge slot is also different. It's been modified so you can fit

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.000
Japanese Mega Drive games into the system.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.420
As long as the game doesn't have region lockout, it'll play.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.240
No modifications or converters required.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.840
The system contains one composite out plug and a power plug.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.960
And the same cables you use on the Genesis 2 will work here as well.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.140
The Genesis 3 also had some internal fixes.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.560
In previous models, the Genesis had a bug in the memory controller of the system.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.840
This was fixed on the model 3.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.160
However some games actually utilized the bug, such as Gargoyles, which means those games do not work on the Genesis 3.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.320
Now to go over some missing pieces.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.000
The Genesis 3 lacks an expansion port, so the Sega CD is imcompatible.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.480
It also doesn't work with the Sega 32X, Power Base Converter, or Galoob's Game Genie.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.860
Any game that utilized an extra processor also won't work, such as Virtua Racing.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.780
Overall, the Sega Genesis 3 is a nice version of the 16-bit console

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.840
Especially for import gamers, or those wanting to save on some shelf space.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.960
However, some games simply don't work on the system, and any hardware add-ons

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.340
Forget about it. This thing is simply just a Genesis

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.860
Today they're worth about 30 to 40 dollars, however they are somewhat hard to find.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.240
Majesco only sold the system for about a year.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.880
By the end of the year they were selling them as $19.99.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.280
Wow.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.040
So should you pick up a Genesis 3? Well, hopefully this video will help in your decision making.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.580
That's all for this episode of the Gaming Historian. Thanks for watching!
