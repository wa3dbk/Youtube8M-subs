00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.470
This is the Janome Memory Craft Horizon 12000.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.020
It is an embroidery machine, sewing machine and quilting machine.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.880
It has an extra large throat space 11 inches

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.300
Extra lighting in the large throat space so you've got lighting everywhere.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.840
 And a little bonus light that you pull out,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.460
and it shines a light right down onto your sewing area. 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.500
Wonderful! We can never get to much light for our sewing.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.520
It has a built in needle threader. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.060
Presser foot can lift up and down here. 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.180
Or, you can lift it up and down at the back as well, 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.320
So, you've got an option.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.660
You've got a needle up and needle down position.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.780
A lock stitch, it means it ties a knot rather then doing a reverse,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.260
but you can do a reverse

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.340
and of course you can do a start and stop right here, 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.140
so that you don't have to have your foot control.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.380
Speed control is right here so that you can slow it down

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.100
if you are doing something more delicate or speed it up

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.960
and of course you've got an open arm by pulling your, your bed off. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.780
Inside here is a little storage compartment you can store your feet 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.869
as well as storage compartment in the top lid. 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.900
As you can see it has about 200 built in stitches which

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.530
are a lot, you got quilt stitches, heirloom stitches 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.370
decorative stitches a small little alphabet built in here 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.340
but there's also an embroidery function to this machine 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.580
and with the embroidery function you can do very large embroidery designs

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.160
They're hooped, and you put your fabric in the hoop and you select your embroidery 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.180
design and the machine takes over. 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.680
It has quilting designs in there that are to die for! 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.000
If you want an immaculate quilted, quilt that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.380
looks very professionally done this machine has professional

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.250
and quilting designs built into the machine and if the 100 some odd

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.830
embroidery designs are not enough for you, you can

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.190
access the computer directly through a link and 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.350
you get a Horizon Link program for your computer with this machine 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.940
that allows you to transfer designs uh to your, from your computer 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.190
to your sewing machine in what they call real time which means 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.379
there's no wait time you press the send on your computer

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.920
and instantly, your design is in your screen. So it saves time

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.920
that way it saves thread by having the thread cutter on there so you got a very 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.269

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:49.169
