00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.779
Hey, I cannot believe it.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.640
It's day 150.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.770
We have a finished house.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.690
Okay, we went over budget.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.190
I know.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.270
But only by about 9 percent.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.110
But the results, I'm really happy with.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.890
Come on, let me show you.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.480
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.580
I'm Allen Smith, join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.899
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.050
Ta-da, guest bedroom.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.769
Don't you love it?

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.489
One of the things that we had to do here was
to conform to the roof line.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.699
So that's why we have these angles here and
a much broader angle on the other side.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.329
But hey, it adds to the charm.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.670
And then there's the hall: The track lightening,
hey, it's great.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.600
And look at these floors -- I'm loving them.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.400
You loving the beadboard or what?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.210
These sheets of beadboard, I think, look very
convincing.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.409
I love this soft green color.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.770
And, you know, our mini splits really don't
stand out that much, so I'm feeling better

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.120
and better about these as a source of cooling
the house down in the summer and warming it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.420
in the winter.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.160
Here in the guest bathroom, well, we did some
things to save money.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.810
We used the butcher block -- we had a little
bit left over from downstairs in the kitchen.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.759
One of the other things that we did here to
make it feel like it's a much broader hall:

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.619
When this door is open, we have a mirror here
-- it also serves as a vanity.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.670
And on this side, well, we conformed to the
roof line to create both the shower and a

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.520
tub space using subway tile.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.440
Come on downstairs, you're gonna love it.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.570
I just love how solid these stairs feel.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.570
It's good.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.950
It's a good stair hall here.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.200
So here in the master bedroom, we did a few
interesting things, I think, that gives it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.880
a lot of charm in the way of, well, the barn
tin -- we decided to paint it.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.010
I like that choice.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.360
And I love the fact that we went with the
pine plank boards, running them horizontally.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.290
Come on in the master bathroom.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.510
Just take a look at this: I'm crazy about
the way the vanity turned out.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.370
You know, we used those finials for fenceposts
for legs on this to really raise it up, give

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.370
it a little pop.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.590
You know, we're all about farmhouse chic.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.250
And then take a look here at the shower: I'm
loving this floor.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.090
Pebbles, it's perfect.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.500
So if you're loving these, come on in to the
main living space of the house.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.980
You're gonna really like it.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.030
This space turned out so well.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.150
From the beams that we created up here, to
the burlap we stretched across the walls,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.230
and then the paneling along the sides.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.150
The wainscot made out of, well, cabinet doors
for kitchens.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.440
And then the mantle.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.140
We salvaged this old 1830s mantle.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.900
It adds such a bit of soul and charm to the
place.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.480
And what do you think of the kitchen?

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.380
Big change, huh?

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.870
Everybody thought I was crazy when I bought
those secondhand cabinets.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.480
But look how beautifully they've turned out.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.290
They came from the ReStore for Habitat for
Humanity.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.300
And then take look at the ceiling.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.950
We actually used the barn tin up there, but
we didn't paint it like we did in the master

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.950
bedroom.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.120
And then for these cabinets, which will be
the pantry in part, we used chicken wire.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.320
Looking pretty good, don't you think?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.320
And take a look at the entry hall.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.680
Look at how the wainscot worked out using
these blocks of wood.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.650
Looks like big stones laid in here.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.580
But not really, just painted white.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.650
I'm so proud of the way it looks.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.120
Now with the house finished, yeah, we went
over budget a little, but we made our time

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.370
in terms of days.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.540
Now it's time to start decorating this puppy.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.210
We've already started a little bit in terms
of getting some light fixtures hung.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.790
And just hang on, you're not gonna believe
it.
