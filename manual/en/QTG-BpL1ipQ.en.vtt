00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.300
Welcoem to Ski Talk. I'm Steve. I'm the ski buyer here at

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.520
skis.com and joining us today is Rick Andreson our Salomon...

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.630
that's a tough one to say. Not Anderson, right? Andreson.
Andreson.
Okay, sorry.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.700
It's okay.
All right and we're going to talk about the Quest 100 for women now this is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.770
a really nice high-performance boot for that good skiing woman, right?

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.900
It's a three buckle design which we've covered in some of the other videos but there

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.980
is something a little unique about this top buckle which I'd like you to explain.
Yeah.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.070
It's a super consumer-friendly design. Tool-free 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.270
adjustment up here so if you need a little more room you can simply just adjust

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.340
this out. Along with the micro-adjust

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.460
so giving yourself plenty of room here or, you know, if you've got that lower volume

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.520
calf muscle, you can adjust it back. So, really giving yourself

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.670
a great fit up here because it's really where you get all the energy from.
Right because

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.780
you know working in a shop, sometimes boots are harder to fit for the woman with the more muscular

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.840
lower shorter, shorter calf. And that gives you an extra feature.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.900
All women's boots are a little more generous there but this is even more than average

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.050
to allow for that additional...
Yeah, in the old days you used to have to drill it and remove it now

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.120
we've taken that guess work out of it.
Now it's also got a ski/walk feature on the back.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.200
Now that's a really nice comfort performance feature as

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.250
well.
Yeah, you can simply just click this up, releases the upper cuff

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.350
so it makes it easier to walk, easier to stand up but also...
Easier to hang out

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.440
in the bar.
Easier to hang out in the bar. But also at this level too

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.470
it gives you a little backcountry access. if you want to do that 5-10

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.600
minute hike to catch that powder stash, click it up, you go

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.700
into hike mode. When you're ready to ski just click it back down, make that first turn

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.760
locks in and you're ready to go.
Okay, and then it's also got a sole which is a little bit

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.920
helpful in that regard as well, right?
Yep. Kind of mimics a hiking boot sole.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.030
Okay. Now let's talk about the fit of this boot. It's a 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.090
100 flex and a 100 last. 
Exactly.
So, let's talk about both of those.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.150
So, that's going to be your average last.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.280
Fits the, ya know, normal or medium lasted foot maybe 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.370
85-90% of the skiers out there.
But it is a snugger fit than the more

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.430
wider...
Performance fit.
Exactly. And 100 flex. Now that's pretty high

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.600
on the flex scale for women so this is for a good

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.730
faster skiing woman, right?
I'd sell this to advanced-intermediate all

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.830
the way up to that lighter weight expert.
But not for a beginner

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.860
is kind of what I'm getting at.
No. No.
All right, now let's talk about the liner. 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.020
It's got some nice little fur at the top, I see.
Yep. It's custom heat moldable liner

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.120
if needed. You've got the faux fur so it gives you a little more warmth

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.200
and then like all Salomon boots in our women's side, we do use extra insulation.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.280
in it.
And I noticed it's got the performance liner which has a lot of 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.440
memory foam type material in it which will actually hold its shape and slowly over

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.520
time custom fit to the person's foot.
Sure will.
Okay.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.580
It's got side cuff adjustment, I think we forgot to talk about.
Yeah, just aligns

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.750
the upper cuff to the lower leg so super simple on that as well.
There's really no features

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.900
that boot is lacking. It's got everything for a good snug fit.
Yep.
So, describe the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.010
perfect customer for that boot.
I would say that advanced-intermediate even

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.070
into the advanced-expert level looking for a great all-mountain boot possibly 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.230
even starting to venture out-of-bounds a little bit trying some of the backcountry.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.320
Okay. All right. Thanks, Rick.
Thank you, Steve.
There you have it.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.370
There's Quest 100 for women. Thanks for joining us on Ski Talk.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.380
 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.413
