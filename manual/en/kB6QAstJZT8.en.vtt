00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.970
In this clip we are going to talk about getting
actually started playing the game. So once

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.380
it is out of the package, once you have the
game out of the package, and you install it

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.890
on your computer, and you download the newest
content in the form of patches and things

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.400
like that, and maybe you have put the expansion
on there, like Burning Crusade is the current,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.720
newest expansion, and so you will want that
on your computer as well. Once you have installed

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.589
everything, it is time to get started by choosing
a realm. And the way you do that is, there

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.579
are a variety of different types of realms,
and there are dozens and dozens and dozens

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:42.379
of realms you can play in. And what that means
is, there are servers spread around, and like

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.179
with many other computer systems, each server
has a different capacity. So what you do is

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:54.910
you have several servers and on different
servers you have different realms, so basically

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.379
a realm is just the place where you play.
You can have characters on multiple different

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.250
realms, but your first realm, if you have
friends who play World of Warcraft, the best

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.190
thing to do would be to pick a realm that
some of those friends are already playing

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.940
on, so you will have people who you already
know are playing the game, and then you can

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.220
play with them as well. In order to choose
a realm, you go up here where it says change

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:29.960
realm, click on that, and it gives you a list.
And one of the things, if you have friends

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.240
who already play World of Warcraft, and you
know what realm they play in, you should just

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.820
come over here on the left, scroll down, and
let's say your friends play in Graymane, well

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.770
you go to Graymane and you click okay. And
you are good to go. You make a character and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.520
that would be enough. And then you call your
friends and say, hey, this is my character's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.460
name and I am on your server or whatever.
And they would, you know, invite you into

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.450
their friends list and so on. But if you do
not have friends who already play World of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.799
Warcraft, and you are trying to decide what
kind of realm you want to play in, you have

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:08.479
a few options. Things like normal. A normal
realm is, well, it might be easier to explain

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.269
PVP first. PVP is player-versus-player. So
on a player-versus-player realm, you can fight

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.120
against other players. If you do not want
to get into fights all the time, your option

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.220
would be, another option would be normal.
Normal, you would have to instigate fights

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.239
or go into battlegrounds and things like that.
But you usually would not just be always under

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.800
the threat of combat with other players. And
then you have role-playing player-versus-player

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.629
realms which are combat realms where you invite
a lot of other players and a lot of different

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.349
ways of playing, but at the same time, people
expect, because World of Warcraft is a role-playing

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.680
game where you are playing as a character
like an elf or something, you might want to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.269
go into a role-playing PVP server, which allows
you to more get into character and people

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.180
expect you to be in character more often.
So those are your options, and you would choose

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.909
one of these types of realms in order to play.
