00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:03.022
(lively techno music)

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:04.248
- [Narrator] Derp!

00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:05.195
- Hey, guys.

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:07.877
I got a bit of a different
guest here, today.

00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:10.068
This is Sigmund Freud.

00:00:10.068 --> 00:00:11.051
- Hello!

00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:12.123
I am Sigmund Freud,

00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:14.761
the father of modern psychoanalysis.

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.811
- Aha!

00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:17.365
Well, I don't even know what that means

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:18.936
but I'm excited to have you here.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:20.944
- It means the part of
your mind that we find out

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:23.866
where the source of all your
concerns and your troubles.

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.951
- Oh man.

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:27.203
I don't know if you wanna
go in my mind, Freud.

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:28.036
Ha ha.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:28.869
- I do, I do, Tod.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.277
- All right, well this'll be fun.

00:00:30.277 --> 00:00:31.290
- All minds.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.306
- We got some Happy Wheels today.

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:34.139
You wanna play?

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.972
- Happy Wheels?

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:35.805
- Yeah, Happy Wheels.

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:36.638
- Oh, okay.

00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:40.129
Yes, well, underneath all
happy wheels are sad wheels,

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:40.962
of course.

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:41.795
- Ha ha ha.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:43.673
- But let us start on the surface.

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:44.506
- Yep, yep, yep.

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:45.339
Here we go.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.555
Yeah, I'm gonna pick a real good level.

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:47.793
This is gonna be so much fun.

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:49.098
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:52.734
It's a father and a son
going on a bike ride.

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:53.567
- Yeah.

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:55.531
- But I noticed the child
is not wearing a helmet.

00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:57.894
- Nah. The kid's not really gonna need it.

00:00:57.894 --> 00:01:01.278
I, I have a feeling the
kid's not gonna be okay

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:03.169
no matter what happens here.

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:04.670
Oh yeah!

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.886
- So violent.

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:07.262
- Lost my head.

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:08.752
Ha ha ha.
- Horrified.

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:09.871
- Okay, here I-

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:11.304
- This is like something
out of a nightmare.

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.771
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:13.628
I don't know.

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:16.455
I guess I just like it when
the dude on the bicycle

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:17.317
loses his head.

00:01:17.317 --> 00:01:18.409
I think it's really funny.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.314
Oh! Ah!

00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:20.147
Ha ha!

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:22.277
- Oh, it's exploding.

00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:23.184
- Aw man.

00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:24.872
I don't even know why
a bike would explode.

00:01:24.872 --> 00:01:27.468
Aw man, I got through those spikes.

00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:29.647
I'm doing wheelies.
- You lost the child.

00:01:29.647 --> 00:01:30.493
- I made it!

00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:31.640
- That's victory because victory,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.583
this is the definition of victory?

00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:34.795
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:35.979
- Oh, horrifying.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:36.812
Horrifying.

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:38.302
Who's this horrifying woman
shown up on the screen?

00:01:38.302 --> 00:01:39.135
- Oh, I don't know.

00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:40.358
That's Happy Wheels woman.

00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:42.126
- She looks like some
kind of Jabba the Hutt.

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:43.575
- You wanna play this level, Freud?

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:45.064
- I don't know if I have
the stomach for a ride.

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:45.938
- Okay.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.317
- I'll give it a shot, though.

00:01:47.317 --> 00:01:48.481
- Alright. Okay.

00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:50.571
- I choose, uh, let's
see, what do we have here?

00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.126
Who have I chosen?

00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:54.297
- You've picked a, well
that's supposed to be a

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:56.612
a carrier on the back.

00:01:56.612 --> 00:01:57.511
- Okay.

00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.758
- But the kid didn't make it along.

00:01:58.758 --> 00:02:00.168
- This is a mother and her child.

00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:01.004
- Uh, yeah.

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.432
- The classic familial relationship.

00:02:03.432 --> 00:02:05.415
- Ah, that was a good death.

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:06.248
- Oh!

00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:07.926
- That was a really good death, Freud.

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:10.826
- I've got two children
with me on the bicycle.

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:12.680
- Why, that kid's stuck back there.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.117
You've gotta lose him.
- Now, let me ask you, Todd,

00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:18.172
what button do I use to
interact with the mother?

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:21.427
To have the child and the mother interact?

00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:22.287
- Oh, um.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:24.305
Nah, I think you're probably
gonna want a different game.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.519
- All children, Todd, all
children have these thoughts,

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.770
these ideas, this Oedipal complex.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.880
Tell me about your mother.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.713
- Oh yeah.

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:35.718
Well, she's pretty cool.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:36.931
She, um.

00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:38.127
- I met her when I came in.

00:02:38.127 --> 00:02:39.774
- She works at the cafeteria.

00:02:39.774 --> 00:02:43.160
She's a real good cook as a result of it.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.993
- I see, yes.

00:02:43.993 --> 00:02:45.110
Alright, I have lost the child.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.560
- Ha ha, Santa.
- Just run over Santa Claus

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.837
and a dinosaur.

00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:49.439
- I love running over Santa.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.977
- This is some kind of nightmare.

00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:51.810
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.970
- Some kind of horrible nightmare.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.100
- This is my favorite level.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.476
- A giant moth in the sky.

00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:56.802
- Yeah, and he's like doin' battle.

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.175
- What does the moth represent?

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:01.175
- Uh, I think he represents insects.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.153
- Incest.

00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:04.422
I've got Santa Claus, now, yes.

00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:05.865
Father Christmas.

00:03:05.865 --> 00:03:07.948
- Oh! Those stupid elves.

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.976
Oh, that was hilarious.

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:12.976
- I am dead.

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:16.179
Tod, I think I've seen enough.

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:17.012
- What?

00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:17.845
- I've seen enough.

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:18.943
- Now we gotta get through this level.

00:03:18.943 --> 00:03:20.619
Don't you wanna see this level?

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:21.871
- This is unhealthy for you, Tod.

00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:23.446
This is unhealthy, we must turn this off.

00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:24.371
- Oh, well, then.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.439
- We must turn this off right now

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.491
and we must talk to your mother.

00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:27.353
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:28.193
- I must talk to your mother alone.

00:03:28.193 --> 00:03:29.026
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:29.859
Hey, Freud.

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.230
- I must be alone with your mother.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.675
- Can I, can I be honest with
you about something, here?

00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:35.936
My mom doesn't know I play this game.

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:38.513
So if you could just
not mention this to her?

00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:41.199
- Tod, I need to at least
spend some time discussing

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.555
your current state.

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:45.320
I must talk to your mother, Tod.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.210
I need to speak with your mother, Tod.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.828
It is very pressing.
- Okay, okay, okay.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.661
Mom!

00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:50.494
- [Mom] Yes?

00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:51.327
- Mom!

00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:52.160
- [Mom] Yes, sweetie?

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.180
- Freud wants to talk to you.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.466
- Yeah, Mrs. Tod, I need to
speak with you in privates,

00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:57.466
uh, private.

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:02.544
- Kind of slipped there, huh?

00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:03.417
- It happens.

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:04.250
- Okay, here.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.443
You go talk to my mom.

00:04:05.443 --> 00:04:08.218
I'm gonna tackle Happy
Wheels here by myself.

00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:09.717
- How do I look?

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:11.457
Is my bow-tie straight?

00:04:11.457 --> 00:04:13.423
- Yeah, you look old.

00:04:13.423 --> 00:04:15.497
Wait, do you like my Mom?

00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:17.022
Do you have the crush on my mom?

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:18.390
- All moms, all moms.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.237
- Aw, man.

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:22.881
- With their jeans that
go up to the belly button.

00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:24.310
- You should not be here.
- Oh boy.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.806
- You know my dad gets
home, like, anytime, right?

00:04:26.806 --> 00:04:27.815
- Alright.

00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:28.893
Ah, Tod.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.846
When you get to be my age, you know,

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:33.352
you take what you can get.

00:04:33.352 --> 00:04:34.659
- My mom?

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:35.919
Being what you could get?

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.062
- I could totally get her.

00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:38.276
- No you could not.

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:39.491
- I'm Sigmund Freud.

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:40.324
- Mom!

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:42.358
- Yes, mom!

00:04:43.454 --> 00:04:44.731
- Mom!
- Mom!

00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:46.787
- Could Freud get you?

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:47.620
Mom?
- Mom!

00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:50.984
She'll never believe you.

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:52.718
- Mom.
- Mom.

00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:53.762
This is what you sound like.

00:04:53.762 --> 00:04:54.618
"Mom."

00:04:54.618 --> 00:04:55.732
- Mom!

00:04:55.732 --> 00:04:56.911
Shut up.

00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:57.828
Mom.
- Mom.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.671
Mom!

00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:05.035
(thumps and groans)

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:06.994
- I was never here.

00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:07.994
Ninja smoke.

00:05:09.624 --> 00:05:12.477
- Making the scarecrows
fear toxin kick back in.

00:05:12.477 --> 00:05:14.808
- My, my head thing is hurting your head?

00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:15.844
- Yeah, stop doing that.

00:05:15.844 --> 00:05:17.319
Aah!

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.152
- What?

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:19.335
- Ah, oh, no.

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:20.415
Tod!

00:05:20.415 --> 00:05:22.692
- It's just a little
fun song I like to sing.

00:05:22.692 --> 00:05:24.581
- Oh, oh, God.

00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:26.748
Help me, help me, help me.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:29.166
- You okay?
