00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.580
Hi everyone

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.640
I'm Shirley from Shirley's Wardrobe

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.740
Stayed tuned with me as I talk to you guys about my favourite pieces from River Islands party season

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.840
And I'm going to be showing you guys some outfits

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.880
And some make-up styling to go with it as well

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.980
I love coming to River Island

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.540
Especially during the party season

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.840
Because I know I can find an outfit from top to toe that's in my budget

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.540
The prices are amazings

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.560
The outfits look so luxurious

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.020
I know I'm going to find a nice outfit

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.340
I love the fact that the dress is so feminine

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.060
It's really sexy

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.280
But it's got this really nice peplum detail around the waist area

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.560
It's a bold colour

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.060
And if you really wanna make a statement

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.160
This is a really nice piece to go for

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.640
The accessories I've kept really really luxurious

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.020
With this gold necklace

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.120
And gold really ties in to the lovely clutch details

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.060
As well as the beautiful shoes I've got on right now

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.300
So for this outfit I thought i'd keep the make-up really simple

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.300
I went for a really lovely nude lip

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.480
And for the eyes I kept it really neutral

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.760
But then a tiny bit of drama with the eyeliner

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.500
And blending of a smoky eye

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.880
So for my second look

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.400
I picked this really beautiful dress

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.140
It's made out of sequins

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.360
And River Island are know for their amazing sequin pieces

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.800
Another thing I love about this dress

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.020
Is the detail on the back

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.660
It's got this really nice low cut V

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.800
Which is really elegant

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.000
And I've paired it with this really lovely pair of minimal heels

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.240
'Cos the legs are out

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.960
I thought they would really compliment the look very well

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.420
So for this make-up look

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.480
I thought I'd play around with a pop of colour

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.360
On my lips and on my nails

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.840
So I have gone for a really bold red

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.540
And I think it really compliments the monochrome of the outfit

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.940
And for the hair

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.940
I kept it really lovely and elegant

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.960
With a middle parting

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.260
Having tiny bit of strands at the front

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.640
And then I strapped the rest to the back

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.320
So for look number 3

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.120
I've gone for the classic LBD

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.800
And one thing I love about this one

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.020
It's got a really nice lace detail on the hem

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.600
And then just to add a bit more character to the outfit

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.280
I've gone for these really really fluffy orange heels

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.880
Which I absolutely LOVE!

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.820
And to tie everything together

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.020
I've gone for an orange lip

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.820
And my hair and my earrings

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.820
Are kind of reminiscent of the 20s

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.780
Which I really like

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.380
I think it would be really fun for a Christmas party

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.520
