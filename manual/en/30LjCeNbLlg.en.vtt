00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:07.133
We're on a two-day trip with Jaguar,
and they've brought all R-models with them.

00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:09.921
We drove to the track in the convertible.

00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:16.476
There are lots of toys for us to play with.

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:20.680
The XFR for example,
but we'll review it later.

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.662
There's also the XJ Supersport,
but Sacha's already driven than one a while back.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.379
But we're predominantly interested in the XKR-S.

00:00:29.587 --> 00:00:31.157
I keep saying it wrong.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.370
You know how much I liked the XKR...

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.650
...that white beast, equipped with
the Speed Pack and the Black Pack.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.647
This one is even better.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.837
It's got the same supercharged 5-liter V8...

00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:50.953
...but this one has just a bit more horsepower.

00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:54.835
550 to be exact.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:00.606
And it's got a staggering 680 Nm of torque.

00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:17.747
We've driven on the Portimao Circuit,
it's a very tricky and technical track.

00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:20.523
This car is fine on the track.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.647
But I think more of it as a playmate,
one that does great powerslides.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.401
The engine in the front's got loads of power...

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.142
...and it's got a limited slip differential.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.098
So it goes sideways very easily
and you can keep it sideways very easily.

00:01:37.147 --> 00:01:39.667
It's top entertainment.

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:14.888
The difference between the engines
isn't all that extreme.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.834
It has 10% more power...

00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:22.833
...but with these kinds of numbers
it's hard to really notice a difference.

00:02:23.084 --> 00:02:26.556
Of course it's quicker; 0-62 in 4.4 seconds.

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:29.392
Am I saying that right?
Yes, I do.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:37.973
It's top speed is significantly higher
but that's mostly down to electronics.

00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:40.994
The XKR is limited to 155 mph...

00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:45.696
...and Jaguar allows you to do
186 mph in the XKR-S.

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:51.829
If you are going to lose your license,
it's better to do it right.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:03.407
The most significant change
is of course the bodykit.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.067
This XKR-S looks much more
impressive and aggressive...

00:03:09.238 --> 00:03:12.351
...with its big spoilers
and its abundance of air openings. 

00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:17.253
There's also the great Smurf blue color,
it looks great.

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:22.300
It looks wrong on most cars,
but on a Jaguar it just looks cool.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:29.617
The great thing is that all changes are functional.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.249
Of course it's also lowered
and it also has stiffer suspension.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.657
It's got active suspension.

00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:45.305
Those changes make this car
sharper than the regular XKR...

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:47.624
...but it's also more calm.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.831
The regular XKR is a bit nervous, in a good way.

00:03:52.888 --> 00:03:55.688
You can drift it very nicely for example.

00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:58.781
But this one feels more decided...

00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:03.339
...but it isn't more uncomfortable.
Jaguar's done a good job there.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:08.290
The car is much sharper,
without trading in any comfort.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.261
It there something to complain about?

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.561
You can always complain
about the sat nav in a Jaguar.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.926
It's got a touch screen,
but it isn't very user friendly.

00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:22.116
But if that worries you, I would just
get a Volkswagen Golf or something.

00:04:37.084 --> 00:04:40.812
The coolest thing about this car
is the exhaust note.

00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:43.467
It just sounds amazing...

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.721
...both full throttle and when changing down.
It's crackles nicely.

00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:53.323
It's exactly what you want from a sports car.
