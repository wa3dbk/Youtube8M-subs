00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.200
(C) Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer
Clay Tutor, and I am at the Astoria Sunday

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.120
Market, which is this wonderful public market,
I am here with one of our members, Becky Sue,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.990
Hi Becky.(B) Hi there.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.580
(C) Now Becky is a Polymer Clay artist, of
course, so she's got a whole booth here of

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.030
wonderful things, so you said that your Barrettes
started…

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.890
(B) Barrettes, is what got me started, 7 years
ago I made a barrette for myself, I hadn't

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.510
worked in clay before then, and I loved my
barrette, and I made another one and another

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.410
one, and the next thing I knew, I had a hundred
of them, and my family decided I had to do

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.449
something, and so here I am.

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.910
(C) Oh, it is so cool, you've got a ton of
different styles, what's your most popular

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.930
style do you think?

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.480
(B) You know, as you look it's… there's
just a whole array of things.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.820
So basically I sit down at the table, I know
I'm going to make a barrette, and that's all

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.500
I know, and when I get done, I have something
made that I never knew was going to come out

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.210
of me, so that's why you see a lot of varieties
of different things that I do.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.280
(C) You've got all kinds of different flowers
and all kinds of patterns and geometrics and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.671
lots of different stuff, and I also see you
have a bit of an influence over here, I see

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:37.420
some Sweet Pea Earrings, and you got few other
things in here too that you've learnt from

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.420
the tutorials, right?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.130
(B) I have several things…

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.830
I have here from the tutorials, going from
the earrings to some of my pendants that have

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.790
the Cabbage Rose...

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.290
(C) or the Ranunculus.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.490
(B) Ranunculus…

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.810
I'm sure you look around and you just see
stuff that you know you influenced me on.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.420
(C) Yeah, so you've been here, you said that
the market runs from when?

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.110
(B) Mother's day to the 2nd week in October.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.310
(C) So you come here every single Sunday,
right?

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.310
(B) Every Sunday.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.540
(C) Now, that is a big commitment you know,
so how many years have you been doing this?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.120
(B) This is my 7th year at the market.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.060
(C) Has it changed over the years or has it
gotten more popular or less popular or what

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.060
kind of thing is happening?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.200
(B) It's been really interesting because every
year I have people that find me for the first

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.720
time, and when they find me…this year I
had a woman that was probably in her 80's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.849
and when she found me, her eyes just lit up
and she went bananas, and went from piece

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:46.610
to piece with just total joy, and then I have
my regular customers that come back.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.520
But I think I enjoy seeing people come in
for the first time and taking a look at what

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.330
I've done with the clay.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.490
(C) Yeah, you've got some really great varieties,
you’ve got a range of pricing too and sizes

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.160
which is good, you've also got some larger
pieces as well, right?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.380
So let’s see, she's got all kinds of stuff,
so are those journal covers and things over

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.380
there?

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.660
(B) These are my journals, and I have photo
albums, none of them are out right now, but

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.360
I started making these because of my daughter,
she is a writer and she wanted a journal,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.650
and so I made her one, and again I just can't
stop.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.870
(C) And they're beautiful, they've got all
sorts of neat things like this...lots of different

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.510
textures, she's got dragonflies and all kinds
of neat things in here, little faces and they're

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.510
really cool looking.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.410
And you've got things like nail files and
salt shakers and wine corks and lots of variety,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.060
so this is really quite cool.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.480
Do you demo at the booth as well?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:59.240
(B) I don't, I haven't figured out how to
do it, and keep the clay clean, so I just

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240
haven't tried.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.570
(C) That can be a challenge just in the house
regularly, let alone out on the street.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:12.380
So I'm here with Becky's husband, and assistant
I hear, Mark and she said that you help her

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.110
out quite a bit, so tell me about that.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:21.479
(M) Well, mainly I just help her setup and
tear down, that sort of thing, but a couple

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.860
years ago, she was telling me that I wasn't
contributing enough, so she put me to work

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.540
and had me start making feather earrings,
and actually it’s been kind of fun, and

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.690
I try to incorporate one of her beads into
the earrings.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.689
(C) So the Peacock Cane she would have learned
from the tutorial, and there's some little

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.909
feathers in that too, so where do you get
the feathers?

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:50.580
(M) Well actually, we were up... we were over
in Walla Walla the other day, and we were

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.159
wandering through a park over there, and they’ve
got this beautiful aviary over there, and

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.330
they had some extra feathers, that they had
just from…

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.300
I guess they collected ‘em from, you know
while they were cleaning up the cages or something,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.430
and just came up with some… just beautiful
pheasant feathers, some really unusual pheasants.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.589
So Becky bought some feathers and we have
chickens at our house, so sometimes they throw

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.699
a few feathers out and we incorporate those
into...earrings yeah.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.850
(C) That's really neat, well that's even better
than picking them up at a craft store.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.469
(M) Oh, absolutely, absolutely, some of them
have come from craft stores but I got some

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:38.379
really, really nice Grizzly Hackle feathers
when I was in a fly shop last year, I was

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:44.220
going fly fishing with my brother and I saw
these Grizzly Hackle feathers and I thought,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.150
man, those will make great earrings, and I
plopped them down on the counter, and the

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.080
guy goes, he was kind of a gruff old guy and
he goes finally somebody is buying feathers

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.139
for fly tying material, all these women are
coming in here and wiping me out making earrings.

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:06.089
I just kept my mouth shut, I felt like I needed
to go to confession after I bought ‘em you

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.909
know, but I just kept my mouth shut, didn’t
tell him they were going for earrings.

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:17.219
(C) My Dad used to tie flies when I was a
kid, he actually started a fishing tackle

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:23.840
company but he started with fly tying, so
I remember boxes and boxes of all kinds of

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.629
feathers.

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:32.649
But that is a neat story, thank you for sharing
that, and it's nice to see that Becky, or

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:34.169
Becky Sue has some great help.

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.169
(M) Well, thank you.

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:36.169
(C) You're welcome.

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:37.169
(M) Nice to meet you.

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.270
(C) And it's nice to meet you too, you can
say good bye too.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.839
(M) Bye.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.729
(C) So that wraps it up for today, we've really
had a great time here.

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.949
There's all sorts of beautiful flowers and
food and wonderful things here, and we will

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.600
see you on more adventures on our road trip.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.360
We'll see you later, bye for now.
