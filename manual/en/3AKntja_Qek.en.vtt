00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.740
There are several other ways also in which
a game can be drawn. The first one is known

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.330
as draw by lack of force. Lack of force means
that neither side has sufficient material

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.750
to actually complete the game and to win.
Now if you had a situation which could arise

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.840
where you simply had the two kings left on
the board there would be a lack of force.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.100
One king cannot attack the other king to put
the king into check because by doing that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.160
it would itself move into check. Therefore,
there is nothing that they can do and the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.350
game is drawn by lack of force. The next thing
is something called perpetual check. Perpetual

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.629
check is something that happens when a player
is on the verge of losing the game but has

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:02.149
a chance to keep checking the opposition player
and by doing that they can keep going with

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.380
one check after another check after another
check and thus avoid letting the other player

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.710
actually check mate them and finish the game.
The other way, another way of doing this is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:24.030
the so called three times recurring position
and this is when games get into a situation

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.290
where really nothing much is happening and
the players are simply pushing the pieces

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.610
back and forth over the same squares and the
same position does arise, the identical position

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.340
three times in the course of the game and
that is another way of drawing the match.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:53.100
Another way of drawing is by the 50 move rule.
The 50 move rule states that a game can be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:04.270
drawn if no piece is taken and no pawn is
moved within a period of 50 moves. In other

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.709
words a game that is simply not going anywhere
can be drawn under that rule and there is

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.999
one other way also that a game can be drawn
and that is by both players deciding that

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:25.329
they cannot win and they are happy to settle
for a draw and indeed at the higher levels

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:32.579
of chess, especially at the master level that
is how many games probably 50% end is with

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.109
an agreed draw.
