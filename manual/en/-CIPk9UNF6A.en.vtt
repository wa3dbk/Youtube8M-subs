00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.950
So the next thing we're going to is, I think
we have filed out the inside of the door hole

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:18.539
a little bit larger so that we can fit our
doorknob into it. So we're going to note the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.470
direction. Since this is a passage door we
want to place the angle of the strike so that

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.210
the door can close. See if that will sit in
there, oh yeah see how now that's fitting

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.650
down in there nicer since we've filed out
that little area in there. Now we're going

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:44.960
just do a test fit on... now I need to figure
which side do I want this in, this is just

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.370
a passage doorway but I think we're going
to put this out here. So we're going to put

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.650
a trial fit and you notice that there's a
rounded side on this and the rounded side

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:04.900
will go into here like that. So we're going
to do a trial fit in here. First we'll go

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:14.770
like this. See if this is going to work. O.k.
that looks o.k. so that's all fitting in place.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.570
Looks like it's sticking out a little bit.
What's that about? Just a little bit of wood

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.341
or what? Now it appears as though I'm going
to need to round or clean out a little bit

00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:42.289
more from the top and the bottom. Just a little
bit. So this is how it is in the real world.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:56.420
You just have to fine tune it just a little
bit. O.k. here we go.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.189
Trial fit again of our doorknob. It's looking
pretty good now I think. That's fitting nicely.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:13.580
Everything's fitting nicely. um, hmm, sticking
out a little bit. Alright there what's going

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.080
on?. O.k. there we go. That's better, that's
better. O.k. looks like we're getting somewhere

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.300
now and then we'll try to put this side on
and just fit it on there. Sometimes you have

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.930
to turn these little knobs around the door
lock knob to get it to seat in place and just

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.910
kind of wiggle that on.
Oh there we go.
