00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.515
You think we flew you from Pakistan
to read the paper, right?

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.817
Keep watching TV.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.652
That's why you're here. Want me
to get you dinner too?

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:20.954
I didn't say I want dinner.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.489
Where's the stuff the Madame asked you to buy?

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:23.990
I got some of it, but I didn't have...

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.225
So you bring the stuff in installations?

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.059
It was prayer time.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.861
When the Madame asks you 
to get groceries, do it.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.930
And if you don't have enough money,
here! Go get the stuff.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.700
Let go of that newspaper! That's not why we hired you.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.268
But I didn't have money before...

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:37.604
Why are you still talking to me?
Get the groceries!

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.407
God forgive me.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:43.476
Idiot!

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.311
Sponsor Song
Abdulkhaliq (feat. Mr. Arshad)
Music Director: Saleh Haddad

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.948
Everybody, listen up.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:52.652
I carry everything.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.689
I carry everything.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.727
I assemble everything.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.831
I do my sponsor's work.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.269
If I leave, you won't survive.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.405
I'm not afraid of my sponsor.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.907
Boy, boy, boy, boy...

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.309
I'm not afraid of my sponsor.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.844
Boy, boy, boy, boy...

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.180
I'm not afraid of my sponsor.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:24.484
Lift the AC, assemble the AC. Assemble
the pump, mixer, tiles.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.821
Saudis are too stubborn.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:31.724
You think I'm afraid? I see everything you do.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.527
I'm not afraid of my sponsor.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.431
I'm not afraid of my sponsor.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.802
I carry everything.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.639
I carry everything.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.910
I assemble everything.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.814
I do my sponsor's work.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:58.118
Saudis talk too much. Every Saudi wants to be a boss.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.221
Leave your residency permit. Get the work
done right, then goodbye.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.858
Who does everything in Saudi Arabia?
Who built the infrastructure?

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.693
Who keeps it 100?

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.361
Then you say "Bengalis are low-class."

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.763
You never keep it 100. You never keep it 100.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.634
Who built the bridges? Who built
the sewage? Who?

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.570
Who takes out your trash? Who works
in your convenience stores?

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.807
Saudis all forget who drives the taxis.

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.643
Saudis all forget who drives the taxis.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.445
"Jeddah Taxi"

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:30.617
Every day, lift the bags. Every day, wash the cars.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:34.654
Then we'll get deported. I'm not
afraid of my sponsor.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:38.525
I'm not afraid of my sponsor.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.362
I'm not afraid of my sponsor.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.933
I carry everything.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.937
I carry everything.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.974
I assemble everything.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.845
I do my sponsor's work.
