00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200
0:00:07.100,0:00:10.809
Hi this Julie with Beadaholique.com

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
and today I'm going to show you how to use
the

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.330
0:00:10.809,0:00:14.680
crystal applicator tool.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.459
This is a
really fun tool.

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:14.900
You're going to find a lot of uses

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.340
0:00:14.680,0:00:16.929
for it in your jewelry projects.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.860
0:00:16.929,0:00:21.910
So what this does is this allows you to

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.560
very easily and quickly apply snaps

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.910
0:00:21.910,0:00:26.640
buttons and various other items

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.560
which were in the past very difficult,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.680
0:00:26.640,0:00:29.519
time consuming and expensive to apply.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.290
0:00:29.519,0:00:33.210
We did a quick little project here that I'm

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.290
wearing.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.290
This
is just a cuff bracelet.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.290
I've done a little

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.980
0:00:33.210,0:00:39.000
pico edge which we have a bead embroidery

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.500
video for and I placed two Swarovski snap

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.500
0:00:39.000,0:00:39.900
fasteners

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.500
0:00:39.900,0:00:42.650
on the edge.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.500
I want to show you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.590
0:00:42.650,0:00:44.690
just how easy this is

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.410
0:00:44.690,0:00:48.570
to remove and take off.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.640
So I have to
bottom part here and there is a front and

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.640
0:00:48.570,0:00:49.420
back.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640
0:00:49.420,0:00:51.070
I have the with a pretty

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.430
0:00:51.070,0:00:54.850
crystal in the front and the back.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.510
0:00:54.850,0:00:57.860
I'm going to show you how easy these was to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.510
do.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.510
0:00:57.860,0:00:59.850
This tool it's pretty light weight.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.380
0:00:59.850,0:01:02.950
I'm not the strongest gal in the world

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.649
and I can easily hold it.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.750
0:01:02.950,0:01:05.030
It's actually very easy to close.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.750
0:01:05.030,0:01:05.819
This little

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.750
0:01:05.819,0:01:09.080
dial right here is going to adjust the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.750
height

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.780
0:01:09.080,0:01:13.180
which is going to show you where you can

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.780
close it.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.219
When you get this should already be

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.280
0:01:13.180,0:01:16.450
set and be okay you can be easily close

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280
your tool

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.880
0:01:16.450,0:01:20.950
if need be though you can just adjust it.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.079
Move this down so you can close the handle

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.140
0:01:20.950,0:01:22.670
a little bit more.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.420
0:01:22.670,0:01:25.920
So what I've gotten in front of me here

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.939
is I've got a couple different snap

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.100
0:01:25.920,0:01:27.530
fasteners.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.389
0:01:27.530,0:01:31.540
These here are the snap fastener

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.960
and there's going to be four parts to them

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.920
0:01:31.540,0:01:34.710
and then I also got a couple little

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.799
decorative buttons and then there's only

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.399
0:01:34.710,0:01:38.350
two parts to them because they're just a

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.159
little decorative flourish little button

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.710
0:01:38.350,0:01:40.440
and they don't need their backside.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.929
0:01:40.440,0:01:42.870
But today I want to show you how to apply

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:42.929
a

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.119
0:01:42.870,0:01:45.700
snap and I here some ultra suede here.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.549
0:01:45.700,0:01:50.200
So you have two dies sets.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.100
0:01:50.200,0:01:51.610
One for the top part

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.310
0:01:51.610,0:01:52.780
of your snap

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.939
0:01:52.780,0:01:55.390
and one for the bottom part of your set.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.479
0:01:55.390,0:01:59.510
The way you apply these is they got

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.170
this little screw here.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.631
0:01:59.510,0:02:02.180
It's very easy to screw.

00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:01.631
Screw right

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:03.840
0:02:02.180,0:02:04.180
or clockwise, it's going to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.030
0:02:04.180,0:02:05.290
tighten it.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.659
0:02:05.290,0:02:08.889
Screwing left counter clockwise is going

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.659
to loosen it.

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.679
0:02:08.889,0:02:12.290
I actually often think of the christmas

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.959
tree base when I'm trying to

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.980
0:02:12.290,0:02:15.420
screw in a christmas tree trunk so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.480
that might be a one way of thinking of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480
0:02:15.420,0:02:16.409
this.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.480
0:02:16.409,0:02:17.680
So I'm going to apply

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.450
0:02:17.680,0:02:21.290
the ones with the dails are always going

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.900
to go on the top of the tool.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.500
0:02:21.290,0:02:23.219
So loosen the screw

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.439
0:02:23.219,0:02:26.409
as far back as you can.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.920
You don't need to
remove the screw.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920
Make sure that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920
0:02:26.409,0:02:27.890
when you look in there

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.620
0:02:27.890,0:02:31.919
it's not protruding out from the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.180
interior circumfence.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.129
0:02:31.919,0:02:33.969
I'm just going to put this

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.930
0:02:33.969,0:02:35.709
right on top

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.879
0:02:35.709,0:02:37.709
of this rod.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.370
0:02:37.709,0:02:41.069
I'm going to fasten it.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.730
0:02:41.069,0:02:43.520
I'm going to keep turning until I can turn

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.730
no
more.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.950
0:02:43.520,0:02:46.860
You don't need to turn it so that it

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.120
gets to be too tight but just turn until

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.150
0:02:46.860,0:02:48.409
you can't anymore.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.019
0:02:48.409,0:02:50.579
For the bottom one all I have to do

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.560
0:02:50.579,0:02:51.969
is drop it in.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.530
0:02:51.969,0:02:55.939
Now you're gonna wanna tests before you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.251
put anything in there and make sure that it

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:58.269
0:02:55.939,0:02:59.649
closes all the way and it does.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.420
So we're good there.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.030
0:02:59.649,0:03:01.799
This is a little cushion area.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.140
0:03:01.799,0:03:05.439
What you're going to do there is you take

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.909
the
top part of your snap fastener

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.170
0:03:05.439,0:03:09.849
which is decorative part and lay it face down

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.890
in that little cushion area so the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.689
0:03:09.849,0:03:12.049
prong faced up.

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.239
0:03:12.049,0:03:15.189
Now what you're going to do is you're

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.239
going to take

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.980
0:03:15.189,0:03:16.300
the bottom part

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.769
0:03:16.300,0:03:20.330
and you can have it, if you look at it in

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.390
a
profile view the area that sticks out a

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.030
0:03:20.330,0:03:22.989
little bit more that's raised is gonna

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.030
go

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.569
0:03:22.989,0:03:24.880
looking down at the prongs.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.830
0:03:24.880,0:03:28.009
So the flat side but first the top

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.319
0:03:28.009,0:03:30.949
and you just going to, I'm just going to take

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.959
out this
little button so you can see how you're going

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.959
to

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:32.959
0:03:30.949,0:03:34.120
put these.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:33.959
You see that little notch there

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.170
0:03:34.120,0:03:39.229
you're going to put the hole right over that

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.930
notch.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.840
0:03:39.229,0:03:42.299
Sometimes it takes two hands I've

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.120
noticed to be able to do this.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120
Just make

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.510
0:03:42.299,0:03:47.699
sure it's secure.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.530
0:03:47.699,0:03:50.089
It snapped into place.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.840
0:03:50.089,0:03:53.799
I'm just going to put that little top part

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.930
back
on.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.370
0:03:53.799,0:03:57.409
I'm going to take my piece of ultra

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.370
suede

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.780
0:03:57.409,0:03:59.879
or whatever material you are using.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.120
0:03:59.879,0:04:04.009
I'm going to rest the material on

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.530
the base part.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.879
0:04:04.009,0:04:05.429
Then I'm going to

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.269
0:04:05.429,0:04:08.759
just almost close.

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.019
0:04:08.759,0:04:12.159
I'm just going to hold this here because what

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.310
I
want to make sure

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.590
0:04:12.159,0:04:15.279
thatI have it lined up exactly where I want

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.590
it

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.780
0:04:15.279,0:04:18.849
because you only get one shot at this.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.830
You
can't remove these.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.830
So you can just

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.690
0:04:18.849,0:04:22.009
lightly press it down so it catches but

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.690
you're not actually

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.630
0:04:22.009,0:04:24.729
compressing it all the way so I can

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.630
still

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.230
0:04:24.729,0:04:26.750
change my mind at this point.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.500
0:04:26.750,0:04:28.319
Move it around.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.350
0:04:28.319,0:04:30.289
When I'm happy with that

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.290
0:04:30.289,0:04:33.289
I'm just going to

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.840
0:04:33.289,0:04:37.939
press my handles all the way down until

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.260
you hear the snap.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.650
It means it's secure.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.650
0:04:37.939,0:04:39.650
Release

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.790
0:04:39.650,0:04:42.039
and pull off.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.260
0:04:42.039,0:04:45.629
That is on there and that is secure.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.270
0:04:45.629,0:04:49.379
So that's the top part of the snap.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.410
Now
I want to show you how to apply the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.410
0:04:49.379,0:04:53.959
bottom half.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.840
So now I'm gonna turn to
the left or counter-clockwise

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.980
0:04:53.959,0:04:56.949
unscrewed the top die.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.430
0:04:56.949,0:04:58.779
Remove the bottom die.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.880
0:04:58.779,0:05:02.250
Repeat the same process.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.490
I'm
going to make sure that my

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.210
0:05:02.250,0:05:03.720
screw you can see that

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.280
0:05:03.720,0:05:10.720
going in there, I don't want that.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.990
I
want it go all the way to the left.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.830
0:05:11.129,0:05:13.080
Place that on top of my

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.110
0:05:13.080,0:05:15.280
of this rod right here.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.480
0:05:15.280,0:05:16.909
Fasten it.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.720
0:05:16.909,0:05:18.860
Drop into place

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.770
0:05:18.860,0:05:21.119
the bottom.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.870
0:05:21.119,0:05:24.720
I'm going to take what looks like a little

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.150
round disc with prongs

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.610
0:05:24.720,0:05:27.539
so I want the prongs to face up again

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.180
0:05:27.539,0:05:30.669
and then I'm going to take my snap

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.180
part.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.410
0:05:30.669,0:05:34.339
I'm just going to put it, see there's

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.410
a little hole

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.860
0:05:34.339,0:05:35.860
I'm just going to put this snap

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.970
0:05:35.860,0:05:38.019
into that little hole

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.800
0:05:38.019,0:05:40.360
just like back and it catches perfectly.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.310
0:05:40.360,0:05:44.560
Again I make sure that this closes all the

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.080
way and it does.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.960
0:05:44.560,0:05:47.910
Now you want to be careful when you're doing

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.510
a
fabric you want to figure out

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.120
0:05:47.910,0:05:51.930
where the snaps are lined up.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.930
It's very important because you do it get

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.410
0:05:51.930,0:05:54.030
one shot at this.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.600
0:05:54.030,0:05:59.289
Press this down here real quick.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.590
So want you're going to do
is you want to fold your fabric.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.930
0:05:59.289,0:06:03.759
If you have two pieces like this is a little

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.310
bit easier
but if your trying to find something that

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.310
match

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.350
0:06:03.759,0:06:06.020
you want to know where it's going to line

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.350
up.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.350
0:06:06.020,0:06:07.250
So I can see

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.350
0:06:07.250,0:06:09.479
that I want

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.490
0:06:09.479,0:06:13.770
this to go into my tool just like that.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.090
0:06:13.770,0:06:15.960
Going to put this back on here

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.990
0:06:15.960,0:06:22.960
put that back on there.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.360
0:06:24.460,0:06:26.869
I'm going to eye ball it.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.880
0:06:26.869,0:06:32.020
Make sure it looks good before I do an actual

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.470
punching here.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.860
0:06:33.290,0:06:36.210
I'm not applying a lot of pressure to

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.860
use this tool.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.350
0:06:36.210,0:06:38.709
So then what I can do

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.240
0:06:38.709,0:06:39.870
is now

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.330
0:06:39.870,0:06:43.979
I've got my snap.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.490
0:06:43.979,0:06:47.279
That's all there is to using the

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.010
Crystal Applicator tool.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.050
0:06:47.279,0:06:51.479
This is a great way to expand design

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.310
possibilities for both jewelry, clothing

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.310
0:06:51.479,0:06:51.960
and home depot.
