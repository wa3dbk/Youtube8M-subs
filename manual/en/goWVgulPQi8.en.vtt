00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.949
Hi i'm Kim Stones General Manager
network infrastructure the network

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:05.400
infrastructure divisions

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.470
main role is looking after the
infrastructure that services Perths

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.300
train systems. So obviously the stations, the associated car parks

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.190
The rail line the trains run on, the power system and so forth

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.000
so its a big job with 250 of us working on that.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.580
The car parking at stations is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.840
certainly a very important part of our
transport systems, i mean we all know Perth's

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.900
a fairly spoiled city, we all love our cars. We're used to being able to drive wherever we want to go to so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.860
there's hugely increasing demand for parking at the stations and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.750
I know in the last several years we were putting in place additional carparks

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.469
Particularly on the Joondalup and Mandurah lines. We've built over 4.5 thousand bays over the last 3-4 years.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.600
We're also putting additional bays on the old lines.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.000
Mostly the Midland, Armadale and Fremantle lines, and within

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.320
the next year so we'll have built nearly 1 thousand there.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.590
While we've been able to build a lot of additional car parking bays in recent years,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.540
we will put more in the coming years.
Unfortunate there is a limit

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.990
to the amount land available for carparking. So there isn't an endless

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.790
supply that we will be able to provide to people. So its important that people understand

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.300
that as well as the option to driving to the stations and parking then catching the trains

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.840
Its important that they avail themselves other options

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.530
which is using for the feeder bus service that feed a number of our stations

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.600
but also to cycle, so we do have a program in place

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.090
where we have built secure bike shelters at our stations

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.880
and we are looking at the surrounding
infrastructure of the stations making sure

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.250
its safe and easy for people to cycle to the station

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.140
so along the term, very sustainable transport modes

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.600
very very important in terms of the development of Perth

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.119
as the population continues to grow very rapidly

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.210
and the demand for a public transport system continues to also grow

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.830
very very rapidly

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.100
for almost 70% of the year. So those are very important element of the total footprint of public transport.
