00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.230
Closure is a game that is not afraid of trying
something different, and different is a great

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.960
way to describe this.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.089
The game is so unlike anything else while
still feeling comfortable.

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:47.070
It is a puzzle game that has many elements
of platformers as well.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.049
The main component to the game is light.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.739
It is the most important aspect to solving
the puzzles.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.850
You play as some unexplained creature whose
only goal is to make it to the door at the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.850
end of the level.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.800
There are different worlds, each transforming
you into something different.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.330
There is no story, just the gameplay itself.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.970
The world is surrounded in darkness and you
need navigate through to the end.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.710
This is where the light aspect comes in.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.890
The world actually does not exist outside
of your light, so you need to keep your path

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.159
illuminated.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.270
You can do this by either adjusting light
bulbs to shine a path, or carrying a glowing

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.810
orb with you.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.351
You will swim and jump, find keys, place your
light on rails, and eliminate obstacles, all

00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:36.280
to make to the door.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.050
The game teaches its gameplay with a brilliant
tutorial without any words, then throws you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.740
into the darkness.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.439
The levels are incredibly challenging.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.890
If you drop your key into the darkness, it’s
gone.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.770
If you stray to far into the darkness, you’re
gone.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.950
All this leads to many deaths and failures.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.039
There is even an instant restart button that
you will become very familiar with.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.240
The puzzles are complicated and constantly
evolving and forcing you to learn new things.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.390
It is difficult but also rewarding, with each
death feeling like your mistake and each success

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.610
being your triumph.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.030
And it is also an unsettling world.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.520
The dark esthetics create an eerie mood that
will have you fearing the darkness.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.590
You don’t know what lies ahead of you, making
you move more cautiously and carefully.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.700
You are alone in this dark world, and this
is echoed with the game’s silence.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.959
The only sounds you will hear is the ambient
soundtrack, sound effects and your own footsteps.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.640
Everything is left for you to figure out.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.110
And the game’s black and white style makes
the darkness all the more intimidating.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.650
It all fits together perfectly to provide
an experience unlike anything else.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.959
This is one of the best games for the PSN
and also one of the most unique.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.000
It takes the old universal conflicts of black
vs white, light vs dark, to create a puzzle

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.680
game that is both challenging and rewarding.
