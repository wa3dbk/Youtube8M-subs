Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen., for Vanveenbulbs.com,
and in this series we're learning all about

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.870
how to plant bulbs in containers. And in this
segment, we'll talk about how to use recycled

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.580
materials in your containers to save space
and the environment. So I have found that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.830
a lot of the items that we recycle are live
items that we throw away. There's lots of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.690
other uses for them. And they say the number
one item right now that they're using in landfills,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.840
or that item is ending up in landfills is
these plastic water bottles. And I know they're

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.120
leak the plastic, and they're not supposed
to be that healthy to drink from, especially

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.360
when they get hot. But when you're at garden
centers, or garden shows, or you're on the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.010
road, we all end up drinking them, because
that's the only thing that's available to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.310
us. So there are other options. You can always
bring your water with you, or bring ice and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.260
let it melt, but in the end, these are have
become part of our life. So why not put them

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.290
in the bottom of your containers, just to
give some air, cause' you're not going to

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.500
use the whole container anyway for your soil
and everything, and the key is good drainage

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.950
in containers. So good juices, just put them
on the bottom. So I've just put a few items

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.719
in the bottom of my container, and it seems
to work for me really well, because it's lighter;

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.180
makes my pot much lighter, and the bulbs are
not going to sit right in water, because the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.289
water's going to go underneath and drain out,
and it'll always be dry on the bottom. And

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.280
whenever you're raking up your leaves or grass
clippings, or you're trimming down your trees,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.590
and you've got bits of wood and branches,
that's like the ultimate material for the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.969
bottom of your containers, cause' it's great
drainage, and it's great for the roots to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.219
have that air. In nature that's how they grow.
So I always put a lot a layer of that over

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:55.630
my bottles.
So my goal is to use all these recycled materials,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.289
cause' really, the roots can even grow into
that. But I want good soil on the top. So

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.740
it's really easy to use recycled materials
in the bottom of your containers. You can

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.450
use moss, you can use sticks, you can use
stones, you can use gravel, you can use metal.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.830
You can use pretty much anything that is garbage,
that can drain well, and it's a great way

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.780
to recycle. Next, we'll talk about how to
select the soil for your planters.
