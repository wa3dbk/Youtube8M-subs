00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.509
i have a younger

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.339
brother that whose handicapped with cerebral palsy 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.700
he was three years younger than me and so

00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:18.400
i had to help

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.500
take care of him

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.700
He was totally handicapped, so I would have to pick him up and bathe him

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.100
take care of his personal needs
and dress him and things like that so at a young

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.500
age probably in my early teens

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.300
i was doing a lot of lifting and then
as I

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.300
got older i did have a couple
accidents

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.900
work related accidents

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.200
taking a fall

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.500
and then it was just a chronic problem, from

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.700
my early twenties until

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.800
 last year

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.400
and um... so i was restricted and
towards the end it got

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.500
to get to where i could work anymore

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.000
I had been to every type of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.800
professional you could think of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.200
neurosurgeons orthopedic surgeons

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.800
uh... chiropractors--I had done it all

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800
and nothing seemed to help

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.000
The neurosurgeons told me that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.900
just to live with it untili couldn't
move anymore

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.900
they would have to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.400
operate and it would take over a year to
recover

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.900
uh... There is a fifty-fifty chance that it would
be successful

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.100
i start searching and my own and i'd ran
into an associate that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.100
Laser Spine Institute-- from the time i
came in for my consultation to the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.200
surgery itself but even the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.800
the doctor and the anesthesiologist
everyone in the whole facility

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.600
paid attention they ask questions they
listened to the uh...

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.500
explained what they were going to do

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.770
it was very very different experiences
then

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.070
the past

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.120
came in at six am for

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.400
for pre-op

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.230
and uh...

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.300
about fifteen minutes before I was to go
into surgery the anesthesiologist came out

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.720
explained exactly what he was going to do

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.000
and uh... and then the doctor came in and did the same thing which

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.200
i was quite surprised that they have

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:13.100
he sat down and explain the procedure
here's my plan to do here's what's wrong

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.800
and here is how we are gonna address it

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.229
and um...

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:18.900
went into surgery at seven and i woke
up

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.400
i can i just couldn't believe it because i
felt no pain-- very first time in

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:26.100
i can't even remember when i had felt
absolutely

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:27.200
i thought i was dreaming

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:32.200
but what it surprised me the most was
everyone around me that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.600
that i deal with on a day-to-day basis

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.700
they were they were just amazed

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.800
my change in attitude i mean i
actually had people tell me

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.300
they were afraid to approach me a lot
of times i just thought as a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.339
mean old man

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.400
that I wasn't very happy i was always in
pain i was always you know it just

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.300
looked like i was upset all the time

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.700
they said we can't believe your change in
attitude just you look happy and smile

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.800
i couldn't stop smiling for two weeks
after the procedure

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.500
i'd never been that free of pain in

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.900
my adult life i'm back to

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.600
doing what i want to do

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:09.400
it's changed my life

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.900
so we are

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.349
living a normal

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.800
active life
