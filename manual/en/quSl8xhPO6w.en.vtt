00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.820
scientists have discovered the world's
first hybrid shark and they found the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.309
shark um... gain uh... right off
australia

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.969
and sad basically is the australian
black tip shark that's meeting with the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.320
content black said

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.570
the australian of lactic shark who lives
in warmer waters the common black tip

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.940
lives in cooler waters so outside sister
thinking that there may be in order to

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.540
reproduced anzac create other little
sharks mac can live in colder

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.000
temperatures starting to get on a by so
this would happen is australia

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.450
collective short

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.160
uh... is in waters that are much colder
this post and the like

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.980
what people know that many let me jump
in there right

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.110
it turns out the has developed right

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.230
your xin will qualify sleep

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.510
and involved because starr

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.590
possibly

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.070
global warming big because uh... the
temperatures are are fluctuating

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.400
uh... if the water and so it's actually
climate change dummies that stage now

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.370
though

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.989
uh... australia blackett as looking for
the water sodas mutated so that it is

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.400
living in the cold war which i think
it's like because they have amid climate

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.170
change part of socks outstanding right
not buy it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.960
evolution that deadbeat

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.509
i'll just think that for the first time
liberal she has been quite about climate

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.110
change

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.820
because all he's doing in a doctorate in
evolved and everything's gonna be a the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.840
produce if we give all will no longer be
cubans

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.700
the state

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.009
anyway by the user different way we
might have six arms a three i thought

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.220
that that uh... at i dot that's the way
it's going to go directly to talk about

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.290
evolution look at you can begin to see
the facts throughout the world of but

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.810
at what i love but that was the stories

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.990
is that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.010
the people who did i haven't

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.270
so but week it's just part of the chart
we just saw say they were documented as

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.390
we speak great disorder you see this is
where they are now they have so new

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.460
hybrid version

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.870
would you know what got probably decided

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.080
for a hybrid version of the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.820
uh... the australia collective shock so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.079
so that you have a problem or probe make
it happen

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.679
its enemies that we got their third
parties

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.169
dot was a mood to create a hybrid
version of it

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.339
by twenty point out a couple other
things about the strike cell are with

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.770
the sciences that was that twenty
percent

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.420
uh... of the black tip population in
this particular area right off of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.389
australia

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.099
uh... are at the hybrid charts right so
right now they're trying to figure out

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.749
whether or not this is something that
has occurred recently or if it happens

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:33.989
for a while

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.569
and they've just discovered it now ok
and they're not concluding that this is

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.950
because of evolution this is because of
climate change of a slut yet so and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.810
there are no definitive answers yet but
i'd me i think it does make sense

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.450
especially since the sharks the hybrid
chart is better suited to live in colder

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.699
temperatures

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:58.279
wed there's a hybrid shortcake review of
all he said it either

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:05.279
enya so there's a lot so your i received
the forties so that county it

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:09.429
power

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.529
dot all the sharks certainly should be
done

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:19.120
through the entire figure everything to
deserve the warm meal

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.230
the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.540
but i don't ever hit a rock
president-elect it's fair for the use of

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.229
five inches definitely evolution

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.889
the same on this is possible given the
circumstances out the waves and works

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.379
report though now

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.889
nominated is one of our own son
destructive live

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.449
involved

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.129
netvision happens is the archive

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.159
and the ones inspection station harry
for actors

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.250
so if it was worth it bob that would be
that

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.770
we would all die

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.029
the ones that you didn't have a sense of
arms are baby had

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:55.959
more there

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.629
arab ever can survive

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.189
warmer or colder temperatures depending
on how the crime scene

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.579
happened that new species would serve
and
