00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.140
Hey fitfam!

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.130
Now if you're like me, eating pizza is something
that cannot be avoided

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.240
It's one of my all time favorite foods!

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.330
But, it's not the healthiest choice

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.110
Now many people think that cheese is the nutritional
sinner of pizza

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.310
But really, the great protein and fat that
cheese has to offer, far outweighs the negatives

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.680
of the refined, carb-laden crust!

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.450
Now by carb I mean "Carbohydrate"

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.660
One slice of pizza can rack up a whopping
30 grams of carbs!

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.180
That's like two to three slices of bread,
or almost a full serving of pasta

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.100
And who only eats ONE SLICE OF PIZZA?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.100
Not me.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.780
But what do we as pizza lovers do about this
carbohydrate conundrum?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.830
How about cauliflower!

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.200
I know!

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.160
I'm gonna show you my completely gluten free,
guilt free cauliflower pizza crust.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.400
It has a serving of vegetables, and only two
grams of carbs per slice

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.510
2 grams!

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.640
Let me show ya!

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.670
For my cauliflower crust recipe, start by
blending your florets in a food processor.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.939
Once blended, steam in a microwave for 7-8
minutes, stirring once about halfway through.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.630
Allow to cool.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.179
Once steamed, place your cauliflower rice
into the center of

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.040
some cheesecloth or an old dish towel.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.139
Make sure to use an old one you don't care
about.

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:37.280
Create a ball with the rice inside of the
cloth and ring out the water until it stops

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.459
coming out.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.799
This is the most important step to getting
a solid crust that does not fall apart.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.259
Make sure your cauliflower is as dry as possible

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.149
Transfer to a bowl and add an egg, parmesan,
mozzarella, garlic, and salt and pep.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.819
Mix to combine.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:03.859
Spread your dough out on a pan lined with
parchment paper and sprayed

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.990
Place in an oven preheated to 400 degrees
fahrenheit and bake for about 10 minutes,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.620
until firm and cooked through.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.790
Remove from the oven, place on your toppings
of choice, and return to the oven for another

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.280
5-7 minutes until the cheese is nice and melted

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280
So WHY do we want to get rid of the carbs
in our pizza crust?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.170
What's so bad about them anyways?

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.760
Well actually, they're not all bad.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.410
We NEED carbs as a part of a healthy, balanced
diet, as they are an essential macronutrient.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.040
However, it all depends on where those carbs
come from.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.140
GOOD, or "unrefined" carbs, are the kind you
get from eating whole grains, fruits, and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.560
vegetables, are great for keeping you full
longer

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.820
AND they help you maintain healthy blood sugar
levels.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.800
BAD carbs, the kind you get from processed
and refined grains such as white bread and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800
sugar

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.040
Are stripped of most all benefits that good
carbs provide us with.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.250
Instead of helping maintain a healthy blood
sugar, these bad carbs make our blood sugar

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.260
spike!

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.350
These carbs are also stored in our fat cells
as triglycerides, which in turn, make us fat.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.090
Remember, eating FAT doesn't make you fat...

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.590
Eating too many BAD CARBS make you fat!

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.530
And there you have it, delicious, nutritious
pizza, with only a tiny fraction of the carbs

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.960
you'd find in a normal slice.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.700
