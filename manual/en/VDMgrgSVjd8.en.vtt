Greetings fellow nerds

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:12.360
Three years ago I showed a demonstration called ghost metal where I got copper metal to exhibit a ghostly glow when dipped into a solution of luminol.

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:20.188
While it did work one of the big problems was that as the copper dissolved eventually the whole solution would glow instead of just on the metal.

00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:25.554
Additionally, it didn’t last very long and it would run out in just a few minutes of use.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:31.043
I’ve now developed a new solution that only glows near the metal and lasts much longer, up to half an hour.

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:38.470
To make this solution we start with 100 mL of a 5% ammonia solution, the exact concentration is not critical.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:44.252
To this we add 100 mg of 3-aminophthalhydrazide, better known as luminol.

00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:53.696
Now we add a new ingredient, 300 mg of disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, also known as disodium EDTA.

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.037
Shake or stir the mixture until completely dissolved.

00:00:57.072 --> 00:01:01.917
Then add 10 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide.

00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:05.628
Once everything is mixed, we dilute this into 900 mL of water.

00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:11.367
I’m making this much for the video, but this is a lot and you can scale down for smaller demonstrations.

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:15.193
Now for the actual ghost metal chemistry trick.

00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:20.447
Pour out a small quantity of the solution and get a piece of copper, in this case I’m using a penny.

00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:24.838
Turn off the lights and drop the penny in. It should exhibit a ghostly glow.

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:28.979
What’s happening is the hydrogen peroxide and ammonia dissolve a tiny amount of copper. 

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:34.446
The copper ions go on to catalyze the reaction of hydrogen peroxide and luminol to create this eerie blue glow.

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:37.408
It’s actually the solution around the copper that’s glowing.

00:01:37.443 --> 00:01:43.598
Now in the original version the whole solution would start glowing after a few minutes as the copper ions mixed throughout.

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:50.374
To stop this we added disodium EDTA which complexes with the copper ions and prevents them from catalyzing the reaction with luminol.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:59.934
It still works near the metal since the concentration of copper ions exceed the concentration of EDTA, but as they diffuse away the EDTA takes over and complexes them.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.742
The result is a solution that glows only near the metal.

00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:08.503
Now a fun trick to do is to pour some solution in a wide container and shape some copper wire into some words.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:12.975
Since it’s near halloween as I make this video I’ll go with something suiting the occasion.

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:19.294
And there we go.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.647
If you stir it up, it will brighten initially as copper is dissolved.

00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:28.043
But after a few moments it’ll die down again as the EDTA complexes with the excess.

00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:35.183
As for longevity, with enough solution this will glow for half an hour so. Considerably longer than the few minutes of the original version.

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:40.463
Anyway, there you have it, the improved version of the ghost metal chemistry trick.

00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:42.018
Thanks for watching.
