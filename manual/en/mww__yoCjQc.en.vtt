Hi! I’m Lisa Krone and I am here with Best
Epicurean on behalf of expervillage.com and

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.660
today we are going to talk about helping your
child set the table. The first thing we are

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.320
going to start with is place mats. We are
setting the table for four today and I like

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.510
to use place mats; something like a bamboo
because they can hold hot foods. My assistant

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.060
here is my daughter Kyle and she has been
helping me set the table since she was very

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.290
small. After the place mats, I am going to
give Kyle the plates. Now if you have little

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.480
ones, I always have paper plates and paper
bowls handy so that the little ones can help

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.730
because there is no reason they can’t start
this at a very young age. We are having soup

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.660
today so I have included the bowls. I like
to use different colors because they contrast

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.320
each other and it makes it look kind of eclectic.
It’s nice if you have stuff that matches

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.730
and that is always fun but I like to make
things a little bit funky; I think our guests

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.750
enjoy it. The first item I am going to give
Kyle to set is the knife. The knife goes on

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.500
the left side of the plates, followed by that
since we are eating soup, I’ve included

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.619
soup spoons. People usually like to be able
to grab all the nice vegetables and whatever

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.030
you put with it and it is important that and
we are just going to show you, we are going

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.061
to flip it so that the end of the knife is
headed to the left. The next thing you are

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:40.100
going to do is when you are putting the soup
spoons down which will go to the left of the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.369
knife. You can fix any of those knives and
you also want to include teaspoons; there

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.700
could be some apple sauce tonight with dinner
so I have to include the teaspoons. These

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.180
go to the left of the soup spoon. I also sometimes
like to make my utensils a little eclectic

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.200
as well. It makes it kind of interesting.
Also, you are going to want to start with

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.260
salad forks or these can also double as desert
forks and you have regular forks for regular

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.710
food. So Kyle, these will go the right of
the plates

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:27.360
and then she is going to lay the desert and
or salad fork to the right of the fork. For

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.030
tonight’s purposes because I know we are
having a young person coming for dinner, we

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.550
are going to use plastic cups and if you want
to, always have with you a permanent marker

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.820
and make sure you write the name of the individual
because the cups all look the same and that

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.460
is how you help your kids set a table.
