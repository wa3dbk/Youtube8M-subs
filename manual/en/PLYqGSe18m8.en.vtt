- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE HOLIDAYS--

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.266
I DON'T KNOW,

MORE AND MORE COMMERCIAL
EVERY YEAR, RIGHT?

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.266
DON'T YOU FEEL THAT?

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.066
LET'S NOT FORGET
WHAT THEY REALLY ARE ABOUT.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.800
LET'S FOCUS ON BEING TOGETHER
WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.566
GATHERED AROUND
A CHRISTMAS TREE.

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.933
AND, REMINDS ME,

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:19.066

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.100

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.233
I MEAN, IT'LL BREAK.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.666
YOU CAN BATHE IT,
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.666
[laughter]

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.866
THERE. COME ON.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:01:59.933

00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.300
AND THEN SHE GETS A TOY,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.933
SO THAT'S GREAT.

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.933
[applause]

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:14.866
ARI, THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU HOLD A BABY.

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.633
SOMEONE HOLD THE BABY
OTHER THAN ARI.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:19.400
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.533
OH. THAT'S A CUTE BABY.
BRING THAT ONE TO ME.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:23.000
THAT'S A CUTE ONE.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.466
LATER SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
SAYING,

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:26.166
"IT'S CHRISTMAS;
BABY, PLEASE COME HOME,"

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.600
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE
TRACK NUMBER ONE

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.300
ON MY HOLIDAY CD,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.600
