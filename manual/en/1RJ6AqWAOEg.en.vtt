00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:12.080
[music playing]

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.090
[music playing]

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.160
[Narrator]: In 2008, the world experienced what has been referred to as a perfect storm of both

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.180
natural and human events.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.210
Droughts in grain producing nations, increased demand for meat,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.240
the lowest reserve of food stocks on record, and rising fuel prices

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.280
led to what is referred to as the 2008 global food crisis.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.280
In the United States, the results were $4.00 per gallon gasoline and higher costs

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.300
for food staples. In some regions of the world, people saw their cost of food double

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.310
or even triple.  How did a world so rich with food end up with such a vast problem?

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.330
To uncover the answers, it pays to step back - far back - and get a global perspective.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:08.360
NASA satellites, monitoring our planet from space, are in the perfect place to help us see

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.370
the global picture.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.380
Agriculture, the process of growing food and fuel, is usually far more complex

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
then simply growing something and getting it to market.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.420
[Brad Doorn]: Because it's an integrated system now and we have to tie markets, economies,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.430
food aid, political issues, and yes, making sure we have a stable economy

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.450
and we have enough food to eat here.  All those things tied together require

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.480
us to have a very good system of being able to monitor crops and food supply.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.510
[Molly Brown]:  When you bring together all the actors, the people in the local communities,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.540
the national government, the international actors, all the NGOs

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.570
and you bring them into a room, the thing that everyone can really agree on the most

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.590
is the remote sensing derived production information.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.620
[Narrator]:  One of the best ways to gauge world food production at any given time

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.650
is to monitor from space literally how green food-producing regions are.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.670
By looking at the greenness of a particular area, scientists are able to tell how much

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.690
photosynthesis is occurring.  Therefore, providing an indicator of how lucrative the harvest will be.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.720
[Molly Brown]:  If you look at the terabytes of data that come out of the sky every day,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.720
the most commonly used index is the vegetation index.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.740
[Narrator]:  This index, developed in the late 1970s by Dr. Compton Tucker and his team at

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.750
the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.750
[Compton Tucker]: When you have these data you are also able to look at where you have

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.780
better conditions for plant growth and worse conditions, and this is where these data

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.800
become really useful to look at agricultural production

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.810
and agricultural shortfalls, because you have this history over many years

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.820
And you know these were good years, these were bad years; the present year is somewhere

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.820
in between, so on and so forth.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.830
[Molly Brown]:  It's a really interesting indicator because it lets us see the health and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.840
the productivity of plants at a wide variety of scales.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.850
[Brad Doorn]: What it does, is it opens up to all those decision makers who have to make

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.850
decisions about their crops now, they can be now serviced a lot better

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.860
with this new real time system.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.880
[Narrator]: But NASA looks at more than just how green our planet is day-to-day.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.890
In the remaining five episodes of this video series,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.910
we will examine, in depth, how remote sensing satellite data gives us a clearer picture

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.930
of how our fragile natural resources, such as rainforests, are being affected by changing

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.940
agricultural practices.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.950
How communities, facing disaster, famine or human strife may be able to get access to food,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.970
how precious water resources are being used around the world,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.990
and even how our changing climate might alter the future of food in the wake of the recent crisis.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.000
By using satellites to better understand how agriculture works today,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.020
we are better prepared to face the challenges of climate change and increasing population sizes

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:49.000
to ensure the world has food on the table tomorrow.
