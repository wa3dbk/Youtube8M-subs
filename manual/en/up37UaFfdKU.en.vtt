00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.910
Hey, what's going on?
You know, the HP Mini-Note Series

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.650
has become very, very popular.
And this is the HP Mini-Note 2140,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.050
and I'll tell you what, 
if T-Pain was to have a netbook,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.490
this is the netbook T-Pain 
would buy. You know why?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.090
'Cuz it's loaded 
with everything.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.700
HP2140 with an Atom N270
1.6 GHz.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.550
It's got 2 GB of DDR2 RAM.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.670
So, you're already doubling
or quadrupling

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.220
what many of the netbooks 
 have for stock RAM.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.010
160 GB hard drive.
It has a, b, g, and n wireless.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.380
So, we're already 
doing better, again.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.250
Because usually you're only 
finding up to g wireless

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.580
 on a lot of the netbooks 
out there.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.850
It's got Bluetooth. 
It's got a 1024 x 600 monitor,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.420
that looks really, 
really awesome.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160
And, it actually has
 expansion ports, as well.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.890
Which is one of those 
things you don't  find

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.190
on very many netbooks 
out there at all.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.130
So, let me go ahead and
 show you around this thing.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.670
We have a webcam right 
up here, at the top.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.470
Very, very nice, glossy screen.
 Nice size keyboard.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.040
Because of the 10'' screen,
you're gonna find a might,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.180
slightly larger keyboard
 on this thing

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.480
that's gonna make it much, 
much easier for typing.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350
Down here at the bottom you see
 that it does have a button

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.120
for enabling and disabling 
the track pad.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.920
You've got a nice, wide, 
track pod, 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.490
track pad, with a scroll zone.
And you're going to find

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.730
 your left and right mouse buttons 
flanking the track pad

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.670
on this particular netbook.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.130
Now, up on the front of this thing, 
you're gonna find two power switches.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.400
One being for your WiFi,
one being for the power on the netbook.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.960
Over on the side you're
 going to find a USB port,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.300
as well as your headphone 
and microphone

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.940
and VGA port,
over on this side.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.350
Over on the other side,
you're going to find your power port,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.500
your Ethernet,  your USB, 
an SD card slot reader, right here.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.420
And right above that,
an Express 54 slot.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.450
So you're going to be able 
to use any Express card

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.400
with this little netbook.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.290
And so, the few things 
that set this apart

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.760
make it very, very cool.
T-Pain worthy, I call it.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.130
It's got a nice, 
big 10'' screen.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.900
It's got Windows Vista 
on board.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.180
2 GB of RAM,
and a lot more hardrive space

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.150
than you find even on 
a lot full size notebooks 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.410
that are out 
on the market.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.910
So, this is definitely hefty
for a netbook,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.510
and it still only weighs less than
2.5 lbs. for all of that.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.520
For what is almost a full fledged
PC laptop in a very, very small package.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.530
It's the HP
Mini-Note 2140.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.600
