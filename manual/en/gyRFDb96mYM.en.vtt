00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.930
Hello.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.680
I’m Dr. Serene Lim.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.990
I’m a cosmetic and complementary GP and
today, I want to show you some facial and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.810
neck massages that are so useful.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.200
What it does is it can actually lift the eyebrows
and it can lift your face.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200
Use some oil.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.200
It doesn’t have to be too greasy.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.730
I like coconut oil.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.260
It’s great for removing make-up.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.969
It’s also great for eating because it’s
got medium chain fatty acids that only give

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.260
you energy but doesn’t put fat on.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.659
Get cold pressed organic oil and you can’t
go wrong.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.979
If we do the right eye, use your left hand.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:54.739
Go over the eye like this and then up.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:03.289
This is particularly good for puffy eyes and
even if you’ve had an eye lift or blepharoplasty,

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.750
this will make the swelling go down.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:22.220
The next movement is below the eyes and above,
right side, left hand and up.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.400
If you’re Chinese and you have a bit of
a flatter face, you can do it all in one.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.610
Just use the palm of your hand, press on it
and up.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.530
Press on it and up, always upward so it lifts.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.450
The lower side of your face will also be lifted
this way.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:55.970
First of all, move the lymphatics up and then
sweep it away.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.491
Grab hold of your cheeks and pinch.

00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:17.180
This helps to give you a sleeker jawline then
the sides of your face, just go up and tiny

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:26.500
flicks then use the fingers and just around
the hairline.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.230
This feels so good.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.459
Finally, give your ears a tug.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.889
You earlobes have more than 200 acupuncture
points so if you massage it, press on it,

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:48.340
you’re going to hit something that will
be useful.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.340
