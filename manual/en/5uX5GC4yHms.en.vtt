your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today
we're going to learn another pachadi

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.710
which I learned when I travelled to Kerala
when i asked them what do they call this

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
pachadi we are in Kannur and we call it
Kannur pachadi so it lets learn how to

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.030
make this Kannur style tomato pachadi, when we make this yogurt raita in north

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.340
they do not temper their pachadis that
is the yogurt based chutneys but in south

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.100
india especially in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka
Kerala they usually temper the yogurt

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.450
chutney or what we call pachadi so we're going to temper this pachadi

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.850
today for making this we're going to
take coconut just half a coconut should

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.280
be good enough and take one tablespoon of mustard seeds then we're going to make a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.080
paste of this and then we'll make a nice
pachadi, here is the paste from the blender

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.650
and wow wow wow wow you know it already smells so good in this add salt, chopped

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.229
green chillies, chili powder, chopped
coriander, chopped tomatoes you know this

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.990
is a yogurt and tomato pachadi so we're going to add lot of tomatoes and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.670
mix all of this together now after you
mix all of this whisk yogurt nicely and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.290
then just mix in this and just check the
seasoning perfect

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.590
Wow but this is not complete without
the tempering, so let's go ahead and do the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.899
tempering for this, for this tempering
i'm going to use coconut oil in which

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.490
we're going to add some red chilies and
when the oil is hot enough

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:09.119
add mustard seeds, in this add hing and move a little far away and add curry leaves

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.810

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.690
wow you know you can add little extra oil and that will make it even more tasty and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:48.959
now hahaha wow wow wow you know so many flavors you know this kind of Kannur style of

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.040
pachadi can be had with roti, naan or
even biryanis or pulaos but what I

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.360
like the most

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.940
just eat it with just plain rice because this is so flavorful, dear friends just

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.260
take it

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.830
eat with just white rice along with papad and it would be amazing if you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.290
eat it right away after you make it

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.660
it is nice and flavorful but rest it for half an hour that's when this mustard

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.510
flavors will get infused and it'll be tasting 
even more awesome, dear friends I hope you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.010
