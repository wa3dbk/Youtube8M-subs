00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.550
 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.920
lately the growing segment of
entry-level luxury sedans in the United

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.180
States has become just that sedans Audi finally got with the program here on

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.410
the redesigned a3 which drops its
predecessors hatchback only body style

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.250
for five seats for doors and an ordinary
trunk which you see behind me here

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.759
there will also be a convertible and a
hatchback version of the new a3 along

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.800
with a higher performance s3 we have the
a3 here it's got a very classy styling

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.399
outside and it should aged pretty well
it's also got gutsy turbocharged engines

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.489
but we aren't sold on every aspect and
we'll show you why

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.260
III really doesn't break any new styling
ground pretty classic traditional audi

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.109
lines here with a large upper and lower
grille that are kind of fused together

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.620
into the same sort of mouth here looks a
little bit like a squash day for

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.500
actually the wheelbase is a little bit
smaller than the current a four

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.100
but overall dimensions are actually very
similar to the first day for that showed

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.570
up in the nineteen nineties

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.019
the interior has a very simple aesthetic
very gently sloping dashboard goes

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.400
toward the windshield

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.280
there's a screen here that rises out of
the center part of the dashboard

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.940
actually pretty slick operation right
here and it houses all your multimedia

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.900
settings a obviously the navigation
system if you get that it all works

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.890
throughout these MMI system which
actually has this touchpad atop the MMI

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.910
knob down here you can use that to do
things like scrolling the map fairly

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.810
intuitive set up overall cabin materials
obviously a big battle ground in terms

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.790
of entry-level luxury cars

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.050
he ate three has some nice touches here
a very consistent grading here along the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.710
dash and the doors could use a little
more padding here along the upper doors

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.740
where your arms your elbows are kind of
kind of rest but you know fabric down

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.190
the a-pillar nice touches like that all
the way down the B and the c-pillars as

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.490
well overall space obviously something
you're going to think about when you're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.850
looking at small small kind of
entry-level luxury cars a little bit

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.900
more cabin volume here then in the
mercedes CLA class one of the a-threes

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.990
top competitors bedroom overhead is
decent

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.050
there's a standard sunroof yeah it's
pretty big but it does take away some

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.120
Headroom in our test car here

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.380
I'm six feet tall and ice it definitely
a number of inches ahead of the seat

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.610
being all the way back so exceptional
driver's seat adjustment range here in

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.990
the a 3 standard features an interesting
mix here now leather seats are standard

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.460
so is this sunroof

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.340
those are typically features that you
often have to pay extra for even

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.080
entry-level luxury cars

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.770
although things that are card doesn't
have automatic climate control push

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.430
button start a backup camera and a power
passenger seat those are all features

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.060
that you can get in cars at actually a
lot less money so kind of an interesting

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.990
mix there

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.920
let's take a look at the back seat
legroom in the back seat is actually ok

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.040
that's where I'd sit to drive the seat
is a little bit low to the ground and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.730
there isn't any payoff in terms of
headroom because it's just really tight

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.240
here and for what it's worth this is a
similarity between the a3 and the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.170
cla-class the a3 family has a range of
engines including a diesel engine into

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.040
turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline
engines we have the base gasoline engine

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.540
1.8 liters hundred seven horsepower 200
pound feet of torque enough power here

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.710
but it's not a very smooth situation
both in terms of going and stopping

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.070
there's some turbo lag there's some
transmission lag there's even some

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.820
accelerator like they all kind of come
together to make the car not very quick

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.810
when you need to immediately get around
other cars breaking - it's kind of an

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.620
on-again off-again sort of binary
position you're in here again not the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.110
most linear experience coming down now

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.770
ride quality editors were a little bit
split over some thought that it was a

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.670
very good actually other stuff but it
was kind of too firm and a little bit

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.989
brittle over certain bumps

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.830
I'm kind of in between there but i think
the real reason that the a3 is not

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.340
particularly fun drive has to do with
the steering lots and lots of power

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.550
assisted steering it doesn't have a lot
of feedback its kind of Numb

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.910
there's an optional audi drive select
system that can firm it up a little bit

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.620
more miles back to the power 6 but
overall still not a very fun car now

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.700
there is with Quattro all-wheel drive a
2-liter turbo four-cylinder some of our

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.290
editors have driven that that makes 220
horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.709
by the numbers it makes this little a 3
a pretty quick machine

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.940
the a3 like the cla-class has a little
bit more refinement and sophistication

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.540
than competitors like the acura ILX in
the buick verano to sort of bargain

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.900
priced entries in this segment but you
also pay for it

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.720
pricing starts right around thirty one
thousand dollars for the a3 goes well

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.500
into the 40s

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.560
you add up all the options so there's
definitely a price premium for these

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.700
German cars

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.350
does that make us necessarily want one
mm maybe but we really like to see how d

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.530
smooth out the driving experience both
in terms of acceleration and braking

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.120
also how he needs to make a backup
camera standard already not optional

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.210
fortunately these are things that brand
could fix in the next model year or two

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.210
so we'll have to see what happens

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.190
I

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.450
yeah
