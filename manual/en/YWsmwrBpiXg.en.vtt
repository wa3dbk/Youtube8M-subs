Hello, Iâ€™m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:09.360
[pause]

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.740
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.230
Unprotected sun exposure creates two distinct
types of damage in the skin.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.560
First, it harmlessly breaks things, and second,
it dangerously makes parts

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.880
of the skin sick, and ultimately, these two
types of sun damage are

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.369
related.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.410
The first type, just breaking the skin, is
unattractive, but is completely

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.520
harmless and called "Photo Aging." When the
sun breaks collagen you get

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.940
wrinkles. When the sun breaks elastic tissue
you get sagging skin or even

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.660
jowls. When the sun breaks the melanocytes
(which are the pigment cells)

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.190
you get brown spots or brown blotches. And
when it breaks blood vessels,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.489
you get broken capillaries, spider veins or
red blotches. Again all of

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.809
these are harmless just unattractive.

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.769
But more importantly, when the sun makes your
skin sick then it causes

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.679
cancer. It does this by making the cells in
the upper layer of the skin

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:14.190
(the epidermis) sick. When it makes Basal
cells sick it causes Basal cell

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.539
cancer, the most common form of cancer in
the world. When it makes the

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.829
middle cells (squamous cells) sick, first
you get a precancerous condition

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.369
called Actinic Keratosis and in time that
Actinic Keratosis will go on to

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.591
be a Squamous Cell cancer. Lastly, when it
makes the melanocytes (the

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.969
pigment cells) sick, you develop deadly Melanoma.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.679
I know one thing is for sure: people who have
more broken things from the

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.459
sun get more sick things from the sun. So,
on behalf of your skin, to

00:01:46.459 --> 00:02:02.799
prevent broken skin and more importantly sick
skin, please use sunscreen.
