This is our machine aluminum case.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.120
And it has 3 components.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.040
It has the bottom polycarbonate piece,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.100
It has the top piece which is machined and anodized out of 60/61 T6 Aluminum.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.580
And it also, includes, and I'll show you how to install now.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.680
You can take your iPhone 4 or 4s and what you do first, is you install the bottom

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.460
Make sure it snaps all the way in place,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.280
then properly align the phone with the case and make sure it's properly line, this is an aluminum case.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.720
Slide it together, and then you can simply snap in place

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.720
To remove this case is little different, what you do is prop hold, just the plastic piece

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.520
and slide the aluminum off the phone.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.180
Plastic will remain with the phone.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.540
So you remove it as such.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.500
We're going to show you how to install the included lanyard, what you want to do,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.740
is have the phone out of the case, slide it through the upper hole.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.060
Then go through the lower.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.740
Insert the large end of the lanyard through that loop.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.060
And pull it tight .

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.740
