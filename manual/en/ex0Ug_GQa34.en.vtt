00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.320
I have unhealthy addictions and they stay
on my bed because I can't help myself.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
So yeah...

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.560
Well anyways, some of you guys may have noticed
from my giveaway video that I went ahead and

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.580
shaved my sides like a month and a half ago.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.750
And.. when I first did that, I didn't shave
it like extremely short.. there might be a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.460
photo for you guys to see.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.840
I shaved it and I was like, "Okay, I like
it."

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.330
But I guess I was just scared of having it
being too short and seeing my scalp so that's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.080
basically what I went with.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.030
But then I was like "Oh my gosh, that's just
too much hair" so I shaved it a little bit

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.070
myself.. with a razor blade because I don't
own clippers.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:16.250
But anyways, when I got sick two weeks ago,
I actually intended on shaving it and getting

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.250
patterns.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.730
Actually, the first day I got it shaved I
wanted to get patterns done but at the time,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.409
I didn't go to a barber, I went to a hairdresser
and I was just a little under...

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.320
I was just trying to get over the fact that
I had just saved my side because it was kind

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.340
of a big deal to me this time around.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.834
Two weeks ago when I got sick, I decided I
wanted to get my patterns done which I never

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:40.040
got to do the first time around, but then
I got sick.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:49.200
So I got out of the hospital Tuesday and I
decided today that I should just go to the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.820
hairdresser because I was feeling a little
better and get what I originally wanted done.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.060
So I told her, I wanted her to shave my head
more..

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.940
Like, give me a shape up and then, do some
zig zags.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.030
What she did instead of shaving my head and
giving me zig zags is she went ahead and permed

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.750
whatever I had here.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.750
So yes guys, I'm semi-natural now, big-flipping
deal.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:33.400
She permed my growth.. my new growth, and
she was done, she slicked it down with gel

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.430
and she grabbed two combs and just created
these zigzags that you see on the side.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.620
Just like that.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.769
The girl is crazy, she's really..

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:44.800
I love her.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.329
I was lucky enough to meet her when I was
working as a stylist for the magazine Elixir

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.849
and every time I wanna go do my hair, I just
tell her really random.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.889
Half of the time when I go get my hair done,
I don't think about it for too long, it's

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.120
just like a spur of the moment.. this is what
I want done.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.359
I go to her and I'm like "Okay, I want zigzags"
and she says "Okay, we'll make it happen".

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.260
She might not make it happen in the way that
I expect her to but she always gets so creative

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.779
and does something I really love.

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:18.370
Originally I did not want this many zigs,
I just thought I was going to have one ray..

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:26.989
one little lightning bolt shaved into my side
but instead I got 20 zigzags and it's just

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:27.989
so dope.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.010
I look at it and I'm like "Yeahhhh, she gets
me" She knows I'm crazy and she just gets

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.299
it but it means I'm probably going to have
to fix it myself often and do things to it

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.299
myself..

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.269
Style it accordingly, probably even cut it
a little bit more myself which is totally

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.269
fine.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:52.939
I actually like the fact that I can be versatile
with whatever pattern is in my head at the

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.439
moment, I really like that.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:59.540
I can always go back to her anytime.. like
every week if I want to change up the style,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.510
she can make it happen for me without having
to shave a particular pattern into my head..

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.689
and that's pretty cool ! So basically I went
ahead and did that, and that's the info on

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.239
my hair.

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.340
So yeah, I just did it today that's why it
looks pretty clean and well-designed.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.400
I'm really happy about it.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400
I don't know if you guys are feeling it..

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400
Let me know.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.100
Like, dislike ? It's all good if you don't
like it.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.260
It's really something I wanted to do for myself
and I'm really in a phase where I just want

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.360
to do things for myself a little bit more.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.980
I love you, thanks for watching !
