00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:03.068
Welcome to episode 5 of Race Control.

00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:06.688
In this episode we’ll be learning how to
drive quickly in the rain, while minimizing

00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:07.688
accidents.

00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:10.398
I’m gonna state the obvious here, don’t
blame me if you try any of this in the real

00:00:10.398 --> 00:00:12.098
world and put your car through a wall.

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:13.248
You have been warned.

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:17.658
There are two main types of drivers that emerge
when driving in the rain, those that drive

00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:20.828
too slowly and those that drive into the back
of them.

00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:24.398
You can improve the car’s setup and your
attitude to driving in order to avoid becoming

00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:28.888
either one of them, but racing in the rain
will always be an inherently risky undertaking.

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:33.168
We’ll start with the setup of the car.

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:37.138
Softening the car’s suspension and dampers
make the car more stable in the wet, and you

00:00:37.138 --> 00:00:40.488
will probably need to set the brake balance
further to the rear as well, as the car will

00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:41.797
understeer when braking.

00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:45.967
Don’t set it too far back though as too
much oversteer will slow you down and increase

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:47.337
the risk of spinning.

00:00:47.337 --> 00:00:52.078
You can also leave this if you wish, some
drivers tend prefer understeer when braking.

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:55.078
Rain tyres are also essential for driving
in the wet.

00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:59.098
Driving on slicks will be like ice skating,
as the tyres will aquaplane very easily (show

00:00:59.098 --> 00:01:00.098
aquaplaning).

00:01:00.098 --> 00:01:03.318
That being said, full rain tyres won’t always
be the best option.

00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:07.338
Go for intermediates if it’s only light
rain, as the softer compound of a full rain

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:09.757
tyre will overheat quickly.

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:14.028
As well as changing the tyres, you can change
the pressures to give you an extra advantage.

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:17.748
Set them lower in light rain and you’ll
have extra grip, but if it gets heavier you’ll

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:19.318
need to set them higher.

00:01:19.318 --> 00:01:25.177
This produces a small crown in the surface
of the tyre, which can help to reduce aquaplaning.

00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:30.078
Finally you have the basic elements of setup
that we talked about in last weeks episode.

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:34.158
change the balance of the anti roll bars to
produce understeer under power, reduce the

00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:39.507
wastegate if you can and lower the acceleration
lock of the differential.

00:01:39.507 --> 00:01:46.878
Some changes to the driving style are also
necessary to be fast, but first let’s clear

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:48.418
up a common misconception.

00:01:48.418 --> 00:01:53.177
Drifting around corners is just as counterproductive
when racing in the wet as it is in the dry.

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:58.318
It may look cool, but you’ll lose time and
the chances of losing the car are much greater.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.178
Now that’s out of the way, let’s talk
about the exception to the rule.

00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:06.047
Cars are fastest when operating within a slip
angle, which changes depending on the stiffness

00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:07.288
of the car.

00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:11.778
It is usually tiny for purpose-built race
cars, but it increases slightly when in the

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:12.778
rain.

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:16.258
With this in mind, don’t be afraid to let
the rear step out slightly when exiting a

00:02:16.258 --> 00:02:20.738
turn, just don’t go too far out with it
as you’ll end up slow and unsafe.

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:24.538
You can practice on your own with sliding,
take the car into a field and try to hold

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:27.178
a slide by blipping and balancing the throttle
with the steering.

00:02:27.178 --> 00:02:32.118
There are dedicated philosophies and methods
with drifting that we may cover in a later

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:35.568
video, but for now just play with the car
and see what happens.

00:02:35.568 --> 00:02:40.008
Practicing oversteer in a controlled scenario
can help avoid an accident in a race.

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:43.858
We spoke earlier about the full wet tyres
overheating, and this will also become a problem

00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:45.828
as a dry line develops.

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:49.118
Drive through the puddles on the straights
and the excess water will cool the tyres down,

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:52.018
allowing them to be more effective in the
corners.

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:56.048
Speaking of dry lines, the racing line in
the wet is often different from the line in

00:02:56.048 --> 00:02:57.188
the dry.

00:02:57.188 --> 00:03:01.488
The rubber laid down onto the dry line makes
it smooth, which is perfect for dry conditions

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:03.368
but slippery when wet.

00:03:03.368 --> 00:03:06.918
Search for the best lines through corners,
as the visual cues the track is giving you

00:03:06.918 --> 00:03:09.858
might not always be the best idea.

00:03:09.858 --> 00:03:15.418
Astroturf, kerbs and other painted surfaces
should also be avoided for the same reason,

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:18.348
their smooth surface makes for a very slippery
experience.

00:03:18.348 --> 00:03:22.358
The same goes for grass, if you drop a wheel
there then there’s not much you can do apart

00:03:22.358 --> 00:03:25.618
from lock the wheels and wait until you hit
a wall.

00:03:25.618 --> 00:03:29.268
Even on normal tarmac you should make sure
to be as smooth as possible with your input,

00:03:29.268 --> 00:03:34.128
as breaking traction too suddenly can lead
to a spin.

00:03:34.128 --> 00:03:37.518
There are times when you get a ‘perfect
storm’ of sorts, when everything is being

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:38.708
thrown at you.

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:43.128
Fog, rain and darkness can all mix to form
a hellish driving experience, which causes

00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:45.208
accidents and makes life even harder.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:48.278
Here’s a couple of tips for the worst case
scenarios:

00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:52.738
1: Avoid a crash by any means, spin out if
you have to.

00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:57.418
A spin is much better than actually damaging
your car, so if something is in your way and

00:03:57.418 --> 00:04:01.028
you have to dip into the grass to avoid it?
do it.

00:04:01.028 --> 00:04:04.678
2: Use the rhythm of the track to get round
the track in low visibility.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:08.778
If you can’t see the corners for whatever
reason, use the brake markers with a count

00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:11.518
in your head to estimate when your braking
point should be.

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:16.718
3: Make note of where the dangerous areas
of the track are.

00:04:16.718 --> 00:04:20.588
If you find yourself struggling with oversteer
on a particular section of track, there’s

00:04:20.588 --> 00:04:22.758
a fair chance that others are too.

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:27.028
have a think where a car might end up if it
span out in this area, and try to avoid it

00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:29.858
if possible, even if you can’t see anything
there.

00:04:29.858 --> 00:04:35.028
Pre emptive avoidance can often give a driver
confidence and avoid unnecessary risk.

00:04:35.028 --> 00:04:39.668
That’s all for Race Control Episode 5.

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:43.358
Ideas are always welcome for these episodes,
so leave a comment with anything you’d like

00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:44.848
to learn about motorsport.

00:04:44.848 --> 00:04:45.508
Thanks for watching.
