00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.140
(theme music plays)

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.610
(theme music plays)

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.769
Jackie?

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.080
Mrs. Gillman?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.890
Dr. Kleinman said that Fred did just fine,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.910
but he'll probably be a little groggy

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.789
for the next hour or so.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.140
Thanks.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.820
You know,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.710
I probably should have asked this before,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.570
but how exactly do you remove

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.430
someone's wisdom teeth?

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.540
Well...

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.420
Is he out?

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.130
How can you tell?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.410
Why are you hitting yourself?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.460
Why are you hitting yourself?

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.390
Why are you hitting yourself?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.760
Yeah, he's out

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.230
Five bucks if he starts choking.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.579
Alright!

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.940
Ooh!

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.290
Ah!

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.790
Look, I'm Fred Gillman.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.200
I'm taking out my own wisdom tooth.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.590
I'm a doctor!

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.879
Every time we get one of his teeth out

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.100
we do a shot.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.309
I'm gonna need more than four shots.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:04.739
Aaaargh...

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.780
Can I get some suction?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.010
That's a lot of...

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.100
Yeah, some suction?

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.310
Gimme some...

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.820
That's a q-tip.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.909
Right.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.340
Come on, come on. Boo!

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.600
He's on fire!

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.689
Hrrr!

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.119
He's choking, he's chocking.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.070
Five bucks.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.540
[BLEEPED] you, you little [BLEEPED].

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.020
Swear at it, it helps.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.549
[BLEEPED] you, you piece of [BLEEPED] [BLEEPED]

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.270
mother [BLEEPED] [BLEEPED]

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.060
Ahhh!

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.040
We're gonna do this one right back there.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.490
Where?

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.770
Just on the bottom. Right over there.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.270
Did...did you just drop your gum into his
mouth?

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.720
Can I have the pokey?

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.689
No, no, no, you can't have "the pokey."

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.770
You want to get the gum back?

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.360
You're very handsome.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.720
Why did you propose to your wife?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.020
I think I'm gonna throw up.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.309
You lick [BLEEPED] licking [BLEEPED] busting
[BLEEPED]

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.219
This is like one of those fricking crane games.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:13.859
I just don't have any more gum.

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.969
You also don't have any more dignity.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.969
Uhhh!

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.959
Ah, come on!

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.189
Why won't you come out!?

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.499
How many diseases do you have?

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:25.879
Only a couple.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.340
Okay.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.549
Piece of [BLEEPED] you're a [BLEEPED] dirty

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.549
[BLEEPED] a carney. You're a [BLEEPED]. I
hate you!

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.040
You [BLEEPED]. Get the [BLEEPED] out of there,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.680
Dad.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.959
Holy [BLEEPED].

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.449
Oh, wow. Nice, see, I told you.

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.090
Cool.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.279
You did good. You did good.

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.199
You did good.

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.319
You're a [BLEEPED].

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.379
AHHH!

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.319
You don't want to know.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.629
It's really boring.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.569
It must be, I don't remember anything.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.839
That's probably for the best.

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.799
(theme music plays)

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.760
(theme music plays)

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.719
(theme music plays)

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.680
(theme music plays)

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.249
Uh, uh. Get your hands off me!

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:19.790
You can put them on me if you want to.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.439
Jackie.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.099
Hm?

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.409
Aw, crap.
