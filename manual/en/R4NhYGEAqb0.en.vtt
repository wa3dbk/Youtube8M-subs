00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.660
About seventy percent of the land in the lower
48 states is owned by private individuals,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.950
and we believe that the fate of the environment
really depends on the quality of the decisions

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.760
made by the men and women who own and operate
that land.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.090
My name is Dave White and I'm the chief of
the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.500
NRCS is a USDA agency.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.910
We have about 2,900 field offices and we have
people all over the country that are agronomists,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.910
biologists, engineers.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.050
This is Working Lands for Wildlife Lesser
Prairie Chicken Initiative.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.389
And these technical people work one on one
with producers to solve natural resource problems.

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:47.039
Maybe spread the maps out over here.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.920
My name is Roy Bealy and I'm a rancher here
in Comanche County, Kansas.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.909
This photo here is probably taken early 1900's.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.299
My great-great grandfather, he homesteaded
here and started this place and I'm fifth

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:05.129
generation and hopefully keep continuing down
the line with my children.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.030
I love the outdoors and solitude and raising
cow/calf, taking care of them has kinda always

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.830
been a part of our lifestyle.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.150
The prairie chicken is a fun bird to watch
in early spring when they do their mating

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.220
ritual.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.410
Yeah, there's always been prairie chickens
around.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.320
I think their numbers have declined.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.880
The lesser prairie chicken is a native game
bird of the southern great plains of the United

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.880
States.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.540
I'm Christian Hagan and I'm the science adviser
to the Lesser Prairie Chicken Initiative for

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.090
the NRCS.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.620
This bird once occupied a vast areas of a
five-state region.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.430
Since European settlement that range has been
largely contracted by about ninety percent.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.310
Because of that contraction, we've actually
seen that species listed as a candidate for

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.460
protection under the Endangered Species Act.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.170
So this is the Eastern Red Cedar.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.459
Historically, large herds of bison and periodic
fire kept this tree at bay.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.010
This tree is now occurring in areas large
enough that it's actually displacing, or removing

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.379
habitat for native species like the lesser
prairie chicken.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.549
So as simple and funny as it sounds, prairie
chickens are prairie species.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:41.159
And so plants, like a cedar tree, represent
a habitat that the bird will simply not use.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.069
But even at lower densities what this does
is it actually provides predators, things

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.950
like the coyote and the hawk, it provides
them an extra advantage and may actually increase

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.239
the predation rates on prairie chickens.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:05.139
So the wonderful thing that happens when you
remove these trees is that we're really returning

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.299
the prairie to its historic condition.

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:15.870
The trees and the chickens don't get along
very good and the cedars, they also use ground

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.000
water that would take away from grass production.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.360
There's just not enough grass for the livestock
operation.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.260
This cedar here was about ten years old.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Mechanical clearing is about the only way
to get on top of something like this.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.250
These people have to make money off the cattle
ranching business.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.980
I'm Dusty Taha, rangeland management specialist
with the Natural Resources Conservation Service

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.379
in south central Kansas.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.879
All right, that's the north contract.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.549
We help landowners by providing them a prescribed
grazing plan.

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.069
The program includes financial assistance
in brush clearing as well as grazing incentive

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.099
payments.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.219
And I mean them chickens are all coming through
this area.

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.980
We know there's chickens here, on this ranch.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.569
We hope to increase their numbers and hopefully
Roy will see that happening.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.700
Hopefully also he'll see that the rotational
grazing program will pay off in benefits in

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.700
the ranching business as well.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.420
I don't see these as restrictions.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.840
I believe that a guy needs to should take
care of his operation regardless the involvement

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.060
of NRCS.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.730
Our major goal is to just to be profitable.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.730
What the Fish and Wildlife Service has done
is they said if a farmer, rancher works with

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.820
us, develops a conservation plan, implements
those conservation practices, they will give

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.200
them certainty from regulation for up to 30
years.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.440
We've taken the fear out of the Endangered
Species Act.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:05.510
And not just for today or tomorrow but for
a generation, for 30 years.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.880
It's not about a bird or a turtle, this is
about changing the whole paradigm of how we

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.000
deal with the Endangered Species Act in America.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.800
"You can go to the left, I can go to the right."

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.920
I think all species are important to protect.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.250
It's also important to protect their habitats.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.980
My name is Holly Neiderider.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.600
I'm a wildlife biologist with the Delaware
division of Fish and Wildlife in the Natural

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.430
Heritage and Endangered Species Program.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.060
This is like the perfect the perfect nesting
spot for a turtle.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.440
The main thing we're trying to do is protect
bog turtles.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.780
The bog turtle is the smallest turtle in North
America.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.220
It's about the size of the palm of your hand
as an adult.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.310
It's the color of the mud in which it lives.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.880
So far what we've found is that turtles aren't
doing well in Delaware and we've really done

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.240
an aggressive search for new habitats and
we've found new habitats but we're not finding

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.050
turtles in any of those sites, so that's really
disappointing.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.570
We don't know exactly what happened to those
populations but what's happened around those

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.220
is there's been a lot of development.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.580
And when you put in something like a whole
housing development that changes the hydrology

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.450
of the whole area.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.560
If it doesn't actually fill the wetland itself
it can end up just pulling the water away

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.320
from it.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:26.410
There are definitely some landowners who really
don't want endangered species on their property.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.630
There is a lot of fear surrounding the Endangered
Species Act and that's one of the things we

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.210
wanted to overcome with that, to change it
from confrontation to collaboration.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.010
So if we control the vegetation here what
I'm hoping is that we can get more of the

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.110
open canopy areas where the turtles can nest
and hopefully have a higher reproduction.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.950
If a producer does everything they can to
protect a bog turtle we are not going to come

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.050
in and require you to do anything more.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.380
So that producer knows there's nobody going
to mess with them.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.520
They have the certainty that they've done
what they needed to do.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.740
We found a way that brings people together.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.490
We give good value to the taxpayer, we can
save these species, we can make sure that

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.410
our farmers and ranchers economically survive,
and we can do it in harmony with a quality

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.710
environment.
