00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.120
Linguae Vascorum Primitiae, 1545 (First book published in Basque language)
Bernard Etxepare (Prologue)

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.160
As the Basques are skilled, hard-working and genteel,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.400
with great men of letters having been and who are among them

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.520
I am amazed

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.000
my Lord,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.000
how none, for the good of his own language,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.000
has attempted to undertake or write some work in Basque

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.000
so that the whole world might know

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.080
that it is as good as any tongue in which to write.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.600
I am amazed.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.760
And this is the reason wherefore it is relegated,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.720
without any renown

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.920
and why all the rest of the nations believe

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.320
that nothing can be written in that tongue,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.480
even as all of the rest write in their own,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.840
even as all of the rest write in their own.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.720
And as you, noble Lord,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.360
of this land that you are,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.120
esteem, praise, and do honour to Basque,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.760
it is to you, my Lord and Master,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.440
to whom I am sending these verses
wrought in my own ignorance;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.000
so that, my Lord, having seen and corrected them at your will,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.360
you might have them printed

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.800
and that all of us might have, in this way, from your own hand, a precious jewel,
the Basque language in print, something which has not existed hitherto;

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.040
so that it might grow, endure, and spread throughout in the future
from your auspicious beginning;

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.400
and that the Basques might have in their language, in the same manner as the rest, some doctrine

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.360
and written matter whereby they might amuse themselves, converse, sing and spend their time,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.800
and in which upcoming generations might be motivated to perfect it;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.720
and that we might see it fit

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.280
to pray unto God

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.480
to pray

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.320
that He might grand you a prosperous life in this world

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.080
and heaven in the next.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080
Amen.
