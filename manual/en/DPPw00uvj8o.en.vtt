00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This party is a ship for all seas

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One that cannot be sunk

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We will never wither away

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We may be tortured

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We may even be killed

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But our ideology can no longer be wiped off 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We will return

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
To bring good government for our people

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Our determination will not sway, our courage will not falter

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We are the Maldivian Democratic Party

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We set out for change

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We shall continue our struggle

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This country will once again see a government thatâ€¦

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.000
...has the people's love, respect and consent 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That will be a government led by the Maldivian Democratic Party 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
A democratic government, a just government 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
A government that will take us to safer shores

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
A government that will bring prosperity

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
A government that will connect us through a transport network

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A government that will not force the people to beg for healthcare

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That is the good government that we long for

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
One which will guarantee a decent life for all

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Praise be to God, and peace be upon you all
