00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.559
A Library Catalog lists all the books, media,
and other items available from that library.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.570
There are several ways you can find ours,
for example, by using the "Books" tab on the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.360
library's home page.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.340
For this example, I'm going to start on the
main search page of the library catalog.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.730
To find books on a topic, I need to use the
keyword search option, which is always the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.750
default.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:44.890
Today, I want to find books on eating disorders,
so I'll type those keywords into my search.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.710
I have 232 possible matches.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.560
They're in order by relevance.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.670
Here, I can see that my first set of results
has my keywords, "eating disorders," appearing

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.489
in the title.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.360
I can change the sort order to date or even
title alphabetical, but normally that's not

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.700
necessary.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.759
Notice some of the different kinds of material
that the library catalog covers.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.679
My first result is an ebook.

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:27.810
The second one is a Master's Thesis written
by a CSUSB student, and this is an online

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.469
Government Document.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.310
And of course, we have regular printed books.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:47.079
If the item is physically located in the library,
I'll see the location, the call number, and

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.810
its availability status.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.340
Be sure to check our tutorial about how to
locate a book on the shelf for more details.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:09.259
If the item is online, I'll get a link to
take me to it.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.510
Clicking on the title of any item will give
more information about it.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.390
So, let's try this one, "Personality Disorders
and Eating Disorders."

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.760
On this screen, I have the table of contents
from the book, an image of the cover, a link

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.129
to the Google preview version, and even a
short summary.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.210
Not every book includes all of this information,
but it's always a good idea to check.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.650
Here, I can scan the QR code with my smartphone,
so I won't even have to write down the floor

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.110
location or the call number.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.170
Here, I see subject headings attached to this
book.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.049
If I want to find the library's other books
with the subject "Personality Disorders,"

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:06.970
I can click on it and explore other titles
on that topic.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.150
But what if I know the exact title of the
book I want?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.239
In that case, change the search option from
"Keyword" to "Title."

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.920
I'm looking for "The Story of Stupidity."

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.319
By the way, it's OK to leave off the initial
a, an, or the.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.680
Because there was only one match for my title,
I went straight to the full record for this

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.849
item.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.650
What if I want to find all of the library's
books by a specific author?

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.870
In that case, I change the search option from
"Keyword" to "Author."

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.409
Remember that authors' names have to be entered
last name first.

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.450
I'm looking for books by Stephen King, so
I'll type King, comma, Stephen.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.130
By the way, there's no need to capitalize.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.310
Here I see an alphabetical list of matching
author entries.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.799
This main entry for Stephen King has 150 titles.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:25.919
To view them, I just click his name.
