Text on screen "Dancers Bring San Francisco's Mission District's Murals to Life"

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.860
"Baile en la Calle" [in Spanish means] actually dance in the streets.

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:16.465
And to see the murals with dance,

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:18.880
it's very powerful and moving.

00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:23.608
These murals, it's part of what makes this neighborhood.

00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:25.108
It's why people come here.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.909
The colors, the stories behind every mural.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.500
Unfortunately, when there are so many changes happening here in the neighborhood,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.340
a lot of our history is being erased.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.180
And that is what we are trying to preserve, for us to survive as a community.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.740
We have to think outside of the box.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.640
Our work has to be speaking to the streets.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.680
Now more than ever we have to look at these corners

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.140
as public spaces that should be activated.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.640
And "Baile en la Calle" is that.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840
Sounds of conch shell blowing.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.340
 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.960
Music.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.980
The dancers become an extension.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.860
The embody the mural.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.480
For me it was very important to start raising my voice.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.420
And what better way for me to do it through my art.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.840
This mural, "500 Years of Resistance," says a lot about who I am.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.760
With the gospel music, "Oh Freedom,"

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.780
I want to show the organization of people in order to fight injustice.

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:56.337
I'm afraid if we forget about our past, then we will be lost.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.060
Cumbia! Everybody put your hands together, come on!

00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:10.354
This year, Galeria de la Raza participated in

00:02:10.354 --> 00:02:14.005
supporting the restoration of one of the featured murals,

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.785
honoring Ralph Maradiaga, one of our co-founders.

00:02:19.846 --> 00:02:23.766
During the years, when he was active, as an artist and as a community organizer,

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:27.200
Ralph was one of those people who worked really hard

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.520
to create physical space, Galeria de la Raza,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.240
and to build community with other artists

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.340
in trying to make us more visible.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.957
To this day, that founding mission is what we work from.

00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:44.729
And I think for new generations, it's really important to have

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:47.921
cultural icons that speak to that legacy.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.240
I was the original artist, so I felt like this was an opportunity

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.100
to go back and bring the mural back to life.

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:05.407
We are hard working artists and we bring culture,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.880
our cultures, to the community.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.520
This is who we are, that's why we keep dancing our dances,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.200
keep singing our songs and keep moving forward.
