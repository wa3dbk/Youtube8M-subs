00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:17.179
gordan was resting in the siding
sometimes he thought it's really tiring

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:24.179
to be such a large and splendid engine
one does have to keep up appearances so

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.480
PEEP PEEP PEEP! hello lazybones! whistled henry

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.500
what cheek! spluttered gordon

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.680
that henry is too big for his wheels

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.030
fancy speaking to me like that

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.030
me who has never had an accident

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.030
aren't jammed whistles and burst safety valves accidents? asked percy innocently

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.340
no indeed high spirits

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.300
might happen to any engine

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.050
but to come off the rails like henry did
well i ask you is that right

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.990
is it decent

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.930
then it was henrys turn to take the
express gordon watched him getting ready

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.229
be careful henry, you're not pulling the flying kipper now.  mind you keep on the

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.229
rails today

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.030
henry went off in a huff

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.670
and gordon yawned and went to sleep

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.960
but not for long

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.320
wake-up gordon said his driver a special
trains coming and where to pull it

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.630
is it coaches or freight cars

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.630
cars said his driver. cars! said gordon. PUH

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.330
gordon's fire was slow to start so
edward had to push gordon to the turntable

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.170
to get hin facing the right way

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.170
i wont go! i wont go! grumbled gordon

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.499
don't be silly don't be sillly

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:14.689
puffed edward

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.189
at last, gordon was on the turntable
the movements had shaken his fire it was now

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.359
burning nicely and making steam

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.029
gordon was cross and didnt care what he did

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.579
he waited until the table was half way round

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.949
i'll show them i'll show them that

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.559
one

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:41.379
he moves slowly forward to jam the table

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.619
but he couldn't stop himself and slithered into

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.239
a ditch. OOOSH! he hissed. GET ME OUT

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.430
GET ME OUT

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.120
not a hope! said his driver and fireman. you're stuck you silly great engine

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.629
don't you understand that

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.239
they telephone sir topham hatt

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.229
so gordon didn't want to take the train, and ran into a ditch?

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.739
sped up conversation between fat controller and policeman from thomas in trouble/thomas breaks the rules

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.540
whats that you say? the specials waiting?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.359
tell edward to take it pease, and gordon?
leave him where he is we'll

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.509
get him out later

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.629
on the other side of the ditch some little boys were chattering

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.169
oh doesn't he look silly? they'll never get him out

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.819
they began to sing

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.849
silly old gordon fell in a ditch

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:31.859
fell in a ditch

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.699
fell in a ditch silly little gordon
fell in a ditch

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.529
all on a monday morning

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.469
gordon lay in the ditch all day

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:48.469
oh dear! he thought. i shall never get out

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:55.059
but that evening the lifted gordon and made a road of sleepers under his wheels to keep him from the mud

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.969
strong ropes were fastened to his back end

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:04.969
and james and henry pulling hard managed
to bring him to safety

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.739
late that night gordon crawled home sadder
and wiser engine
