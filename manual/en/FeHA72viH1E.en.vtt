00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.000
My name is Larry Cook, and I am here to share
with you that we can all be healthy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.840
Now I understand that you might have a disease
or you may have cancer, or you may be overweight,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.620
or you may have any other kind of health condition,
but in reality, we can all be healthy, and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.390
the reason why we can all be healthy is because
the body actually knows how to heal itself

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.960
when given the right conditions.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.540
That's the most important thing of this entire
video that I want you to know about.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.750
The body, when given the right conditions,
can heal itself.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.390
Let's talk about conventional medicine.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.350
Conventional medicine is really a process
of symptom management.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.430
That means if you have some sort of a symptom,
whatever that symptom might be, the western

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.290
medicine medical model says OK, we've identified
that symptom, now let's use a drug to manage

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.250
that symptom.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.790
It's really a symptom management model.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.090
This is the most important thing of all.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.140
Western medicine is all about managing symptoms,
but it doesn't actually get to the root cause

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.290
of the problem or help the body heal.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.470
In fact, as you probably have seen on a gazillion
TV ads now and every ad that's in a magazine,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.299
there are a million side effects associated
with lots and lots of drugs and those side

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.290
effects are not good for the body.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.020
Then you might ask yourself, well why are
there side effects?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.430
The side effects are there because what you're
being given is a synthetic drug that's been

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.200
patented so a company can make a lot of money
from it, but it doesn't actually help your

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.720
body heal, it just manages the symptom.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.560
If it helped your body heal, you wouldn't
need that drug anymore.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.070
Hmm.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.560
This is the key.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560
It's not healing.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.450
In fact, when you hear the phrase, "There's
no cure," or, "We're searching for a cure,"

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.650
or whatever, that's because drugs are never
going to cure the problem.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.239
Drugs are designed to manage symptoms.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.279
Always.

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.430
Let's go back to what I originally said.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.510
When given the right conditions, the body
knows how to heal itself.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.379
This is the key.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.099
Let's jump over to alternative or natural
medicine.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.319
Natural medicine says oh, you're exhibiting
these symptoms, well let's figure out what

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.400
the body is doing or not doing or not doing
correctly that's causing these symptoms to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.840
manifest.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.730
Then once we've figured out what these different
root causes of those symptoms are, we're going

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.889
to give the body what it needs so it can get
better.

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.269
This happens all the time.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.799
You just don't hear about it.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.469
You don't hear about it because the pharmaceutical
industry pretty much advertises in the entire

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:08.079
mainstream media, and so mainstream media
makes a lot of money from the pharmaceutical

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.359
industry, and no one wants to upset that apple
cart, so you're not going to hear about it

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.590
unless you do some research and you dig a
little deeper and you ask a few questions

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.790
and you visit a few natural doctors, and you
start reading some books and you start reading

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.370
some alternative websites, and pretty soon
you're like, wait a second, you mean I have

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.760
diabetes and I don't have to have diabetes?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.219
You mean I have fibromyalgia and I don't have
to have fibromyalgia?

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.480
You mean I have some other, you name the disease,
and I don't actually have to have that disease,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.450
I can actually get better?

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.909
You should get outraged, and a lot of people
are outraged.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.419
When they finally figure out that the body
can heal when given the right conditions and

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.519
that the western medical model is actually
based on treating symptoms and not treating

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.390
the root cause, it's a game changer.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.979
It's a complete game changer, so what have
you learned in this video?

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:08.430
You've learned that the western medical model
treats symptoms with drugs because they're

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.499
patented, which means the pharmaceutical industry
will make a lot of money, and that when given

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.540
the right conditions, the body can heal itself.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.020
Those conditions might include changing your
diet, taking some supplements, doing exercise,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.930
maybe doing hyperbaric oxygen therapy, maybe
getting a Vitamin C nutritional IV, maybe

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.330
doing something called hydrotherapy - hot/cold
therapy - maybe doing a detoxification protocol.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.900
When you put together all of these different
things that you can do to give your body what

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.650
it needs, including nutrition, nutritional
supplements, all of a sudden the body goes

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.509
hey, I have what I need, I'm going to heal.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.590
You know what that's called?

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.340
That's called a cure.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.229
That is a cure.

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.360
The body knows how to heal itself.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:13.500
What you want to do is live in a way where
you are giving your body what it needs to

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.850
do it's very best, and you want to make sure
you don't give your body ... You don't add

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.379
to your body things that diminish health.

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:28.260
When you consciously do that, that is called
the Healthy Living Lifestyle, or also known

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.849
as the Natural Living Lifestyle.

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.979
It includes dietary change most often, it
usually includes taking some supplements,

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.650
it definitely includes exercise and exercising
on a regular basis, it most likely includes

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.580
seeing a natural doctor or a naturopathic
doctor, an acupuncturist, a chiropractor,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.509
those specialists who actually get to the
root cause of the problem.

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:57.789
It may include doing a chi-building exercises
like yoga, and it definitely will include

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.500
detoxification, colon cleansing, getting rid
of the toxins, because you know what?

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.330
Our society is extremely toxic, and when you
start putting all of these toxins into your

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.210
body, inadvertently, like you're not necessarily
trying to do it but the body starts accumulating

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.530
and accumulating and accumulating these toxins,
if you don't get rid of them, you will have

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.780
a degenerative disease sooner or later.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.819
Your body will start going downhill.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.260
You may need to do a detoxification program,
but when you start doing all of these different

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:37.620
things: you start deliberately eating food
consciously, organic, whole, fresh food on

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.229
a regular basis, you start taking some supplements
that help support your body's function, you

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.970
start exercising, you go see a natural doctor
who can really figure out what's going on,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.919
and then from there, prescribe a protocol
that will help your body heal even more.

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.360
Wow, all of a sudden you don't have your disease
any more.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.490
You've lost weight.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.740
You have more energy.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.440
You're in vibrant health.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.270
That is why you want to adopt a healthy living
lifestyle.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.810
Now there's a lot more I could say.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.229

of resources on my website.
