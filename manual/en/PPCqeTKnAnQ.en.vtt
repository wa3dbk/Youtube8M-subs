00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:13.608
Shrinkies are versatile enough to install wefted hair. 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.076
The first step in the process is to position your needle through the weft.

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:21.076
You are going to pick up a small section of hair.

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:28.120
Flip your latch closed and pull it through your weft. 

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:35.306
You are going to take the natural hair and 
 a small bit of the extension hair.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:52.755
Slide a Shrinkie onto your needle and pick 
 up the two pieces of hair. 

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:58.920
Pull both pieces into your Shrinkie.

00:01:01.437 --> 00:01:03.437
And slide the weft up into place. 

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:07.464
The next step is to apply heat.

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:21.801
You should hear a slight crackle as the adhesive melts.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.753
Next, roll your bond into place.

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:38.093
Again, push your needle through the weft.

00:01:40.337 --> 00:01:43.960
Continue this process until the entire weft is secure. 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.150
Continue installing your wefts until you have reached your desired style.
