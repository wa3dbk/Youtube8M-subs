00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.290
Capcom has been in a little bit of trouble
lately.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.560
Although their franchises like Resident Evil,
Street Fighter and Dead Rising are still selling

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.790
well, they’ve also had some games that just
didn’t attract the attention the company

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.430
expected, like Dark Void and Bionic Commando.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.520
There’s one game, however, that Capcom has
released a sequel for, and is getting ready

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.480
to release another in the future.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.260
This series mixes an awesome setting with
great combat to create a title fans of both

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590
science fiction and action will enjoy.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:03.649
This is Lost Planet: Extreme Condition for
the 360.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.960
Lost Planet’s plot revolves around how humans
were forced to flee Earth and find a new planet.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.700
After finding a snowy sphere of ice that they
hoped to call home, they learn that there’s

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.500
a local presence in the form of creatures
called the Akrid.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.470
At first they decide to flee, but realize
that thermal energy on the planet is far too

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.590
important to pass up.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.100
Your character watches as his father gets
killed by a gigantic variety of these beasts,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.640
before being knocked unconscious and frozen.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.850
After being rescued and thawed, you set out
to take the fight to these creatures.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.229
I love the idea of mankind being stranded
on an unfamiliar planet, especially one with

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.090
creatures capable of overpowering humans.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.940
The gameplay is part third-person shooter,
part platformer.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.310
Most of your time will be spent in combat,
where you wield weapons like machine guns,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.540
rocket launchers, shotguns, rifles, and even
Gatling guns to take down enemies, while also

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.959
collecting energy to add to your reserve.

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.039
Gunplay is excellent, and the game uses the
right and left bumpers of the 360’s controller

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.179
to allow you to do a really quick turn, and
this really comes in handy when facing quicker

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.270
enemies.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.510
Weapons have some serious power behind them
for taking down the Akrid.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.810
You’ll also get access to a robotic suit
which gives you a big boost to your power

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.319
and jumping ability.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.040
The other part of the gameplay is platforming
of sorts.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.770
You have access to a grappling hook-like device
to reach ledges and pull yourself up, which

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.670
can be really important when traversing levels.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.569
It’s really fun figuring out the best way
to get up buildings or cliffs, and the game

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.040
usually gives you a few different ways to
do this.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.120
The aiming for this device can be a bit of
a pain, but you’ll get used to it after

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.440
a little bit of time.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.430
Boss fights are also epic, and the game usually
gives you a weak point, kind of like a Zelda

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.250
boss fight, to attack.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.390
Lost Planet is an early 360 title, but it
doesn’t look all that bad.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.489
Faces are a little rough, but hair on characters,
as well as environments and enemies, look

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.489
really solid.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.489
Explosions and smoke effects are also really
good.

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.519
Lost Planet is an fantastic title, and it’s
one that made Capcom really get out of their

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.310
comfort zone to develop something that feels
much more like a Western game than most of

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.310
Capcom’s releases.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.010
This is a must-play for fans of action, science
fiction, or lots of snow.
