00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.520
I have to understand

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.820
In this irrational world

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.320
I have to hide in the darkness
'cause you never try to save me

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.670
He made a speech to the people
"Keep it clean"

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.520
Oh, if it was easy, I wouldn't be here now

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.120
No one held their hand to me

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.770
Nor did I want to take it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.070
Even if I bathe in light

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.720
It's only dazzling to me

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420
I don't want to be nihilistic

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.670
Please don't double-cross me

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.320
I don't wander, I just hide

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.920
I'm not afraid, just standing here

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.220
Nothing changes even if I fade

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.820
I don't intend to leave here

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.520
I don't intend to find right

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.770
Darkness is always next to me

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.770
Descend into other world I say,
fulfilling the others ok!?

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.920
Hey! You all love touching movies

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.320
Give me all the admission fees

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.720
Drunk with endless peace laugh at stupidity

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.270
I refuse to be manipulated anymore

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:59.820
I'm only able to believe in myself

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.320
Rising

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.820
I'm only able to believe in myself

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.570
Shut me out
I'm only able to believe in myself

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.670
Don't light up my hatred

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.720
Show me real darkness

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.070
Give me more

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.570
No one held their hand to me

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.820
Nor did I want to take it

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.320
Even if I bathe in light

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.520
It's only dazzling to me

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.770
I don't wanna be nihilistic

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.220
Please don't double-cross me

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.420
I don't wander, I just hide

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.670
I'm not afraid, just standing here

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.120
Nothing changes even if I fade

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.420
I don't intend to leave here

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.970
I don't intend to find right

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.770
Darkness is always next to me

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.820
Next to me

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.170
Darkness is always next to me
Next to me

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.570
Darkness is always next to me
