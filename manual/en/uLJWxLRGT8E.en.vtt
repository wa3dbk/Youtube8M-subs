00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:18.428
The exceptional character of a Nespresso coffee owes nothing to chance.

00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:23.637
In order to obtain a perfect cup of coffee, time after time,

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:26.880
we suggest you follow some simple instructions.

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:33.465
To start, the quality of water is essential for enhancing the aroma of your espresso,

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:39.853
so we suggest you refill the water tank on a daily basis using fresh water.

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:47.519
After every use, it is important to remove the used Nespresso capsule

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:50.761
and not let it remain in the extraction system.

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:55.578
We recommend that you regularly empty the capsule container and drip tray

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.642
in order to avoid overflowing.

00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:00.983
You can easily separate them for cleaning.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.239
After using your machine for the last time, simply let a cup of water without a capsule flow through

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:13.662
in order to wash away any residue left in the flow system.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:22.311
We recommend to clean the coffee outlet regularly with a soft damp cloth.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:29.191
You can empty the system before a period of non-use or for transportation.

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:31.451
To enter the emptying mode,

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:37.545
press simultaneously the «Espresso» and «Lungo» buttons to turn the machine off.

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:40.002
Remove the water tank.

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:43.933
And open the lever.

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:50.321
Press simultaneously the «Espresso» and «Lungo» buttons for 3 seconds.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.547
Both blink alternately

00:01:57.628 --> 00:02:00.346
Then, close the lever.

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:03.491
The machine switches off automatically.

00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:08.896
Empty and clean the used capsule container and drip tray.
