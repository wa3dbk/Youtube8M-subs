00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:01.179
- Korea!

00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:08.022
- I love Korean barbecue
'cause they just feed you

00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:10.241
all of the food you can fit
into your dumb, fat mouth.

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:12.555
- Uh, I know about the bivenbop.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:14.305
- I know they like to ferment things.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.931
- I dated a Korean girl, once.

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:19.411
- [Voiceover] Mung Bean Jelly.

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:21.323
Very appetizing name.

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.428
- This looks like Jello.

00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:24.445
- Uh, animal fat?

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:25.379
- Ooh. Oh.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.761
- Lightly jiggly.

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:27.950
- This looks like an eraser.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.844
- Woop.

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:31.996
- Oh no. This is, ew.

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:32.788
- Who would not like that?

00:00:32.788 --> 00:00:34.129
- The consistency is pretty awful.

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.694
- Yeah, it's like if you made Jello

00:00:35.694 --> 00:00:36.994
out of soy sauce.

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:38.393
- I got some Mung Bean stuck in my teeth.

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:41.597
- [Voiceover] Tree from Korea, leaf.

00:00:41.597 --> 00:00:42.739
- Did you take a leaf off the tree

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:43.958
and just put some hot sauce on it?

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.848
- Is this like poison sumac or some shit?

00:00:47.908 --> 00:00:50.060
- My palate isn't advanced
enough to identify

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.076
what flavor this is.

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:52.394
I just know I don't like it.

00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:53.433
- No.

00:00:53.948 --> 00:00:54.740
- Oh, weird.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.345
Tastes almost like cleaning
products or something,

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:57.150
but I like it.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.369
- Aw, leaf.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:59.141
What are you doing?

00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:01.253
- This is bringing back memories of,

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:01.977
mowing my lawn.

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:02.995
- [Voiceover] You told me
you weren't gonna surprise me

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:03.939
with any penis.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:04.630
- It looks like a,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.438
it looks like a treat for a dog.

00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:07.611
- Eh.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.834
- I bet this is like, a pig's cheek.

00:01:11.477 --> 00:01:12.358
If I had to guess.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:14.736
- I really like this.

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:15.927
It tastes good.

00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:16.935
- Buh.

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:17.746
- Mmm.

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:18.723
- They had to use every part.

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:20.766
- You think people who have
foot fetishes are like,

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.846
into eating feet?

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:23.074
- I like pickled pig's feet.

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.234
I put that on my OkCupid profile.

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:27.428
- [Voiceover] These
look like little crabs.

00:01:27.428 --> 00:01:29.918
- Aw, the poor little crabs.

00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:32.051
- This is the claw of the crab.

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:33.290
- I'm going for the eyeball.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.342
- I mean, I guess if you
boil anything long enough

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:36.620
it gets soft.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.017
Yeah, that's pretty hard.

00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:39.957
(crunch)

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:41.319
(crunch)

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.180
(crunch)

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.810
(cough)

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.448
- That is delicious.

00:01:44.448 --> 00:01:46.760
- This makes me think of when
you're a kid and they're like,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.509
"Eat your vegetables Claudia."

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:50.294
- Mmm, that's a little leg I just ate.

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:54.272
- It's like, "Eat your hot
sauce covered baby crabs,

00:01:54.272 --> 00:01:55.294
"Claudia."

00:01:55.304 --> 00:01:56.624
- [Voiceover] Silkworm.

00:01:56.624 --> 00:01:58.595
- Did you just say pupae,

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:01.054
and expect me to not dry heave?

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.476
- Come on, man.

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:03.633
- I refuse to eat this.

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:04.425
- I just can't.

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:06.394
- Sarah and Andrew refused to eat this?

00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:08.938
You know that means I'm gonna eat it.

00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:11.030
- I'm gonna be really open,
and like cool about this.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.404
Yeah, how was your day?

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:13.794
Uh hun.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:16.593
(burp)

00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:17.825
- Oh God.

00:02:18.164 --> 00:02:18.906
It popped.

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:21.284
- It's like a grass and hay flavor.

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:22.320
- Gushers!

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.247
- It's just like bite, larva juice.

00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:25.100
- Boom.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.571
And your mouth is like, "No!"

00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.105
- Even if I were dying,

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:32.577
I would have a hard time
eating more than one of these.

00:02:32.577 --> 00:02:34.019
- Koreans are hard dude.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.395
- They're not afraid to eat some shit

00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:37.778
that we are a little nervous about.

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:39.417
- I have not acquired those tastes yet.

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:41.225
- [Voiceover] That bug,
that larva was gross.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:43.243
I'm still kinda mad at
you for feeding it to me.
