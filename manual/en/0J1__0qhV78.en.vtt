00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:12.161
The President:
Well, I want to, first of all,
just thank Tiffany and Richard,

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:17.928
Jimmie and Velma for opening
up their beautiful home to us.

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:20.161
The reason that we're here is
because Tiffany is one of the

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.428
people who responded to My2K.

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:28.494
As many of you know, we asked
folks all across the country to

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:33.061
talk a little bit about what
would it mean if their income

00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:38.961
taxes went up in 2013, and
Tiffany, who is a high school

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.428
teacher, responded.

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:45.761
Her husband, Richard, works
at a Toyota dealership.

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.961
They actually live
with Tiffany's parents,

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:51.294
both of whom are still working.

00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:56.994
And so what Tiffany pointed out
was that an increase of $2,000

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:03.061
or so for her and her husband
in this household would actually

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.428
mean $4,000 that was lost.

00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:12.494
And a couple of thousand dollars
means a couple months' rent for

00:01:12.494 --> 00:01:14.194
this family.

00:01:14.194 --> 00:01:18.895
And the story they tell about
working hard, my understanding

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:22.695
is they're interested in
starting a business as well

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:25.127
as the work that
they currently do.

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:26.528
They've got dreams
and ambitions.

00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:30.328
They've got a beautiful
6-year-old son, Noah,

00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:32.695
who's back with great-grandma.

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:36.227
And they're keeping it together,
they're working hard, they're

00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:39.695
meeting their responsibilities.

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:45.761
For them to be burdened
unnecessarily because Democrats

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:48.861
and Republicans aren't coming
together to solve this problem

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:52.795
gives you a sense of the costs
involved in very personal terms.

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.594
Obviously, it would also have an
impact on our economy, because

00:01:55.594 --> 00:02:00.161
if this family has a couple of
thousand dollars less to spend,

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.161
that translates into $200
billion of less consumer

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:06.194
spending next year.

00:02:06.194 --> 00:02:09.394
And that's bad for
businesses large and small.

00:02:09.394 --> 00:02:10.594
It's bad for our economy.

00:02:10.594 --> 00:02:13.795
It means less folks are being
hired, and we can be back in a

00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:18.628
downward spiral instead of the
kind of virtuous cycle that we

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:19.661
want to see.

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:25.294
So the message that I got from
Tiffany and the message that I

00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:28.227
think we all want to send to
members of Congress is this

00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:31.027
is a solvable problem.

00:02:31.027 --> 00:02:34.661
The Senate has already passed a
bill that would make sure that

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:38.928
middle-class taxes do not go
up next year by a single dime.

00:02:38.928 --> 00:02:42.294
Ninety-eight percent of
Americans whose incomes are

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:46.795
$250,000 a year or less
would not see any increases.

00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:49.328
Ninety-seven percent of small
businesses would not see any

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:51.061
increases in their income taxes.

00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:55.861
And even folks who make more
than $250,000 would still have

00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:59.361
a tax break for their
incomes up to $250,000.

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:03.895
So 100% of Americans actually
would be keeping a portion of

00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:07.795
their tax cuts, and 98% of them
would not be seeing any increase

00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:09.361
in their income tax.

00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:11.828
That's the right thing
to do for our economy.

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:14.528
It's the right thing
to do for families like

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:15.961
Tiffany's and Richard's.

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:20.227
And it's very important
that we get this done now,

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.428
that we don't wait.

00:03:22.428 --> 00:03:24.728
We're in the midst of the
Christmas season; I think the

00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:27.328
American people are counting
on this getting solved.

00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:32.561
The closer it gets to the
brink, the more stressed

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.328
they're going to be.

00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:37.194
Businesses are making decisions
right now about investment and

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:39.328
hiring, and if they don't have
confidence that we can get this

00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:43.594
thing done, then they're going
to start pulling back and we

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:47.061
could have a rocky time in our
economy over the next several

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:49.294
months, or even next year.

00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:55.494
So I'm encouraged to see that
there's been some discussion

00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:59.394
on the part of Republicans
acknowledging the need for

00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:01.027
additional revenue.

00:04:01.027 --> 00:04:04.461
As I've indicated, the only way
to get the kind of revenue for a

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:08.861
balanced deficit reduction plan
is to make sure that we're also

00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.895
modestly increasing rates for
people who can afford it --

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:14.161
folks like me.

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:19.561
For folks who are in the top 2%,
we can afford to have a modest

00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:21.127
rate increase.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:24.261
That allows us to not only
reduce our deficit in a

00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:26.494
balanced, responsible way,
it also allows us to make

00:04:26.494 --> 00:04:30.695
investments in education, in
making college affordable, in

00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:33.261
putting folks back to work,
and investing in basic research

00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:35.328
that's important
for our economy.

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:38.928
And I think we all recognize
that there are some smart cuts

00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:40.628
we've got to make in government.

00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:42.828
We're going to have to
strengthen our entitlement

00:04:42.828 --> 00:04:45.494
programs so that they're
there for future generations.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:49.961
Everybody is going to have to
share in some sacrifice, but it

00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:54.361
starts with folks who are in the
best position to sacrifice, who

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:57.961
are in the best position to do
a little bit more to step up.

00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:00.061
And that's what my plan does.

00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:05.461
So just to be clear, I'm not
going to sign any package that

00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:09.594
somehow prevents the top
rate from going up for folks

00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:11.961
at the top 2%.

00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:16.061
But I do remain optimistic that
we can get something done that

00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:22.061
is good for families like this
one's and that is good for the

00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:23.094
American economy.

00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:23.895
All right.

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:24.994
Thank you very much, everybody.
