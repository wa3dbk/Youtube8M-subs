00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.710
When someone says to me "I've just played
an Indie game."

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.059
I must admit my brain almost immediately engages
in to its all-too-commonly used 'snark' mode

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.610
and I wonder what pixel-art coated, chip-tune
blaring, low-resolution, and philosophical

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.110
narrative they could be talking about.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.511
Truth be told, while many gamers may make
fun of these 'experience' driven titles, they

00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:31.340
approach gaming as a media in a way that can
result in a far deeper sense of satisfaction

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.899
than simply breaking bricks with your head.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.500
These Robotic Hearts of Mine by Alan Hazelden
is a short tale of love and robots played

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.300
out over a series of puzzles that entwine
directly with the narrative.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.649
Your task on each of the puzzles is to simply
use rotating gears in order to shift and align

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.269
hearts so they all point upwards.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.539
The way in which the game's mechanics mirror
the actions of the characters in the story

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.210
helps to engage the player, making the later
stages all the harder to complete; not just

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.350
because they're more challenging, but because
of what they represent in terms of the narrative

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.480
itself.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.970
Should you find yourself truly engaging with
the story, the final scene is sure to pull

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.970
at your heart-strings.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.620
As a concession to the style of puzzle being
used, the developer has included two features

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.020
that help you to keep track of just how well
you're going compared to everyone else who

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.260
has played the game.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.390
Aside from a counter indicating the minimum
amount of moves required (or rather what is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.260
considered the minimum), once a puzzle is
solved you're presented with a graph showing

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.700
your number of moves and an indicator of how
many others matched your count.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.800
It's a novel feature, if unrelated to the
story in general.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.270
Ultimately, These Robotic Hearts of Mine is
hard to recommend to most gamers as, much

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.940
like approaching a challenging poem, it requires
a mindset ready to absorb and explore its

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.270
deeper implications.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.430
As a puzzler it will tickle your mind and
as a story it's enjoyable, but without each

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.640
other they're far from the best the iOS platform
has seen.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.070
Caution is advised, but should you engage
fully it's a magical experience to absorb

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.820
and enjoy.
