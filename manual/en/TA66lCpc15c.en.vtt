Hi! My name is Elizabeth, and on behalf of
Expert Village, we’re continuing in our

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.600
series of tips and techniques for embossing
when making cards. In this segment, we’re

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.740
going to talk about what is called the stained
glass technique. I already have here a prestamped

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.890
and colored image. This is a stamped image
that has been enhanced with some chalk. What

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.750
I’m going to do is take this square rubber
wood mounted stamp and ink it up with my embossing

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:40.610
ink. You want to make sure that is well covered
in the ink, and then I’m going to stamp

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.590
this right on top of my image, pressing firmly
down and coming straight up. Then I’m going

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.810
to take this image and sprinkle on the clear
embossing powder, making sure that there is

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:06.630
good coverage all around the image. At this
point, put this out of the way, and then we’ll

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:17.479
heat emboss. You will notice as the embossing
powder melts, that because it is clear, the

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:25.780
image and the colors underneath will come
through nicely. As similar as was done in

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.439
our image embossing, while it’s still hot,
we’re going to put more clear embossing

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:42.710
powder on here. Sprinkle it off and heat emboss.
If you have a pair of crafting tweezers or

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.939
scrap booking tweezers, this is a good time
to use them to hold the corners so that you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.689
don’t burn your fingers. You don’t have
to worry about hitting your fingers with that

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:01.109
hot blast of air. Just very similar to image
embossed that we did in the previous segment.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:10.539
We’re going to do 5-6 layers of embossing.
So just continue to emboss so that you’ll

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.569
have 5 or 6 layers of clear embossing powder
heated on your image.
