What's up fish thank people. Fishtanktv.com, Dustin's fish tanks bringing it to you on a Sunday. It's species Sunday. I've got so many species coming out of my ears. I'm just going to show you them all. Give you a little taste of what's going on. Do the species individually. Love your feedback on some of the fish that I've got.
Thank goodness for fluvals lying around cause these things have been a lifesaver. 
Alright, so where do I begin? Let's see here. The most common fish that I saw in Peru were these Apistogrammas. I believe that a Bitaeniata right there. "Bi" meaning two lines. A lot of females and males. There's the random corydoras, whitesman corydoras that I actually bought at the wholesaler. I'll show you his whole school that he's living with. Look at that apisto right there though. I've got a ton of apisto's in here that I'm going to have to separate them out once they get going cause the males will get pissed and start beating on each other. But there's a lot of apistogramma in here so I'm really excited about that.
It's one of those fish that I knew would ship well, really hardy. Check out the fins on that one. And they are only going to get better, with better color. So they have eaten, that's huge. I've fed them a bunch last night, bloodworms, so those are rocking.
Also, there's a tone of miscellaneous catfish in here, there's another Apisto back there. The tanks are all cloudy, just the fronts of them cause I've been in and out working on them doing a lot of water changes.
Look at these Whitesman cory cats though. I went to buy these and the guy was like, "Those are special". And I was like "Really, tell me why". It looks like there is twice as many as there is because of the reflection which is what they are loving. They haven't left this corner, they just sat in this corner and just played, and played and played. I bought like, one, two, three, four, five six. I bought like seven of them and they said these corys are great cause they like cold water. My tank's kind of cold so I'm really excited about that.
They come from the lakes in the Andes, and the water freezes at night. So they are a potential to go out in the greenhouse this winter so I'm pretty excited. Anyone who knows anything about Whitesman Cory Cats let me know. Here's some Apistogrammas just dominating right now.
As far as casualties go, um I've only had. Ah, you're awesome, I'm so glad I brought.. And I haven't seen these fish, they've been just awake for a while. That's a nice looking Apistogramma Bitaeniata right there.
Acclimating these fish though, I floated them for 6 hours, added about 8 ounces to each bag, then removed some of the water as I was doing that. Slowly, slowly acclimating them, then I just put them in.
A few floaters in the bags, which makes me nervous that there was an ammonia spike or whatever.
It's funny cause the old. I love dirt, I think it's awesome for almost everything except for fish you get in the wild that naturally dig it up like this catfish right here that just digs up under it. I'm not sure if you can see him right there. So I got a bunch of those in there. They're like a relative of cichlids.
I've also got a really tripped out. Oh, this little dude right here. I forget what it's called.  Brian loves it, it's actually going in Brian's tank for all his help. I had six of them, only one of them made it.
And then I also had six of these boys. No Altums, but I had six of these, but three of them made it, and they ate bloodworms last night so I'm real jacked about that.  Really cool, I mean these fish were all over the place down there. And I love their long fins and they are going to be really sweet once they get used to me, but they need a water change. I've got about fifty Loretta Ensis I believe is what you say, the Cory cats. I'm not sure if you can see those. I actually caught about have of these myself, and the other half Devon, whose info by the way, the info on this trip is down in the body of those comments. Sorry the body of the writeup on these Devon's email's in there so you can get a hold of him.
So, a lot of these Cory Cats. It's funny they actually came from a beach, I'm actually thinking about adding some white sand. You can see their coloration really matched well, they are sitting up there. My Swartz and sturbays instantly scame out of this tank, it was hilarious. I added a bunch of Cory Cats and boom, they all popped up.
There's those guys.
So that's what's up down here folks. Really excited. I've got to do probably about a 40% water change in this sucker here, and then a 40 on the other. Just cause there is so much more ammonia in these tanks. And I keep my tanks pretty lightly stocked as you all know so I definitely have some work ahead of me tonight.
But that's what's going on. I wanted to share. For some reason these two Cory cats don't hang out with the rest. Like these ones are just like over there just nuts. So that's what I'm doing folks. I'm really excited. I appreciate all the feedback on the last video. Barowello right there. And I'm just having a good time. It's kind of stressful as I have to get them all acclimated, you know, and keep doing water changes so it's a lot higher fish load and a little more work, but, you know, it's worth the work. That's what's up. Whitesman Cory Cats. Tell me about them.
