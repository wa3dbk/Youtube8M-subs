00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.360
So many nights

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.900
I've watched you sleep

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.940
(watched you sleep)

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.960
Tried to resist

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.400
but it got so deep

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.260
(got so deep)

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.640
And when you're next to me

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.860
you're still out of my reach

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.420
But I just long for you

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.420
My soul is dark, I seize the night

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.940
(seize the night)

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.240
But your the angel that showed me the light

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.100
(show me the light)

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.680
And I try to be strong,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.500
but I still long for you.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.380
I look into your heart,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.640
and discover myself

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.440
but I'll never be

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.560
a part of your world

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.160
I need you

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.660
Can’t reach you

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.920
we're worlds apart

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.940
If you need me,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.100
look into your heart.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.760
You tamed the beast,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.800
I bleed for you

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.280
(I bleed for you)

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.860
You showed me love,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.820
that's something I never knew

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.960
(never knew)

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.800
I'll take the blame,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.100
my life's a shame,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.340
But I just long for you.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.360
Don’t wait for me.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.120
(don’t wait for me girl)

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.320
I'll never be

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.080
(a part of your world)

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.880
But I'm in your heart …

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.160
forever

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.360
I look into your heart,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.660
and discover myself,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.220
but I'll never be

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.180
a part of your world

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.180
I need you (need you)

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.540
can’t reach you (reach you)

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.520
we're worlds apart

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.280
If you need me,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.840
look into your heart.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.320
I look into your heart and discover myself

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.560
(myself)

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.800
but I'll never be a part of your world
(I'll never be a part of your world)

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.700
I  need you

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.960
can’t reach you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.760
(I can't reach you, babe)
we're worlds apart

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.140
If you need me,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.800
look into your heart.
