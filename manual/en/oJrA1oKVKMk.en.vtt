00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.279
How to Draw a Dragon.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.010
Put your imagination in high gear and you'll
soon be drawing a mythical, magical fire-breathing

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.660
dragon.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.680
You will need A graphite pencil Paper and
an eraser.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.800
Step 1.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.679
Draw a sideways S to establish a side view
of the dragon's body.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.580
Add an oval onto the left tip of the S for
the head.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.660
Connect the right end of the S to the center
point of the S to form the body.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.350
Draw your basic form lightly so you can erase
unwanted lines later.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.720
Step 2.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.390
Widen the dragon's neck by adding a line following
the upper curve of the left portion of the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.920
sideways S, connecting it to the body.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.649
Draw a long triangle-shaped tail, making sure
it flows from the top of the dragon's spine.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.899
Add a small triangle to the tail's tip.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.340
Dragon drawings often combine invented and
real animal body parts.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.960
Study reptile and bat photos, to foster ideas
for creating your own original drawing.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.960
Step 3.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.049
Lay in a vertical oval shape at the lower
right edge of the body to represent hindquarters.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.479
Draw an elongated oval at the end of the hindquarters
and another near the front edge of the body

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.100
for feet.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.100
Add triangle shapes to the feet for claws.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.130
Step 4.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.250
Draw a pointed umbrella shape originating
from the dragon's mid-neck for the single

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.830
wing visible from this view.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.909
It can be as large as you want, but be sure
that the umbrella points downward.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.909
Step 5.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.991
Draw pointed ears on each side of the dragon's
head.

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:56.659
Add eyes, nostrils, a mouth, and teeth.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.840
Step 6.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.530
Erase your guidelines and round out your form.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.420
Apply shading to shadowed areas to add realism
and depth to your drawing.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.500
Step 7.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.200
Add scales to the dragon's chest by overlaying
scallop shapes from the neck to the feet.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.870
Add a series of small triangular points along
the spine.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.290
Step 8.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.340
Draw fiery flames shooting from the dragon's
mouth for the final fearsome touch.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.780
Now, stretch your imagination even further
and create a friend for your dragon.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.700
Did you know The Komodo dragon is the world's
largest lizard, weighing in at up to several

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.459
hundred pounds.
