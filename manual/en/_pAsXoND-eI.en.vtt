Hey, I'm ZC... Your Splinter Cell Community Developer...

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.539
In this week's Blacklist ComDev video, we're speaking to those who embody the characteristics

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.910
of both the Ghost and the Panther... the stealthy-folk who, when choosing to strike, do so from the shadows...

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.390
but remain undetected. We'll begin on this rainy rooftop...

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.859
a nice place to show off the variety of non-lethal takedowns.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.210
We'll look at the Assault approach -- which is lethal, and action-heavy -- in the coming months...

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.619
But for now, let's keep it quiet...

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.530
K: The theme we're going for, is we're trying to find unmatched fluidity;

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.410
with Sam, with the environment, with his moves;

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.539
We're really trying to show that Sam has a move for every situation.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420
We take a lot of things into account:

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.400
we take the position of where Sam is, we take the situation that Sam is in, whether it's lethal or non-lethal,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.830
and then we add all of that together... and that will give you each one

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:12.989
of our unique moves.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:17.390
When you're coming up behind someone, obviously we want to take them out quickly and efficiently.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:25.400
So we found a good way of doing it is basically going for nerves in the back of the head, back of the neck.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.670
We go for kidneys, as well. Again, we try to go for that idea of sound suppression.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.890
So it basically gives Sam some more time to do what he needs to do.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.570
But the first action is always going to be some sort of suppression.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.000
We have combat, we have stealth, we have lethal, we have non-lethal, we have abductions

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.090
which are combat and stealth, lethal and non-lethal.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.010
Then we have takedowns in the open which are lethal/non-lethal... combat/stealth, so... number-wise,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.010
I'm thinking we've got 90-plus moves.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.769
The thinking behind the abductions: to me, it's a perfect fit for Splinter Cell.

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:14.930
I mean Sam pounces from the shadow; he attacks from the shadows. So what better way to do that than use cover...

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.930
and make cover your weapon.

00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:25.968
With the stealth abductions, the philosophy behind that is we always bring into cover.

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:30.340
So it's Sam hiding the body, trying to suppress the body; trying to keep it quiet.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.489
With the combat abductions: Sam's not concerned about hiding the body, because he's already been detected.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.489
It's about dropping the body as efficiently as possible.
