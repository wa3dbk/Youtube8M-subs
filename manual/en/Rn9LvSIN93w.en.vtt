Hello everyone.

00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:07.779
In this tutorial we will see how to change
the password of an apple id in case if you

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:08.779
forgot.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:09.940
How to reset the password.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.040
This is the part two of the part two of the
tutorial.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:24.730
In part 1 we reset the forgotten password
by sending an email to the email address which

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.160
we had used while creating an apple id.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.070
Now in this tutorial we will reset the password
by answering the security questions.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.329
Now click on the this "Reset your password"
link.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.079
Enter the apple id of your apple id.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.920
Now the first one we already used to reset
or change the password by sending an email

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.329
to the email address which we had used for
creating an apple id.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.400
Now the second method is by answering the
security questions.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.240
When we created an apple id we had answered
three security questions.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.340
Now with the help of that those three security
questions we can reset or change the apple

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.820
id password if we forget it.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.040
Click on "Next" button.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:31.420
Now you need to enter your date of birth.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.600
Now press on next button.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.130
You need to answer the question.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.750
After answering the security questions, press
on "Next" button.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.990
Now you need to enter your new apple id password.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.710
And this new apple id password must not have
been, must not have been used before.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.440
If you have already used this apple password
for this apple id then it won't be accepted.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:23.569
So, just think about a new password.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.120
Then click on this "Reset Password" button.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.480
Now, there is a message which shows me that
my password has been reset.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.659
So, in this way if I forgot my apple id password,
I can reset it with the help of the security

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.659
questions.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:54.099
Now, let me return to my apple id and check
whether it is working or not.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.959
Let me "Log in".

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.810
Yeah, I can successfully log into my apple
id.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.359
So, this is how you can reset if your forget
your apple id password.
