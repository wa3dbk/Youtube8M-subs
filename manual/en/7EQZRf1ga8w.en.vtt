00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.240
So have you been prescribed by your General
Dentist or by your Orthodontist that you need

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.200
Orthodontic Records and you're just not quite
sure what that is? Well, my name is Michelle

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.549
and I'm a Dental Assistant with Solutionz
and I'm going to kind of show you what Orthodontic

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:21.949
Records are. Basically, what Orthodontic Records
are, is it's a pre-treatment before you get

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.699
Orthodontic braces. And first of all the Orthodontist
will need to take upper and lower impressions

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.140
of your teeth and once when they do that,
they actually pour those impressions up in

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.140
a stone plaster base and actually creates
a model of your teeth. So therefore, she can

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.850
kind of study your teeth in depth and kind
of see on the different anglations or the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.230
crowdingness of your teeth. Also, she'll probably
want you to have what we call as Cephalometric

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.579
xray which is this xray right here. This xray
is a side profile view of your teeth and how

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.989
you bit down on your back teeth. And also
shows your spine, it shows your jaw alignment,

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.850
how far your overbite is; so that means whenever
you bite down, how far your upper teeth stick

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.340
out in front of your lower teeth. Therefore,
once when she has this, she can take that

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.530
home, she'll be able to study this xray and
she'll be able to make her measurements to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.280
determine on the perfect treatment for you.
Also to, she might require that you have a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.190
Panorax xray which is a long xray. This is
normally done in case for Orthodontic Records

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.390
or to determine on where your wisdom teeth
are at. Basically, it's a machine that you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.780
go in and the machine goes all the way around
your head and then it produces an xray that

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.010
looks like this. This will show your bone
alignments on, if you've had any bone loss

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.350
or how many teeth you have, if you have any
impacted teeth. These are all the different

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.120
types of procedures that need to be done in
order to determine the correct Orthodontic

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.920
treatment that you'll need. So once again,
my name is Michelle and I'm a Dental Assistant

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.989
with Solutionz and I just explained to you
on why you would be needing Orthodontic Records.
