00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.940
The ultra light weight Mountain Hardwear Ghost
Whisperer down jacket.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.719
It combines two revolutionary technologies,
one in the fabric and one in the actual down

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.089
used to insulate the jacket.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:21.740
It gives you an ultra compressible, ultra
light weight, very versatile jacket for different

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.820
types of conditions.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.260
I can see it just as a great stand alone jacket
by itself.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.360
But layered with other pieces, it makes it
very versatile.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.129
The stand out feature of this jacket is the
outer shell fabric which is Mountain Hardwear’s

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.550
renowned Ghost Whisperer fabric.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.079
It has a very tight weave.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.140
It is naturally down proof.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.250
It is naturally wind proof and water resistant
and so it gives you just really light weight

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.320
feel and keeps the weight of the jacket down
significantly.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.219
The down that is used to insulate the jacket
is high quality 800 fill Q shield down.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.500
And what is so important about Q shield down
is that each individual plume of down is treated

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.110
to be water resistant.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.110
So unlike traditional down, when this becomes
wet or when it is subject to moisture it is

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.110
going to dry out faster.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.530
It is going to keep you warmer longer and
ultimately perform better in damp conditions.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.150
So you can wear this jacket longer.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.160
It is going to stand up to conditions that
would typically either force you to go home

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.350
or to quit in harsh conditions.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.240
So definitely a very technical piece here.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.780
True to the ultra light weight concept of
this jacket the features are really simple

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.340
and really clean.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.410
You have got a light weight, full length zipper
in this jacket with a ultra light weight stretchy

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.310
draw cord at the bottom and you can adjust
it from one side.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.270
So if you cinch that down it can really hold
in your heat, but it is not weighing down

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.730
the jacket at all.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.770
You have got just two hand warmer pockets
here and they are set up high enough that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.020
if you are wearing a climbing harness or a
back pack, you can still access these hand

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.420
warmer pockets.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.990
And the jacket actually stuffs down into one
of the pockets.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.140
Other than that, you just have simple stretchy
cuffs and a nicely baffled collar.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.250
The fit and feel of this jacket in my opinion
is really great.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.420
My first impression when I put it on is that
it is really warm right away, but it feels

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.530
really light weight on.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.740
It feels really airy.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.050
I feel like I can definitely move in this
jacket.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.270
I am wearing a small right now and I typically
wear smalls in other brands in outerwear pieces

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.959
and this fits really well.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.500
I can definitely get some more layers underneath
of it, but I don’t have a lot of room.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.980
I am just wearing a light weight t-shirt today.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.030
And it is low profile enough that I could
put layers over top.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.050
So if you would want to get a waterproof shell
over top it is not too bulky.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.070
Definitely a great mid layer, great layering
piece.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.980
Just very, very light weight in general.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.910
Like I said the jacket does stuff down really
small into this pocket.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.670
So we are going to stuff it down and show
you how small and compressible that is.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.830
As you can see, I have got it stuffed down
into that pocket and just to show you how

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.270
light weight, small, compressible that 800
fill down really is.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.860
Got a two way zipper on that pocket and you
can see one of them says: Stow.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.209
So you know which one it goes into.

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.330
And on the inside of the pocket you do have
a little webbing loop so you can attach it

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.260
to a harness or to the outside of a backpack
if you need to get your hands on it quickly.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.690
Just with all of the features combining the
ultra light weight fabrics, the Q shield 800

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.319
fill down and all the other light weight features
about this jacket, it is definitely your go

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.280
to technical light weight down jacket.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.790
It is Mountain Hardwear’s Women’s Ghost
Whisperer down jacket.
