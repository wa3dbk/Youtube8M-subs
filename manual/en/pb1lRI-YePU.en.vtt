00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.210
Did you know that bees are out there talking
to each other right now?

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.850
The honeybee performs a waggle and rotation
dance to share information about the location

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.350
and distance of a nearby point of interest.
Let’s say you’re stuck in a beehive, and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.360
your friendly hive busy bee goes out foraging.
On her journey she finds a flower full of

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.110
powdery pollen. She heads back to tell you
and the rest of the hive where this

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.119
flower is.
How? Distance and direction, my friend.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.800
She makes a waggle run, shaking it back and
forth real fast while she kind of walks in

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.230
this straight line. When she gets to the end,
she turns to the left, circles back to the

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.730
start. Waggle run again, now turn to the right,
back to the start, waggle run again, turn

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.730
to the left… got the idea? Do we really
need like a whole electronic bee dance mix?

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.120
What’s really cool is that the length of
this waggle run varies, and it varies in a

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.120
way that’s precisely related to bee travel
distance. Closer destination, shorter waggle.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.859
In fact, with every second a waggle run lasts,
the bee’s telling you to travel 1km. So,

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.499
what, we have kilometers and miles and bees
have waggle waggles?

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:21.499
Okay, 1 kilometer, ready to go! But go where?
Like a compass, up is the bee’s point of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.929
reference, which is the sun. Up means towards
the sun. The angle of the waggle run tells

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.569
you where to keep the sun in your sky while
you travel. Combine that angle with your distance,

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.659
and you’re ready to go!
Other info might be actually hiding in this

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.289
“shake ’n rotate” routine, like familiarity:
experienced bees might pay particular attention

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.590
to the smell of a familiar flower coming off
the dancer.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.419
Or maybe danger, with the dancer circling
around to do fewer waggle runs if the destination

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:57.049
is a dangerous target.
If we compare other bees in other parts of

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.310
the world, we even find waggle dialects and
the possibility of social learning.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.610
