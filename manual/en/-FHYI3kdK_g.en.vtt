00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:13.680
"Unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins" - Jesus (John 8:24)

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.740
I felt alone in the world on my own then You came to me

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.280
Hope flowing through my veins

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.890
I was lost in the black so far gone

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.769
Then You drank my shame letting sin flow through Your veins

00:00:44.769 --> 00:01:28.509
Lord You are good oh God You're so good

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:42.880
You were there from the start before it all
Still You left Your throne love flowing down in the flesh

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.720
Born to serve born to heal and to lay your life

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:56.580
You're the final offering cause up from the grave you arose

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:54.100
Lord you are good, O God, you're so good

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:21.620
Oh the miracle, you're the miracle that makes the dead come alive

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.380
Let me take a little second to tell you as we see a prophecy that came true

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.380
You see we need to believe that he literally bled through

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.560
the clothes on his back his sweat the day was just like crimson rain

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.000
crimson stains, tide bounty and the devil can't wash these stains away

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.680
Who's he you ask he's a friend of me

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.600
cause in my inability he was sent for me

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.280
I hear birds and trees there all telling me

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.120
it's a good thing he won Gethsemane

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.800
cause this enemy is to much for me

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800
and this flesh and world are triple teaming me

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.560
it seems to be the very end I scream please oh please pass this cup from me!

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.320
The thing is it did pass

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.000
and it passes every day

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.600
he took my cup from me and gracefully he drank the grave

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.560
and I don't mean to speak blasphemy when I say

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.720
but I am speaking of the day when my God passed away, Okay?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.680
no wait wait wait no that's not it no that's not all

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.840
I don't wanna leave you hanging, this stories banging against my throat and against these walls

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.520
It can’t be contained no it won’t stay in here it will thrive

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.120
cause stories just don't die when the dead come alive

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:47.440
Oh the miracle You're the miracle
That makes the dead come alive

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:56.380
He Himself bore our sins in His body

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:05.900
That we might die to sin and live to righteousness

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.680
By His wounds you have been healed (1 Peter 2:24)
