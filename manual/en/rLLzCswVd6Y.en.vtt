Hi! We are Nick and Valerie Wisniewski on
behalf of expertvillage.com. We are here to

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:23.310
talk about animal tracks and for more information
you can visit our website at walnuthillstracking.com.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.439
There on the ground in front of us weâ€™ve
got many different animal tracks including

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.960
raccoon, human being but we are mostly interested
in this pair of coyotes that were traveling

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.800
through here. This particular track here is
what we would call a direct register. It is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.110
a little bit sloppy for coyotes but when we
talk about direct register what we mean is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.610
that the front foot and the hind foot step
in almost the exactly the same place. Often

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.649
times it is impossible to even decipher the
fact that there were two tracks there so neatly

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.810
placed. That is a characteristic of coyotes.
Here we have a little bit different thing

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.500
going on. This is what we would call an indirect
register and an indirect register means that

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.580
instead of the hind foot landing where the
front foot was, it will step off to the side

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.200
a little bit or a little bit to the front
or a little bit hind giving an indirect register.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.360
Normally the coyote travels in what we call
a direct register trot. When is doing something

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.270
else it is useful to know track patterns because
they can tell a little bit about behavior.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.040
Here we made a plaster cast of a coyote in
the area and this particular coyote was moving

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.979
at what we call an overstep walk. This is
the front foot and this is the hind foot.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.579
When a coyote does this, it is not a normal
way that it moves about the landscape. Knowing

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.280
this can tell us a little bit about its behavior.
Its behavior has changed. It is no longer

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.829
in a trot. It is moving into something a little
bit faster than a trot called an overstep

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:14.080
trot. Another animal that will leave a similar
pattern on the ground is a bobcat. Here we

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.959
have a plaster cast of a bobcat track, two
tracks; the front and the hind. This bobcat

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.010
is also doing an overstep but for the bobcat
that is one of its most common ways of moving

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.720
around the landscape. So we can tell by comparing
those two patterns they the eastern coyote

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.570
is transitioning out of its preferred method
of locomotion to something else whereas here

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.950
the bobcat is moving about in its preferred
way of moving around the landscape. Knowing

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.300
this kind of information can help you decipher
behavior of animals.
