We’re Adam and Joanne from InspiredTaste.net
and welcome to our kitchen.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.750
We’re making our homemade tahini recipe.
Its&nbsp;easy and&nbsp;much&nbsp;less&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;than&nbsp;buying&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;store.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.410
Here’s how we do it:

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.270
You only need three ingredients when making
tahini — sesame seeds, a little oil and

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.110
salt.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:36.880
Add the sesame&nbsp;seeds&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wide,&nbsp;dry&nbsp;saucepan&nbsp;over&nbsp;medium-low&nbsp;heat&nbsp;and&nbsp;toast,&nbsp;stirring&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;until&nbsp;the&nbsp;seeds&nbsp;become&nbsp;fragrant&nbsp;and&nbsp;very&nbsp;lightly&nbsp;colored,
not&nbsp;brown.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.739
This takes 3 to 5 minutes. Careful though,&nbsp;sesame&nbsp;seeds&nbsp;can&nbsp;burn&nbsp;quickly.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.700
Add the toasted sesame&nbsp;seeds&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;bowl&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;food&nbsp;processor
and let it cool for a few minutes.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.120
Once they are cool, process until&nbsp;a&nbsp;crumbly&nbsp;paste&nbsp;forms.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:08.630
Now to help things along, add some oil — a
neutral flavored oil like grape seed oil is

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:33.229
best — then&nbsp;process&nbsp;for&nbsp;2&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;more
— we’re almost there --

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:49.560
When its smooth and pourable. Add a little
salt and process a few times to mix it in.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.439
Give it a taste then transfer your homemade
tahini to a container or jar and store in

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.439
the fridge for up to one month — Or, keep
it out and use it by making one of the&nbsp;most&nbsp;well&nbsp;known&nbsp;ways

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.399
to&nbsp;use&nbsp;tahini — Hummus. Hop over to our
