Hi, I'm Ann Myrick, and today I'm going to
show you how to choose a color scheme to work

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.579
with. What you want to do is try to look at
the room, look at the area. What it--wherever

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:19.850
it is that we're going to be working, look
and is there already something there. Is there

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.380
something you already have to use, so that
will have to be taken into consideration,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:34.059
but really it's wide open. I'm a decorator,
and I love working with what people have.

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:42.120
I tend to love color on the walls, but I also
tend to like, at times, I am very monochromatic,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.350
in I love, like this is one of my rooms, and
you will see a lot of wood and dark and brown.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.469
I just tend not to--I really like the calmness
of having a lot of natural texture, a lot

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.210
of natural wood, but not a whole lot of bright
color in certain areas. Now, in a play room

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:13.600
in a certain area, I might like the zippy
color, but like in this room, I like using

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:22.530
the neutrals. I love using all the natural
textures. This is a color that I really would

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.350
say is not a good color to work with especially
on the wall because I think it turns out fleshy.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.420
This was--this color was here before I got
here, and so these walls will be changed to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.270
a more neutral color that is softer. This
is a little bit fleshy for me, but what I

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.610
do in working with a color scheme is what
colors do I like, what colors really interest

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.890
me, what things do I have that I have certain
colors in that I can pull out. An example

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:06.730
is I have this chair, and so this chair has
greens in it, whites in it, orange, yellows

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.430
in it and reds in it, so you can really pull
out a few colors and work with it. But what

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.080
I don't like about a color scheme is a lot
of times people will stay just with that color

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.550
scheme and, you know, things that shouldn't
even be colored, they put in the colored scheme

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.490
like I really don't like colored candles.
To me, colored--there shouldn't be colored

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.650
candles. It should just be a natural color.
So, don't buy a red candle. Buy just a neutral

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.040
candle, and try to be careful that you don't
over kill your color scheme. This is Ann Myrick,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.989
and that is how you choose a color scheme
for rooms.
