00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.660
So, Chris, let's start with you.
You are Mr. Robotics; correct?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.480
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: Yes.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: And when you were ten

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.170
years old, how predictable was it that you
might be going into robotics?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.379
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: I don't know about robotics,
but I think engineering was pretty clear,

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:32.070
I think. I literally -- on my parents' fridge
right now, there's literally still a picture

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.829
there with the sweater vest and the glasses
with tape in the middle. So I think it was

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.079
pretty preordained.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: It was not Halloween.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.489
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: It was not Halloween, sadly.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: And you knew you wanted

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.820
to go into engineering and technology. What
first caught your eye then about robotics

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.390
in particular.
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: I actually didn't really think

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.630
about robotics until I was finishing up my
undergraduate degree. And I had an opportunity

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.239
to go work in telecom. And I was walking around
the engineering building, and I saw this poster

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.990
with this robot crawling into a volcano. And
I thought, "Shit, that's awesome." You know,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.690
I could go deal with telecom stuff or go do
something cool and real. And I thought, that's

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.030
the thing to do.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: And what have you done

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.030
since?
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: I've been working in robotics

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.749
for, I don't know, 12, 13 years, something
like that. I've been involved with a lot of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:24.961
vehicles that drive themselves. And recently
came to Google to lead the self-driving car

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.999
project here.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: Got it. And I understand

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.881
you have a video that you can narrate for
us a little bit about the project.

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:35.170
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: So this is a video showing
our car driving itself in and around the Bay

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.999
Area in San Francisco.
We built a fleet of seven self-driving Priuses.

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:48.920
Take a Prius, put crap on it.
We take it out on the road and have it drive

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.659
around. Here is on the freeway. So we can
do surface roads. We, of course, do that in

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.929
traffic. The sensors we have on the vehicle
allow us to operate day and night.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.969
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: Was that planned?
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: No. I tell you, that was an

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.929
exciting moment.
The vehicles can do basically anything that

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.160
a person can do. So they can see all the way
around them, they can make lane changes, we

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.030
can see pedestrians and track them, we can
see traffic lights. And we have 360-degree

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.382
perception around the vehicle, so we can understand
what traffic is doing in the neighborhood.

00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:24.170
The vehicles can drive at freeway speeds.
They can do it precisely. So here we go through

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.920
a toll booth.
They can do it in urban areas. So this is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.340
a resort town near San Francisco. All of this
is the car driving. So it's seeing the pedestrians

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.140
reasoning about them, moving around.
This is Lombard Street. It's a very scenic

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.460
place in San Francisco. It is also home to
the dumbest pedestrians on Earth. They walk

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.730
in with the traffic. It's amazing.
The cars are able to do, you know, pretty

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.440
much anything a person can. So here we are
in a construction zone, merging with other

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.000
traffic. Then we're going to get back on the
freeway here and have to deal with the fact

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.990
that it's a short merge and there's traffic
whizzing by at 70 miles an hour.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.790
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: Does the car have an
aggressiveness setting?

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.520
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: Doesn't yet, no. It's set
to 11.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.930
And then, of course, we do a lot of testing
on the track as well. So we joked we're the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.810
Prius drifting team sometimes.
So part of how it works is that we use some

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.170
of the best maps in the world. So we've taken
Google Maps and taken it to the next level.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.590
We have 15-centimeter resolution models of
the world, and we have lane-level models of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.440
the world as well that kind of feed into the
car how it drives.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.580
And then in real time, we take laser data
from the vehicle and we process about a million

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.462
and a half thousand measurements per second,
and from that we cluster out where other people

00:03:35.462 --> 00:03:40.060
are, where other vehicles are, and are able
to track them, bicycles, and whatnot.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.310
We've also done some work with radar. So here,
this is a radar like you might have in your

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.480
expensive luxury car for adaptive cruise control.
We've taken that, refined the algorithms,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.760
and then used that to make the thing work.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: Incredible.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.510
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: So from your point of

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.120
view, is the aim here just to deliver a really
cool car that drives well? Or is there a larger

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.630
strategy afoot?
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: So, you know, our goal at

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.200
Google is to advance this technology. We think
in the long term this has got a tremendous

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.400
societal benefit. Worldwide, there's something
like 1.2 million people killed in traffic

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.310
accidents each year. If you look at the utilization
of automobiles through the day, it's about

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.189
3% in the developed world. So you buy a car,
it sits there 97% of the time. By developing

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.759
this technology, in the long term, we think
we can reduce traffic accidents, we can give

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.580
people back their time when they're driving,
and we can make better uses of the resources

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.650
we have.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: Amazing.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.870
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: Thank you.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: And you started on the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.639
robotics team at Carnegie-Mellon University.
Can you tell us a little bit about the innovative

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.330
environment and any differences between academia
and corporate zone.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.189
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: Sure. I've worked at Google
and at Carnegie-Mellon. Carnegie-Mellon was

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:55.879
fantastic. There's lots of brilliant people
there. But it's a university. And so it's,

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.110
you know, somewhat resource constrained. When
you come to Google, again, we have the same

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.520
caliber or higher caliber of people, and we
effectively have, you know, unlimited resources.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.909
So for an academic, it's magical.
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: So you're trying to recruit

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.819
all your former fellow academics, at least
the good ones?

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.789
&gt;&gt;Chris Urmson: Yes.
[ Laughter ]

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.520
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain: Amazing.
