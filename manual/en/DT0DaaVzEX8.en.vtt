Hi I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about how to remove fingernail polish

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.220
from a carpet. I have a sample down here and
you can see we have this nice bright red spot

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.110
of fingernail polish that has been dropped
on the carpet. What we want to start off with

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.250
first is Hydrogen Peroxide is a good solution
to start off with first. It will remove a

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.770
lot of your common stains. The important thing
is that you want to start out with something

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:39.530
that is the least damaging or at least is
a chemical or a solution that is as weak as

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.699
possible because you don't want to damage
your carpet when you are doing this. So what

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.829
we'll do is we can either blot the Peroxide
on or in this case pour a little bit in your

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.429
cap so you can control it and you can actually
pour it right over the stain. You might want

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.179
to let that set a little bit and then go back
to blotting. It is very important whenever

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.760
we are trying to remove any kind of stain
out of a carpet you want to blot this, you

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.040
don't want to rub this at all. Rubbing will
just disturb your fibers and it will also

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.550
just spread the stain so to keep it isolated
we want to just keep blotting it. Now if that

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.890
is not working then the next thing we can
go to is make a solution of baking soda and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.750
water here and then again you can either dab
this on or you can pour a little bit on but

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.660
we want to keep working this and if you don't
have good results with either the Peroxide

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.860
or the baking soda solution then you can go
to some over-the-counter products such as

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.140
a stain remover or a goop off or something
like that. Now it is very important if you

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.690
move up to a stronger chemical such as this
to remove the stain you'll want to make sure

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.590
that you try it on the carpet in a closet
area so to make sure that it does not remove

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.640
the color out of the carpet. So you want to
make sure that the carpet is colorfast so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.740
if we use that and that doesn't quite work
then we can also go up to the strongest which

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.099
would be a non-acetone polish remover and
on this one what I would recommend on this

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:20.959
one is making sure that you put it on a white
cloth and dab this in. Now a stain-like fingernail

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.159
polish is something you are going to have
to be very patient with and it is going to

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.700
take you a long time to get this out but the
most important thing is that you want to continue

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.329
to dab and as you can see it will start pulling
it out of the carpet. So you are going to

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.230
have to stick with this stain for a while
but the most important thing to remember is

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.439
work through progression on the solutions
that you are going to use to clean this up.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.709
I'm Tim Gipson and that's how to remove fingernail
polish from a carpet.
