00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.422
On this episode of China Uncensored when are gyrating grannies a bad thing?

00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:11.739
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your host Chris Chappell.

00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:14.293
You know about China's gerbil plague.

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:19.056
But now there's a new scourge sweeping the nation: Dance.

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:26.138
What with the kind of pollution they have there, you might think it would be dirty dancing but you'd be wrong.

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:37.981
In China, you're of course free to march to a different beat, as long as you know when to step in line, which is what millions of China's elderly women are being asked to do.

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:40.997
China's population is rapidly aging.

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:48.659
According to China's National Committee on Aging, more than one in seven people in China is over the age of 60.

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:53.536
By 2050, a full third of China will be senior citizens.

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:56.205
And watch out! They like to dance.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:06.995
According to a 2014 report by state-run CCTV, more than 100 million people, mostly women in their 50s and 60s, enjoy "square dancing."

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:09.905
No, not yee haw square dancing.

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:11.648
Public square dancing.

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:27.201
And man, these old folks like to tear it up, sometimes hundreds of them, blasting their music well above 45-decibel limit in a public park, often beginning at 6 am, or carrying on late into the night—that is, after 7 pm.

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:31.269
After all, China's elderly are in better shape than you.

00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:41.715
These rebellious elderly have no sense of responsibility, dancing, blasting their Canto pop tunes, disco, and Cultural Revolution Maoist anthems.

00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:46.475
What are the hard working, less physically active young people of China to do?

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.353
You see, half of China's 1.3 billion citizens live in cities.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.672
And things can get a bit cramped.

00:01:54.352 --> 00:01:56.930
Hardworking young people want their peace and quite.

00:01:57.488 --> 00:01:59.946
But the elderly, well, they want to dance!

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:06.324
So how are youngsters handling this dilemma with due respect for their elders?

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:09.464
Apparently, by throwing things at them.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.054
You know, water, sand, coins, and, once, even feces. Also, death threats.

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:21.303
But once again, the Communist Party has stepped up to the plate to preserve social harmony.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:30.010
The "General Administration of Sport of China" has introduced twelve state-sanctioned dance routines that you're supposed to obey.

00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:37.325
And thank goodness! I mean, why go through the hassle of creating your own dance moves when the government can do it for you?

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:43.828
So all you drones in Sector 7-G: Behold your new dance routine! Go wild! Not too wild though.

00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:45.087
No, seriously, don't get too wild.

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:14.249
Now some of you subversive free thinkers out there might be wondering, will the Chinese government really interfere with my display of self expression through the ethereal art form we know as dance?

00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:15.750
Of course not.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.680
What do you think?

00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:25.043
China is ruled by some faceless, soulless bureaucracy that disregards personal freedom and expression for the sake of its relentless thirst for power?

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.172
That's crazy, you should be put in jail! You will be put in jail.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.268
But seriously, it's not all that bad.

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:34.679
I mean, not all dances in China have to be initiated by the state.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.235
They just have to... praise the state.

00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:43.037
For example, this one people came up with to show their love for Chinese leader Xi Jinping!!!

00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:06.845
Beautiful. The song they're playing is Xi Dada.

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:10.440
It was definitely not written by officials in the propaganda department.

00:04:10.773 --> 00:04:17.058
It's just another totally spontaneous outpouring of affection for Xi Jinping by four netizens in Henan Province.

00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:22.161
With lines like, "Not afraid of heaven, not afraid of earth, Dreamers all look to him!"

00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:24.952
But here's my personal favorite! ('宇美广'场舞《习大大爱着彭麻麻》')

00:04:44.902 --> 00:04:47.704
So you see, all you China Uncensor-ites out there?

00:04:48.152 --> 00:04:52.472
The Chinese regime isn't such an oppressor of freedom of expression after all.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.325
Oh, what's that Shelley?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.887
Ah, apparently, haha, this was all just a misunderstanding.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:09.762
*Totally* unrelated to the international media backlash, Xinhua published this article: Official stresses standard square dancing no mandatory.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.026
Apparently it was all just a big misunderstanding and those 12 dances were always no mandatory.

00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.242
Where did anyone get that crazy idea?

00:05:18.906 --> 00:05:29.851
As this new Xinhua article clarifies, "The era where all people are forced to follow only one orthodox in sports is long gone and people now require more individualism."

00:05:30.295 --> 00:05:30.890
See?

00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:36.122
You are required to have more freedom! Individualism with Chinese characteristics.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:41.930
So what do you think about China's new dance regulations, or suggestions, or whatever?

00:05:42.493 --> 00:05:44.707
