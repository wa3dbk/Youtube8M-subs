00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a number Christina

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Oi, eu sou Christina

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:04.377
e eu acabei de tirar meu ciso.

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:07.721
Eu to sangrando muito.

00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:11.255
Acho que eu deveria trocar minha gaze agora.

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:15.296
Me sinto engraçada.

00:00:15.647 --> 00:00:17.647
Isso é vida real?

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:20.103
Eu tenho 2 dedos.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:26.335
Então, eu tirei todos os 4.

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:29.324
E acabei de falar com minha mãe no telefone

00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:31.623
foi engraçado.

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:35.802
Que mais que eu digo?

00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:47.267
Fale comigo Andre.

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:51.319
What are feeling in your mouth Christina?

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.618
What am I feeling in my mouth? Nothing.

00:00:55.902 --> 00:00:56.902
Minha língua...

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.973
ela tá...morta

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:01.376
não consigo sentir minha língua

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:04.632
You just have to bite it dude and then you can feel it

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.810
Eu me sinto igual um bulldog

00:01:07.318 --> 00:01:09.318
Sabe quando eles mordem a língua?

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:12.034
É assim que eu me sinto.

00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:22.483
Pull on your nose, does your nose hurt too?

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.667
Meu nariz tá meio...

00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:26.976
morto também

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.066
Essa metade do meu rosto tá mortinho.

00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:36.395
Meu olho tá um pouco melhor

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:39.515
mas eu não conseguia sentir meu olho.
Blink just one eye then.

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.530
Now lets see if you're good, do a 4.

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:49.560
4?

00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:52.390
Yeah, like the cops do when they're trying 
 to see if you're drunk or not.

00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:54.250
What's 4?

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.730
It's a number Christina

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:59.070
No... but...four?

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:05.720
Four with your legs, that one that you do 
 to see if you're drunk or not.

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:09.270
You want me to get on all fours?

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:13.930
Oh God Christina! No you retard! I'm telling you to do the 4.

00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:16.430
It's like the tree pose you do for yoga.

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:18.700
Like this?

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:21.920
Go more that way so I can film it.

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:25.310
Now do it.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.840
But what's the pose like?

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.730
Put one foot on your knee.

00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:32.740
It's like a passé, and a relevé...like ballet

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:37.340
Yeah but you have to hold it, you 
 have to hold it for a while.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.670
Try to hold your balance.

00:02:40.052 --> 00:02:43.050
You're not even that trippin' that hard, you're fine.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
Yeah, I'm better. A while ago I was trippin' hard.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.790
I'm not trippin' too hard.

00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:54.090
Hey

00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:58.880
Not at all. You're not trippin' at all!

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:03.120
My tongue is so weird dude.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.480
Am I bleeding a lot?

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:08.270
No you're not Christina.

00:03:08.373 --> 00:03:11.370
But if you stopped playing around with it it would be better.

00:03:12.313 --> 00:03:17.310
Ok then. I think I'm going now. Bye!

00:03:19.982 --> 00:03:22.980
Obrigada. Obrigada. Muito obrigada.
