00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.971
Clifford: When we first decided to advertise
on the Don Imus show, we

00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:07.990
were warned.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.420
Don had said controversial things before.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.260
He's gotten himself
in some trouble before.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.059
Don: That's some rough girls from Rutgers.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.059
Man, they've got tattoos.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.059
Some
hard core hoes.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:18.059
That's a nappy head.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.950
If I was there, I would take that thing
off.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.600
Clifford: He has the Don Imus cattle ranch.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.450
He's helping kids.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.760
We're
helping kids.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.899
We share the same values.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.460
Don: Yesterday, when the little children were
singing, I was telling them

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.110
to shut up.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.173
And other icky things apparently I was saying
to them.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.660
Unknown: I heard something else.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.700
Clifford: Sure, we were shocked.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.380
Don: I talk to the commercials, and say hideous
things to them.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.220
Clifford: But we try to take this in good
cheer.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.320
Take it sort of as it
was meant.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.180
Don: But I certainly didn't intend for the
sponsor to be listening, to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.790
think that that's the way I really felt about
the little children.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.040
Clifford: In fact, the next day on our blog,
we even asked Don, sort of

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.060
innocently: "Are you really going to give
us your Bentley?"

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.690
Don: I explained to the little dopes that
they weren't getting my Bentley.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.990
Let me tell you how much I love this Kars4Kids
commercial.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.670
Unknown: Break it down, Imus.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.860
Don: I was thinking about putting it on a
Imus ass record too.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.670
Clifford: I think it was sincere.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.560
We're providing resources for children,
and counseling.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.040
Part of our message to them has to be how
you would even

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.540
deal with something like this.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.670
We even sent Don a gift the next day, just
to show him that there were no hard feelings.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.880
[1-877-Kars 4 Kids]

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.450
Clifford: Were we hurt?

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.720
No.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.450
No, what we do is important, and we have to
balance between that and people's reaction

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.049
to the jingle, sometimes.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.590
Don: I'm not going to give my Bentley to them
until it gets a few more

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.590
miles on it.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.450
But I want to encourage all of my rich friends,
and the rest

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.659
of them with these high end cars, to turn
it over to the lovely little

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.719
children and the Kars4Kids.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.459
Clifford: This is Don Imus, and we said to
ourselves: Well, we're a

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.459
charity.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.829
We help children.

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.059
What could possibly go wrong?
