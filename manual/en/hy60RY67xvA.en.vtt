from your fuel.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.480

Burn Wood, Not Money!

[I have an idea for this but it may be a different
video.

00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:31.181
You could have each word “land” on the
screen with the appropriate sound and have

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:31.196
a manly voice say “Burn Wood” loudly and
a weak voice say “not money” meekly.]
