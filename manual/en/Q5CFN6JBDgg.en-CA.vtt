00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.320
So this is the new Janome Memory Craft 15000.
We just got it in yesterday, and I was so

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.820
excited to unpack it, and I sewed off on i,t
and I am thrilled with it. First of all, you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.090
can see that it has a much bigger screen then
the previous machine had. The screen savers

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.940
are all sewing related pictures. By touching
the screen now it wakes up the machine, you'll

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.070
notice how it lights up everywhere with a
bonus light, by just flipping this out, you

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.371
got a bonus light directly over your sewing,
and you can direct that bonus light if you

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:42.070
don't want it up so high. It has a little
bit of movement in there, it has a wonderful

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.570
needle threader built on to it, and I'll show
it to you here quickly. So, before you use

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.149
the needle threader, what you do is you lock
out your machine and that's very important

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.130
because otherwise you might accidentally hit
the wrong button, and you could damage your

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:06.140
needle threader. But this way just watch,
all I do is press the button and it's threaded

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.530
and I did nothing but touch a button. Now
all you have to do is just pull the thread

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.150
back and we're done. You'll notice that it
comes with a nice large table, we wanna rememer

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.360
to unlock the machine when we are finished
threading, and this flips up so that you can

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.060
see all your stitches that you got built in.
But what it comes with, is a nice extension

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.640
table that fits around your machine, you have
the option of using it or not. This is quite

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:42.510
cute too, this is an accessory box, so it
unzips and you've got three layers of storage

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:53.020
in here, and then the bottom layer, so you
can see how organized you can be with all

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.170
your sewing accessories. And it comes with
your walking foot, your quarter inch foot,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.909
free motion quilting foot, zipper foot of
course, and all your other feet that are standard

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.480
with your machine. So converting this to an
embroidery machine is actually very, very

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:22.070
simple. The first thing we want to do is,
just extend our embroidery arm, and you'll

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.590
notice how long it is. It's long because it
does huge embroidery designs. So now to convert

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.260
it to an embroidery machine, just press the
picture of the sewing machine and, you get

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.040
a nice little stylist with your machine so
you don't get finger prints all over your

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.920
screen. So I'm converting it now, from a sewing
machine to an embroidery machine. Again, a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.280
very attractive screen comes forward, very
basic, giving you your basic stitches, alphabet

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.280
or your edit. You just touch the section that
you want to select your stitch from, and scroll

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.629
down to your next page of stitches. It has
very large designs built in. This is one sample

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.790
that I just did yesterday. That's the size
of the hoop I did it in, and this is called

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:21.090
Sashiko quilting. It has a section of embroidery
designs that are related to Sashiko quilting.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:29.080
Here it gives you your different options for
categories, paging down or up goes to your

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.239
next option, going back to Sashiko when you
touch the picture of the Sashiko, your window

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.940
opens up and it has two pages of Sashiko stitches
in there, you just flip back and forth between

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.190
them. If you want to edit on your machine,
you would select the edit button. Select your

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.310
hoop size here first of all, what hoop you
want to work in. Then you would go back to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.709
your home button and select what design you
want to work with, and it brought it to the

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.660
middle of the screen. Here in your edit button
you can maneuver that design around. Actually

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.620
this one doesn't show up very well because
its not very colored. I'm going to go to my

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.629
embroidery designs again and select a different
design, because it's just not showing up bright

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:27.300
enough for me to even see. That one shows
up very good, okay. So you can maneuver it

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:36.089
around, move it, you have other options, flip
it upside down, if you have a left or right

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:41.819
you can mirror image it, you can copy it,
you can size it. So here I can reduce the

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:51.949
size of it which is now going to allow me
to copy it, and have two hearts so I can copy

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:59.051
it, move it over, and I have two hearts that
I can copy again if I had enough room. The

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:04.649
larger screen, the larger hoop would give
you more sewing area this is I selected the

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:10.639
smallest hoop which is the 14. You get, I
believe 4 or 5 hoops with your machine so

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:19.839
that you can make your designs larger or smaller,
and you can bring the alphabet in at the same

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:27.439
time. Here you have font styles that you can
choose from, and then you would just select

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:32.779
the alphabets you would want to sew and say
okay, and it brings it to the centre and you

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:38.251
can position it top or bottom.You can arc
those too, if you'd like. If you wanted to

00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:45.780
have an arc on them you can arc them up or
down okay, this way if you'd like you can

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.899
spread them further apart, bring them closer
together. So see how you can customize a design

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:58.710
to the way that you want it to do. Then you
also have a memory file folder in here, where

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.110
you can store it in the machine on a memory
file folder or you can store it on a little

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:14.259
memory stick. The new thing about this machine
however is, the fact that it is wifi friendly.

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:23.479
There's your little wifi indicator there,
and you just press on it, make sure its turned

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:29.809
on, select your network that you are going
to work with, say okay and it's connected

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:35.810
to your wifi that you have in your home. Come
in the store have a look at them, we've got

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.559
stock coming in next week, right now this
is the only one I have, but you can come in

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:41.620
I'd be happy to give you a demo and you can
give it a try.
