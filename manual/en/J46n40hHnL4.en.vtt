Hey, it's Derek with Excuse Proof Fitness
and Shane Edele here.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:15.139
We're going to be showing you how to make
"The Sixty Second Salad"

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.540
This recipe is really great for people like
myself who are in a hurry and they want something

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.720
quick and easy.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.660
And I don't really like the taste of greens
or most salads.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.510
I need to do something to kick up the flavor
a notch and make it something tolerable for

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.510
myself.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.510
I have just some spinach here pre-bagged and
already washed ready to go.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.870
You can use just about any leafy greens that
you want.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.010
Some romaine lettuce (would work).

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.650
I don't really recommend using Iceberg lettuce
because it's not very nutritionally rich.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.570
Any good leafy green can work for this recipe.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.660
The next thing we need is a little bit of
salt.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.170
The final component to the sixty second salad,
and this is really up to you guys, is just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.960
some sort of salad dressing or flavoring.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.950
I don't really like the store bought salad
dressings all that much, I like to make my

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.340
own.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.429
Some options are balsamic vinegar, top it
with a little bit of coconut oil or extra

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.119
virgin olive oil.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.200
But in this case I'm not going to use any
oils.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.950
I'm just going to top it with some dried spices.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.709
I have some curry powder, "Italian" seasoning,
and my "secret weapon" some salsa.

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.259
We have the start of the salad here.

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.229
When I look at this I see a couple problems.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.259
First of all, I don't like spinach and I don't
like raw spinach.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.409
This doesn't look very appealing to me to
eat.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.609
That looks disgusting.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.029
Yeah, who wants to eat that?

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:41.200
No one.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.819
The second problem I see is that it's very
big and bulky.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.180
Now I have a large container so I can accommodate
it, but sometimes I want something that I

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.189
can just toss in a to-go container with some
other food and take with me on the go.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.159
The other thing about this much spinach is
that it looks like it's going to take me 15

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.020
minutes just to get through all of this sitting
here eating it.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.030
So we're going to get around this a couple
ways.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.070
First thing that we're going to do, is we're
going to condense this down.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.220
The second component is we're going to add
the flavorings.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.560
I'm going to prove to you this can be made
in sixty seconds and it will taste amazing.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.459
First thing I'm going to do is take just small
amount of the salt and add it in there.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.340
Then I'm going to crush this down with my
hands.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.450
This is going to condense the greens into
a much more manageable size.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.370
You can see this is essentially acting like
what cooking greens would do.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.920
Get it down, get all those juices out.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:53.290
This is much more manageable and easier to
eat.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.750
Now I'm going to add my seasoning.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.480
To top it all off, I'm going to use my dressing.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.280
In this case, it's just going to be my salsa.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:29.920
This is going to taste amazing, I have it
all nice and spiced up.
