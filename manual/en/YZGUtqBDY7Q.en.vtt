00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.800
Me!? Hold on just one second, 
I'm in the middle of a

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.809
very important duty here...

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.699
There we go [blow out lighter]

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.309
That, uh, takes a steady hand. 
It's harder than it looks actually.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:20.940
You ever come into service and you see the acolyte when they start the service and

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.999
you know,  they're they're usually
a little smaller than me..

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
and they are trying to get some leverage
and you are trying to worship, and..

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.360
out of the corner of your eye you are watching
and cheering [stressful cheering voice] Come on! You can do it! I believe in you!

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.400
And then they finally get it lit and you just want to stand up and cheer

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.490
but you can't because you are already standing up

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.690
and cheering for God

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330
through song and so

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.899
you don't get a chance

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.760
to cheer for the acolyte.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.240
[sigh] uh, regardless uh...

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.410
I think it's safe to say being an acolyte
is not necessarily easy stuff and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.660
that is why we are talking about

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.270
these amazing servants

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.260
Acolytes on this episode of Chuck Knows
Church.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:14.020
(Theme music)

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.780
Acolytes

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.330
[trying to enunciate] Ac-a-light, Ack-o-Light 
that's a strange word isn't it.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.040
We borrowed it from the Greek word ακολουθους 
[sounds like ac-a-luthus]

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.450
[whisper to self] that was lovely ακολουθους

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.270
which means to uh... follow 
therefore an acolytes is a follower

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.410
[spirited question voice] a follower of who've you might ask

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.080
or whom if you speak with proper english

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.260
uh, I might respond

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.860
a follower of Jesus Christ that's who

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.979
or whom spoken in proper English

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.700
So in a way it's weird but all
Christians are acolytes since we are all

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.920
followers of Christ

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.840
The word acolyte is also translated as
helper or assistant and that's probably

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.390
the most common way we think of it at your
church.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.110
The acolytes helping out the pastor in
the worship service

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.249
In fact, there are lots of things that the acolytes actually do

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.379
In some charges they take care of the
vestments or check at the sanctuary is

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.919
ready before worship.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.619
uh... they might carry processional
banner or assist the pastor in communion,

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.609
baptism, or..

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.869
makes sure nobody else parks in the pastors spot.

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:25.559
The list goes on and on

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.480
and actual off.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.480
But what is most often expected of the
acolyte is.. [the Chuck trumpet sound]

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.629
the lighting of the candle before worship

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.159
and the extinguishing of said candle

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.569
after the service

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.890
You see, the acolyte brings the light of
Christ

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.199
the light of the world
into worship

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.579
using its own light the
candles that are most often at the

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.779
communion table

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:57.189
it signifies Christ is present with us.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:04.189
Then at the conclusion of the service,..

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.299
.. to demonstrate

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.639
how the light of Christ never goes out
acolytes take that light with them as

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.919
they leave out into the world.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.139
It's a symbol of us being the light of
Christ in the world

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.169
a light, that never goes out.

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.489
If you'd like to learn more

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.049
ask your pastor

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.889
Tell them Chuck sent ya'.

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:35.389
[you are the light of the world]
