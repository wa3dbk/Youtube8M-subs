00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.630
This is spine stretch forward.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.660
So after the abdominal series of five you'll
rock up to seated.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.880
This is really the first official time we've
come to seated and the reason why is that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.630
in Pilates you start lying down on the mat
so you have the most support from the mat

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.870
and so that gravity works with you.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.850
Now we're almost midway through class so you'll
try to organize your body keeping all of that

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.230
awareness while sitting up.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.670
In spine stretch forward the name suggests
what the exercise will be, in this case we'll

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.260
be stretching the spine forward rather then
back.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.100
We begin by extending the legs long in front
and open the legs mat width apart or a little

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.079
bit wider then the mat width apart.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.510
So Madeline will bring her heels to the moon
box.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.860
Now lift your arms up here shoulder height
and we'll inhale to prepare, then exhale curl

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.769
the chin towards the chest as you reach forward,
then inhale stack the spine right back up

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.610
to seated.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.080
Again inhale lift tall out of your sit bones,
exhale round forward and inhale come back

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.150
up to seated.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.500
That's it hold it here for a second Madeline.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.410
So the position of the spine is different
then rolling like a ball, is different then

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.000
roll up, it's a straight back your not in
a c-curve so you'll feel your sit bones the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.420
bones of your seat on the mat for this one.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.350
Let's do one more inhale lift tall out of
the waist, exhale crease forward at the breast

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.350
bone.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.960
As she rounding forward she's lifting in and
up through the waist just like you and stack

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.000
the spine right back up here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.350
Inhale, exhale last time round forward lift
tall up out of the waist the spine forward,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.420
then exhale build the spine up one vertebrae
at a time like you're stacking it against

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.420
a wall and lower your hands down for a second.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.380
So if it's hard for you to sit up straight
with legs outstretched you can bend your knees

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.649
to soften them up off the mat a little bit
until you can bring your spine up to a straight

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.649
position.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.230
Then lift your arms and you can perform the
exercise this way.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.720
That's our spine stretch forward.
