00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:11.540
[music intro]

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:45.420
What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere , athleanx.com!

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.670
Walking into comfortably what surrounds us
here.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.010
Not for me, after I spent three years on the
road with the New York Mets, hotel's gym sort

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.050
of became my life.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.809
I took a lot of time on the road, in hotels
and in the hotel's gyms, but what I thought

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.820
will be viable here, while we're in Chicago,
that's the Hancock building over there, unbelievable

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.020
place and unbelievable city.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.110
I thought it would be cool out here in Chicago,
while we are in the hotel, let's just take

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.820
a little trip around the weight room, I'll
show you what's wrong in a hotel gym, why

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.770
don't we like it, and then tell you more importantly
what could you get, what could you do in here

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.100
to get more out of it.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.450
So, as you see tons of cardio options all
the way.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.180
I don't know, I've never seen this many cardio
options actually to be utilized at the same

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.180
time.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.430
But that's what mandatory people focused on
and that's what I've talked to you about before.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.780
If you can only do one thing, strength training,
strength training, strength training.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.880
Do not waste your time doing cardio if you're
trying to build a better body.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.909
You're trying to strengthen your heart?

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.610
Sure, fine, this is ok.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.500
But I think that you can do a circuit train
weight room workout and it's gonna keep your

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.149
heart pumping to the 30 minutes that you're
doing it too, and still be cardio benefits.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.869
Taking a look quick at the equipment.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.770
We've got four options here guys.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.830
Number one, my old favorite, leg extensions.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.830
Out, forget it.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.610
You know how It feels on that, I hate it and
I think it stinks.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.720
Second worst one here, leg rolls.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.780
See leg rolls.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.020
We've talked about that too, that's not how
the hamstrings work and function so both of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.020
these are gone.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.260
So you have 50% of your options out.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.890
Next to some kind of shoulder press.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.430
That's ok, that's fine.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.239
But you're gonna lock your shoulders blades
up against the pat while you're pressing and

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.010
one of the mega things that your shoulders
actually do is, they rotate.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.580
You know they rotate as you will raise your
arm over your head.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.290
So bad mechanics on that too by the way.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.190
And right here for our bench press, the same
thing.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.420
You know locking yourself to places is not
really how you move.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.810
So, that's now all the space that we have.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.750
We're coming to this side over here and we
have some dumbbells.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.160
Now, keep an eye on the space here, just get
a quick look of that space down there.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.760
Keep that in mind, and I'm gonna tell you
some things you're be able to do in that space

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.050
as you move forward.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.750
So, over here we have our free weight area,
and basically if you look, this is it.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.690
There's not a lot of room here, and one thing
you're probably gonna find most awkward on

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.760
this hotel gym is they only have up to 15
pounds, if you're lucky.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.210
Sometimes up to 35 pounds, and that's it.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.820
So how can we work with what we've got here
and still got our work at it?

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.820
I think it is very easy.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.599
I think some people walk in here and say they
don't have enough and they walk out and that's

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.599
a mistake.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.599
What I say is, let's well do..

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.840
I'm gonna show you a couple of examples.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.010
Let's say we're doing a, I wanna do back,
ok?

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.540
We're gonna do like a version of a dumbbells
roll.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.629
I will grab 20, 15 here, because I can only
do, let's say 17 or 18.

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.090
So how about making these 15 seem hard?

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.540
Well, we talked about it all the time, the
time and attention principle, right?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.670
Going slower.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.349
So, here, come slower on the rep, squeeze
at the top, come down, and slow, under control.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.220
Up all the way, squeeze, down, under control.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:05.720
So kind of keeping our reps in that format
is gonna make a lot more weight being done

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.720
on your back.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.610
But how can we make it even harder?

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.120
Show off rep times.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.690
Just jumping to the right side, go right back
to the left side.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.930
Remember that left side is resting when the
right side is working, so you don't need to

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.670
rest another minute in between sets.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.410
So you go back and forth.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.650
Let's say I'm doing bench presses and I'm
trying to make these hard.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.650
So I can stand up on like an inclined press,
you know grad these 15, let's say I will try

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.410
to lift like I'm normally using the 18 or
so.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.190
So, I can pull up here, and basically I can
even come down slow with one and now as the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.690
other one goes up, I can bring the other one
down.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.680
So, this constant movement in times of tension,
ok?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.150
That's one way.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.710
And we get ourselves to our twelve reps or
so under that way.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.530
But let's say we finally complete our set,
come right down and drop it right into a burn

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:12.000
out set of pushups, so compound the exercises,
compound sets, burning yourself out.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.150
Another great technique to get more out of
it, the limitations of not having the weights

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.150
that you're used to using.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.330
Incorporate with, you know, legs , working
on your legs.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:30.070
You can't tell me, sure maybe 15 pounds squats
is not enough, but what if we did 15 pounds

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.850
in each hand which I'm not gonna do.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:39.540
I don't wanna get to close to your camera,
but I could be holding 15 pounds right here,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.540
ok?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.590
Come down, up and now press.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.340
Down, up and press.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:52.780
Now, working shoulders, working legs in a
single squat variation so lots of tough stuff

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.070
there too.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.090
So, basically the last option , again, I here,
when I showed you running out of space.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:08.229
Any of my workouts that you saw before, 4
minutes to hell, Invincibles I mean The Expendables,

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:15.830
the Invasion workout, all those require just
a little space to do some mountain climbers,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.710
some skiers, all that quick burst, ATHLEAN
Burst Training.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.420
Do it right here in this space.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.650
Forget the cardio machines workout here you
can do as many as different links out here,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.650
a different workout.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.690
So, guys, no excuse, in a hotel get the best
workout that you can, with what you have,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.270
and don't necessarily use stuff that they
give you.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.940
It's just one more creative way on how to
get into the ATHLEAN body, and you go looking

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.819
