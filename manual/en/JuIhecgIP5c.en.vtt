00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.010
When it comes to jealousy in relationships,
who is the greener among us?

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.030
Men or women?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.760
Before I get into gender differences in romantic
jealousy I would first like to take a moment

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.999
to blame the culprit for this green-eyed monster.

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.999
Babies.

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.699
According to the oft-cited evolutionary theory
of jealousy, the reason why this innate human

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.370
emotion exists is all because we start getting
crazy about our babies.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.770
Men's romantic jealousy according to this
theory is driven by paternity insecurity or

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.469
the fear that their babies might not actually
be their babies.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.399
Women's romantic jealousy at least according
to this theory is driven by fears that their

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.039
baby-daddies are not going to stick around
and care for said babies.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.789
a wise man once said it's all about the Benjamins
but really, it's all about the babies-mins.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.399
For that reason the predominant theory of
jealousy is that men, women and jealousy is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.810
that men are more jealous of sexual infidelity
whereas women are more jealous of emotional

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.080
infidelity.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.290
When researchers look into gender differences
in jealousy it isn't so much the question

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.950
of whether men or women are more jealous but
how they might be jealous differently.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.380
At least, that is, when you're looking at
jealousy through that evolutionary lens.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.490
However additional research has uncovered
some nuances in these somewhat stereotypical

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.670
gender differences in jealousy.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.470
That don't necessarily have to do with babies.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.000
A 2010 study found that a person's relationship
attachment style--fancy psychological term

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.990
for essentially how you deal with relationships,
whether you are more securely attached, anxiously

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.000
attached or dismissively attached--plays a
big factor in this sex versus emotional jealousy.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.369
Both dismissively attached men and women were
far more likely to be jealous of sexual fidelity

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.300
versus emotional fidelity.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.350
Whereas for securely attached people, men
and women alike were far more likely to be

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.689
jealous from emotional infidelity versus sexual
infidelity.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.820
Which means that it's not just our reproductive
impulses at work but also psychological factors

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.370
that are going to vary on an individual basis
as well.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.900
And speaking of reproductive impulses, one
interesting caveat of this supposed gender

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.870
difference in romantic jealousy is that it
disappears when you look at gay and lesbian

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.870
populations.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.510
A lot of times the strongest sex differences
of men being more jealous of sexual infidelity

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.569
and women being more jealous of emotional
infidelity tends to only happen when looking

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.150
at hetrosexual groups.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.150
Ehhhh?

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.620
Which researchers then circle back to babies.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.790
If you take away the reproductive factor in
this jealousy the sex differences disappear.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.790
Hmmm.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.310
Not to say that jealousy doesn't exist within
LGBT groups but that their jealousy is not

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.099
as pronounced and that again those gender
differences just don't really exist.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.440
Which kind of means that when you take babies
out of the equation things get a little better.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440
No offense babies.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.569
Finally and not to discredit everything I've
said in the past few minutes but it is important

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.420
to take these kinds of study findings with
just a tiny grain of salt or at least pay

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.879
attention to study methodologies.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.159
Some researchers point out that hey, when
you simply make people choose between hypothetical

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:22.019
scenarios of would you rather be cheated on
this way or this way, the results get a little

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.879
bit muddied compared to when you actually
ask people to reflect on jealousy provoking

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.890
situations that happened to them in the real
world.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.760
Although we might think that one type of romantic
threat, be it sexual or emotional, might hurt

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.750
us more, when it actually happens in front
of us in the real world, there are a lot of

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.019
different variables that are going to go into
how we process it and how jealous we might

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.739
or might not actually be.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.439
But enough with research, what do you think?

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:59.349
Are there differences in the way men and women
are jealous and do you think that men or women

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.380
are the more jealous sex?

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.800
Let me know in comments below and I just realized
this totally looks like a Breaking Bad Heisenberg

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800
hat.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.109
For Saint Patrick's Day.
