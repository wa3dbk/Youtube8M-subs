00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.670
Alright you're looking at the DX4710 Gateway's Refurbished Desktop. 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.500
If you're looking... it's extremely powerful,  but you don't need a video card,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.780
you're not going to playing games, you're an adult, you're going to do this for business,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.960
you need something that's quick, this is right up your alley because it's got a very Quad Core,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.560
it's got a ton of memory, it's got a big  hard drive, it's at an affordable price,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.900
but it doesn't have anything extra like a big  video card that produces a lot of heat,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.190
wastes a lot of electricity, if you don't need it, this is right up your alley, this is perfect for

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.700
businesses, for consumers, for college students, if you don't want your kid to get in trouble,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.100
he can have a blast with this,  he can do everything else,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.440
but play video games. Fun computer, very fast, now let's talk about the fact 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.940
that's it's a reconditioned, refurbished unit. Because that does happen,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.980
we do sell a lot of those. Keep in mind  these things are factory refurbished,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.320
they go back to Gateway, where it was built. They see this computer,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.480
and they fix anything that's possibly wrong  with it, they wipe the operating system clean,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.130
and they provide you with everything  that a normal one would come with.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.330
Speakers, mouse, keyboard, all included, these are all brand new,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.470
and very important, people ask me  this question all the time,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.550
"Does it come with an operating system disk?" Yes, it does.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.630
Absolutely does come with one and right here you're going to see this is a 32 or 64 bit Vista

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.810
with Service Pack 1. Let me go over the specs  with you. As you you're going to see,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.410
this is a pretty nice case, pretty nice computer, all around.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.800
First of all I'm going to point you  towards right here.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.680
When you push this button, you lose your flap right there. That's where your DVD drive

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.820
is going to come out of. You have another one, an expansion slot right down here,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.860
so if you wanted to add an additional one, you very well could.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.940
Now down here is where you have your power button, and your input and output,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.570
for your microphone and headset.  Alright, now looking up here at the top,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.330
 you have 2 USB 2.0 ports, very nice and convenient, brings them to the front, 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.920
instead so you don't have to go to the back  of you case to plug anything in.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.970
You have your Media Card Readers which are all up here, this will take just about every single type

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.150
of media. So no matter what kind of camera  you have, it's going to work on here.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.680
Whether you have Compact Flash,  or you have SD or MS Pros, 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.700
XD's from Olympus cameras will also work in here, pretty much everything will work.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.330
Also you'll notice that it's Label Flash.  Kind of forgot about that.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.490
DVD player is Label Flash. That's like Lightscribe except you don't need a special disk, 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.950
it will use any blank disc, so that's really good. Alright now let's talk about some of the 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.690
important stuff in here. First of all, Quad Core,  very important, you have 4 cores,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.960
multi-threaded applications,  it's going to run very fast.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.380
So if you have programs that use a lot of CPU, this is going to be great for them, in particular,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.840
especially if they're optimized for multi-threaded applications. That means that you can do 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.280
a bunch of things at once. You can have Photoshop up, with iTunes, with Internet Explorer,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.700
with 100 tabs, with whatever you want, pretty much leave it all running at the same time,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.360
you don't have to kill an application just because you're computer is not powerful enough to run this

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.240
You have that Q6600 Core 2 Quad from Intel, it's a very fast processor,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.770
runs at 2.44 GHz, has 1066 MHz frontside bus, has 8 MB L2 Cache which is extremely fast,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.100
and I'll tell you what, you also get 6 GB of RAM on here and that's operating in dual channel modes

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.970
so that's more than you're ever going to need.  You're never going to have to upgrade your memory,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.920
and it also has 64-bit Vista to optimize it and use those 6 GB versus having 6 GB in there

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.190
for absolutely no reason, which would be completely pointless and ridiculous. 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.500
Now let's talk about hard drive space.  640 GB SATA-2, very fast, very big.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.480
If you're upgrading from an older computer,  640 GB is probably a lot more than you're going

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.440
to need, you're probably never going to use it all so keep in mind go take a look at what you got now

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.300
and see how much free space you have  and then imagine going to 640 GB.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.210
It's a lot of space, a lot of movies,  a lot of music, a lot of content,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.670
and you can put a ton of stuff in there. Now also let's talk about the graphics on here.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.150
Again I said it doesn't have a video card, but it does have very good onboard graphics.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.110
It has the GMA 3100 Intel integrated chipset for graphics.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.900
That's an onboard graphic solution, but it works very well. It's actually one of the higher end

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.160
onboard graphics setups, and you can actually do just about anything you wanted.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.160
If wanted to decode Blu-Rays on here and add  an optional DVD burner,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.400
or Blu-Ray player,you could. It wouldn't be a problem, so just keep that in mind,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.800
as you think about stuff like that. You don't actually need to do... Get a video card to do

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.850
simple stuff like that, it will work great  just the way it is.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.720
Again it comes with a keyboard, mouse,  speakers. I'm going to give you a quick tour

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.680
on the back of this thing. Want to show you... What you can plug in.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.370
Whoa, let me not kill this disk. Alright now, starting from the top obviously you got a nice

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.460
power supply you have 2 PS2's for your keyboard and your mouse if you have any legacy items.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.740
This is your VGA output, that's where you're gonna be connecting your monitor with the 15 pin D-sub.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.400
This is eSATA. If you have any external hard drives that have an eSATA cable,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.540
those let you transfer information  from an external hard drive,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.510
just as fast as if it was inside the computer. Which is 3 GB per second.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.460
So if you're doing backups or you're sharing  music with your friends through an external

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.220
hard drive, and it supports eSATA,  that's very very fast, very very useful.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.870
This is your FireWire port, great for taking video off of cameras, digital cameras.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.890
These are 4 USB 2.0 ports, this is your gigabit  Ethernet, and this is your 5.1 channel HD audio.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.790
This is actually 7.1. I apologize.  7.1 HD, so that's 8 channels in total,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.770
and 7 speakers and a subwoofer. And then down here at the bottom, you got a modem.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.320
Again this is the Gateway DX4710.  Now I want you guys to keep in mind,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.660
there's several different versions of this one  in particular, the 4710.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.150
This version that you're looking at,  you're watching this video on

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.660
is the UB801A. Make sure you're looking  at the right computer.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.230
Don't buy the wrong computer, Ok?  This is the UB801A.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.530
Great computer from Gateway. If you have any questions on it, email me.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.430
I'll see you guys next time. 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.670
The Gateway DX4710 version number UB801A Refurbished Desktop is available
