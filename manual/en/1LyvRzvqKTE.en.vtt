Robert: Okay you know how obsessed I am with eyelashes

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.020
and I wanted to do a video

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.269
just a really quick one about strictly curling, the three types of curlers I use

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.739
and give you a better view as to getting in there and seeing them.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.899
First I always start with the classic eyelash curler and I'm going to go and I'm going to start at the base,

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.430
crimp down open up walk it out, crimp down open up walk it out, crimp down.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.110
It's never a matter of, and I know you girls you want to just like...

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.450
hold it for forty five seconds then you have just a crimp. You will get more of a curl my walking it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.090
out then you will

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.000
from just sitting there and holding it while you do something else. Okay, of course I hop you aren't doing something else.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.979
So we're going to start,

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.030
turn that way for me,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.510
and we're going to crimp down

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.110
open it up crimp down open it up walk it out

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.140
crimp down. And you can repeat that a couple of times.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.939
But you're walking it out to the ends of the lash

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.100
so you're getting a curl rather than a crimp.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.780
You'll notice that the outer corner and inner
corner aren't quite as

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.560
curled as I want but I'm going to go back and get that with another eyelash curler.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230
Look down.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.700
Working it in there.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.700
Crimping down walking it out, crimping down walking it out, crimping down.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.740
And you can see when we turn her head

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.840
can you see how curled that is? And it's a nice curl rather than a crimp that goes right

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.610
straight up.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.850
I'm then going to take my detailed eyelash curler

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.740
and I'm just going to get my corners. Look down for me.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.400
Just getting my corner here.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.230
And then my inner corner.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.950
My outer corner on this side.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.200
My inner corner.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.179
And this just really allows you to get up close

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.159
and get those little detailed lashes.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.040
Now my third eyelash curler works after mascara.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.149
So I'm gonna go ahead and put on a layer of
mascara. Now it is true,

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:24.279
that waterproof mascara will hold your curl longer so I do like to use, look down for me,

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.379
I do like to use waterproof

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.189
for my very first layer.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.879
You'll find that some waterproof formulas
are not as hard to get off as others.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.559
And my just doing one layer of waterproof first

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:45.559
versus all three of your layers being waterproof it won't make it hard to get your mascara off.

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:52.809
Making sure to clean off your wand so you don't have too much product on there.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.399
Look straight ahead.

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.039
And you can see

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.339
all you need is a little lip gloss and blush and she would be good to go.

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.689
But see where these corner lashes still aren't where I want them to be and I want to do a little

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.919
cleaning up.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.669
I simply take my heated eyelash curler

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.359
mine looks a little ghetto but

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.210
I keep using them even after they

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.660
don't stay clicked together I just use a little piece of tape, especially when you get a good hot one.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.120
I'm going to take the heated eyelash curler and the trick to using the heated eyelash curler of course your have to have a layer of mascara on 'cause it uses

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.099
the mascara to curl with.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.239
You are going to start at the base of the lashes

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.509
you're going to work it back and forth and then you're going to push up and roll it towards you

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.459
and that will get you the perfect curl. Look how perfectly curled that is from doing

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.199
that.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.849
Look down and over that way.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.369
So working it back and forth

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:50.829
and then you're just kind of rolling it over.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.559
The reason why you are working it back and forth
is you want to get it into these little grooves.

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:58.899
And these little grooves, you want the lashes to go into the little grooves.

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.909
So working it back and forth.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.249
You're almost laying it on top of your lashes or the lashes on top of themselves

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:14.249
But see that one that wouldn't curl, look it's perfect. The curl is perfect there.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.409
Okay look straight into the camera, that one.

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.879
I'm sorry that one.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:30.949
Now you can't tell me that curling your lashes are not important.

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.110
That's one layer of mascara and curled lashes.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.199
If I just put one more layer on and I'll do that for you. You're going to see that she literally

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:43.199
could do nothing else to her eyes but maybe a little highlight around her lid

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:51.869
and she would be good to go.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.650
Look at what a difference that makes.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.249
Curl your lashes people.

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.829
Okay so you're not going to believe how long they are so do you want to see them?

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:08.160
Okay here it's a ghetto mirror. Model: Wow!

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.949
Robert: It looks like you have false ones on. So you can attest to how much curling your lashes makes a difference.

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.010
And see for me

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.610
you do a little highlight on your lid and some lip gloss and you look done for the day.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.860
Model: It looks awesome.
