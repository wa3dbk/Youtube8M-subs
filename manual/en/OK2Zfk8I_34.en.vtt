Hey whats up

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.770
Im just gonna make a quick little video

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.790
On how to set up xbmc with fusion

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.450
I just noticed that some of the other videos on youtube are a little outdated

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.889
And theres kind of a newer method on how to do it, and it works a lot better to

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.889
So just to get started, go to your internet browser, whatever you have

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.730
Just type in xbmc

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.410
Go to their downloads section

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.410
And download it for whatever os you have, i just have windows, but i have already downloaded it so i dont need to do that again

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.690
Just open xbmc up once you have downloaded it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.850
Your going to want to go to system, file manager, and click add source

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.850
Go to here and type what i type

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.190
http://fusion.xbmc.com then click done

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.770
Just name it Fusion

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.869
Just open it up to make sure it worked sometimes it glitches out a little bit, back out of there and go into system again

00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:34.193
Just click on it and go to addons

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.479
Click install from zip file, go to fusion

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.540
Press start here, and click plugin video hubwizard

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.650
Alright then it should say addon enabled

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.489
Then go to programs, click config wizard 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.489
I have windows so im just going to click on this right here

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.030
Click on it , it says would it like to customize your addon selection, say yes

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.930
This might take a while so ill come back once its finished

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.430
Alright its almost done loading here

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.430
Its extracting some stuff, just let it load

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.480
Alright looks like it's done

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.390
Now see under all the tabs it will have different stuff

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.160
For videos the main one that most people use

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.610
most people use i would say is one channel just go to it 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.610
You can watch basically any show for free

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.720
Search whatever movie you want, or you can just go to most popular

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.140
Ya there you go it works very well gives you a custom setup

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.690
