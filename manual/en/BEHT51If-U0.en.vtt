This weekend, we're making a chair ski!

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.300
We just thought it would be awesome to be able to out on the lake 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.620
touring around on a chair so we thought
a ski chair...or chair ski

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm Andrew

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.060
I'm Kevin

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.900
Welcome to Brojects!

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.370
So, our first plan blew up because we couldn't find the PVC

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.200
and steam bending the wooden skis was a bust

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.120
our new plan is to use wooden dowels

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.680
Luckily they fit perfectly into a pool noodle
this is gonna be a great combination of

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.160
strength and buoyancy

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.500
with this design we can have it angle
back...it's almost like an adirondack chair 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.670
and using grandpa's ancient skis is going
to help us bring this project together

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.870
and get us out onto the lake before we have to head home

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.540
So, what we've done here is we've assembled our frame for our chair

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.290
and we're going to shove the dowels through the noodles

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.000
Beauty! 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.239
Lets put this thing together so we can...

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.899
yeah

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.600
It will float, it's just will it float with someone in it is the question

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.980
Kevin's got a fat head so, maybe that'll float

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.540
Alright, you wanna put the skis on?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.520
How's this thing work again?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.560
It's going to the front

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.520
The front of its this way? So it goes in like that? 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.640
We need to have thicker feet

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.750
otherwise this whole thing just gonna
crack

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.410
Do you know what we should have used was mannequin feet 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.360
The loons are laughing at us already

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.920
Six and three quarters

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.420
about seven there

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.230
Last screw

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.770
Lets see what a chair ski looks like

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.000
That's pretty awesome man 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.820
It is pretty awesome

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.820
High five!

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.980
This one was kind of easier than normal...we had fun

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.320
Let's just have a
great relaxing weekend

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.840
Moment of truth!

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.140
Skis are up! 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.320
Skis are up? Ok go grab the boat...and I'm just about ready

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.720
Gotta keep going I'm touching ground 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.320
This going to work like a hot damn

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.100
Ok buddy you ready to go?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.280
Ok, I'm good go for it!

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.600
Alright lets do it!

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.010
it seemed like I was dragging too
much water for the first

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.020
few goes then we switched up the design a
little bit and instead of me holding the tow rope

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.320
attach the tow rope directly to the chair
ski 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.540
and that was a much improved design 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.540
You ready buddy?

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.180
Go!

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.130
Here we go!

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.010
The chair ski worked...it was a long haul getting it up

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.480
that thing is amazing it needs some
tweaking to get it perfect

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.400
Great project Andrew got the chair out of the water and did a lot of skiing on it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.080
This is head and shoulders above what
the initial thing started out to be

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.520
We threw in a lot of extras like the pergola and the barbecue and the solar panel

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.960
By the end I think we nailed this one
