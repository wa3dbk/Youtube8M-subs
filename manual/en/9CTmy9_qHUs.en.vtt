Hi I'm Curtis Freeman for Metalworks Institute
Bass Tips. This is an exercise on singing

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:27.529
and playing. Bass has a bad reputation of
being the hardest instrument to sing along

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.030
with and I'll give you a couple reasons why.
You're never singing the same rhythm that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.510
you're playing, and you're never singing the
same notes that you're playing, so that makes

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.170
it harder. And when you're playing a piano
for instance or a guitar and you're singing,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.170
I compare it to bumper bowling. You have the
bumpers in the gutters, and you can't really

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.100
hit a bad note almost. When you play a chord,
the note you have to sing is encompassed in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.600
that chord. But with bass, it's more like
a 2-dimensional drawing as opposed to a 3-dimensional

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.640
drawing where you have this going on and you're
not ever playing or singing at the same time.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.070
So here's a couple ways to knock that down.
When you're playing a bass line and let's

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.830
pick some really popular bass lines, so these
are songs that you've heard before, so you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.579
know that we're not just making up exercises
to try that aren't practical in the real world.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:30.450
And put up with my singing voice for a second.
I sing in bands all the time and I just started

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.329
as the bass player singing a couple tunes
here and there. So if I can do it, you guys

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:41.329
can do it. Let's do Billie Jean. That's a
complex bass line, and sometimes you get scared

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.560
away from a complex bass line, but if you
think about it, this bass line - We have these

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:59.639
eighth notes going on, so basically it's like
tapping your foot. So you don't have to worry

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.549
about the rhythmic aspects of that. That's
not going to trip you up. So what you want

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.289
to do is play that bass line over and over
and over again and have that part of your

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.160
conscious, and that's like tapping your foot
because the rhythm never changes. Very steady.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.120
And then it gets to the course, that's just
playing big whole notes, so that's good too.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.120
Another song, popular tune to do, The Beatles,
"Saw Her Standing There". "She was just seventeen,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.810
you know-" You've got to shake your head too,
like Paul McCartney. Something like that is

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.900
all sixteenth notes. The same. So it's filling
in all the spaces, and it's actually giving

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.879
you a good groove to sing over. So what you
want to do is get the bass line down and feel

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:57.879
the rhythm of that, and that should be really
steady and really solid, and your vocals need

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.980
to the have the chance to have the expression
in that, and so the vocals will play different

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.319
rhythms while the bass line's staying very
steady. You want to be able to be expressive.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.610
Now there's some bass lines, let's do another
Beatles one. Here's a famous bass line for

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.610
"Come Together". "Here come old flat top he
comes grooving up slowly, he's got -" and

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.079
on and on. So something like that, there's
more rhythm to that, so it's not really just

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:37.079
constant - There's rhythms to it. You want
to think of these kinds of lines more, and

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.750
they'll take more time to practice and get
down. Think of a piano player who has to play

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.750
a bass line in his left hand and a melody
in his right hand. They're going to be happening

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.939
at different times, so you might think of
which notes hit at the same time, and which

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.359
notes hit in the spaces. You want to do the
same with your singing, so if there's a bass

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.859
part that hits first, then sing in the space.
