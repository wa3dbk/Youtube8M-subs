00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.459
Hello,

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.770
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.770
[pause]

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.080
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.170
Welcome to the third, and last, part of essential
skincare for your fifties.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.630
In part one, I discussed the prevention of
photo aging, lines and wrinkles,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.070
as well as slowing down the formation of lines
and wrinkles

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.589
with Botulinum treatments.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.410
In the second part, I discussed the importance
of exfoliation,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.849
and then aggressive filler and laser treatments
that correct,

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.320
or just improve, more advanced lines and wrinkles
and other facial contours.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.440
In this part, I’ll discuss skin tightening
and firming of sagging skin,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.719
especially in the lower face and neck,

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.719
as well as surgical procedures for the eye
area, neck

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.649
and facial sagging or wrinkling

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.249
when it just defies everything I’ve already
discussed.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.860
As we get older, and particularly in our fifties,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.719
as a result of the loss of collagen,

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.069
elastic tissue and even some fat in your face,

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.069
the skin of the lower face starts to sag,
especially around the jaw line

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.210
and below the corners of the mouth.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.540
That also results in early jowl formation.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.350
And, in addition,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.750
there is sagging and loosening of the skin
in the neck,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.920
so we start of lose the definition of our
jaw line.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.540
This results in the bottom part of our face
actually getting wider,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.640
which is the opposite of the way it used to
be when we were younger,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.369
when the bottom of the face was tapered to
the jaw,

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.770
and the upper cheeks was much wider than your
lower face.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.659
Today, there are various devices that are
non-invasive…

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.420
which means there’s no cutting, no surgery,
no needles, and no anesthesia…

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.850
and they actually tighten that loose skin
to firm it,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.680
and to help restore normal contours.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.850
Some machines do it in one or two treatments,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.759
others require five or six, but they all work

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.030
and they do it without surgery.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.570
Examples of that technology

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.369
are Intense Pulsed Light, or IPL, and radio
frequency devices.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.509
There are brand names such as Skin Tite by
Sciton,

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.509
which is IPL.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.369
On the other hand, Exilis by BTL,

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.219
Thermage by Solta Medical, and Velashape by
Syneron,

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.190
are all radiofrequency technology.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.050
Unfortunately however, at a certain point,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.470
the sagging or wrinkling just defies all the
techniques

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.660
I’ve discussed in skincare for the fifties.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.080
In those cases,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.470
if you want to treat them, then it’s time
to consider plastic surgery,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.630
in terms of either getting a face lift, eye-lid
surgery,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.110
or even neck surgery to help restore youthful
facial

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.110
and neck contours.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.110
These procedures are done

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.940
by plastic surgeons and require general anesthesia.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.330
If you do pursue this path, make sure you
find your surgeon

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.070
from a reputable referral such as a friend

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.640
or the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:03:00.040
NOT from an ad in the newspaper or on the
Internet.
