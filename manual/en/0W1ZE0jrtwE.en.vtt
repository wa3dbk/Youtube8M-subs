Hello friends, this is Jeesaa Gupta, a traditional
practitioner and in this clipping I am going

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.009
to talk about wrinkles and normal skin. Usually
the people that have normal skin are not worried

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.830
about wrinkles because they think as they
have normal skin, they can maintain it always

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:30.340
without taking much care, but your skin needs
skill. So let us start, some natural ingredients

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.309
to show you how to take care, how to prevent
and what are the techniques of prevention

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:49.589
of wrinkles for the normal skin. Let us start,
tomato juice, one teaspoon of tomato juice.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:59.819
A little sugar, you're mixing white sugar
because sugar helps to keep our skin very,

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:08.620
very clean from the mess, and is also helps
to bring shine to our skin and smoothness.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:20.150
So a person, having normal skin needs to include
sugar in his or her pack to avoid wrinkles.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:31.110
You can see I have taken just one grape, black
grape, and squeezing it with my fingertips,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:48.100
I have taken the juice; and stir it until
it's a smooth paste. The paste should not

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.020
be too thick or too thin. It should be just
like this so that it can penetrate into your

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.590
skin very easily and it should not take much
time to get dried because, in these days,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.520
you don't have much time to take beauty care.
First, you clean with your face with a moist

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.720
cotton and then you apply this paste properly
onto your face. Allow your skin to absorb

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.480
the beneficial part of this natural paste
for at least 10 minutes. And after that, with

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.090
a wet hand you just wipe off, wash your face
with face-wash. This will help to prevent

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.240
wrinkles to the persons having normal skin.
So the people having normal skin are not worried

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.380
for the problem of wrinkles because you have
the tips and techniques to prevent wrinkles.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.250
Thank you for being with me.
