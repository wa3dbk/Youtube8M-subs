00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The Spanish Heel, is the traditional way of attaching

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.500
the neck to the sides, on a classical guitar.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.000
In terms of tone,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.000
this is arguably the best way to attach the neck,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.700
and some folks even use it on steel string guitars.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.000
Although I personally don't recommend it for steel string guitars.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.900
There are several versions of the Spanish heel,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.700
and in this video, I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.200
a way of cutting the slots on the Spanish heel

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.700
using a table saw.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700
Start by making sure that your saw's miter gauge

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.700
is square to the saw blade,
this is extremely important

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.900
I'm going to be using an 7 1/4 inch thin kerf,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.900
circular saw blade.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
These types of blades are readily available

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.000
at most any hardware store.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.300
The kerf on this blade is about 2 millimeters,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.700
or a skoshe more than a 1/16th inch.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.800
Start with the blade square to the table

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200
I then tilt the blade about a

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.800
1/16th of an inch or about 2 millimeters.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.500
On this particular saw, the blade tilts

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.100
to the left.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
Notice the small gap between the bottom of the square,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.000
and the blade.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.700
You can also see how much the blade is tilted

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.900
by placing your neck blank behind it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Next, I set the height of the blade.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.100
I like to leave about 11 millimeters

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.200
or about 3/8 of inch uncut, on my Spanish heels.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.800
I now place the neck blank against

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.500
the miter gauge and place it behind the saw blade.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.500
The top of the cut should split the line indicating the 12th fret,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.200
or where the sides attach to the neck.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.700
The botton of the cut will be on the right side of the line,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.200
this is because the blade,
has been tilted slightly.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.500
A spacer block is placed between the end of the neck blank,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.000
and the saw fence.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.000
This helps maintain the correct position for the cut.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
Bring the neck black in front of the saw blade,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600
and push it up against the spacer block.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.200
You must remove the spacer block

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.100
to prevent kick back during the cut.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.300
Hold the neck firmly against the miter gauge.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You can now turn on the saw, and make the cut.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.000
Only push the neck through the cut,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.500
do not pull it back across the blade again,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.100
after the cut has been made.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.300
This is what the neck looks like

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.500
after the first cut.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.600
Now remove the miter gauge from the slot

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.100
and turn it around, placing it back in the slot.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.000
Now turn the neck over,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.700
and place it against the miter gauge.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.500
Insert the spacer block between

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.000
the neck blank and the saw fence, 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.200
to position the neck for the next cut.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.500
You can then remove it, start the saw,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.600
and make the cut.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.600
Hold the neck firmly against the miter gauge,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.100
and remember to not pull the neck back through the blade after the cut.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500
This is what the neck blank looks like

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.000
after the slots have been cut.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.300
This method is a simple and precise way

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.600
to cut the slots in a Spanish heel using the table saw.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800
You can now continue making the neck.
