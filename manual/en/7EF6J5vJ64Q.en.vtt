00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.270
undergoing 10 mini procedures

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.840
Cosmetic Surgeon, Dr.. Daniel Lanza is from the college of dermatologists, then we're going to use the laser

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
you

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.800
Patients are advised to do their own research on the procedure and the doctor and seek a second opinion

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.529
Ten days after surgery this is the result she achieved

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.909
Some so-called lunchtime facelifts into Melbourne dermatologist, Dr.. Daniel Lanza

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.820
A

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.019
facial suture lift basically involves fixing the skin with a suture from the inside surface of the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.339
Skin and then lifting and pulling the skin and suturing it to the actual

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.979
Earlobe to the cartilage of the ear

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.699
So basically you get a pulling an immediate pulling inter technique takes two hours and is performed under a local anaesthetic

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.949
Instead the face is pulled up and sewn in place using permanent nylon stitches of the skin so there's going to be scars and it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.369
Can just be done under local anaesthetic the recovery is much quicker

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.879
There's really no downtime over the next few weeks that just softens and then stretches out and disappears for days later

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.350
She's feeling well

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.300
Uplifted, this is a subtle procedure

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.600
that's not going to replace a facelift and

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.879
And it may well be you know every year or two you come back and put another little suture and redo it or ten believed

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.259
That there was any way to age gracefully, so she'd like to stop the aging process altogether

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.569
And you have to admit she isn't bad for

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180
76 yep

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.430
76 Year oldest patient

We've done cosmetic surgeon older patients and her old doctor recently

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.169
I've done an 82 year old lady doctor lands have performed laser resurfacing on Dilma's top lip and chin to remove wrinkles

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.219
In liposuction on her neck to remove fat so Delma will have part of her bottom injected into her face

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.029
We're going to inject a little bit more fat into the cheek. It's done with liposuction

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.660
painless if you're the patient that is

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.680
Most Cares and worries are etched in lines you could be forgiven for wondering if I changed my face

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.959
I'd change my fortune showing a complete face makeover laser skin resurfacing

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.539

14 days of recovery later

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.839
Welcome back for many families sibling rivalry is just a part of growing up, but for the three stirs in our next story

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.970
It's something they have never grown out of lots ago. Fearing her age was keeping her out of the Workforce

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.989
cosmetic surgery Cosmetic Surgeon Daniel Lanza will replicate

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.339
Surgery for his siblings. They've had a lot of procedures, but the trick with cosmetic surgery today is to do small procedures

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.190
But to focus on each of the individual problems laser allows us to resurface and rejuvenate the skin very safely

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.910
We'll have excess skin removed from above and below the eyes a suture lift to tighten the skin

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.199
Liposuction to the neck laser resurfacing for the face as well

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.389
We'll also have liposuction to her arms hips and buttocks and simpler ver surgery

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.689
Now to the latest trend in cosmetic surgery

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.309
matching makeovers with twins and couples lining up for the

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:44.569
Facelift to change her looks together and your lanza is a dermatologist servicing the seemingly insatiable

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:49.969
cosmetic surgery Market, he says patients are now arriving in pairs with

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.128
Dr.. Lancer we've had couples do it together we've had sisters do it together

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.979
we've even had mothers and daughters doing it together and

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.709
And I think the reason is because it is perceived to be less invasive, then people say well

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.949
Why don't we do it together and get on together and see how we both look together?

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.119
And we'll look after each other laser surgery can make is 80 year old

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:19.959
A lot of brown pigmented spots and solar keratosis from the sun as well as that she had quite severe sun damage around the mouth

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.979
with Wrinkles and

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.679
Ridges from the sun damage, and we basically passed the laser over her whole face

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.160
Vaporized the skin healing took place at about seven to ten days, and she now has a much smoother complexion

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.199
Three operations in One First Dr.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:46.089
Lanza will treat the bags under her eyes then the excess skin on her eyelids and finally he'll use the laser to resurface her face

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.350
we're about to start the laser surgery around the eyes the

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.429
Main advantage of using the laser in this area is that whilst we're cutting the skin the blood vessels will be sealed at the same

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.320
Time that'll mean that there'll be less bruising and swelling for the patient and a quicker recovery

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.679
We're now going to start the resurfacing of Sandy's face

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.029
We've attached this end piece. That's called the computer pattern generator

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.550
This is a new addition

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:20.169
And it is generated by a computer that allows us to print out a hundred small pulses evenly on the skin

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:27.309
This has made a major breakthrough as far as the resurfacing goes because we're able to give patients a consistent

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.099
resurfacing the computer basically decides how deep we want to go and

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.029
We don't have to trace it in each spot one by one

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.280
