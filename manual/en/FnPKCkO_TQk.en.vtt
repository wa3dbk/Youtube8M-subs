We hope your enjoying A
Chritsmas Snow. Next, we'll

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:11.611
visit one of Baton Rouge's
favorite restaurants,
Texas De Brazil.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.388
The Texas De Brazil
experience is certainly a

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.792
memorable one. Widely known for
their exceptional cuisine, a

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:31.297
dinner at Texas De Brazil is
equivalent to what many would
consider a gourmet feast.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.703
Now what is the
concept behind Texas

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.272
De Brazil? Texas De Brazil
Churrascaria, you know

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:43.777
Churrascaria means in Portuguese
means Brazilian Steakhouse.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.079
Brazilian Steakhouse. Yeah so
that is a concept we do have the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.816
concept is you go out to the
table the "gauchos" carvers,

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.419
come to your table and cut the
meat at your table actually. At

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:57.757
your table? Yeah. Wow! That's
what the difference is between

00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:00.160
us and the other restaurants. So
what else makes you different,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.797
what else makes you stand out in
the baton rouge culinary scene?

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.633
Well you know when you do come
here and eat you have the fifty

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.269
beautiful salad area that you do
have that you could choose from

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:16.409
50 items on the salad area. You
don't have to really go off a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.013
menu or pick off a menu because
you have 12-15 different cuts of

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:24.350
meat come to your table. So do
you have actual menu items? We

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.821
actually don't, we don't have a
menu item you could choose from,

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:32.759
it's not like a menu at a'la
carte it's just straight from

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.495
the grill. It comes up to your
table and you just say yes or no

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.232
when you flip the car
from red to green.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:56.883
This is the Picanha. Picanha?
Yeah, Picanha is a top sirloin
house specialty that we

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:02.455
do have. Okay let's try it. It's
really good. And you can assist

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:08.695
him with the tongs here. You
grab it and you can cut it. So

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:13.266
that's what brings us different
from other restaurants. It does.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:24.144
Okay see what you think. Mmm.
Melts in your mouth. It's like

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.380
so buttery and so good oh my
gosh. Thanks for joining us for
