00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.200
Okay! So this is the Sony RX100, as you
can I've added some extra things to it here,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.019
this leather plastic, whatever it is, its
extra. I did that because I did had RX100

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.430
before and the entire thing got scratched
up from being in my pocket, so I decided to

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.960
put much protection on it as much as I could.I've
also added this grip here, which is excellent

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.619
addition. It really makes the camera feel very
secured in your hands, so I really like that.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.239
I'll put a link to that on my website, where
you can get that, its really great thing to

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.530
add in your camera if get an RX100, and this
works on I believe any model of the RX100,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.190
I had it on one, and then I actually took
it off and then put it on here. So that's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.190
really nice. We got the basic lens, you got
a control multi-function control on the front

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.370
that you can decide what is going to control,
really nice smooth feel to it. Along the

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.850
side of the camera here, we got the multi
data port which is a USB cable, which is also

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.060
how you charge the camera, which actually
come in handy if you're traveling, you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.010
just, you know, need to find a USB power adapter
which almost everyone has, or your computer,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.850
and then, plugin your USB cable in there.
So that's really nice. We got the HDMI in

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.170
the side, and we got the standard controls
on the back here, and then the screen does

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.170
articulate, tilts up , tilts down, and then
you can tilt it all the way up. I did noticed

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.820
it didn't titled all the way up though because
of the way of the screen is working actually

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.790
did not wined up or been able to see on the
bottom or the once on the top, which shows,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.710
you know, what your settings are at, kind
of a little bit of a bummer but not too big

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.710
of a deal. Along the top we've got the pop-up
flash and in this RX100 III we do have the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.170
pop-up view finder which kind of a nice feature,
I find that I didn't actually used it as much

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.520
as I though I would have but it's kinda nice
to have. Its amazing that they fit in to this

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.099
tiny little body, and that is for sure. We
got the mode dial up here, it feels like all

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.890
metal on the top, feels pretty good, I mean
it definitely feels like a premium camera.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.890
Lets go ahead and turn it on, so this camera
does not feature a touchscreen, but they've

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.510
done fairly good job of allowing you to control
the camera, we got this function button here,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.790
you press it and it brings up all of the main
camera controls right here on the screen.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.810
and then you can click in and change the settings,
so that's pretty nice. We also got the menu

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.420
which is well layed out, and I think they've
improved over the last menu because you can

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.719
click on the top there, and then scroll to
each different section on the menu so that's

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:03.049
nice You can also go through the entire menu
just by clicking through, but I do like it,

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.790
you know, you don't have to scroll down and
not be able to see what's on the next page

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.400
you just click over on the pages are sequential
like this rather than being able to list that

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.400
you scroll down. I think that's really good
design, And that's you know, fairly standard

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.930
features, for this camera menu, I do miss
the touch screen, it is nice to be able to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.930
touch for focus but this is not a touch screen,
but nice layout of the settings and display

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.719
here, I do really like that for this camera,
Ok! So lets look at how you set up WiFi mode,

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:44.260
there's actually two different WiFi mode for
this camera, one is to control the camera,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.529
and the other is to transfer your images,
so I'm gonna show the transferring of the

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.439
images first, am not gonna go through the
whole thing, but am gonna show you were it

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.790
is at, so you just go here, and you can see
this little icon here that kinda shows the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.180
sort of WiFi signal, click over there, and
you can choose to Send to your Smartphone,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.230
Send to your Computer, and then you can either
decide which items are gonna be sent to your

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.629
phone by using this Select on This Device,
or Select on your Smartphone where you can

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.299
view it all on your Smartphone. That's pretty
nice feature, it is really handy to be able

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.449
to Select on this Device and then it automatically
transfers to your phone after you make the

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.300
WiFi connection. But in this case I wanna
show you the remote app, so if we go over

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.720
there to the applications list, and you click
on applications list and you do smart remote,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.940
one thing thats important to remember is whatever
settings you set your camera to up here, I

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.060
think it will remember that it's in movie
mode but all of the other settings you have

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.970
to redo on this application mode because it
uses different settings in the application

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.970
mode which is very confusing, anyways, so
here on the iphone, we need to go and it does

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.629
not go through the router that you have at
work or at home, you set direct connection

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:08.629
from your phone to the camera, so we click
on WiFi, Ok! Then you click on direct connection,

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:15.259
I've already set it up before and put in the
passwords so its all set up. And then you

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:22.259
go to the play memories app, Ok! So here we
are in movie mode, it is nice that this screen

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.610
of the camera does stays on so that if you're
trying to record yourself even the screen

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.229
flip up you can still see on the camera and
on your phone which you are recording, unfortunately

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:51.229
you do not get very many settings when it
comes to adjusting the camera, basically we've

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.530
got zoom, and then you got exposure compensation
, you can just click in here, I don't remember

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:08.909
how you adjust the, there you go, you can
adjust the exposure compensation , but other

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.970
than that, you can add the grid lines, so
you can see the rule of 3rds grid lines, other

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.680
than that, that's pretty much it, just that
and record, Its a little bit disappointing

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.520
because this is a super powerful video camera,
great to be able to have all the controls

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.710
that you want on the camera right here on
the app but you don't get that. I don't think

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:40.710
that you even get that on photography mode,
lets see, here we are on aperture priority

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:49.889
mode now, it just got the same functions and
features, you basically need to change it

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.789
on the camera and if you need more advanced
settings so that's kind of a bummer on this

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:05.789
camera. But I guess on the aperture priority
mode, yeah, I don't know, so that's the connection

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.419
between the RX100 III and your phone
