chicken and mushroom you know to make

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.970

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.540
chicken with little one herb and little

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.920
bit flour you will see how it is going

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.210
to be so to make this first here I have

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.610
got all purpose flour that is maida and

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.720
take it in a bowl add little bit of

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.110
salt and we're going to add thyme okay today to

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.970
make this i'm going to use thyme if you

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.619
want you can also add  little bit of

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.140
pepper powder now in the pan we're

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.030
going to add some oil you don't need to

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.039
add lot of oil just very little here i

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.750
have got the chicken this chicken has

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.240
been brined that means the chicken will

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.729
cook much faster now take these chicken

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.429
pieces just coat it with the this thyme

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.070
and pepper flour so that is what we are

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.960
going to do make sure that all the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.030
chicken pieces are nicely coated and

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.999
this coating will make it very very

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.670
tasty and flavorful and also some of

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.009
this flour will help in thickening the

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.850
chicken sauce okay this is how we are

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.890
going to do now we're going to take

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.909
these chicken pieces and fry now just

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.060
after letting it cook on one side you're

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.619
going to let it cook on the other side

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.160
look at this like this slightly till it

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.319
gets slight color, when the chicken pieces

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.270
get slightly browned you can take the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.050
pieces and keep aside and do not add too

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.030
many pieces of the chicken at the same

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.830
time because some of the moisture may

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.900
come out and you will not get nice

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.780
coloring like this now take all the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.300
chicken pieces out

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.350
and you know what we're going to fry a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.050
little more ofcourse this chicken piece

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.690
is good but the chicken legs is

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.620
going to take some more time and in this

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.820
we're going to add even pieces of potatoes so we

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.440
want the potato pieces also to be

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.010
little bit fried in this oil now even

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.800
this potato pieces are nicely colored

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.110
we're going to take it in a plate with

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.210
the chicken now you know we're going to add

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.550
a little more oil you know preferably I

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.060
love to do this with butter now we can

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.240
add garlic you know whole garlic if you

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.800
want you can crush the garlic little bit

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.930
and add but when they are whole they are

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.120
really really good and in this we're

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.280
going to add a bay leaf also and now

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.440
you're going to add some onion slices

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.970
and saute this onion, now add pinch of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.090
salt and let this saute for two minutes

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.330
now once the onions are slightly sweated

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.890
in this add mushroom ok and we're going

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.230
to saute this mushroom also now

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.260
we're going to add some crushed pepper

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.530
now in this we're going to add some

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.130
chicken stock usually in the hotels in

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.840
the Chinese kitchen we always have

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.489
chicken stock ready so you can add

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.050
little bit of chicken stock I already

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.400
have a video of how to make chicken

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.110
stock by adding  little bit of chicken

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.020
stock it becomes very nice and tasty if

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.280
you don't have chicken stock you can add

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.260
water also because chicken is already

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.840
there but we want more intense flavor in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.650
this add little bit of vinegar okay that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.489
will give nice aroma and some garam

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.260
masala powder okay, add soya sauce little

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.540
bit that will also enhance the flavor

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.239
okay now in this we are going to add

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.000
some ketchup or if you want you can also

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.610
add very little of tomato puree now in

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.530
this we are going to add the chicken

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.870
pieces and the potatoes and the the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.210
flour that is coating on these chicken

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.220
pieces will give it a very nice

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.490
thickening look at this wow you know

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.100
I don't want to make lot of gravy or

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.430
anything I want the sauce to be thick

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.110
and should be coating my chicken pieces

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.020

simmer it for 15 minutes on a very slow

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.220
flame you know the aroma from thyme is

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.230
awesome even though I added  little bit

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.560
