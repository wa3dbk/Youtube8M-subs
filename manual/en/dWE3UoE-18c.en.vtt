00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.960
"Nerves of Mercury"

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.600
No mercury level may be truly safe.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.860
This review on the adverse effects of
mercury in fish suggested that "[E]ven

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.160
slightly increased environmental exposure
to methylmercury from fish could lead to

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.560
adverse effects on nervous system
development, just like… lead exposure."

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.860
No lead is the only good lead, and
the same is true for mercury.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.100
They point to this famous study,
published in the Journal of Pediatrics

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.260
a few years ago, showing delayed
brainstem auditory evoked potential

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.220
latencies in teens exposed to
methylmercury as an objective

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.840
measure of neurobehavioral
toxicity in 14-year-old children

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.220
with developmental exposure to
methylmercury from fish.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.860
It’s a measure of how well the nerves
in your brain communicate.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.800
You take kids; you stick electrodes
on their scalp, and headphones

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.760
on their ears, and play
a quick sound.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.060
And then, just measure how long it takes
for that sound to be transmitted from

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.780
the nerves in their ear to the auditory
cortex in their brain.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.660
The longer the delay, the slower your
nerve impulses are traveling.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.380
And so, here’s the graph.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.340
This is delay versus mercury
content in their hair.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.040
You’ll notice two things.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.300
The more mercury the kids had in
their bodies, the longer the delay.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.360
That’s bad.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.160
Also, you’ll notice it’s basically
a straight line.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.980
It doesn’t plateau out at the bottom end;
the lower the mercury, the better.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.880
Where do the official safety limits
fit on this graph?

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.600
In 1978, the World Health Organization
started to realize how dangerous

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.280
mercury was, so they said no
greater than this level is safe.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.580
We didn’t know any better.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.620
Decades later, the "safe" upper limit
was moved down to here.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.960
Our government said no way, our children
are much too precious for that, and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.580
placed our upper limit here, in 2001.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.140
As you can plainly see from this later
data, though, if you push levels lower,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.940
get people to eat less fish, you get
even less brain damage.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.800
Yet, as of 2012, the safety limit
remains there.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.980
As one former EPA toxicologist told
the Wall Street Journal,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.260
"[Government regulators] really
consider the fish industry

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.180
to be their clients, rather
than the U.S. public."
