00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.810
Hello everyone, I'm Terry Bowden with Expert
Village and today we are talking about how

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.170
to file your taxes on-line. Now the couple
of segments before we talked about preparation,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.370
getting everything together and availability
of computer access. So now let's dive right

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.640
in, we have a computer in front of us so let's
take a look. We go to the address bar, you

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.849
know where you type in whatever page you want
to go to and we type in www.irs.gov and it's

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:40.010
not .com or .net, this is the government so
they have their own, so .gov and hit enter.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.060
This is their home page. Whether you have
always gotten other companies to file your

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.010
taxes you know and sometimes wanted to pay
that money to get that money in faster because

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.260
you needed that money, right? Well there is
a lot of information on here that a lot of

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.850
people don't understand or never thought of.
I mean really it's all free to take a look

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.630
and if you notice on the home page you have
for individuals and that is what we are talking

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.490
about today, individuals filing their taxes.
You have businesses, a lot of information

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.590
there whether you are self-employed or whether
you are a large conglomerate. Of course if

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.320
you are a large conglomerate, you are probably
not going to be filing your taxes on-line,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.220
you are going to be paying a professional
to be doing them so that probably wouldn't

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.450
help us here. There are also charities, government
entities, tax professionals and even if you

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.130
work for some of the other companies, a lot
of great information there for you. There

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.970
are forms. There is a W4 form. We all know
what that is. Got to have it if you work somewhere

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.810
and a W9 if you are a contract labor and so
forth. Over to the right there is a need to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.930
and there is a lot of good information finding
forms. Call or contact the IRS, get a copy

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.899
of your return from last year. This very important
topic here, very very important. I can tell

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.500
you from personal experience myself but I'm
not going to go there but about not keeping

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.810
your forms from prior years. Very very important.
It is very good to keep your returns for at

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.250
least 5 years, at least because if the Internal
Revenue Service or your state tax people come

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.470
back with an error or problem or what have
you, it is good to have that information I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.700
talked about in the very first segment with
you because that way you can pull all that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.370
out and show them and prove to them that you
did file your taxes and that this is the information.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.840
So when we come back, we will dive right into
doing the free filing.
