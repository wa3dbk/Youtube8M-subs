00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.460
It's Oktoberfest!

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.736
Let's legitimize our
drinking by talking about it

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:04.360
scientifically.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.010
Hey guys, Anthony
here for D News.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.950
I've got local craft
brewer Jesse Friedman

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.390
here with me from Almanac
Brewery here in San Francisco.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.791
All cooking is kind
of chemistry, right?

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:21.290
Yeah.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.560
But brewing I find is
especially so, right?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.606
Because it's so
specific and precise,

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:27.730
the way you have to get
different beers, and things

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.920
that you have to change
to make things work.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.710
Yeah.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.659
I often say that brewing's
a lot like baking.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.910
OK.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.660
You know, both involve
a lot of fermentation

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.035
if you're breadmaking, and
you sort of set up everything,

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:39.440
and then you just sort
of set the process loose,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.280
and see what comes
out at the other end.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.550
And so instead of
like cooking, where

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.260
you adjust as you cook,
and stuff like that,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.020
with beer it's more like
you see how it comes out,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.080
and then you go back
to the beginning

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.455
and make a new batch, and
tweak, and adjust your process.

00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:51.340
So tell us about the
main ingredients that

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.585
are going to go into every
beer, and kind of what purposes

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:55.170
they serve.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.270
So, all beer by definition
contains four ingredients.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.490
Water, hops, yeast, and barley.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.990
OK.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.950
And that goes back to a
17th century German purity

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.180
law that said only
those ingredients could

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.114
be made with it.

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:08.530
At the time they
didn't say yeast,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.480
because it hadn't
been discovered,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.200
but after they found out there's
yeast, they added that in.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.700
OK.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.030
And so each of those
ingredients, and you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.770
can vary all of them
in different ways

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.670
to make all the
different styles of beer.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.300
So what makes us adhere to
the 17th century definition,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.514
as opposed to kind
of evolving it?

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:24.055
Oh, we don't.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:24.790
We flaunt it.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.790
My brewery flaunts it
at every opportunity.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.379
Excellent.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.420
We put all sorts of
different things in our beer.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.090
Yeah, let's talk about it.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.180
Let's talk about some
of the other stuff

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.960
that you guys put in.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.540
I mean, sometimes
fruit is added, right?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.900
Yeah.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.149
Sometimes other kinds of food.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.580
So Almanac Beer,
we call ourselves

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.850
a farm to barrel brewery.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.890
So we brew, we
describe our beers

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.130
as being brewed in
collaboration with local farms.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.570
So the idea, and we use
a fancy French term here,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.190
is to infuse a sense of
terroir into our beer.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.130
Because beer is all made with--
all the ingredients in beer

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.220
can be dried and
easily transported.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.540
So the idea is to go to
local agriculture systems,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.998
and bring in fruits
and vegetables,

00:01:55.998 --> 00:01:58.680
and local ingredients to
infuse a sense of California

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.574
back into our beer.

00:01:59.574 --> 00:02:01.365
You know, we brew with
a lot of real fruit,

00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:03.030
so we source that
fruit from local farms,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.570
and then we stand
there and by hand put

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.720
all that fruit into the
barrels one piece at a time.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.060
Gotcha.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.351
So talk to me about the
chemistry of what goes on here.

00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:12.570
When you throw everything
into the vat, what happens?

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.260
Well, you start out
with your barley,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.070
and the barley is molted,
and that's usually

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.990
done by a molster.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.400
So usually a brewery
won't do that ourselves.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.880
And they sprout it, and then
kiln it to different levels.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.540
And actually, that
toasting process

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.510
is how we make beer lots
of different colors.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.190
We take that, we soak it in just
the right temperature of water

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.810
to extract out exactly
what we want out of there,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.380
and beer brewing is one of
those great things where

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.190
the process has been evolved
over so many hundreds of years

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.250
that it's like a
self-contained process.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.620
So when we melt all the sugars
and starches out of the barley,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.280
the husks that are
in there actually

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.040
become a natural grain
bed that filters it out,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.570
so you get an almost
perfectly crystal clear liquid

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.090
when you're done with that.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.860
Then we begin a
boiling process, and we

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.880
add hops during the
boiling process.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.300
And the hops act as
preservative, and delicious,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.200
delicious flavoring agent.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.430
So we add hops at the
beginning of the boil,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.759
and that creates bitterness.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.800
And the more hops you add
at the end of the boil,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.883
those actually add aromas.

00:03:10.883 --> 00:03:12.390
So you guys are
also doing something

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.390
that's kind of trendy
right now in brewing,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.740
which is the barrel aging.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.240
Exactly.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.980
How does that work?

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.896
Well, that's one of those
trendy things that's

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.740
thousands of years
old, if [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.410
It's definitely very
in vogue, and it's

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.220
one of the most exciting parts
of the beer brewing process.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.894
So we take the
beer, and don't just

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:28.060
go brew with brewer's yeast.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.790
We sort of draw--
for how strict,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.077
and the Germans are about
their beer brewing process,

00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:35.660
the Belgians are
kind of the opposite.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.200
OK.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.950
So they'll make
beers in Belgium that

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.970
are what are called
spontaneously fermented.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.230
So that means they make the
sugar water solution, called

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.750
wort, and then instead of adding
a very specific yeast strain,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.780
they actually open the
windows, and whatever

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.540
drifts in through
the windows will then

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.380
create the spontaneously
fermented beer.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.900
What?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.535
So we drawn on that tradition
for a lot of our wild,

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.300
what are called
wilder sour ales.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.800
OK.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.383
So there's a--

00:03:58.383 --> 00:04:01.200
But what drifts in
through the window?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.070
Well, I mean, it's just like
San Francisco Sourdough.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.570
OK.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.260
So in San Francisco, if you
want to make San Francisco

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.140
Sourdough, step one,
go to San Francisco.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.640
OK.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.830
And then you just mix
some flour and some water

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.210
and put that out, and
it'll naturally inoculate.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.214
Because we have, there's wild
yeast, there's lactobacillus,

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.589
there's all these
different bugs.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.750
They're all around
us all the time,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.459
it's just a matter
of culturing them.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.540
And then as you grow them
up, the alcohol tolerant ones

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.520
will naturally weed
themselves out.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.020
OK.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.870
And so we use a cocktail of
while Belgian yest and some San

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.270
Francisco sourdough to
bring in that local flavor,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.105
and we age the beer in a barrel.

00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:38.134
In a barrel the oak is
perfect, because as it

00:04:38.134 --> 00:04:39.550
gets warm and dark
during the day,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.480
the barrel actually will
breathe, soaking in the beer

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.620
and pushing it back out.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.560
So we get all those great
whisky, oaky flavors.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.150
Wow.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.720
That is awesome.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.682
So, how long have
you guys been around?

00:04:50.682 --> 00:04:52.390
Just celebrated our
two year anniversary.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.080
That's awesome.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.635
Happy anniversary.

00:04:53.635 --> 00:04:54.420
Well, thank you.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.410
And you guys have
a website, as well?

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.652
Yeah. almanacbeer.com.

00:04:56.652 --> 00:04:58.860
Do you want to know more
about Almanac's barrel aging

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.990
process, or about the beer
brewing process at all?

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.540
There is a new show
for beer enthusiasts,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.050
it is called Brew Age.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.360
it's at youtube.com/brewagetv.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.860
That starts on October
23, so check it out.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.360
Jesse, thanks so
much for coming by.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.310
Hey, thanks for having me.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.143
Let's go get a beer.

00:05:14.143 --> 00:05:15.560
Yes!
