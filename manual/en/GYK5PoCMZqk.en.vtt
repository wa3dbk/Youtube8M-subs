Hi, my name is Pat Goodwin with patgoodwinassociates.com
and we're going to talk about how to make

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.410
money on the side. When I hear that topic
I think about there's a reason for making

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.370
extra money on the side. It could be that
you are trying to pay off a student loan or

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.520
you need to make extra money to whittle down
your debt but when you're looking for making

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.020
money on the side, I would certainly encourage
you to think about how many hours can you

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.640
actually donate to working on the side. Is
it weekend work? Is it evening work? Is it

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.410
early shift work? And how many hours can you
afford to be away from your family. So let's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.670
look at you want to make sure that you are
alert and confident in the job that you have

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.460
in your day job or night job, so as you select
a job about making money on the side, what

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.560
types of jobs might there be for you? There
could be everything from assistant librarian

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.760
in a library on weekends to cleaning homes
to pet sitting to helping the elderly and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.009
being a caregiver and sitting with someone
who needed some extra care in their home.

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.840
To actually being a security guard. To being
a substitute teacher maybe in the summer if

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.920
you are a teacher. To be a tutor. I've known
people who've made great work by being a tutor.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.439
You may have a keen mathematical skill but
you're not working typically in your field

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.931
of work. There are a lot of students who are
honor students who want a math tutor to help

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:31.009
them excel in their particular subject. You
may be fluent in Spanish and you could teach

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.829
Spanish. You could go to Sylvan Learning Center
and look for making extra money on the side

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.499
by being a tutor there. So just get creative,
go to the website and look at extra jobs or

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:48.079
home based jobs. As you drive through communities
and you look at different buildings they may

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.210
have a sign posted for extra help needed.
It could be seasonal work where you're working

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.459
seasonally during the holidays in retail.
There are wonderful stores that open up just

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.780
seasonally like the calendar stores where
you could work there. And there could be people

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.100
on extended vacations where you could actually
house sit and be paid quite handsomely to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.630
be there and to take care of their home. So
you want to present yourself as someone who's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.430
highly responsible, on-time with a high degree
of integrity and trust and then as you present

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.400
yourself for that extra, making extra income
on the side, they're going to know more than

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.290
likely that you're making a full time income
and why you're looking for job. You can keep

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.680
the reasons maybe professionally, you just
need to make some extra money to pay off some

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.950
bills. So I hope that helps you think about
how can you make some extra money on the side.
