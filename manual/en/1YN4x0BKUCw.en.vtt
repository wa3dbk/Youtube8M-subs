New Life restorations TV presents disaster recovery tips 1 on 1. Where we look into how to

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.510
recover from disasters such as water damage, fire damage and mould. Here is your host Warren Moir.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.089
We are here today at a real life fire damage and we’re actually working on these books

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:22.249
at the moment they are on the shelf,  had a mild soot coverage  over everything

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.999
if you could just see see across the top of this book. So, what I’m doing is holding the book closed.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:33.030
Back in across the top, down the edges, across the bottom, the front, turn it over - across

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.540
the back and should the book require it, we then just give it a quick wipe with a chem sponge.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.570
We take any other residue left by the fire and this situation, this is probably good as it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.210
can do with that book there. So expect
usability. No real smell, all the fire soot is off.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.010
That book is ready to go back on the shelving.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.580
So there's another book here, same thing across the top what we probably have is a HEPA vacuum,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.579
horse hair brush on the top which is an agitation action. So it moves the fire soot.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.159
and whatever is spilt goes through the work table and you can see then

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.240
it just sucks down into the HEPA filter which is below, and in there we have a carbon

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.479
filter and a pre filter, so that there will sort out then through the HEPA itself

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.420
and air exchange out of the edge of the filter which is clean

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.240
Right here is the HEPA filter which is the
one running under our HEPA filter bench behind us.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.530
Its also good to run in the room to filtrate  the air. So we’ll take the top off it, we

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.509
can see the pre filter. This has been in actual job situation, its collected this dust.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.429
floating around the room over a few hours so that’s the job of that. Then we have the carbon filter

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.149
which the air goes through that. It is still
smelling of the smoke, gets encapsulated

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.590
in the carbon granules within there. Then it goes through the filter itself which is an expensive part

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.920
of this machine and then the HEPA filtrated air comes out this side to exhaust back to exhaust

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.700
back in the room. So dirty smelly air in,  and clean fresh air out - HEPA rated.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.530
