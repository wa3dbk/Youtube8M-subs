Hi, there, Tim Ryan again with VOLT.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.059
Today I want to show you how to install the VOLT hardscape light. There are two types of applications

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.458
you're going to encounter when installing the hardscape light. The first one is going to be in a typical retaining wall

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.029
Where you have dirt behind it,

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.229
the second one is going to be into a free-standing retaining wall that's open on both sides.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.329
We'll show you how to do both.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.739
Alright before we get started on project, let's take a minute, and let's review some of the tools, we're going to need for this project.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.639
A couple things were off the bat. Always need a tape measure and a pencil, a

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.489
Sharpie of some kind would be very helpful, marks a little better on the stone little easier to see.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.769
Masonry chisel and a masonry Hammer something that you'll be able to pop these stones off with we'll show you how to do that and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.639
Then you're going to want a four and a half inch or four inch angle grinder.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.189
You're going to want to have a diamond-tipped blade on it.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.669
And that's what's going to cheat a stone and make a groove for us to place our wire in the stone

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670
I'll show you how to do that now.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.139
The first step is the measured mark out the locations for each light I use a spacing of every 6 to 7 feet.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.970
Next take your masonry chisel and begin forcing it between the cap stone and the stone below, as you advance the chisel you'll feel the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.970
glue between the stones begin to break free.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.459
With the cap stones removed set your fixture where it will be placed and mark a line from the central point of the fixture straight

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.290
Back to the dirt. This is where we will score a line in the stone for the wire.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.559
With your angle grinder begin by scoring the line you just marked. Make sure it's deep enough so that the wire lays flat inside.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.000
If it's not deep enough the capstone won't sit flush the stone next to it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.430
Next push the protective brass tube into position.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.150
Set the fixture in position and lay the cord in the slot.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.819
Now I'm securing the fixture with the masonry anchors and screws that were provided with the light.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.119
This is an optional step, you can actually even just glue the light in place and use the weight of the block to hold it down.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.958
I'll go ahead and mark the holes, and we'll show you how to do this step.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.069
Use a small hammer drill with a masonry bit

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.160
and then the holes, we just marked drill out about [1/2] to [3/4] of an inch deep for our masonry anchors.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.889
Take your anchor sleeves and place them in the holes might be a little bit tight,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.239
So if you need to take the back end of a screwdriver or a hammer and just lightly press them in.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.009
Now for the final time you can take your fixture and go ahead and set it in the slot.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.989
Take your screws and go ahead and stick them in the anchors and we will begin screwing those down in place. This will secure your fixture very tightly.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.160
Your hardscape fixture is now installed and ready for wiring. Now you can strip your wire leads and make a good solid watertight connection.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.569
Squirt a good dab of block adhesive back on the stones

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.220
and place the cap stones back into their original location this will finish up the installation of the hardscape light.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.150
Never hurts to give them a little tap on top to help set that glue.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.219
The next application I'll show you is installing the hardscape light into a free-standing wall with two open sides.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.829
We'll begin as before marking out the fixture location.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.419
But this time, we're only going to go half way through the stone to the cable on the inside.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.899
This connection is going to be made inside the wall to the cable that is already placed there.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.109
First we need to cut the cable where we want to make the splice.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.250
Then we need to move it out of the way otherwise, it'll get cut by our grinder.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.419
Take your grinder and grind out a slot as we did before making a groove for the wire.

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.239
But only go half way through to the center of the stone.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.880
Next we'll take the grinder

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.279
We're going to do enlarge out that central groove to make it just a bit wider so it'll accommodate the new connection.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.039
Let's go ahead and strip the wires and let's make the new connection in the wall.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.269
I like to use adhesive lined heat shrink tube that I can heat up and shrink over the connection, makes it nice and watertight.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.979
Apply some block adhesive and put your capstone back in place

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.190
And here's your finished hardscape light.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.489
All right there you have it one installed hard scape light. If you have any other questions about the hardscape light or any of
