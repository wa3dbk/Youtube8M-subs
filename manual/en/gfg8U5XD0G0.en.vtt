hi it's Leigh I'm today I'm gonna tell you
how I make my awesome delicious vanilla

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.890
cupcakes using a box mix and one special
ingredient that makes them taste amazing

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.930
okay so you start off with the box mix
any brand you like you know whatever

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.000
your favorite brand is throw that in the
mixer okay

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and these are for vanilla white cupcakes
um this recipe anyway and then you just

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.410
put in the rest of the ingredients it
calls for the Box calls for me so this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.880
one says three egg whites and then one
and a quarter cups water plus 1/3 cup of

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.519
vegetable oil I just added them in the
same okay now now for my special

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.420
ingredient that's going to make all the
difference in the world and trust me do

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.420
not leave this out plain old vanilla
yogurt so take a what having is is I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.130
think it's six ounce container of
vanilla yogurt and throw that in the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:29.180
whole thing don't stamp I don't know
what it does to make it so moist but it

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.700
works then mix it up because hand mixer
obviously

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:55.490
let it go for a few minutes few seconds
then I'm gonna scrape it down all right

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.770
and then you're going to put it on

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.560
medium for about two minutes

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.060
all right and that's it and then you
just bake them according to the Box

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.830
directions and I'm going to be showing
you that in my next video so thank you
