00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.961
Alright, so now I'm going to grab a curling
iron and just finish off this side.

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.340
I'm actually going to add a little bit of
wave to this side, and then I'm going to pin

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.790
the other side.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.709
So this is about a one-inch curling iron.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.080
One thing to remember when you're curling
hair, especially short hair, is you want to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.460
avoid getting little dent marks, and so what
I do is I try to hold my curling iron really,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.560
really loosely.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.029
I'm not clamping it down tightly.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.920
One thing that I always think of is I put
myself in the mind frame that I'm a ballerina,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.000
and I'm trying to hold it as elegantly as
I can.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.690
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to take this kind of top portion here, this

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.360
temple section, and I'm going to pull each
piece straight out to the side, and I'm just

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.920
going to curl it away from the face.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.170
I like to start at the root and work my way
down to the tip.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.420
Traditionally, we would start at the end and
work our way up, but the reason that this

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.780
works a little bit better is that the hair
is the softest at the root, and so it needs

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.770
a little bit more time to be heated up.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.080
And the ends tend to be the oldest part of
our hair and take the curl really quickly.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.690
So you get a more even curl if you do it this
way.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.229
So now that I've curled that top section,
I'm going to curl this bottom, and I'm going

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.439
to go in the opposite direction.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:24.390
I'm going to go towards us, again starting
in the middle, just heating it for a little

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.159
bit, ignoring the pieces on the top.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.979
We get a really nice shape in there.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.189
Really run your hands through it, and you
can touch up anything that you need to touch

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.219
up in the bangs that way, too.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.850
Again, super, super light touch.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.701
Sometimes you just need to touch up a little
end piece, just trying to give the hair a

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:51.750
little bit of movement over to the side.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.939
I like these kind of little wild bits here.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.700
So now I'm going to take it, and I'm going
to bobby pin the other side really tightly

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.079
to the head.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.610
And again, I'm just doing that because it's
really going to emphasize that this side is

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.149
a little fuller, a little curlier.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.290
So I'm taking my bobby pins, and with short
hair I like to use these really, really tiny

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.290
bobby pins.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.510
They're pretty easy to find almost anywhere.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.330
They're maybe an inch long instead of two
inches.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.530
These are a little bit easier to control,
and they kind of blend seamlessly into the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.560
hair.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.400
I'm just going to finish now with a light
spray of beach spray.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.590
And then I'm actually going to just tousle
the hair between my hands.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.079
I love using a beach spray or textured spray
on short hair because it just gives so much

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.620
interesting dimension to the hair, so instead
of just seeing a silhouette of the hair, you

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.340
see very interesting details with it.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.549
But you could use your favorite paste or smoothing
wax to get the same effect.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.740
And then just situate it where you want it.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.819
And that's a cute style that you can do with
a side bang and a bob.
