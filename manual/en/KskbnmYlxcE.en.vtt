00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:03.940
For this week’s TL;DR

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.240
we’re doing one of our own questions, 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.540
because we thought about it recently. 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.840
How has Korea changed 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.440
in the six years that we’ve been here? 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.440
Because there have been 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.250
a lot of changes. 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.340
A lot of you are gonna be new here, 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.650
and you don’t know the pains 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.080
that we’ve went through. 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.250
There was pretty much no cheese 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.050
when we arrived and 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.000
I can’t live without cheese.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.450
I CAN’T LIVE, LIVE WITHOUT CHEESE! 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.560
So yes, what you’re gonna find here in Korea 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.360
is that a lot of the foods that you might 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.760
now be like ”Ah that’s great that we have here” 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.170
We didn’t have that we first came here, 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.130
cheese is a very good example of it. 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.440
So they do have a bigger sortment 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.970
of cheese at local grocery stores, 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.940
and what I wanna focus on is 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.740
things that everybody can go 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.740
to like Homeplus and Emart 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.740
are the local grocery stores. 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.740
Do they have cheese available now? 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.740
Yes! They do. 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.600
Is it still $16 for this much cheese? 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.950
Yeah.... 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.250
Do you splurge on it when it comes to 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.150
Christmas or depressing moments? Yeah.... 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.950
There are no big cheese boutiques 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.650
here so it’s difficult to find like a Stilton 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.460
or a whole bunch of the fancy pants cheese 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.160
that you get. 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
But, you can get like a parmesan cheese 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.460
or like a white cheddar now. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.860
They have two kinds of parmesan now! 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.170
Yes! That’s a big deal. PARMESAN! 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.430
You know what, I thought about 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.240
when we were watching 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.140
cooking shows last night, 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.340
we were watching Anthony Bourdain.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.340
And he goes to a cheese 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.640
boutique in Philadelphia. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.240
It’s like watching porn. 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.040
We see the cheese boutique we’re like 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.550
”AAH LOOK AT THAT CHEESE!” 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.850
The cream at the top of that mhm! 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.650
But the Koreans seems to 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.650
have gotten into Brie? 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.250
I don’t know why there’s so much brie! 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.850
Who told them that brie was important. 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.060
So there seems to be like an 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.560
excessive amount of brie! 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
There should just be one brie, 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.060
and there should be more cheeses 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.760
to choose from. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.660
I need some goat cheese... 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.860
One of these days Simon. 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.360
I need that goat cheese man. 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.260
You’ll also find in some of your 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.570
grocery stores a bigger selection 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.240
of herbs than we just to have like 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.440
now you can see mint, 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.340
cilantro sometimes as well, 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.140
basil has started to get popular as well. 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.250
While before there was pretty 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.740
much no herbs in any grocery stores.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.950
I just bought six limes yesterday, 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.150
at e-mart. Martina, she called me up 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.550
like ”OH MY GOD THEY HAVE LIMES AT E-MART!” 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.750
It was 6 dollars and 50 cents for six tiny, 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.960
little baby limes. 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.060
I will use this lime sacredly, I will use its skin, 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.160
I will use everything. 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.560
I feel like we’re back to the hunting days, 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.160
we’re like ”I must respect the lime animal” 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.040
CIRCLE OF LIME! 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.240
It was such a bad joke but it made me laugh! 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.450
Outside of food, because 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.740
we could talk about that for 20 min. 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.150
We’ve also noticed a change 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.650
in the attitude that Koreans 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.850
have towards foreigners. 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.650
We noticed this change maybe two years ago? 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.350
In our three first years in Korea, 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.560
if you stopped at a corner it was guaranteed 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.860
that someone would say in Korean: 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.860
”Look it’s a foreigner!” Oh 외국인! 미국사람!”   

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.960
Which means, it’s an American! 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.460
”Oh 외국인!” ” 미국사람!” 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.630
”어 아니에요, 캐나다사람이에요” 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.870
And that was really annoying, 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.540
‘cause not every foreigner is an American. 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.540
Everyday we’re told ”Hey you’re not one of us” 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.340
And it really Jars on you after a while. 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.340
If you’re reminded that you’re an 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.150
outsider everyday, we barely hear that anymore.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.680
Yes! It’s really a big shift and it’s possible 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.350
it’s because we’re now in Seoul. 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.450
Yeah. Maybe there’s a change, HOWEVER 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.960
I still remember when we used to 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.560
come to Seoul we still heard a lot 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560
of people muttering about ”Oh, it’s a foreigner. 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.460
Hey look it’s a foreigner”. 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.160
This doesn’t mean that it’s completely 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.760
obsolete now, like even the other day 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.060
we were filming something and some 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.470
old guy’s like ”Oh look at the foreigner!” 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.670
It still happens, but not as much as it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.270
 used to and we like that change. 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.340
Korea, please stop telling us that we’re foreigners, 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.240
we know already don’t remind me. 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.640
We can combat it quite easily though, 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.140
ok you be Korean I’ll be Martina. 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.650
OH 외국인 (Oh a Foreigner) OH 한국사람 (O a Korean). 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.550
A really positive change that we’ve seen 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.750
something that really really annoyed 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.050
us before but over the past few months 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.250
it has become so much better, 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.660
night taxies are no longer dirty evil vultures.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.460
That’s right! Yes, because before if you wanted 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.960
to get into a taxi after midnight, 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.460
the taxi will like slow down and 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.760
roll down his window, and say like 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.360
”Where are you going?” and then he’s like

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.060
”Oh that’s gonna cost you like $50-60. 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.470
They would give you like a flat which is illegal, 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.940
there should be a meter rate. 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.240
And sometimes they won’t even pick you up, 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.840
they’ll like roll down the window and just drive

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.240
right by no matter what.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.840
But, recently the taxi drivers went 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.150
on strike to raise the base rate of the taxis 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.550
as well as raising the rate after 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.650
midnight and after that went through 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.950
we noticed a huge difference. 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.250
No taxis says no to me anymore, 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.350
just hop in there and they’ll take you 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.550
where you need to go which is what taxis 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.860
are supposed to do. So that increase, 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.060
that strike apparently really helped the attitude 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.760
of the taxi drivers. Great change for taxis, 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.370
very good approval rating from me! 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.370
Thumb up! 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.670
On the negative side of things that 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.440
have changed in korea is that we’ve seen 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.440
a hyper franchisation happening in Korea, 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.440
that is a word right? I believe so, 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.540
what we’re trying to say is that the streets 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.640
that had nothing that local shops are now being overrun 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.950
by big franchises as Gap and Uniqlo, Forever21. 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.150
Like we’re here on Hongdae and it’s a university, 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.260
indie artsy area and they’re opening 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
up a Godiva chocolates? 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.460
Do you not know the people that live here? 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.330
That operate around here? 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.460
They have that building on that main 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.270
street leading up to Hongdae now. 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.670
They’re opening up a massive new balant shoe store, 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.040
it’s like three stories high.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.740
Like three stories of new balance shoes in Hongdae. 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.870
How many shoes do you think university 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.940
students will be purchasing? 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.440
I just don’t understand. 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.650
But I think my biggest disappointment was Garaso-gil. 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.950
Oh man that’s so bad now. 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.950
So Garaso-gil was this street that, 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.650
we did a video a while back. 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.250
We went for SE7EN’s chicken 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.860
in that whole area and it was they had

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.260
these little shops that were kinda boutique-ey 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.060
so some of them were higher and pricing 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.960
but it was still the only shop you could get it at. 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.460
Now it basically turned into a Korean department store, 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.960
that they’ve taken all of the stores 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.070
in the department store and just 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.870
put them on the street. 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.840
They even have a Mr.Donut there. 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.540
Why do you have a Mr. Donut 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.840
on like a fashion street that’s WHAT? 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.340
Essentially when you’re walking down Garaso-gil 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.940
now, every shop that you might think is unique 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.350
and cool shop, you can get from any department store, 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.750
you can go to MyeongDeong and get it there, 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.850
so it’s nothing special anymore 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.750
it’s just a pretty are thats turned into a franchise. 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.350
So why am I gonna go there and fight the crowd? 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.960
‘Cause it’s a very crowded area. 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.150
So we still have hope for Hongdae 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.860
to retain this like indie spear but the 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.160
charm of Garaso-gil is totally lost now. 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.760
I’m sorry. I hope Hongdae doesn’t go that way 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.160
‘cause there’s still those little shops here. 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.470
Keep those shops Hongdae, we’re watching you! 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.370
You can do it buddy! We believe in you! 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.240
Yeah! I’m an anime character! 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.240
You can do it if you put your mind to it! 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.940
Okay Simon-chan! 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.950
We’re gonna talk a lot more about this on our 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.580
blog post so make sure you click on the link here, 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.150
including the hyper franchisation of kpop. 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.850
And the excess amounts of bands 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.050
that are coming out and not being very good. 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.150
Holy smokes. 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.160
So question for you guys. 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.960
We got a split here: 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.660
for those of you that are living in Korea 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.760
and experiencing it, what is it like in your area? 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.460
Do you live in Busan? Do you live in Jeju? 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.260
Are you in the countryside? 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.670
Have the changes affected you 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.770
as they’ve affected us or is it totally different? 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.970
‘Cause we’re talking about our perspective 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.370
now being in Seoul but maybe in the 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.340
countryside things are still a little bit different. 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.340
So for those of you living outside Korea 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.840
what is your Korean community like, 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.140
do you have a Korean community? 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.540
Is there a local store you can buy stuff 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.980
at or is there nothing at all? 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.580
Let us know. 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.250
Two TL;DRs ago we wound up talking 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.450
about Korean blood types and 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.450
a lot of people were asking 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.650
”Well what about like the positive 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.550
and negative bloodtypes?” 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.250
But somebody left a really interesting comment, 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.660
Mariam Watt wound up telling us 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.460
that less than one percent of Korea’s 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.060
population are RH-negative so there’s 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.500
no need to talk about positive 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.860
and negative because supposedly 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.760
it’s the rarest in the world for any country

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.970
to have that little of RH-negative. 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.880
BerlinTokyoConnect said that blood types 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.170
are also important in Japan in fact one 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.040
of her friends was asked for 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.240
blood type at an interview. 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.340
If I were there I would be like I don’t know..? 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.350
The best bloodtype? 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.550
And speaking of Japan, Lynnette Bates 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.850
wound up telling us that bloodtype AB 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.550
as opposed to be like really cool 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.050
is very stigmatized in Japan because it’s unpredictable. 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.860
When I thought AB was the best blood type because. 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.760
I’m pretty sure the words she used were 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.860
like eccentric and unpredictable. 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.260
Unreliable! And Crazypants! 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.270
I’m pretty sure they said *** in here as well. 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.336
No, not at all!
