00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Dani S. Grady: Being diagnosed
with a serious illness

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.629
and faced with
a host of decisions...

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.860
really what it
comes down to...

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.669
will this treatment
work for me?

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.400
And what will my life
look like afterwards?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.270
Robert Wechsler-Reya, Ph.D.:
Meeting patients and families

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.970
who suffer from disease

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.449
has really driven the way
that we do our work.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.160
This is not just science.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.839
This is actually
the race to a cure.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.100
Greg Lucier: We're finding right now
that the understanding of life

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.180
is taking us to where

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.500
each patient has to be
treated uniquely, individually.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.030
Kristiina Vuori, M.D., Ph.D.:
Personalized medicine

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.470
that's guided by genomic medicine

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.600
is something that really is a driver
for the 21st century of science.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.430
Sheila Collins, Ph.D.: You realize that
the workings of the cell

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.000
when they don't work right,
leads to disease,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.479
so then it does become a factor
of wanting to understand

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.420
what's going on with patients

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.369
and how the knowledge that we gain
from doing research can be applied.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.990
Dani S. Grady: These focused efforts
are put toward drug discovery

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.200
so we can have
personalized medicine,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.890
so we know when we give
a patient a treatment,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.920
we know what it will do

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.490
and we know what the rest
of their life will be like.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.780
Ranjan Perera, Ph.D.: The future of medicine
is personalized medicine.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.479
The future of medicine
is something that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.549
we can actually customize
for a given individual.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.539
T. Denny Sanford:
Sanford-Burnham is

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.819
one of the leading medical research
organizations in the world

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.649
and we are designed
to create cures.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.170
Malin Burnham: Collaboration is
the DNA of Sanford-Burnham.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.909
Greg Lucier: Where the very best people
and the very best technology converge.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.850
Layton Smith, Ph.D.: Sanford-Burnham
is a unique and ideal partner

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.729
for therapeutic discoveries.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.749
Pamela Itkin-Ansari, Ph.D.: We can quickly
translate our findings to something

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.189
that will be applicable to patients.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.429
Michael Jackson, Ph.D.: The combination
is all here to go from understanding

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.630
the molecular basis of disease
to coming up with the first-in-class new drugs

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.640
and this Institute is passionate
about taking the next step.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.200
Robert Wechsler-Reya, Ph.D.:
We're really trying to find

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.300
what are the questions
that we need to answer

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.300
to be able
to help the lives of patients.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.300
Dani S. Grady: This is where
the answers are coming from.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.750
Personalized medicine
from basic science research

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.900
is the hope for the future
and it's what we're all working for.
