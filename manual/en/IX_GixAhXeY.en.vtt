00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.041
Hi my name is Ben and I'm going to teach you
how to tie one of the coolest knots of this

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.041
generation.

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:09.400
The Trinity Knot.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.240
All right, so first a quick word about the
type of tie you want to use when tying this

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.400
knot.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.351
In my experience, you want to go stripes all
the way.

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:23.710
It gives it the contrast it needs and makes
it stand out.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.480
Otherwise, it just blends in and looks like
any other tie.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.650
However, when I teach this knot I'm going
to use this tie because the stripes kind-of

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.930
make it hard to follow what I'm doing.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.820
So, I'll use the yellow tie.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.490
Both of these ties are found on our website
and with that, lets get started.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:51.379
All right, so you have your necktie over your
neck, you shirt buttoned and your collar up.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.969
The Trinity Knot is tied with the skinny end,
so, you want to line the wide end up to about

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.230
the tip of your belt.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.900
Then, cross your left hand over and pinch
the wide end.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.080
Cross your right hand over and pull the skinny
end over the wide end.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.080
There.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.150
That is the first step.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.150
Pretty easy.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.630
All right, so you have the skinny end pulled
in front of the wide end. and then the second

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.450
step is to take the skinny end, push it up
through the hole between your necktie and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.140
your neck.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.520
Pull it all the way out and then you keep
the skinny end on the right side.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:47.630
Then, you push the skinny end behind the knot
that is now forming, up and through the hole

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.220
between your necktie and your neck but this
time the opposite way that you went through

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.550
last time.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.950
At this point, I try to get this middle knot
as tight as I can because this is going to

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.490
hold the shape of the knot and you're going
to need the length later on (depending on

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.610
your tie).

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.400
So now, you take the skinny end and you pass
it in front of that triangle that you just

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.549
made.

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:20.930
And that starts to look like a necktie.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.200
This will eventually be the bottom peice of
our Trinity Knot.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:35.109
So, now I'm going to push the skinny end up
through (like we've already done one time).

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.599
Pull it through.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.700
And then I'm going to loosen this front piece.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.040
Remember, I said it was the bottom of the
trinity knot.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:55.120
I'm going to stick the tip of the skinny end
through the cover piece, the bottom piece.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.269
And this is the top piece of the Trinity Knot.

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.220
At this point the skinny end is still on the
left side.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:19.859
Then, I'm going to pass the skinny end behind
one more time and then up and through the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.830
top piece.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.530
Fish for it.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.530
:)

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.700
Pull it through just a little bit.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.480
So at this point the knot is tied.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.019
We're done.

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.719
But we need to tighten it.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:43.519
And tightening is particularly important when
you're tying with a striped tie.

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:55.400
The way that is done is...when you pull on
this piece, the right piece, it is going to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.239
tighten the top.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.169
See that?

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:06.700
And when you pull on the top piece, it is
going to tighten the bottom.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.499
Obviously, when you pull on this end, it is
going to tighten the side piece.

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:19.080
So, remember how we put the bottom piece in
place first?

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.230
So, you're going to want to...if you need
more slack, you're going to want to tighten

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:37.870
the top piece first, then the side piece,
and then the third one.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.220
Walla!

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.260
I always like to open the bottom of the knot
up just a little bit.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.000
All right, so I just tied a striped tie to
show you how tightening is so important.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.570
Right now, the Trinity Knot looks ok.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.510
You can tell it is the Trinity Knot but it
looks the best when you get the stripes to

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.430
all hit the center of the knot at the same
place.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.630
And so, tightening is critically important.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.510
Remember, by pulling the bottom of the side
piece, you're going to tighten the top.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.220
And by pulling the top you're going to tighten
the bottom.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.280
And so, this stripe already looks like it
is in place, we just need to get the top and

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.030
the right piece aligned with it.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.540
To get the top aligned with the bottom I'm
going get a little more slack on the top and

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:40.320
then I'm going to pull the right/side down
so that those two lines meet at the center

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.480
of the knot.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:53.040
Then, I just pull the right piece so that
it meets at the same place and walla!

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:08.370
For the experts, practice tightening and you
can get a knot that just looks fabulous.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.620
And that is the Trinity Knot.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.880
If you master this knot post a picture or
a video on instagram and tag it #mynicetie.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.550
Those videos and pictures will be show in
a feed at MyNiceTie.com (as long as they are

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.550
appropriate).
