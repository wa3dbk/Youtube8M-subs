00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.880
Hello, this is XboxAhoy and this is the seventeenth
episode of my Black Ops 2 Attachment Guide.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.560
In this episode we're covering the Adjustable
Stock.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.070
The stock has its roots in the Stalker perk
first introduced in Modern Warfare 3, and

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.089
sees its return as an attachment instead in
Black Ops 2.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.619
In real-life, a weapon's stock is an important
factor for infantry accuracy: the ability

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.999
to brace a longarm comfortably against a shoulder
makes for a much more stable - and therefore

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.750
more accurate - firing platform.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.700
In-game, the adjustable stock is available
for the assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.400
LMGs.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.170
It is entirely compatible with any other attachment.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.330
The stock's effect is relatively simple: you'll
be able to move faster while aiming down your

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.150
sights, as your mobility while aiming is normally
subject to a penalty dependant on weapon class.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.650
Assault Rifles see perhaps the greatest benefit
overall, with their default ADS movement speed

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.460
buffed from 40 percent to 88 percent.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.530
This makes for a great pairing with aggressive
'incisor' assault rifle builds - as you'll

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.560
be able to preserve accuracy while driving
into enemy territory, enhancing your odds

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.619
of surviving a close-quarters gunfight versus
an enemy wielding an SMG.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.530
Shotguns see less overall benefit, with the
stock taking the already-high 80 percent ADS

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.440
mobility to just 88 percent instead.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.679
This marginal benefit is of dubious virtue
with the buckshot-firing options, as their

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.049
hipfire performance is usually pretty good:
only the KSG is a useful candidate, with its

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.880
need for aimed accuracy.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.180
Even so, a mere 8 percent increase perhaps
isn't worth a pick-ten point - the Quickdraw

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.200
Handle is usually a far better answer for
the KSG's demand for rapid precision.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.990
SMGs see an increase from 80 percent to 100
percent speed while aiming with the stock,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.959
allowing you to walk at full speed with no
penalty.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:06.109
This effect is most useful on the higher damage,
slower firing SMGs, where aiming down sights

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:12.480
is more critical - the PDW-57 and MSMC the
best fit for this attachment.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.920
The faster-firing options tend to perform
just fine from the hip, so a laser sight might

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.220
be a better pairing for reactive fire without
a loss of peripheral vision.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.761
The lethargic LMGs see a relative sizeable
increase from 32 percent to 72 percent speed

00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:32.030
while aiming with the stock, although this
comes with amplified sight sway while on the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.450
move.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.030
For a static defensive class, this mobility
isn't particularly useful - but if you plan

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.439
on employing the LMGs in a slightly more aggressive
role, the stock can be a good fit.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.989
It might be best to pair the stock with a
low-zoom optic to preserve peripheral vision

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.510
while on the move - the 1.35x zoom of the
reflex is the lowest on offer for the LMGs,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.129
but the ultra-low 1.1x magnification of the
MMS is very useful for the other weapon classes.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.269
This means you retain nearly all peripheral
vision, in addition to the MMS's x-ray vision

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:11.510
- paired with the stock this combo can be
very effective when sweeping into enemy territory.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.150
The Adjustable Stock is a universally beneficial
attachment that enables more rapid movement

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.970
while retaining pinpoint precision.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.900
It's a great choice for aggressive builds
with assault rifles and SMGs, where you can't

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.420
always guarantee a good firing position in
gunfights.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.510
Being better equipped to manoeuvre mid-conflict
can bamboozle your opposition: rapid strafing

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.480
can help confound their aim, all while keeping
your sights trained on your mark.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.330
This instant accuracy benefits the slow-handling,
slower-firing weapons the most: the stock

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.810
can compensate for any lack of hipfire ability.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.840
As such, the attachment might prove less useful
for weapons with favourable hipfire characteristics:

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.970
such weapons are less reliant on accuracy,
and so can usually land the first shot in

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.830
a gunfight without needing to aim.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.329
I'd also avoid the Stock with the shotguns,
as the benefit is relatively limited and their

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.430
need for accuracy less marked in most cases.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.870
Nevertheless, there are no downsides to the
attachment and it's simply a matter of best

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.260
using your pick-ten points: for some the stock
is an essential choice - the nimbler handling

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.350
easily missed once you become accustomed to
it.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.600
So, when considering your available options,
if you value your mobility and can't compromise

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.600
on accuracy...

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.440
...perhaps it's time to take stock.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.460
Thanks for watching, this has been XboxAhoy.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.460
Join me for the next attachment guide, when
I'll be covering the Grenade Launcher.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.949
Until then, farewell.
