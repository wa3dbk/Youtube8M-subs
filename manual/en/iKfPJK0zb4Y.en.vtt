00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.620
Welcome to DevFactor!

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.830
today we have a video that's been
brought to you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.990
by request gonna viewers and that
question I was asked was

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.420
how did you teach yourself how to build
video games

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.660
so I'm going to be a really cool answer
this because I'm show you

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
the majority of video games that I bill
since I started doing this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.390
as a hobby so for that reason I'd
suggest you stick around to the other

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.200
this video

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.300
because at the end to this video on the
show something that's never

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.059
been shown for on the web the first
video game ever built by yours truly

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.190
if you don't wanna see crown got the
former on-screen

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.950
otherwise the starting into it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.580
so the first step is start small and
this is one of the more important steps

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.400
that a lot of people don't realize

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.260
when I talk to a lot of people that want
to build games a lot of times it tell me

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.110
they want to build like in Pammal

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.670
or 3d first person shooter in these
games are

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.710
really difficult to build especially
when you have go foundational knowledge

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.940
as humans are really driven by feedback
and he starred in the big game

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.480
may never finish it he may never get
them valuable feedback that you get from

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.070
actually playing on finished game if you
start with something small you can

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.800
finish it

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.460
you can polish it up hate you have a
working team

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.140
you can look back on it and take up all
the steps it took to build it from start

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.750
to finish

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.860
and then you can think of what steps you
have to modify to make it bigger

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.130
so this is why I think starting small is
so important

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.140
on the screen you see the second game I
ever bill

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.470
a space shooter game written in
JavaScript so the second thing

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.400
equation is practice on screen you'll
see the third game I bill

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.650
which is a multi-player tic tac toe game
written

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.140
C sharp is on top of the Unity game
engine

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.399
and this brings us the party of the
equation which is practice

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.560
batting practice is essential for anyone
who works in a profession

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.039
whether surrounded by software
SunAmerica

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.119
we have this misconception the
misconception is that some programmers

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.740
I'm actually better than others we have
entire films based after this we have

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.120
the Facebook film Mark Zuckerberg where
they make him out to be some tape a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.060
genius that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.220
everyone has class at harvard know to
keep up with them

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.740
even have terminology like 10x
programmer to programmer capable

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.740
doing ten times the amount of things is
your average one

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.690
just cuz he's so intelligent something
so you right off the bat that this is a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.770
load of bullcrap

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.120
and there's no such thing as a genius
programmer for the most part

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.280
when you meet someone who seems to be a
genius programmer

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.050
nine times out and ingenious programmer
in reality the edges practice way more

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.590
than you

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.629
and possibly have

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.230
under study habits than you see humans
are naturally very ambiguous

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.760
and software has to lack all ambiguity
so naturally

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.500
one of the best things you can do to
become a better developer is just to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.560
write more software

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.409
so his mum the games they came after my
multi-player tic tac toe game

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.489
quite frankly it's nothing but a flap
Ebert called

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.329
in order to build this game I despair as
hell time googling

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.280
in so many other people I closed flat
the bird it was easy to find example

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.980
source code

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.930
it was easy to find forms with people
discussing how they built the game

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.700
ex ever and the reason I built this game
because I realized that flap the bird

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.769
was allowed to access

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.049
and I wanna try to tear that apart
figure out why it was so

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.829
entertain and that brings me to my third
point which is polish

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.500
in polish is critical game you ever ship

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.150
even if it's a 2d side scroller or a
Tetris clone

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.359
or flappy Bird Club now here's my
reasoning for that

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.760
in my reasoning is when implementing the
core features

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.430
you learn ally about program as a game
developer

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.980
it's very important have a solid grasp
of programming fundamentals

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.380
in this is because the code is basically
the clue

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.200
that has your game together it's almost
like the bread

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.660
in a BLT but similarly to a BLT if you
have nothing else

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.620
then all you have is two slices of bread
and who's gonna pay for two slices of

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.849
bread that you can pick up at the
grocery store

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.980
but you know all the sudden at some
baking you had some fresh lettuce

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.690
fresh juicy ripe tomatoes some
millionaires

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.650
all the sudden you have a BLT it's not
just two pieces of bread anymore

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.740
now it's a fully-fledged delicious
sandwich

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.010
and that just sounds so much more
appetizing

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.099
and this is why the Polish on it is so
critical

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.360
in this is where you can just stop at
the code if you stop at the code

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.620
your game is going to be really dry is
to be really boring

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.440
right seem to think you our asset seem
to think I've the sounds

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.099
lead to think of how does the user
interact with the game

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.690
how does the graphic user interface work
if there is one

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.870
what's the control scheme and then some
things that

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.850
indie game developers don't seem to
think about a lot is the psychology

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.560
the user playing the game so I'd like to
use a game as an example for this

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.780
like you is League of Legends produced
by Riot Games

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.680
is a competitive multiplayer game and in
2013

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.860
rankings me 624 million dollars

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.830
of %uh selling skins so I was lucky
enough to be a close beta player for

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.730
League of Legends

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.910
but one thing I can say about that was
League of Legends was not a very good

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.540
team

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.860
during the closed beta the graphics were
very poor

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.170
the gameplay was really slow paced and
the worst so

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.860
many bugs I can even store to list them
off the top of my head

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.320
but here's a legal edge instagood first
it was entirely by accident to legal

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.790
engines

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.860
was really good capturing a competitive
spirit

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.170
it just happened to be the right
environment we could really get into the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.660
game

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.180
and you could play with your friends and
you're talking over Skype are

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.330
strategizing

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.200
and trying to figure out how to beat any
team so I believe that's what has

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.810
allowed

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.820
the alleged become such a popular game
see their competitors have better

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.570
graphics

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.590
better characters better game playing a
lot of them have better animations

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.640
better sound effects

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.890
but none of them make that competitive
spirit as easily accessible to the

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:15.780
average person

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.110
as Ray games has made in their game
which brings us to our final topic

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.820
the first game I am for me I made this
game

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.900
late Middle School like all that weight
loss simulator

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.560
the idea was if you run on the
treadmills long enough without falling

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.570
your character will eventually become
skinnier

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.520
and while that's a little bit humorous
it's not a very exciting promise for a

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.090
game

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.380
the game lacked a ton of polish

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.720
it's just another infinite runner with
words graphics

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.060
but after lot of practicing and after a
lot of polishing

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.220
because I never give up I was able to
produce better games in the future

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.400
and today I'm quite confident in my
programming game development abilities

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.630
so that's my story and if you have a
similar story or even a vastly different

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.190
story i'd love to hear it in the
comments section

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.910
below this video for those of you who
are new to this channel

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.070
I have programming in game development
tutorials out at least three times per

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.540
week

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.880
all my contacts is of course free it
takes a couple hours per each video

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.560
together

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.310
