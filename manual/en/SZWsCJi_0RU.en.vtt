Part III - Moving objects

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.260
Welcome to Part 3 of the Dying Light Developer Tools guide.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.760
In the previous video, we showed you the basic toolbar icons.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.900
In this video we’ll discuss tools that let you move objects on the map.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.820
The most essential tool is ‘Select Object’. You can find its icon on the toolbar, or simply press the ‘S’ key on your keyboard.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.000
If you want to select a number of objects, press and hold the ‘CTRL’ key while selecting.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.560
After selecting one or more objects, you can easily center the camera on your selection by pressing ‘F’ on your keyboard.  

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.060
To move any object, click the ‘Move Object’ toolbar icon or press the ‘W’ key.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.700
Objects can be moved using the red, green, and blue arrows displayed on the screen. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.480
The colors correspond to X/Y/Z axes respectively, while these arrows are referred to as the ‘gizmo’ of an object.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.420
The gizmo is displayed in the pivot of the objects, that is the center of the object’s local coordinate system.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.000
If you have trouble remembering the colors of the axes, identify them with the RGB mode: 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.440
the X-axis is R,  or Red;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.960
the Y-axis is G, or Green;

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.460
and the Z-axis is B, or Blue.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.800
Click on the colored squares around the object to move it along two axes at the same time.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.960
The majority of available objects also have so called hooks, which makes snapping objects together much easier. 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.700
You can see how it works when you move an object along the street.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.400
This option is called a ‘Hook Snap’ and can be disabled with the ‘4’ key on your keyboard if you want.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.440
Finally, you can press and hold the ‘SHIFT’ key to clone objects.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.300
And by pressing ‘A’ on the keyboard and clicking the left mouse button on the map, you can easily move a selected object.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.380
Combine it with ‘SHIFT’ to clone and place objects really quickly. 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.540
And that’s it for Part Three. Next time we’ll talk about how to rotate objects. Thanks for watching.
