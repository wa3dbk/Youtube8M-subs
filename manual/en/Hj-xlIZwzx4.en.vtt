How to Make Tamales.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.339
It only sounds intimidating -- you can make
your own tamales from scratch at home by following

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:10.440
these simple steps.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.920
You will need 2 1/2 lb. pork roast 1 peeled,
halved onion 2 peeled, halved garlic cloves

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:29.300
1 tbsp. toasted cumin seed 3 tsp. salt 3 dried
chili peppers 36 corn husks 4 c. masa 1 tbsp.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:39.140
baking soda 1/3 c. pork lard 36 corn husks
Dutch oven Blender Steamer Chiles (optional)

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.329
Shortening (optional) and cheese and other
fillings (optional).

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.329
Step 1.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.309
Put the pork, onion, garlic, cumin seed, and
one teaspoon salt in the Dutch oven and completely

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.260
cover the ingredients with water.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.309
Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce
the heat to low, simmering for 2 hours, until

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.089
the pork is cooked through.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.089
Step 2.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.879
Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles
and simmer them in 2 cups of the broth from

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.559
the pork for 20 minutes.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.750
When they've cooled, blend the peppers with
the broth until the mixture is smooth.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.540
Use any kind of chiles you like.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.570
Step 3.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.500
Separate the cooled pork into small, shredded
pieces and then mix 1 cup of the chili mixture

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.100
into the shredded pork.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100
Step 4.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.070
Soak the corn husks in hot water until you're
ready to fill them.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.670
While they're soaking, put the masa in a large
mixing bowl and mix the baking soda, lard,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.940
and two teaspoons of salt in a separate bowl.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.210
You can use shortening if you can't find lard.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.210
Step 5.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.719
Combine the masa and baking soda mixture,
working it with your hands until they are

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.260
evenly combined.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Step 6.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.570
Remove the corn husks from the water, spoon
the tamale dough evenly into the corn husks,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.619
and follow that with a spoonful of the pork
filling.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.110
Try adding cheese or other fillings.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.110
Step 7.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.450
Twist the ends of the filled corn husks and
tie the ends with pieces of corn husk.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.560
Then arrange the tamales upright in a steamer
and steam them for an hour to an hour and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
a half.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.840
When the husk easily separates from the filling,
you're ready to enjoy delicious, authentic

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
tamales.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.450
Did you know After the 1989 American invasion
of Panama, it was discovered that white powder

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.900
found in one of Manuel Noriega's residences
that was thought to be cocaine was actually

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.660
farina, corn meal, and lard used to make tamales.
