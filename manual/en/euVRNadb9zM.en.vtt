This is Diana Sullivan in Austin, Texas.  Today,  I'm going to show you a different sort of

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.959
tapestry needle bind off.

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:20.789
Jane in San Diego wrote me and commented that when you have an e-wrap cast on, it has a certain look,

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.949
and then when you do your typical

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.169
tapestry needle bind off, you get these little horizontal bars all

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.539
along the stitches on the stockinette side of the knitting.  She said,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.240
"Wouldn't it be better if the bind off looked like the cast on?"   And in fact,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.569
she even sent me directions on how to do that.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.090
So let's do it.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.300
Knit a sample and end on the right, and then cut a nice long piece of yarn for

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.310
sewing up -- at least three times the width of the knitting.  Now bring all the needles out to hold position.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.110
You're going to need a tapestry needle.  It's a blunt needle with a fairly large eye for sewing with yarn.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.730
And you go ahead and thread the tapestry needle as usual, by folding the yarn over the needle,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.690
squeeze it between your thumb and your forefinger,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.390
and work it into the eye.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.120
So now it's threaded.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.949
I'm going to start by going through the right-most stitch from front to back and then by tightening that up.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.220
This one tends to be loose, this last stitch.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.909
Now, the pattern is to take two steps to the left and come into the stitch

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.559
two needles over on the left, so I skip this one and come in from back to front.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.619
Draw that up fairly tight.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.709
It is the spacing of the needles that

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.029
determines how tight this bind off is, and because the needles are fairly far apart, I need to give this that tug.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.899
Now I'm going to take one step back toward the right,

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.609
put my needle through that stitch from front to back,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.289
then take two steps to the left, over to the fourth needle from the right,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.289
go from back to front.  Just careful not to split the yarn.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.699
And here's where I want to tighten this up right here.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.149
Each time that I take my step back toward the right and I put my needle in,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.489
I like to hold these bits of yarn in the back up and get my needle under them.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.309
Now, two steps to the left to the next new stitch

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.108
working toward the left -- this would be the fifth stitch --

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.590
and now I do my pull up tight.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.479
Now I take a step back into that fourth stitch,

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.339
and then two steps to the left, to the sixth stitch, go from back to front.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920
Avoid splitting the yarn.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.009
And again, this is the moment when

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.920
you want to pull up tight.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280
Now I take a step back,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.720
two steps forward,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.259
pull that yarn up tight, a step back,

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.690
two steps forward.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.200
Now this can be sewn from right to left or from left to right.  To go the other direction.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.320
you just end at the left, and you work

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.020
from left to right, going back one and forward two as you work your way across.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.529
Now I'm going to keep working on this

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.000
and not film it until I get over to the last needle.  Then I want to show you what to do

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
as you finish off the row.

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.439
Here I am coming out of the second to the last needle, working toward the left,

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.578
and this is the place where I would take a step back,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.850
so I'm going to go to this third from the end one,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.679
and then I would come out this very last needle.  Now, I like to take

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.200
one  more step back,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.169
go in the second of the last needle again,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.549
and come out the last needle again.

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.179
That finishes my bind off.  All I need to do at this point is pull it off the needles.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.229
I'm going to give it a light steaming to uncurl it.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.959
Here's our sample now that it's all knitted.  Now, down here is the e-wrap edge and you can see how that looks.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.250
Then up at the top

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.790
here's this new version of bound off edge and see how that looks?

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.109
It's a really nice, stretchy edge for situations where you need some stretch.  Now compare that top edge

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.039
along there

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:23.959
to the top edge of my previous sample.  Do you see how the previous sample, which I've laid on top,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.590
is bumpy, and this one is smoother?  Now, they're  both stretchy,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.969
but you get just a little nicer finish with that edge.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.179
So when you're using a tapestry bind off in a place where it's going to show, why not try this new one?
