00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(MUSIC)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
GIRL: Hi. I'm Jeena

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.650
BOY: And I'm Drew.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.960
JEENA: Welcome to Santa Monica College, the
Number One transfer school to UCLA, USC and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.130
other premiere four-year universities!

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.840
DREW: Today we're going to give you a glimpse
of this amazing college. It's located just

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.899
one mile from the beach and in the heart of
the entertainment capital of the world!

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.650
JEENA: We're here in the campus Quad. It's
the center of this dynamic two-year college

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.410
with 30,000-plus students from all over the
globe!

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.480
DREW: Sure, we have palm trees and beaches,
but SMC is a top-notch school with an outstanding

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.699
reputation. Many four-year colleges send students
to us first for academic preparation.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.280
JEENA (VOICEOVER): SMC is located in the heart
of sunny Los Angeles, with a mild climate

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.000
year-round.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.079
DREW (V.O.): There's so much to do in L.A.
you won't know where to start.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.140
JEENA (V.O.): Whether it's outdoor sports
at the beach or nearby mountains.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.039
BOY (V.O.): Or concerts or nightlife in Hollywood
or other hot spots, you'll have plenty to

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.960
explore when you're not studying. Plus, on
any given day, you might just spot a celebrity!

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.210
JEENA (V.O.): After all, Arnold Schwarzenegger
did go to school here.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.929
JEENA: SMC has more than 30,000 students attending
classes day and night.

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.630
DREW (V.O): and we also have one of the most diverse
campuses in the entire world.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.670
JEENA (V.O.): And there are nearly 3,000 international
students from over 100 countries. So

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.630
on any given day, you might see Mexican folklorico
dancers, Capoeira or Japanese taiko drummers

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.579
performing outdoors.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.560
TONY: My name is Tony. I'm from LA, and I
think the diversity at Santa Monica College

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.860
is really good. Because I have met people
from all walks of life, all over the country.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.869
I'm a veteran myself so I've traveled all
over the world. And to come here and see something

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.000
similar to that in an educational environment
is really impressive actually.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
(MUSIC)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
DREW: Santa Monica College has all the advantages
of a four-year university.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.790
JEENA: But its small classes guarantee you
get individual attention from your professors.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.899
DREW: With about 100 majors to pick from,
you can get an Associate of Arts degree in

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.130
two years and then transfer to a four-year
university.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.890
JEENA: Or in two years or less you can be
trained in high paying careers such as digital

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.000
animation, nursing or cosmetology.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.120
DREW: We also have a world-class faculty whose
priority is teaching, not research.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.700
DR. MARIO PADILLA: The quality of the faculty
at SMC is very high. When I was going for

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.190
the job here, I heard that there were almost
500 other candidates for my position.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.489
LIBBY: The professors at Santa Monica College
are amazing. I mean you're not just a number

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.580
in a classroom or just a name on a piece of
paper. You really establish a relationship

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.090
with your professor.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.110
TONY: That was my Marine Biology teacher.
I'm not super crazy about science but he really

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.000
made learning about all the different animals
interesting. He's really, really excited about what

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.170
he knows, what he has learned and he's really
eager to share that with his students.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.150
JEENA: Some of SMC's students favorite majors 
are business, science and the arts.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.000
DREW: We also offer some pretty unusual programs
like...robotics. That's right! In this program,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.670
students design, build and program
their own robots.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.379
JEENA: Too bad those robots can't do your
homework for you.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.239
DREW: I know!

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.170
JEENA: They should do that. They should make
that.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.040
DREW: I suppose.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.099
DREW (V.O.): SMC has sent thousands of students
to world-famous UCLA over the years.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.980
JEENA (V.O.): As a matter of fact, we're the
No. 1 transfer school not only to UCLA, but

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.480
also to the entire University of California
system.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.989
DREW (V.O.): We are also the No. 1 in transfer
school to USC and Loyola Marymount University.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.470
KAY: We've been recruiting here for several
years now. There are a lot of students

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.599
from Santa Monica who come to our program,
at Columbia, and they tend to do really well

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.049
at our school.

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.519
JEENA (V.O.): We transfer hundreds of students.
Our students attend colleges like Columbia

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.720
University and the University of Michigan.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
(MUSIC)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.720
DREW: Santa Monica College has one of the
most active student bodies of any community

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.840
college in California.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.470
JEENA : With 16 men's and women's teams, including
football, soccer and volleyball, there's never

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.819
a dull moment for athletes and fans.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.939
DREW (V.O.): It?s no wonder SMC has produced
NFL stars like Steve Smith of the Carolina

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.420
Panthers and Chad Johnson of the Cincinnati
Bengals.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.360
JEENA (V.O.): Or champions like swimming Olympic
gold medalist Lenny Krayzelburg.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.000
DREW (V.O.): Speaking of water sports, we
also have a surfing class!

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:15.860
DREW: Cowabunga.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.820
JEENA: Cowabunga dude.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.760
DREW (V.O.): No matter what your interests
are, you'll find a club for it at SMC.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.720
JEENA (V.O.): We have more than 100 active
student organizations, ranging from the Eco-Action

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.250
Club to the International Student Forum.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.510
DREW (V.O.): And our Club Row, held twice
a year, is one of our most popular events.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.000
With music, food and lots more, you'll have
a great time and find something that fits you.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
JEENA (V.O.): And we also have lots of lectures,
concerts, art shows and plays. Some of which

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.570
have gone all the way to the Kennedy Center
in Washington, D.C.!

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.300
DREW (V.O.): You might also want to check
out our Study Abroad trips.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.300
JEENA (V.O.): And don't forget our Dale Ride
internship program where you can spend a whole

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.990
summer interning in Congress, or even in the
White House!

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.300
DREW (V.O.): In fact, we also have one of
the largest internship programs in California.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.810
JEENA (V.O.): We all know that traffic in
L.A. can be a challenge.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.330
DREW (V.O.): But getting to SMC doesn't have
to be a hassle.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.000
JEENA (V.O.): With our "Any Line, Any Time"
program, you can ride the Big Blue Bus for free

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.599
JEENA: Want some?

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:12.580
DREW: No thank you.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.270
JEENA: No, sure?

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.339
DREW: I'm good.

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:17.380
JEENA: All right.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.349
DREW: It's all part of SMC's commitment to
the environment.

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:25.419
JEENA: I guess you can say we have "green
fever" on campus. That's why we recycle, make

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.599
healthy food choices, and educate ourselves
on the environment.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:34.500
DREW: As you can see, Santa Monica College
has it all: awesome teachers, an amazing location

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.520
and a reputation as one of the best two-year
colleges in the nation.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.740
JEENA: No wonder it's the place where the
world comes to learn!

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.419
DREW: Thanks for joining us today.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.000
