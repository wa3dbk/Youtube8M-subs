00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.860
Hi, and welcome to the ValveTime news.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.170
Each week we'll bring you the biggest talking points regarding Valve Software and the community.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.780
Now, the news:

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.520
While this week is definitely lighter on news than the last,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.870
it was still a big week for Valve as they were named as EDGE Magazine's

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.900
Number 1 best game development studio in this year's EDGE Developer Awards.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.530
The issue, which is on sale now, includes an extensive look at Valve

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.010
and their business practices.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.890
Topics discussed in the issue include Valve's reasoning behind developing Dota 2,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.560
their recent business developments,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.250
and the design ideas behind Steam's Big Picture Mode.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.660
There is frankly far too much to talk about on the show,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.560
so head on over to a link in the video description to read more.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.050
Print and digital versions of the magazine are also available, which we highly recommend.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.480
It was also revealed earlier this week that Valve developers

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.700
will be giving a pair of talks regarding virtual reality at the Game Developers Conference,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.770
known as GDC 2013.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.140
While we've known for a while that Valve has been developing hardware

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.360
in the form of controllers, consoles, and virtual reality goggles,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.220
this will be the first real time we've heard inside stories from the developers themselves.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.500
The first talk will be given by Joe Ludwig and is entitled,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.490
which will, as the title suggests, discuss how Valve dealt with a variety of issues

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.930
involved with integrating Team Fortress 2 over to a VR system.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.670
The second talk, given by Michael Abrash, will be titled

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.050
and will function as a general overview of virtual and augmented reality,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.290
alongside Michael's own personal roadmap for the future development of these technologies.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.390
GDC 2013 begins in San Francisco on the 25th of March

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.650
and will run for 4 days until the 29th.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.330
Game and system updates featured as a big theme this week,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.570
with a wide variety of Valve's titles receiving sizeable patches.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.290
Firstly, Steam Guides have gone live after leaving a short beta period.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.850
The new system, which we talked about a while back after its beta released,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.550
functions as a new community-driven tutorial, walkthrough, and tip system

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.520
allowing players to share information, support, and guides

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.080
relevant to any game on Steam in order to help other gamers, or... to just show off.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.330
The Steam Guides are available in-game via the Steam Overlay,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.060
or under the "Game Hubs" section of the Steam community.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.090
We're not really sure what has changed since the system's beta unveiling

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.280
and the full release earlier this week, so let's just move on.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.520
Following the footsteps of Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, and Portal 2,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.210
Left 4 Dead 2 received Workshop support earlier this week

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.550
which allows community modders to upload and share maps, campaigns, skins, and scripts

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.500
for other users to download and rate.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.850
This makes Left 4 Dead 2 Valve's 4th title to officially receive Steam Workshop support,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.020
which we believe will be followed shortly by Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.890
In just a short period of time, around 300 skins, campaigns, maps and other game mods

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.960
have already been added to the Steam workshop, so head on over to the workshop

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.150
via a link in the description to get involved.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.060
Dota 2 also received an update earlier this week

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.050
which introduced a new game-type known as "Least Played Mode," which, when selected,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.220
will give every player a random selection of heroes determined by playtime information,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.640
forcing all players to experiment with new heroes

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.070
and play styles they don't usually experience.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.430
Other noticeable updates include a new high quality radiant melee creep skin,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.120
updated ability icons for a variety of heroes,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.210
and improvements to the workshop upload feature, which now features

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.070
support for the submission of custom wards and couriers.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.470
An unreleased UI update has revealed that in-game hero guides will soon be available

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.720
from an additional panel, helping newer or less experienced players

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.520
to focus on specific builds uploading by developers or the community.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.150
Upcoming heroes Troll Warlord, Skywrath Mage, and Tusk also received

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.180
a variety of content updates including basic skill icons, skins, and particle effects.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.990
A link to Cyborgmatt's full changelog analysis will be available in the video description.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.060
Steam Greenlight also received an update this week

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.300
which unveiled the next full set of Greenlit titles to the service.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.890
10 new games and 2 new software titles were added to the Greenlit tab,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.390
including games such as Leisure Suit Larry and The Age of Decadence,

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.350
alongside software titles such as articy:draft and GroBoto.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.670
For the full list of the newly Greenlit titles,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.300
head on over to our site via the link in the description.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.710
In merchandise news, pre-orders for the 20-inch tall Gordon Freeman Gaming Heads statue

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.100
have officially opened as of January the 18th, 2013.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.560
The statue, shown here, is constructed from high quality poly-stone

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.620
and is currently limited to 1,500 units worldwide,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.810
with 500 units reserved for the more expensive exclusive version

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.090
which comes with a wieldable MP7 SMG straight out of Half-Life 2.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.700
We believe these collectible statues will sell out quickly,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.270
so head on over to Gaming Heads to pre-order one to avoid missing out.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.310
During last week's episode of ValveTime TriviaTime,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.650
we asked you a question regarding Team Fortress 2--

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.240
more specifically about the planned unlockable weapon

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.290
which was announced but never released.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.610
The answer was, as several of you correctly pointed out, the Overhealer,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.840
a planned Medigun from 2008 which was supposed to overheal

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.190
the target to 200% of their original health

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.090
The gun was scrapped for being extremely unbalanced

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.460
as it practically made Heavies and Soldiers unkillable,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.800
removing the need for an Ubercharge altogether.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.220
The Kritzkrieg was added during the Goldrush Update, ultimately taking the Overhealer's place.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.020
For the next question, the original game launched with only 6 maps,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.920
and Goldrush was later introduced as the game's 9th map,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.590
but what were the first 2 officially released maps available before payload Goldrush?

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.160
We're looking for maps 7 and 8; we'll reveal the answers on next week's show.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.080
That brings us to the end of another week of Valve news.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.930
Thanks for watching.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.680
Be sure to head on over to our site via a link in the description

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.720
to read all about the recent update to source mod NeoToyko,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.410
and an annotation link should be available on-screen around about now

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.370
which you use to head on over to the first episode of ValveTime TalkTime,

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.400
the first episode of our recently-released podcast series.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.050
Don't forget to leave your feedback regarding the new series in the comments below.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.790
Stay tuned for more ValveTime videos, news, and reviews coming soon.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.230
Bye for now.
