Hi YouTube,

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.030
AJ from GoProFanatics.com here to give you
a quick and easy tip to ensure that your GoPro

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.530
mounts are tightened down properly and prevent
your camera from changing direction during

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.900
a hard impact.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.419
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.710
AJ, please!

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.540
I know how to tighten down a screw on my GoPro
mount.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.070
I don't need you to tell me how to do it.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.420
Well believe it or not, some of my friends
who own GoPros and some of the members on

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.180
goprofanatics.com didn't know about this before.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.039
So prepare to have your mind blown.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.550
So if you were like me when you first got
your GoPro, you were tightening down all of

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.260
your mounts by hand.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.829
However, hand tightening often isn't enough
especially if you're doing sports with a lot

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.409
of impacts like let's say skiing, snowboarding,
mountain biking, jumping on a sidewalk.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:07.970
So imagine this scenario, you're tired after
tightening down that mount by hand and you're

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.700
about to get this epic footage, you hit a
bump in the road.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.700
Oh no.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.159
Your GoPro camera is pointing down, at the
ground and you're missing all that epic footage

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.820
that will obviously never happen again.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.820
Bummer.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.960
So this is where my tip comes into play.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.330
With every GoPro mount, you get a few thumbscrews
and if you look inside the thumbscrew, there

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.450
is a Philips screw inside of it.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.360
So, I always carry one of these, snowboard
tool, and after you tighten it by hand as

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.810
much as you can, try not to hurt yourself.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.150
911, what's your emergency?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.409
Uh yes, I appear to be bleeding profusely
as a result of turning a GoPro thumbscrew

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.409
by hand?

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:59.890
I do you know about 1 more turn, 1.5 more
turns and you know that gets it tight enough

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.659
where if you hit a bump in the road, boom,
it's not going, it's not going to change direction

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.579
at all so that's good.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.510
However, my only comment would be when you're
done filming, loosen it because you're putting

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.680
additional stress on these little plastic
hinges for nothing and they're going to become

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.540
more fragile and more likely to break.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.930
And obviously in colder weather, the properties
of plastic change, it becomes even more brittle,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.129
even more fragile and even more likely to
break.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:39.159
So I don't suggest using a screwdriver to
tighten them down a lot when it's below freezing.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.190
Always try and do it at room temperature and
you should have no problems.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.400
So I hope you enjoyed this video.
