00:00:01.977 --> 00:00:05.432
(upbeat light music)

00:00:05.992 --> 00:00:06.765
- Hey friends.

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:08.948
Thank you so much for

00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:10.597

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:13.637

Truvia Baking Star Contest.

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:15.473

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:17.910

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.443
to vote for your favorite entries and

00:00:19.443 --> 00:00:21.394
join the conversation on social media

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:24.109
by using the #TruviaBakingStar

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.751
So today I am going to be making

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:27.082
Caramel Cheesecake Bites

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:28.846
with the new Truvia Brown Sugar Blend

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:31.656
which has 75% fewer
calories than brown sugar.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.838
Let's go ahead and get
started with the crust.

00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:35.348
That is graham cracker crust,

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:36.857
Truvia Baking Blend and

00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:38.018
softened butter.

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:40.363
I'm going to go ahead
and mix those ingredients

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:42.314
in a medium sized bowl and

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:43.822
I actually like using my hands.

00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:45.817
It distributes the butter evenly and

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:48.117
just gets the consistency that I like.

00:00:48.117 --> 00:00:51.995
In a 9x13 inch pan I'm placing
the graham cracker crust and

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:54.642
I'm going to also pack
it in with my hands.

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:56.662
I also line the pan with foil because

00:00:56.662 --> 00:00:59.053
it's actually easier to
remove the cheesecake bites

00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:00.261
once it's baked.

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:04.533
You're gonna bake the crust
alone at 350° for 10 minutes.

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.598
Let's work on the cheesecake part.

00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:08.363
So that's softened cream cheese,

00:01:08.363 --> 00:01:10.453
flour and Truvia Brown Sugar Blend.

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:13.489
And I'm going to mix
that with my hand mixer.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:18.876
Then I'm also adding some sour
cream and vanilla extract.

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:22.592
Again, I'm going to go ahead
and mix with a hand mixer.

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:26.289
Then I'm going to crack
three eggs individually.

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.659
I like to do it one by one.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.749
So that's the first egg
and then I'm blending

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:30.933
with the handmixer.

00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:33.695
This is the second.

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:36.082
And that's the last one.

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:40.777
So for the caramel part,

00:01:40.777 --> 00:01:43.192
I'm just melting some caramel and water

00:01:43.192 --> 00:01:44.841
in the microwave, and

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:46.165
that's going to melt it and

00:01:46.165 --> 00:01:48.021
I'm going to put it in
the cheesecake batter

00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:50.919
to make it a caramel cheesecake flavored.

00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:54.407
So I'm going to go ahead and
mix that with the hand mixer.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.214
And you're ready to pour
the cheesecake on top

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:00.275
of the baked crust.

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:06.154
You're ready to bake the
cheesecake in the oven

00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:09.218
at 350° for about 40 minutes.

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:09.938
After that,

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:11.843
you're going to go ahead and
refrigerate for four hours

00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:13.283
or overnight and

00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:14.374
then cut it up.

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:19.374
You're ready to add walnuts
and drizzle with more caramel.

00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:21.827
Alright, Justins ready to try it you guys.

00:02:21.827 --> 00:02:22.779
- Oh man.

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.704
- And again, Liam looks like
he's about ready to eat it.

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:26.401
- Oh yeah.

00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:27.075
- Give me some daddy.

00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:28.742
- Look at this caramel on here.

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:34.885
- Oh he said give me some daddy.

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:35.931
- Mmmm.

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.807
- You haven't made that sound in a while.

00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:40.992
- Seriously.

00:02:40.992 --> 00:02:42.200
- Sorry, I was like whoa.

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:46.534
I don't think I ever would
have thought to put walnuts

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:47.764
on top of cheesecake.

00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:50.180
The crunch with the crunch of the crust

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.968
with the cheesecake itself,

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:53.941
oh my God it's so delicious.

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:54.522
- Thanks.

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:55.892
- Cheesecake is one of my vices and

00:02:55.892 --> 00:02:57.887
I need to be really careful
when you make cheesecake

00:02:57.887 --> 00:03:00.117
because I literally could
eat like the entire pan.

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:01.371
This thing is so good.

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:03.089
This is actually a very impressive thing

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.784
if you want to like impress guests

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:05.736
or something like that.

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:07.802
Because it's really hard
to get cheesecake right

00:03:07.802 --> 00:03:09.033
I feel like, you know?

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:09.961
So good.

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:11.448
- It's really easy though.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:13.303
And it's really pretty when you like

00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:14.885
decorate it with caramel and nuts.

00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:17.763
You don't have to use walnuts
if you guys don't like nuts.

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:20.062
Like you can do any
nuts, or just exclude it,

00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:21.702
or even do fruit if you like.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:22.672
- Oh my gosh.

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:23.297
- If you like this video,

00:03:23.297 --> 00:03:24.783
give it a thumbs up and subscribe and

00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:26.198
we'll see you guys next time.

00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:26.909
Bye.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.891
Let's go ahead and get
started with a caramel.

00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:31.049
These are caramel bites
and heavy cream and

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.277
I put that in a saucepan on
low heat until it was melted.

00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:37.295
The consistency should
look something like this.

00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:39.617
You can go ahead and set
that aside while it's melted.

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:41.843
In a large bowl, you're gonna place.
