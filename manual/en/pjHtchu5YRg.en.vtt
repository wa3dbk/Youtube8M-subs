What up fishtank people, fishtanktv.com Dustin's fish tanks. My crazy problem and obsession that I'm having fun with. Two for Tuesday continues, it might even be triple Tuesday I don't know. I am dirting a tank and I want all you beginners and new subscribes the best way the grow aquarium plants and it's just like freaking this. I have so many mosquitoes around me even though I drove all the way to cvs to get bug spray. This is how much dirt. That's my finger down in the dirt. Take it up. That's how much dirt I'm using. I also have some special ingredients inhere that I'm just not going to share well maybe I will. I'm feeling good today. I use that much dirt, guess how much gravel I'm using. It's probably about the same ratio. The special ingredients in this are right here. I have some iron ore, I do not recommend using this it could cook the entire batch. I do not recommend this at all I have not experimented with it, I do not know what I am doing. I have heard good things and I think I have seen some good things in some of my tanks but by no means do what I am doing. If you use iron in your tanks do not send me an email saying that you killed all your plants. I'm telling you do not try this. I'm trying it, I might kill some plants or they might grow shit house. So that's what's up. I put about 15 of those in there. Then I put 30 chunks of this clay. Which I'm going to be carrying here in a little bit. About 30 chunks of these 3 rows across then 10 in each column. Now what I am doing is the slow fill method that I learned about on fishtanktv.com, in the dirt convert forum written by Shane. And I'm just going to get this going. And you know what I just can't resist I'm probably going to plant it tonight too. But man spend the extra $7 on some bug spray. Cause back here it's like mosquito heaven. Long time subscriber young dude only 15 years old ben petterson, bens aquariums is his YouTube channel I think. He sent me a very intelligent email wondering about sand versus gravel. There has been a lot of talk on that. I'm a gravel guy I'm rolling with gravel, I think that this size maybe a little smaller is the best. I don't like sand and I have a tank in my basement that I'm using sand with and it's been nothing but trouble. I figured out why, it's because it does not allow oxygen to get down to the roots, so it gets anaerobic which means no oxygen. Every now and then it gets released and it just destroys everything which is why I had that massive plague in that tank. Or it will just cook the roots and kill the plants. Either way it's no go so I'm rolling with gravel folks and I suggest you do the same. Really great question ben I'm glad to have you on the channel I know you have been a long time subscriber. If you want my 2 cents its gravel over sand. It will get that oxygen down into the dirt. It's the same kind of principle as why it's good to have worms in your yard because the help air rate it, it's the same sort of deal air rate your dirt. So um yep. Going to see how this goes. It's taking forever to fill but that's a good thing. The dirt underneath wasn't too wet a little moist but not too bad. I'm doing this slow so I don't have any float up. Here's the best part, when I go to do water changes I can just over flow the stupid thing. And then I'm going to get growth like that and it's going to be awesome. And then winter is going to come and I'll have to be inside all the time but my shit will look awesome. So that's what's up, welcome new subscribers. Hit me up, tons of this stuff for sale $3 right here. You don't think that's going to grow crazy in your tank you are out of your skull. And doing what we are doing as usual. Later.
