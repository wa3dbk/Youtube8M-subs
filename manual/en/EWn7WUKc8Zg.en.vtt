00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.120
So, there are two very different ways to approach
a climb. You can plan to be seated, you can

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.900
plan to stand, and there's a third way which
is a mixture of seated and standing. In this

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.110
little segment here I am going to show you
the differences like in my body position between

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.750
the two and what different ways of climbing
allow me to accomplish differently. So, follow

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.200
me. Well, obviously you start off seated because
you need to get into your pedals and get stationary.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Being all seated like this allows me to climb
relatively slowly. I'm pulling down on the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.500
handle bars...really, you know, driving the
back wheel into the ground. For a situation

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.430
like this I can get out of the saddle. To
get out of the saddle I keep my butt real

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.250
low, get my weight forward, but move my butt
back and it enables me to have a little bit

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.190
more room to maneuver so I can pick up the
bike to get up over obstacles and stuff like

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:07.410
that.
So, when we started, when you start off and

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.380
you're choosing if you want to be seated,
choosing if you want to stand, or if a mixture

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.460
between the two, then what you have to take
into account is traction. You can find more

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.510
traction when you're seated because you're
weight is distributed much more evenly...more

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.730
weight on the back wheel. As long as you just
get low and sort of practice that rolling

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.630
motion with your arms, you'll keep that wheel
driven in and you'll be able to climb even

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:45.960
a real slippery slope. With the standing technique,
you can get a little bit more power because...plus,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.820
in addition...to the force that you can generate
with your legs you could put your body weight

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.420
into each trick which helps a lot. But the
power application is way more cyclic. It's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.549
not a smooth ...like an electric motor. It's
more like two pistons. So, it's easier for

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:08.020
the wheel to lose traction and break loose.
So, to compensate for that you, A) have to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.340
think of that ice cream cone. You have to
think of bringing the bottom of the cone that

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.769
has all the melted ice cream sort of down,
pushing it into that rear axle by lowering

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.090
yourself and moving your weight really far
back while you're pulling yourself down. In

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.430
addition to that, you want to try to pedal
as smooth as a circle as you can. Like really

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.939
jerky. Almost up/down strokes are going to
end up in disaster, especially on a hard climb.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:42.579
Instead, you want to think about really pulling
your foot all the way through the pedal stroke.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.379
So, that's seated versus standing/climbing.
