an isolated incident

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.920

I don't know why they

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.229
they made that claim I don't know this
never would have happened

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.430
if she was carrying a gun and when she
knocks on

there's a gun inside it

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.720

box and it will fire in front of you

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.290
just in case this type of thing happens

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.759
the I not the shooter the brand assure
the firearm was just standing his ground
