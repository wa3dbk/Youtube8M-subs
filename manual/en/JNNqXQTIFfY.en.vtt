00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.059
I’m going to show you how to work a really
simple buttonhole.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.070
This method happens to be my favorite way
of working buttonholes, and, you’re going

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.400
to have to follow your pattern.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.630
The technique is the same regardless of how
big you need to make the buttonhole, but you’ll

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.890
need to follow the pattern, uh, using your
gauge and the size of button you want to use

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.250
to determine how many stitches you’re going
to bind-off.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.369
Let me show you how this goes.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.640
So I’m going to put a buttonhole here in
the middle of my work, just for example’s

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.900
sake here.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:46.210
So I’m going to knit two, and bind-off one,
knit one, and bind-off another one.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.989
Now I’ve bound-off two stitches.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.440
Remember when you’re binding-off stitches,
actually pulling the one stitch over should

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.839
count as the bind-off.

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.619
None of the knitting part.

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.760
And then I’ll knit across to the end.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.360
So that I can get back on to the wrong side.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:14.580
Okay.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.490
Now the second row of the buttonhole is the
final row.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.780
Oops.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.729
My needles are clacking against the table.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.329
I’m going to work up, in this case I’m
purling.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.859
Work up to the gap, where I bound-off those
two stitches.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.079
Here I am. Big gap here.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.990
Now, based on the number of stitches that
you bound-off, you’re going to cast-on stitches

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.990
here.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.289
And since I bound-off 2, I’m going to cast-on
2.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.399
Using the backwards-loop cast-on method.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:05.729
So I cast-on two, and I work across the rest
of the row.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.090
And then from here on out, you’re just going
to follow the directions to work the pattern

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.739
as usual, and you’re going to work those
stitches you just cast-on, as usual, and you’re

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.930
left with a nice buttonhole there.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.810
And with my gauge and two stitches it looks
like that would probably accommodate like

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.549
a three-quarter inch button, or something.

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.989
And that’s how to work a very simple buttonhole.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.810
