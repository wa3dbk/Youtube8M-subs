00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.520
[music playing]

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.200
Looking to make a room
more playful and bold?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.440
Try polka-dots.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.600
They give rooms a sense of
organization

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.040
while making them lively.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.120
It's easy to create
your own unique design.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.320
All it takes is a little
imagination.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.520
In this video, we'll show you
how to paint polka-dots on a wall

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.400
Step 1: Preparation.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.240
Think about the design you'd
like to create on your walls.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.320
How many colors do you want to use?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.800
How many dots?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.360
Will the dots be large or small?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.400
Once you've determined your design,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.320
gather the right tools
for your project

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.680
at your neighborhood
Sherwin Williams store.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.360
Choose your paint colors.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.880
One color is the basecoat and
the others are coordinating colors

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.080
which create the polka dot pattern.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.760
Make sure you have
the following supplies:

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.880
A compass or round objects
to create the dots,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
pen knife,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.080
one or two inch
Low-Tack Safe-Release tape,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.360
a nine inch roller frame and cover,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.440
small brush, roller pan with liner,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.680
tape measure and a pencil.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.440
You'll also need
a pre-made circle stencil

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.840
or blank stencil sheets
to make your dots.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.480
A variety of stencils are available
at local craft stores or online.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.480
Step 2: Paint the basecoat.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.680
You can use your existing
wall color as the basecoat

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.120
or apply a new color.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.960
If you apply a new color,
let it dry for at least four hours,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.440
or overnight for best results.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.720
Step 3: Make stencils for the dots.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.080
Use a compass to trace
circles on the stencil sheets.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.440
If you don't have a compass,
simply use a round object

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.800
like a dinner plate.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480
Carefully cut the circles out
using a sharp pen knife

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.000
If you want a variety of dot sizes,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.520
create a pattern for each
circle size and cut them out.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.160
Step 4: Design your
dot pattern on the wall.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.840
Determine where
you want the dots on the wall

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.040
and mark the center of each
dot with a light pencil mark

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.400
or piece of tape.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.520
Then attach
each dot stencil to the wall

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.920
using Los Tack Safe-Release tape.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.520
The last step is to paint the dots.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.840
Using a small paintbrush,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000
work from the outer edge
of the circle towards the center

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.480
to avoid paint seeping
under the stencil.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.160
Then carefully remove the stencil.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.120
Do this for all the dots.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.240
You may need to apply a second coat

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.560
depending on the look
you want to achieve.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.840
