00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.859
Alright, today I'm going to do another test of my
parabolic cooker.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.479
In my last video that I did about
this

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.630
I mentioned that I needed to use a different
method of mounting the pan. So today I'm

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.269
using my camera tripod

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.779
to do that and I think it's going to
work out just fine

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.410
Today I'm gonna cook some Italian sausage along
with some peppers and onions

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.050
so I'm gonna go ahead and put it on the tripod
and see how long it takes

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.440
one thing I was concerned about is how
much sun this tripod would block but

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.280
I see it's gonna work out pretty well

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.380
There's a little bit

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.080
blocked right here and also there's a
shadow here cast by the leg and then a little

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.930
shadow back here

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.810
that comes from the pan

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.340
The reason this works out pretty good is that
these satellite dishes are not perfect

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.110
parabolic shape.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.420
they actually ...

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.010
the satellite signal would normally come
in from what is the top of the dish and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.340
bounce back toward the bottom of the
dish where the receiver is at

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.080
and so because of that I have this thing
pointing straight up but sun is actually at a

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.350
slight angle so it can come in here
between the legs of the tripod without

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.610
getting blocked and then it can
bounce up here to the pan which can be off

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.640
center a little bit, so I think this is
actually going to work out well for use with the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.560
tripod.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.670
Alright, the food has been in there about
ten minutes and I see the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.840
lid of the pan is steamed up a little bit so I
want to go ahead and open it up

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.509
stir it around a little bit

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.509
and see how it's doing.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.860
OK, it's been about 25 minutes and
this looks pretty much done

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.450
All the meat looks brown and I see that it is
boiling a little bit there in the middle but I'm

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.829
gonna stir it around a little bit

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.809
and give it maybe another 10 minutes
just to be sure.
