00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.759
Today we're changing a rear latch on a 96
Ford Explorer. In this step I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.330
the proper procedure for cleaning up and reassembling
of our latch mechanism. Now if you purchased

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.529
a new latch you don't necessarily need to
do this step. But we got a used one just to

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.529
save some money. As you can see inside the
mechanism it's all crusty and nasty and dirty.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.359
We're going to take some brake clean and a
wire brush and take and clean out the mechanism

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.359
as good as we can. This is really your one
shot to prep this and try and get as much

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:39.680
life out of it as possible. So we're going
to take our brake clean and spray down inside

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:51.670
the mechanism. Just like so. We're going to
give it a second to sit and take and chew

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.539
on that grime and break it down. Once we let
it sit we're going to take and use our wire

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.500
brush and clean up all the contacts as good
as we can and we're going to use some heavy

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.530
duty silicone spray to lubricate it. We're
going to wait and let this brake clean totally

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.000
dry out and then continue cleaning it. Now
that we've let it sit and completely dry what

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.110
we're going to do is take our wire brush and
clean off as much of the moving parts as we

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:41.840
can. And there we go. As you can see we got
a significant amount of stuff off of the operating

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.450
portions of the latch. I'm going to take and
latch it all the way down and clean this side

00:01:45.450 --> 00:02:00.060
a little bit. I'm going to click the release
mechanism

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:17.030
right there and I'm going to go ahead and
clean the other side as well right there.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.540
From here what we're going to do is take and
spray a significant amount of heavy duty silicone

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:42.510
into the mechanism. We're going to now take
and operate the levers to work that silicone

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:58.620
into the places where it needs to be. You
can see how working it back and forth that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.879
silicone is going to take and clean up the
pivot points and sink in and lubricate all

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.760
the places that are touching each other that
will drag and cause the latch to malfunction.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.040
From here what we're going to do is we're
going to take and reinstall our release rod.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:25.590
Release rod inserts just like so. You're going
to rotate it into position. That is the proper

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.260
service procedure for cleaning and lubricating
your replacement latch and reassembling your

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.799
release rod.
