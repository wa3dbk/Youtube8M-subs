00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.140
[Steve Myers] When most people hear the word
Passover, the first word that comes to mind

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.080
is usually not Christian.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.110
Normally they think Jewish.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.540
And yet Passover isn't restricted to the Jews.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.160
There's actually a better Passover that's
described in the New Testament.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.109
In 1 Corinthians the Apostle Paul described
Passover as Christian.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.610
And so when you think of the Passover, I think
you have to understand what Christ's intent

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.010
was on the Passover.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.719
What was it all about?

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.570
Well, when you found how He instituted that
Passover, 1 Corinthians 11 Paul points it

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.850
out very clearly what Christ taught him.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.430
And he says, verse 23, "I received from the
Lord that which I also delivered to you" (1

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.430
Corinthians 11-23-26)

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.489
So what Christ taught Paul, he gave to his
church.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.870
So he points out very clearly the Passover
is Christian.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:10.250
And of course Christ changed those Old Testament
functions of Passover and gave us the bread

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.470
and the wine, representative of His body and
His blood.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.690
And so Paul points that out that the Passover
is Christian the way Christ instituted it

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.760
the night before His death.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.010
And in fact, the way that he says it in chapter
5 of 1 Corinthians, he tells us that we are

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.200
to celebrate the Passover (1 Corinthians 5:6-8)

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.600
In fact, he doesn't stop there because immediately
after Passover we have Unleavened Bread.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.720
And Unleavened Bread also is one of those
festivals that sound very Jewish.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.720
You can turn to Leviticus 23 where it lists
all of those Jewish festivals.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.560
And yet Paul says it's not Jewish.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.390
It should be Christian.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.610
New Testament Christians should keep the Passover
and should keep Unleavened Bread.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.660
Now here's one if you haven't thought of that
you should look up.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.090
Take a note of this passage in 1 Corinthians
chapter 5 and in verse 8.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.430
Here's what the Apostle Paul says, "Therefore,
let us keep the feast," and then he says,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.340
"Not with the old leavened, nor the leaven
of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.860
bread of sincerity and truth" (1 Corinthians
5:8).

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.130
So do we allow the word of God to teach us
some symbolism behind what we eat during this

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.420
time?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.770
For a Christian, the answer is not a question.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:47.460
The answer is really an exclamation that yes
Passover and Unleavened Bread are absolutely

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.460
Christian.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.930
If you're not sure about it, check out the
word of God and what Jesus Christ and the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.570
Apostle Paul himself taught.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.790
That's BT Daily.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.400
We'll see you next time.
