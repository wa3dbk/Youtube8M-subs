00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.750
We're going to talk about soleares or solea,
it's also called which is a flamenco palos,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.590
which features a 12 beat cycle.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.450
Yeah, there's a couple of palos in flamenco
that feature this cycle.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.060
Okay, so 12 beats is a long ways from our
usual four beats.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.770
So how do we count 12 beats in a cycle?

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.290
This is how they count it in Spain.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.750
You divide the 12 beats into two parts, the
first six beats are going to be two groups

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.940
of three notes, okay?

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.940
We are kind of one, two, three; four, five,
six.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.940
What's unusual about these three beats is
that the accent, instead of being on the one,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.470
it's on the last beat of the group.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.590
So the accent is going to be on three and
on six.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.890
So you're going to count it, one, two, three;
four, five, six.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.589
That's your first group.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.610
Now the other six beats you group them in
three groups of two, just the opposite, but

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.890
you are always going to put the accent on
the second beat of each group.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.100
So the accent is going to be on seven, eight;
nine, ten; eleven, twelve.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.350
So it's one, two, three, four, five six, seven
eight, nine ten, eleven twelve.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.600
Okay, and you start all over, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven eight, nine ten, eleven

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600
twelve.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.790
All right, so how do we play this.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.960
Well, let's see.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.440
We're going to learn a very basic soleares
compas.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.920
First we're going to do a super, super basic,
and then we'll start doing some embellishments.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.770
So for the first three beats of the compas
we're going to play and F with an added second

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.540
there.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.530
Second three beats is a C Major chord, second
half of the compas we're going to alternate

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.660
between F and and E chord, F and then E chord.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.849
It's going to give us a really Phrygian flamenco
sound.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.860
So let's see how we put this together.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.359
Also soleares is in a Phrygian mode, which
means its usually in a minor key and very

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.950
slow tempo.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:37.810
One, two, three; one, two, three; one two,
one two, one two.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.870
This is very, very basic.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.499
Let me count it with all twelve numbers.

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:56.310
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight,
nine ten, eleven twelve.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.170
On twelve I do golpe.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.230
All right, so let's throw some flamenco elements
into this compas and see how we can spice

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.620
it up.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.239
Over F I'm going to do two rasgueardos.

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.920
On the first two beats I'm going to do a three
finger rasgueardo with my index coming back,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.610
which is going to be four notes per beat.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.419
Yeah, so it's going to be one beat.

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:34.430
So one, beat two, and beat three since it's
an accented beat, I'm going to do index done

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.190
with golpe.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.099
So let's do the first three beats, one, two,
three.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.310
Again, one, two, three.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.579
I'm going to do the same thing on the next
three beats, but with a C chord.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:04:05.050
Let me do those six beats again.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.920
Second part of the compas, I'm going to play
an F chord, but I'm going to arpeggiate it.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.549
I'm going to play it F and then I'm going
to throw this little arpeggio roll, middle

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.100
index middle, A, just like an embellishment.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:43.140
Same thing over E, so it will be seven eight,
nine ten, one, two, so eleven twelve.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:59.590
Let's do the whole thing.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.540
So that's basically your soleares compas.
