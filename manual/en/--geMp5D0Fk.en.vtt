00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.500
My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:16.029
carve a turkey. I usually divide my turkey
up into three parts I will do the light meat,

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.890
dark meat and actually I will do the breast,
dark meat then all the pieces like all this

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.650
stuff we are going to trim, this will be its
own piece here in a second. So we are going

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.079
to take a very small very sharp knife again
and we are going to take all the skin off

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.140
cause that is good stuff. Know what we are
going to do is why you want to use a smaller

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.399
knife like this is cause you're going to get
in here and remove as much of this off the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:01:01.789
bone as we can, without getting into the bone.
Cause that will be not very tasty, a little

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.570
hard to eat too. Although you don't have to
go this far with it you can just take everything

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:19.049
else off and call it a day if you want. But
I want to get my moneys worth and I also want

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.149
to show you how to get your moneys worth.
It is really hard to characterize this as

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.130
light or dark meat because it all tends to
kind of come together here at the end. You're

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.060
going to get stuff that borders on one and
another, if you have someone who typically

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.790
who is really picky about the light meat.
You're always going to want to make sure that

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:49.021
they get the breast because breast is nothing
but white meat as oppose to the thighs and

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:59.990
the legs that are nothing but the dark meat.
So I prefer the dark meat too myself I think

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:11.030
it's a lot more flavor and it has a lot more
moisture in it (flip to the other side) I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.390
got pretty close to the rib cage in here so
I probably pull this piece out, I thought

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.780
I could.
