Welcome to the West Wing Week,
your guide to everything that's

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:09.127
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:09.127 --> 00:00:12.394
This week, September 10th to
the 16th, or "Back to School."

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:13.127
President Obama:
So far so good?

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:14.127
Child:
Hum-hum.

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:15.695
President Obama:
Not too bad, not
too much homework?

00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:16.227
Child:
No.

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:17.461
President Obama:
No?

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:19.661
Narrator:
On a brisk Saturday
morning, September 11th,

00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:21.761
the Presidential motorcade
traveled through Washington to

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.561
Arlington, Virginia, where
President Obama attended a

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:27.994
wreath-laying at the Pentagon
9/11 Memorial to mark the

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:31.261
anniversary of the deadliest
attack on American soil.

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:32.861
He was accompanied
by Admiral Mullen,

00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:34.561
the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.961
and Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:40.594
President Obama:
Nine years have now passed.

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:47.194
In that time, we have shed more
tears than we will ever know.

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:49.861
And though it must seem some
days as though the world has

00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:55.861
moved on to other things, I say
to you today that your loved

00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:02.127
ones endure in the heart of
our nation now and forever.

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:04.127
Narrator:
The President also visited
Ron Brown Middle School in

00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:05.961
Washington, D.C., as part
of the National Day of

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.461
Service intended to honor
the lives lost on 9/11.

00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.161
President Obama:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:10.161
Come on, let's put me to work.

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.161
Narrator:
The project at Ron Brown
Middle School was part of

00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:15.261
the Armed Services YMCA and
included making quilts for

00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:17.961
children of deployed troops as
well as making improvements to

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.428
the school building.

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:20.561
President Obama:
That wasn't me over
there, by the way.

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:21.895
(laughter)

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:23.528
President Obama:
I just want to be clear,
I stopped right about

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:25.161
here (indicating).

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:25.494
Painter:
Okay.

00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:25.895
President Obama:
Okay.

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:26.461
Painter:
That's a good answer.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:27.494
President Obama:
I didn't want y'all thinking,

00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:29.961
like, you had to
touch up on my work.

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.761
Narrator:
On Monday, September 13th,
President Obama called A123

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:36.861
Systems of Livonia, Michigan,
to congratulate them on opening

00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:40.227
the nation's first manufacturing
facility to mass produce electric

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:44.227
vehicle batteries made possible
by a Recovery Act grant.

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:47.728
President Obama:
It's going to allow us to
start exporting those cars,

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:51.594
making them comfortable,
convenient and affordable.

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:54.828
It helps our manufacturing
industry to thrive.

00:01:54.828 --> 00:01:56.695
Narrator:
Later that afternoon, the
President traveled to Fairfax,

00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:59.761
Virginia, to visit the home
of a local family and talk

00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:02.861
about the challenges they face
in this difficult economy.

00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:06.127
President Obama:
A great way for me to just have
a nice conversation with people

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:10.361
without, you know, sort
of the usual formalities.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.328
Narrator:
The President then
hosted a discussion in

00:02:12.328 --> 00:02:14.561
the backyard with local folks in
the neighborhood including some

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:15.928
small business owners.

00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:19.895
President Obama:
This is actually pending
right now in the Senate,

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:22.928
the United States State, because
Jerry and Jim have already voted

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:26.328
on it, is a small business
package that would eliminate

00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:30.027
capital gains taxes
for small businesses,

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:34.194
would help small
businesses obtain loans.

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:36.761
It is a common sense bill
that traditionally would have

00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:39.594
garnered a lot of bipartisan
support but we're in the

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:43.461
political silly season right now
so it's been blocked up by the

00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:47.294
Senate Republicans for the last
month and a half, two months.

00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:50.227
Narrator:
On Tuesday, September 14th,
the President and Secretary

00:02:50.227 --> 00:02:52.695
of Education Arne Duncan,
went to Philadelphia for

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:55.261
the President's Second
Annual Back to School speech.

00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:56.328
Secretary Duncan:
You all right?

00:02:56.328 --> 00:02:57.227
President Obama:
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:58.428
Secretary Duncan:
Thanks for doing this.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.161
President Obama:
Absolutely. I love doing this!

00:02:59.161 --> 00:03:01.294
Narrator:
They visited the Julia R.
Masterman Laboratory and

00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:03.761
Demonstration School where
the President spoke directly

00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.661
to students across America.

00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:08.361
President Obama:
The farther you go in school,
the farther you're going to

00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:10.361
go in life.

00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.628
And at a time when other
countries are competing with us

00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:20.895
like never before, when students
around the world, in Beijing,

00:03:20.895 --> 00:03:25.561
China or Bangalore, India, are
working harder than ever and

00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:29.027
doing better than ever, your
success in school is not just

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:32.061
going to determine your success;
it's going to determine

00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:34.728
America's success
in the 21st century.

00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:36.528
Narrator:
On Wednesday, President
Obama spent a perfectly

00:03:36.528 --> 00:03:39.394
nice day indoors holding a
series of meetings including

00:03:39.394 --> 00:03:41.461
one with General Ray Odierno
who had just returned to the

00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:44.761
U.S. after transferring
command to General Lloyd

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:48.194
Austin to coincide with the
change of mission in Iraq.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:49.895
Vice President Biden:
Hey, you.

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:50.928
General Odierno:
Hi, Mr. President.

00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:54.061
President Obama:
Good to see you.
Welcome home. Come on.

00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:55.761
Narrator:
The President also held
a cabinet meeting focused

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:57.294
on the economy.

00:03:57.294 --> 00:03:59.294
Following the meeting the
President spoke to reporters

00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:02.027
about the upcoming Small
Business Jobs Bill vote and

00:04:02.027 --> 00:04:05.194
republican obstruction on
middle class tax relief.

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:07.461
President Obama:
Middle class families
need this relief.

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:10.394
These are the Americans who saw
their wages and incomes flatline

00:04:10.394 --> 00:04:12.261
over the last decade.

00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:14.261
Who have seen the cost of
everything from health care

00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:18.161
to college tuition skyrocket
and who have been hardest hit

00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:19.661
by this recession.

00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:24.061
And if the other party continues
to hold these tax cuts hostage,

00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:27.094
these are the same families who
will suffer the most when their

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:29.761
taxes go up next year.

00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:33.027
Narrator:
On Thursday, September 16th, the
President discussed proposals to

00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:35.061
increase our global
competitiveness and

00:04:35.061 --> 00:04:36.695
jump-start the economy.

00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:39.661
First, holding a meeting with
his Export Council in the East

00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:43.227
Room, and second by announcing
the launch of "Change the

00:04:43.227 --> 00:04:46.294
Equation," a CEO-led effort to
improve education in science,

00:04:46.294 --> 00:04:47.561
technology,
engineering and math,

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.561
and ensure our children have
the tools they need to compete

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:51.961
in the global economy.

00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:54.661
President Obama:
Everybody in this room
understands that our nation's

00:04:54.661 --> 00:05:00.127
success depends on strengthening
America's role as the world's

00:05:00.127 --> 00:05:03.728
engine of discovery and innovation.

00:05:03.728 --> 00:05:05.895

President Obama:
Who do you want to call?

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:18.027
Child:
Uh, I'm going to
call my mom's cell.

00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:22.027
President:
Let's see if she picks up.

00:05:22.027 --> 00:05:25.227
Child:
Did she pick up?

00:05:25.227 --> 00:05:26.127
President Obama:
Is it ringing?

00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:29.861
Child:
It just says call
message -- have a message.

00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.394
President Obama:
Leave a message.
Leave a message.

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:34.561
Child:
Hi, mom, I'm in the President --

00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:39.494
Mr. President's car, so call me.

00:05:39.494 --> 00:05:42.695
It's really cool, so --

00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:45.094
President Obama:
All right. Bye! All right!
