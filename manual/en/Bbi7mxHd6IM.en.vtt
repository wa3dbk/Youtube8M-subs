00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.760
remove any paper jams

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.039
remove the pick roller you need to
release the two white tabs on the side

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.780
of the roller
what I do is take my finger and on the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.299
roller while taking a screwdriver and
release the tabs

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.620
next while we're here we can replace the
separation woman remaining a small

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.390
screwdriver to help release it you may
not need to remove this to remove the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.000
roller but I did it anyway so you could
see it more clearly this roller just

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.460
slides toward the top front of the
printer

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.090
kind of at an angle take your new roller
and place it inside it can only go in

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.090
one way
don't force it you will know when it's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.460
in when it sits in its spot without
coming out

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.430
when replacing the plastic piece be sure
to get it back on the right way you will

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.440
know when it's on correctly what it
freely moves

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.659
next insert the new pick bully with the
two larger tabs for the rear of the

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:38.090
printer set them inside the holes on the
arm and push the roller forward until it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.629
clicks into place

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.720
you

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.730
now you can turn the printer over and
install the totems

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.790
install the paper tray

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.140
and hook everything back up

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.980
if you left the power button on the
printer should boot right up fine a demo

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.530
page to make sure prints okay and does
not Jamie

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.980
that's it you're done
