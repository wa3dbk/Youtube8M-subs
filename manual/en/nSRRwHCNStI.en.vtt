00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:00.908
Hello!

00:00:00.908 --> 00:00:02.934
I'm Lucas Abduch of the channel "Malabarize-se"

00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:06.666
and this is the first episode of the series Youtube Most Viewed!

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:11.559
on October 2nd,

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.758
3 of 10 most viewed videos on Youtube Brazil were about Soccer

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:18.982
okay that one was the guy in the audience trying to kill the linesman,

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:20.124
but that's not the case.

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:23.507
We already had many contact juggling tutorials here in the channel,

00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:25.962
and I usually do the tricks with this ball

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:28.175
a 100mm acrylic ball

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:31.577
But what if we contact juggle a soccer ball?

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:33.413
This is possible! Check it out!

00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:46.349
In this video I'll explain how to make the contact juggling tricks

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:49.061
that are already in the channel, with a soccer ball!

00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:50.745
Besides explaining a new trick.

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:55.227
If it's your first time here click and go to the playlist with contact juggling tutorials

00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:56.743
there are 7 until now

00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.903
so let's see the first trick, it's the butterfly.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.410
It's possible to do the butterfly even with a tangerine

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:05.571
or a rubik's cube,

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:07.993
then with a soccer ball will not be a big problem.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:16.847
So click here to learn the butterfly, then you just have to do it with the soccer ball, easy!

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:20.112
Another trick you can do is the inside elbow stall

00:01:20.424 --> 00:01:23.871
Remember the learning process, first put the ball on the stall point,

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.898
then throw it

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.375
and finally roll

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.933
Awesome, but you must think these tricks are very boring. Now comes a cool one:

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.088
Top-of-head stall with a soccer ball!

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:38.251
If you practice top-of-head stall with an acrylic, doing with a soccer ball will be really easy!

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:40.794
so click on the ball and learn it!

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:41.543
ops!

00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:43.388
Ok, let's go to the new trick!

00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:46.693
it looks like a chestroll but it's uglier and cooler!

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:50.388
so let's call it uglier and cooler infinite chestroll with a soccer ball!

00:01:50.388 --> 00:01:51.625
you can do it both directions

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:54.527
But I'll teach you only one, and you apply it to the other side, if you want

00:01:54.527 --> 00:01:57.018
the first step is to do that movement

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.528
The idea is to give an impulse with the right hand, especially with the last 3 fingers

00:02:00.528 --> 00:02:04.274
Making the ball roll on the inside part of your arms and on your chest.

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:06.354
The most common mistakes are:

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:08.889
to give the impulse too weak, then the ball falls

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.107
or too hard, then it'll hit your face

00:02:12.107 --> 00:02:13.404
so be careful!

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:16.650
Don't let your arms too down, give the right amount of impulse and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.880
lean back a little if you need to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.878
After getting 1, Practice increasing the number of rolls until you can do it infinitely.

00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:28.158
I know you won't do these tricks in the middle of the soccer match if you're not the goalkeeper,

00:02:28.158 --> 00:02:30.038
but these are cool things to learn!

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:31.128
