00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.936
President Obama: Now, one
other thing I want to point

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:10.543
out -- so our Power Africa
initiative has been

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:15.048
leveraging private capital
to invest in electrification

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.816
all across the continent.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:21.521
And our preliminary goal was
10,000 megawatts; now we're

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.758
looking at 30,000 megawatts,
and we're well on our way.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:28.862
Some of those megawatts are
going to be generated by

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:36.136
very traditional power
plants and the traditional

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.938
financing and
large-scale capital.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:43.810
But part of what all these
folks represent is the

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.213
creativity of recognizing
that there are going to be a

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.717
lot of ways of generating
power and a lot of different

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.186
distribution mechanisms.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:57.390
And the models that we have
in the United States may not

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.496
always be perfectly
adaptable to a rural region

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:09.469
of a country, where you
might wait 20 years before

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.038
you get all the
power lines in.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.741
Moreover, part of what's
taking place is because --

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.644
you notice these solar
panels -- this is an

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:21.281
opportunity for countries
like Africa to leapfrog over

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:26.519
dirty energy and immediately
go to clean energy.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:32.091
And so this mix of
traditional products

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:38.798
combined with these
innovative ways of both

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:43.503
producing energy and
distributing it is why we

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.306
think this is going to be
such a promising initiative

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:50.977
over the next several years.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.546
There was an article, I
think a while back, about

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.115
well, how much electricity
has Power Africa actually

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.650
produced lately?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.855
And I would just point out
that if you wanted to start

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:05.191
a power plant in the United
States, it doesn't take a

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.093
year to get that done.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:10.396
In fact, what's happening
is, is that financing, the

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.366
transactions have been
completed, plans are

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:18.671
underway, and the work is
being done -- now we're

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:26.112
going to start seeing
thousands, then ten of

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.581
thousands, then hundreds
of thousands, and then

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.683
ultimately millions of
households all across this

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:36.489
continent with electrical
power that can boost

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.493
productivity and economic
growth all across the continent.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.594
So it's really promising.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.930
We're really
excited about it.
