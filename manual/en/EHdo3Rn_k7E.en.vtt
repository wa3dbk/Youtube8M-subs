Hi, I’m Sheri from CruiseTipsTV.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.990
Today I’ve got a few money saving tips

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.940
Cruises are great; they are like floating
all-inclusive hotels.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.470
Food, entertainment, and exotic locations
all wrapped up into a nice nautical package,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.920
but if you’re not careful you can end up
spending more than you anticipated.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.599
And nobody wants that – right?

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.730
Okay, my tips today are more like advice,
and it’s the best advice I can give you

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.239
if you really want to save money.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.500
Here it is: resist temptation.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.559
It’s tough love here today on CruiseTipsTV,
but here’s the reality.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.950
Alternative dining, Alcoholic beverages, spa
treatments, casino visits, shore excursions,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.330
Internet access, and photos can put a major
strain on your pocketbook.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.869
All right let’s talk about few ways to give
into temptation without breaking the bank.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.110
Let’s go through the list one by one.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.850
1.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.420
Alternative dining.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.800
Buffets are awesome, but they can get crowded
and noisy.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.550
Sometimes it’s nice to sit down and be served
in a real restaurant.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.979
Okay, so do it, but plan on going just once
or twice?

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.899
If you get into a routine, it will be tough
to keep costs down.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:40.530
Also, check to see if your cruise line offers
pre-purchase packages for meals.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.009
More cruise lines are making this option available.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.649
Royal Caribbean offers packages that can save
you 25% on specialty restaurants.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.579
Talk to your travel agent or check the cruise
lines website after booking.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:03.829
You’ll need proof of booking – typically
a confirmation number will get you access

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:04.930
to the line pre-reservation offerings.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.930
2.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.930
Alcoholic beverages.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.600
As we mentioned in a previous video, check
your ship’s beverage policy.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.319
Many cruise lines allow you to bring one or
two bottles of wine or champagne on embarkation

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.830
day.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.670
Some lines, like Celebrity, Royal Caribbean
and Disney offer alcoholic flat fee beverage

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.250
packages that could help keep costs down.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.530
3.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.310
Spa Treatments.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.080
Typically the best deals are had on embarkation
and port days.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.870
Check with the spa as soon as you can.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.560
If you’re willing to give up a port day
you can save as much as 30%.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.090
Some lines also offer pre-reservations on
spa treatments.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.280
So, take a good look around the website after
you have your confirmation number.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.740
4.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.200
Casinos.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.570
If you like to gamble, set a limit on how
much you are willing to spend.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.440
If, or when you hit that limit, walk away.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.650
There’s plenty to do elsewhere.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.060
5.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.930
Shore excursions.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.910
Consider going it alone.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.740
Book a taxi or van tour.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.940
Research the area beforehand so you have an
idea of what you want to see, then look into

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.660
booking with local operators in the area.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.410
Always look for reviews from previous cruisers.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.330
Another good way to comparison shop is to
use sites like http://www.shoretrips.com.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.940
6.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.940
Internet access.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.420
Unless you really, really need to get online,
just avoid the onboard Internet.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.910
It’s expensive and slow … really slow.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.030
Wait for a port day, and find an Internet
café.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.070
Depending on your itinerary you may also be
able to use your cellular device.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.460
7.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.840
Photos.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.080
The photos are fun, right up until you get
them to the register.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.219
If you like the photos plan on limiting yourself
to just one.

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.590
Better yet, take your own photos.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.540
Take a small point and shoot or your cell
phone everywhere you go.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.310
Work on your self-portrait skills.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.560
It will pay off in the long run.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560
Who knows?

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.139
Maybe we’ll do an episode on mastering the
art of the selfie.

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.460
That’s it for this episode.
