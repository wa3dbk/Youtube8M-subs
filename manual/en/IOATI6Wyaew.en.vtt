Hey everyone it's me, Drew, and I'm so excited to 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.910
announce I will be starting a new journey here very shortly but don't worry I won't be eating 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.609
donuts at the end of this video

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.109
i'm here to announce the journey I'll be embarking on called Fit2Mass where I'll be 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.689
showing everyone how to gain lean muscle mass

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.009
but here's the twist

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.669
the i'm gonna be bringing in my lovely wife Lynn to do this journey with me to 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.240
help women along the way and also to disprove some myths right? 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.209
Right. Actually I work with a lot of female clients and the biggest myth we come into is if we 

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:45.209
lift weights we're going to get big, beefy muscles like this guy right here. And that's simply not true. Gaining lean muscle mass for a female is difficult and with that lean

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:50.679
muscle mass you're actually going to lose weight, tone, and tighten

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.680
 and you're going to get that look that you're going for. 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.720
So we're going to disprove that myth

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.740
and show women that I too can lift heavy weights like Drew

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.610
..maybe not quite as heavy (ha)

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.850
and that I am not going to get bulk in the process. 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.100
Ya

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.480
my goal is to gain maybe 10-15 pounds of lean muscle

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.910
and Lynn maybe 3-5 lbs. So here are the details of the journey. It's going to be three months long, 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.010
we're going to be charting our body fat percentage

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.510
throughout this journey to make sure we're gaining the right kind of weight. We'll be charting our exact meal plans

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.820
our exact workouts and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300
professional workout videos to show you how we're going to do this. 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.040
And the cool thing, we hired a professional
production company to film the workouts as you can tell from the quality of this video

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.670
And we also

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.510
have a new, custom website (www.fit2mass.com)

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.240
built so that everything is more accessible for you.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.350
And that way it's also more convenient for you. So to cover our costs for this journey we

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.170
will be charging a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.680
small fee of ten dollars for the whole three months. So it's basically only three dollars

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.010
a month and you know you spend $10

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.670
on a movie or eating out.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.600
So skip fast food and do the journey (laughing). 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.420
So those are the details of the Fit2Mass

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.590
journey.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.880
Ya, and even if you're not looking to gain lean muscle mass and you just want to follow our progress... maybe

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.219

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.680
So there's a three options. There's the free

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.580

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.430
everything

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.879
and for those of you that need something more
custom

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.090
for say you ectomorphs we do have

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.189
