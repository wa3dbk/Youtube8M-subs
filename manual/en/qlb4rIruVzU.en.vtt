Building bridges. 
I know, see,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.000
we're connecting London with the Middle East right now.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.700
We're going live in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.400
I actually was in Boston before
I went to Amman

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.980
about five years ago I moved back to Amman
really with no intention to stay. I was

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.329
visiting my parents who were residents
of

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.629
Amman and basically, I saw

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.890
something different than the last time
when I came back, I saw that

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.040
actually this open canvas, this so to
speak desert,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.809
was an opportunity in itself to be part of
the creation of the first iteration of

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:59.530
the industry

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.309
the first iteration on the tech industry
which is much more exciting than

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.570
anything that was happening in the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.470
already established markets. You know, you have Boston, you have San Francisco

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.560
and other places around the world so
trying to establish myself

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.200
in a emerging market such as Jordan
came

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.280
as a very big opportunity for me
personally to grow and evolve and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.759
actually solve a lot of the puzzles

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.140
that we're around the region. There a lot of
challanges been I think that's what excites

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.970
me most

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.070
when looking at the region first and foremost. So,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.360
maybe London today is becoming the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.380
hub for globalisation but I think the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.960
the gateway to the Middle East is definitely Jordan in terms of the tech sector. You've seen

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.799
things such as

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.140
the Oasis 500 which I was part of the founding team for

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.350
one of the biggest accelerators, tech accelerators in Amman.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.259
The name Oasis comes from

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.540
the fact that it was a desert before any
seed stage funding came along

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.390
for investment and then 500

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.280
comes from the actual goal of investing in
500 companies in the next five years.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.469
If you want any more information on Tech
City,

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.920
London and Partners and any of these businesses that you heard from today you can

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.500

Thank you very much

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.500
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.430
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.030
 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.020
