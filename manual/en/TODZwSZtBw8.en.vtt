Hi I'm Mat from eSpares.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.809
In this video I'm going to be showing
you how to identify the cause

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.230
have an F 11 or drain error code on a
Hotpoint

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.860
or Indesit washing machine.
If your machine displays an F 11

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.890
code on a digital display,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.099
Or your lights are flashing in this manner
the machine thinks it has an emptying

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.800
or draining problem.
The most likely cause is debris stuck in the filter.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.900
Safety first: Always unplug the appliance 
before carrying out any work

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.760
Also, before checking the filter make sure you
empty the machine

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.900
via the drain hose into a bowl,
otherwise when you open the filter

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.480
you have water all over your floor.
To access the filter

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.160
I need to remove the kick plate.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.940
And here we have the filter,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.310
if the filter can't turn on your model

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.969
that may mean that there's a bra wire,
hair clip or something like that blocking

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.139
the filter from turning.

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.819
This will mean they'll have to get to
the pump behind the filter,

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:21.659
thankfully this one's okay.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.659
A good idea

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.459
is to take along headed screwdriver

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.709
and use that just to give the

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.350
pump impeller a spin at the back,
that should spin freely

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.929
No issue there.
Now to machine is draining slowly

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.289
there may be a problem with the hoses or
the pipes.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.709
In order to get to those we need to
put the machine onto its side.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.859
With the machine on its side

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.280
the next place to check is the sump hose.
Easy enough to do

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.709
give that a good massage this is often
blocked by small items such as socks

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.900
or baby clothes.
On this model

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.890
the sump hose has a ball at the top your model may not have that. If you find a blockage

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.290
here

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.239
easy enough to undo simply undo these
three clamps here

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.970
and remove the whole sump hose

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.549
and take the debris out. If you have checked 
the sump hose and if there's no problem

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:33.980
there

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.049
the next place to check is the pump.
And the pump is easily removed

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.120
by undoing these four screws at the
front here.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.219
With the screws out

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.340
the pump just comes away, good idea

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.610
to check the resistance of the pump
using a multimeter

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.680
set to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.549
the second lowest setting.
And you're looking for reading of

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:06.549
around 220 ohms, now this one measures
fine but if your pump measures over 220

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.939
ohms

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.180
was intermittently not starting you
going to need to replace it

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.329
it's easy enough to do simply grab a
pair water pump pliers

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.700
and a top tip is to remove the hoses

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.920
just bring the hose clips up the hose

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.109
this makes it easy to replace them later.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.670
This also gives you a check second chance
to check the hoses if necessary.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.900
Then you can just grab the new pump

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.900
and fit the hoses back on.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.640
So there we have it the F 11 or drain code

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.169
trouble shooted  for this Indesit
washing machine, it's a good idea

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.880
to put the machine through a test cycle
just to see if everything's okay.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.000
Parts for this Indesit washing machine and
many other makes and manufactures can

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360
be found on the 
espares.co.uk Website.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.220
Thanks for watching.
