00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.100
Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.220
So a few weeks ago, I did a tutorial on how to do a

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.220
two‑tone faux deer bust, and I made it out of papier-

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.880
mâché, store-bought. Unfortunately people were having

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.280
trouble finding their own store-bought papier–mâché

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.800
deer head, so I thought for this week I would put

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.780
together a tutorial on how to make your own from

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.140
scratch. It took me a while to figure out how we could

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.880
tackle this, but eventually I decided that I'd do it similar

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.860
to the turkey candles that I made. I rendered up the deer

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.000
head in a 3-D program and threw it into another program

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
that would flatten out the image so you could print it out

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.660
and then cut the pieces out and reassemble it, so then

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.000
you have your own 3-D object. And then using that as a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.540
base, if you want to put more detail into it you can use

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.060
some air-drying paper clay to sculpt some more fine

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.520
details into it. So enough of me just rambling about

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.220
what I did. Let's get started.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.080
You will need the 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 printed onto thick card stock.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.000
A link to the pattern will be in the description box below.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.940
𝗠𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗮𝗽𝗲, 𝗵𝗼𝘁 𝗴𝗹𝘂𝗲 and glue gun, papier-mâché

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.640
paste, 𝗻𝗲𝘄𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.440
Optional materials: 𝗔𝗶𝗿-𝗱𝗿𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘆—I'm using handmade

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.960
paper clay, 𝗔𝗹𝘂𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗺 𝗳𝗼𝗶𝗹, a 𝘄𝗼𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗾𝘂𝗲, and hanging

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.520
hardware.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.240
This is supposed to be a tutorial for just the papier–

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.480
mâché deer head, not necessarily the mounted deer

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.980
head thing I did before. That's why I threw those last

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.020
two into the Optional list.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.040
First cut the pattern out and, following the directions,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.700
piece it together. After I filmed this I ended up going

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.460
back and numbering all the pieces, so it should be

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.280
easier to keep track of everything. It took me forever to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.720
put this thing together because after I cut everything

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.260
out, I just put it into one big pile, and I had to go

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.300
searching for all the pieces I needed, when I needed

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.600
them. It would probably be easier if you did one sheet at

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.660
a time. I recommend just taping all the pieces together

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.060
since it will get covered up by papier-mâché later.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.040
There's not really any need to glue it.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.580
This head ends up being a little bit smaller than the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.380
papier-mâché deer head that I had bought from the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.060
store. But, if you want it to be bigger you can always

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.100
scale it up a little bit when you print it out.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.440
Now that you have the deer head put together, if you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.540
like this faceted look, you could totally just skip to the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.760
papier-mâché steps. But if you want to, you can start

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.040
putting some more detail into it right now to make it

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.860
look a little bit more realistic. I used a mixture of

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.680
aluminum foil, masking tape, and then finishing with air-

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.160
drying clay to put more detail into it. I went online and

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.880
found a good picture of the anatomy and musculature

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.380
of a deer's head, and using that as a reference, I started

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.220
to rough out the shape of the head by taping crumpled-

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.900
up aluminum foil onto it, like so.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.780
I just learned about this technique. It's actually pretty

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.800
nice. It's a quick way to bulk areas out when you need to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.260
but you can also get some pretty decent detail with the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.760
aluminum foil as well.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.480
I used a bone folder to push in the tape into the areas

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.580
where I wanted there to be more detail, such as around

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.020
the eyes and in the nostrils. You could just use a pen or

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.380
a pencil or your fingers or whatever.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.160
When I happy with what I roughed out with the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.400
aluminum foil and masking tape, I moved on to the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.600
paper clay. You can skip this part if you're happy with

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.580
how detailed your piece is after the last step, but

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.460
honestly, I kind of just wanted an excuse to use this

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.140
awesome paper clay that I made the other day. I used it

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.420
to help smooth out some areas and to put a little bit

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.780
more detail onto the eyes, with the eyelids and then in

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.260
the nose, into the nostrils and everything.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.200
I let it dry and then I lightly sanded the clay to smooth it

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.140
out even more.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.440
And then it was time to papier-mâché. I made a paste

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.140
with about 1 part flour to two parts water. I mixed them

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.840
together with a stick blender, but if you don't have one of

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.880
those, you could just mix it with a fork or a whisk until

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.700
there aren't any lumps. If it's too thin or too thick, you can

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.840
add more flour or more water. Dip your paper strips into

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.720
the paste and then run it in-between your fingers to

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.960
remove the excess. Then apply it to the head. Normally,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.500
you see people using newspaper for this because it's an

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.860
easily accessible, cheap, thin paper, but in my case I'm

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.600
using some brown packing paper that I had saved from

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.200
some packages I got a while back. It's pretty much the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.120
same and in my case it worked out well because my

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.620
deer is going to be brown, so it's nice to have that

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.720
background color already.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.880
When you put a new strip of papier-mâché down, you

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.540
want it to overlap about ¼ or ½ of the previous strip.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.140
And then just continue on until it's all covered up.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.860
Again, for the more detailed parts, I used my bone folder

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.320
to push the papier-mâché into those areas.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.580
Since you're not going to remove the innards like you do

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.600
with a piñata, you only have to do about 1–2 layers.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.440
Let it dry, and you're done. Technically, this is the end of

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.040
the tutorial because this is How You Make a Papier-

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.480
Mâché Deer Head, but I couldn't help but decorate this

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.380
one, and of course I recorded it, so I'm going to show you guys what I did.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.100
I went with a sort-of-realistic-but-not-really kind of paint

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.880
job with acrylic paint.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.620
And then when I was done with that, I went back in with

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.920
some black nail polish for the eyes to give them a

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.380
glossy look. It actually ended up looking pretty nice.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.100
Then, I simply hot-glued the head onto the plaque that I

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.640
had stained and finished with a coat of poly-acrylic.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.740
And here's this one, completely finished.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.100
