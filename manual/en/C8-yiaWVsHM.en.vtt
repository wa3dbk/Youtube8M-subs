Chancellor: I would now like to invite Renee

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:11.100
Imbesi who graduated with a graduate diploma
of communications to speak on behalf of the

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.100
graduates.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:20.280
It’s the hard working organised keen and
smart part time students who stand out for

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:28.220
the energy they bring to night classes after
a long day at work, and Renee was one of these

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.730
students it was a pleasure to have in class.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.520
Throughout her studies she demonstrated excellent
across traditional communication theories

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.690
and more creative areas of production.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.100
Please welcome Renee Imbesi.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.400
[applause]
Renee: Chancellor, thank you for that welcome.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.079
To begin I would like to acknowledge the Traditional
Owners of the land we are meeting on today

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.309
and pay my respects to Aboriginal elders past
and present.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.950
I would also like to acknowledge the Vice-Chancellor
and distinguished guests, Victoria University

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.009
staff, fellow students, family and friends,
and congratulate Ms Dianne Foggo on her honorary

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.429
degree.

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.810
It is an honour to address you all today.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.979
I feel particularly delighted to be here because
my time at Victoria University has been personally

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.759
transformative in many ways.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.229
I have studied Communication and Writing over
the last 3 years, which I have wanted to do

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.229
since I was a teenager.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.969
So you could say that I have fulfilled my
childhood dreams.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:52.880
Also, during the time I have been studying,
I have started a new job, got married, moved

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.539
house, been pregnant and had a baby.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.749
So this graduation is a very significant milestone
for me.

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:04.969
But it is a considerable challenge to speak
on behalf of the student body, because we

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.619
are a diverse group.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.579
There are almost 250 people graduating today.

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:17.110
We are women and men who originate from 13
different countries, speak a range of languages,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.250
and hold a considerable range of work and
life experiences.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.350
We are a diverse group of learners.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.920
But there is one thing we have in common:
We wish to be successful.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.519
We are all striving to move beyond our current
place in some aspect of life.

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.209
People often talk about study as a way to
become successful, as a way to achieve excellence,

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.340
to get in front…..

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.819
In short: to aspire.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.849
But to what should we aspire?

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.489
Many people, including our high school teachers
and sometimes our families, tell us we should

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.079
aspire to world-renowned greatness and fame.

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:00.030
We are often encouraged to aspire to more
power, more influence, to stand out and move

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.930
ahead from the crowd – to be a CEO, a member
of parliament, a wealthy lawyer or a best-selling

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.709
novelist.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.969
At Victoria University we are encouraged to
climb to these heights, but more importantly

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:19.499
we are taught that success means fulfilling
your unique personal potential.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.640
In other words, we have studied here because
we aspire to become ourselves more fully.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.900
And this is perhaps the greatest challenge
we face as humans.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.269
Here at VU, the staff work hard to meet the
needs of each individual student – to nurture

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.459
our individual talents, to strengthen our
personal passion and to help us build our

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.219
unique pathway in life.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.640
That commitment was demonstrated to me in
my second year of study.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.769
We could elect to do a Communications placement
subject, which sounded exciting, but I didn’t

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.689
want to find myself doing photocopying or
arranging files in a dusty back office for

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:54.689
some forgotten newspaper.

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:01.219
So I took a gamble and asked the Faculty if
I could be linked to a creative writing mentor

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.569
who would help me to write a short story.

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.780
Within two weeks the Faculty had put me in
contact with a local writer and teacher, set

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.680
up an assessment structure and even asked
me to stay in touch to let them know whether

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.799
the arrangement was working.

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.070
It was an experiment.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.199
The Faculty took a chance on me, and over
the semester I produced a short story and

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.199
other pieces of writing.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:30.370
I gained enormous insight into the invisible
and often difficult process of creative writing.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.830
I gained exactly what I wanted and needed
from my course, and in effect, VU had helped

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.590
me to find my own writing voice.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.090
So, on behalf of the students of the Faculty
of Arts, Education and Human Development and

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.000
VU College I would like to thank the Victoria
University teachers, administration staff

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.330
and coordinators for assisting each of us
to grow our individual talents, to pursue

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:56.389
our unique journey, to seize our destiny and
to find our own voices.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.389
Thank you.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:57.390
