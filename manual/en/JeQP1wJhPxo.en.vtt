00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.810
Hi I'm J.John.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.180
I love the season of Christmas.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.970
One of the things I enjoy during

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.249
this Christmas season is finding
a present for my wife.

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.939
I've been married to Killy for 27 years and every year I like to come up with

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.340
something new and creative. When I go shopping

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.560
for present for Killy at Christmas, I'm
looking for something personal. I want

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.830
it to be personal

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.900
to her. I want her to really appreciate that I've gone

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.900
the extra mile for her, but also I want it practical. I want her to be able to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.100
enjoy using the gift that I've given her.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.600
Thirdly I want it to be permanent. I don't want a gift that is only going to last a

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.140
couple of days, I want it to last,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.100
and of course when I choose that gift I can't just walk out

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.500
of the store with it, I have to purchase it. One of the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.680
great bible verses says this.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.700
John 3 verse 16 "For God

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.490
so in love the world that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.100
he gave his

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.520
one and only son

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.300
so that whoever believes in him

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.960
should not perish but have

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.200
everlasting life."

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.250
In that first we see how God came
to earth.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.720
It was a personal mission. "For God so loved

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.000
the world". Each

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.260
one of us.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.300
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.400
It was also practical.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.420
He actually came to do

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.020
something for us, and that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.160
was to die upon the cross, because

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.080
 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.869
 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.340
that was the way that he purchase for us

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.720
 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.670
forgiveness from the past,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.870
new life today,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.320
and a hope for the future,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.389
so that if we choose to receive God's
gift

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.800
there is a permanency about it.

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:13.200
Can I encourage you

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.719
this Christmas time

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.700
to receive God's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.529
gift, because it's

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.129
personal,

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.919
it's practical,

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.900
it's permanent,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.219
and it's been purchased.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:30.739
Merry Christmas.
