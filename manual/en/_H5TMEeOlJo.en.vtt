00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.630
I think the public healthdental hygienist

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.230
is the next step.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.300
In private practice you maynot see the underserved

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.340
population the way that I see itin the school systems.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.740
We can take the skills thatwe've learned as a hygienist

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.740
and apply them in a differentsetting.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.550
 I think there are manyhygienists out there who would

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.480
really love the opportunity tobe in a nontraditional setting,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.590
with all of the challenges andrewards.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.530
 DR. MINA PAUL: Legislationwas recently passed

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.130
which allowed or actuallycreated the role of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.470
the public health hygienist forthe first time

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.070
in the state of Massachusetts.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.240
It allows public healthhygienists to be able to deliver

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.480
care without having to make surethat there is a dentist on site,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.310
which allows more freedom.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.550
 CATHY MARSHALL: A publichealth hygienist is someone

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.290
that has chosen to take theskills that they have developed

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.790
over their career and bring thatto an alternative setting.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.320
 PAULA MORRISON: Basicallywhat we're trying to do

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.460
is reach a population that isconsidered

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.090
the underserved population.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.800
 MARSHALL: The program that wedo here at this school

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.870
and other schools in Springfieldis a prevention program.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.270
So what we do is we screen thechildren,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.600
we do fluoride varnish, we dosealants

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.270
when they need sealants, andthen we have

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.710
a case management referralprogram.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.610
 MORRISON: Sometimes we haveto make a follow-up phone call

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.180
to the parent in regards to thechild

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.180
if they need dental services.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.350
And when we make that call, notall families speak English,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.320
and that can be difficult,because you're not always

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.960
certain that the parent isunderstanding your message.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.630
And in some cases we may requirean interpreter.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.330
 ROBERT JENNINGS: For somestudents, when they had this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.930
opportunity, when they wereselected, it was their

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.900
first time receiving dentalservices at all.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.470
It was the first time anyone hadasked them to

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.970
"Open up and letme see what's going on inside."

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.740
And they were very excited aboutthat.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.610
 MARSHALL: When I came intothe schools, they told me

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.210
that the key to these programsis the collaboration

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.320
with the school nurses.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.690
And I knew that was true, but Ididn't know the depth

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.360
of that relationship until I gothere.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.960
In the schools that I serve,when the school nurses

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.800
are really enthusiastic, andwhen I have a great relationship

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.770
with them, the program is sosuccessful.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.230
 DINAH SINNEMA: The oralhealth program here

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.040
follows our policy that we havealso in the city of Springfield

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.740
where we want the children tohave

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.010
the best education possible.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.180
If your mouth doesn't feel good,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.750
you're not going to do well inschool.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.810
 MORRISON: You have toestablish a relationship

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.820
with the principal, with thenurses, and you have to build

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.320
that relationship so thatyou can come into the schools

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.020
and provide your program.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.590
But you need to understand that,first and foremost,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.130
education is the priority in theschool.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.270
Dentistry or the dental sealantprogram is secondary.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.070
 MARSHALL: A lot of timeswe'll get into a school,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.100
and there's testing.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.670
Not just MCAS testing, but anykind of testing

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.670
in a certain grade.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.340
And so you may come in fullyprepared for your day,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.210
only to find out that you can'tbe there that day.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.480
And you have to be accepting,and you have to be flexible,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.890
and you have to work with theschool to make sure

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.550
that you can get in another daywhen it's better for them,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.720
not necessarily for you.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.630
 MORRISON: Sometimes you're ina very small, tight space.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.170
I actually work in one of myschools outside of a gym.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.930
And I have to put barriers upoutside

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.770
to protect the patient'sprivacy.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.540
But the space is small andtight.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.410
As long as you have an outlet,you're all set to go.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.280
 MARSHALL: The equipment thatwe use in the schools

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.880
is very heavy.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.780
The black unit that we havewhich carries our suction

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.850
and all of our equipment isabout 70 pounds.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.790
And it packs up nicely into asquare suitcase,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.490
but it has little wheels, it'svery difficult to drag,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.030
and in a lot of the schools thatI'm in, anyway,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.930
some of the schools areover 100 years old,

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.670
and they have no elevators.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.740
So we lug that thing up and downthe stairs,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.310
and it's quite cumbersome.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.940
 DAWN SUMMERVILLE: Putting itin the school, the kids view it

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.310
as a part of the school, thecurriculum.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.480
They weren't petrified, theyweren't afraid,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.020
as if they would be in adentist's office.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.790
 MARSHALL: You've got to beopen to looking

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.620
at the evidence-based dentistrythat exists,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.190
and incorporating that into yourpractice in the school.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.060
So it isn't taking what you'velearned in private practice

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.260
and bringing it to analternative setting.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.930
There are a lot of things thatyou need to learn

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.270
and that you need to keep up on,which is very recent data,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.440
that will help you do yourpublic health hygiene job.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.780
 MORRISON: Sometimes I'mseeing children that have never

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.740
seen the dentist before, havenever been to a dental office.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.450
So this is an opportunity forthem to receive a service.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.050
And if we can seal their teethand prevent them from ever

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.360
experiencing decay, that's agreat thing.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.060
 JENNINGS: Sullivan MiddleSchool is certainly

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.160
a better place because of, youknow, the program

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.230
that Paula has infused in ourschool.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.100
And, you know, and what makes ita better place

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.670
is it has becomea part of our school culture.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.370
It's not an appendage, it's notan addendum.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.040
It is what we do.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.310
And it's just another wonderfulservice that we offer.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.310
So it makes Sullivan special.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.280
 PAUL: I think this wasprobably one of the most

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.320
rewarding things, because itallows an independent person

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.690
who is a self-starter toget out there and sort of set up

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.520
their own day, and also be ableto regulate themselves

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.760
as they practice.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.560
They get to make decisions aboutthe treatment and

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.560
the treatment plan that they'regoing to deliver.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.030
Certainly the other part of it,or the other component of it,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.540
is that it's public health, soyour variety of patients

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.070
that you treat and the type ofcare that you can deliver

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.910
and the fact that you're thereto deliver that care

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.380
I think is incredibly rewarding.
