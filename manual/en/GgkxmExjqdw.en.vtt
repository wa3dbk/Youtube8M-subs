00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:01.749
Hi my loves, welcome back!

00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:08.329
I know this video is a long time coming, if
you can tell by the description of it, I know…

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.579
it's been a few months.

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:14.259
But I'm finally getting to it, so I thought
I would give you guys a dupe of the naked

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.069
3 palette and let you guys know, if the naked
3 was worth it, if the hype was real, cause

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:23.339
I remember staying up super late waiting for
this.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.469
Let's get started!

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:27.559
Okay, so we all know about the naked 3!

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.049
I don't have to really say much…

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:33.059
It has its own little introduction, just by
me saying naked 3!

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.329
This is what it looks like right here, and
at the time, I believe I paid $53 for it.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.409
It comes with a pretty nice case, it comes
with a long mirror; so its perfect for travel!

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:51.309
And it also comes with a whole bunch of cool
toned shades, that are rose toned, but they

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.309
are cooler tones.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.668
They aren't very warm.

00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:56.439
I got it and I was so happy with it!

00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:00.208
Idid a full swatch video of it, I did tutorials…

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:03.399
I did a whole bunch of videos on this, I loved
it at the time.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.409
It was the best palette ever for me honestly.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.648
Because I don't own anything like it!

00:01:07.648 --> 00:01:09.549
I really love this no matter what.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.639
It's one of my favorite palettes but then,
I went ahead and purchased the revealed 2

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:17.059
palette right here.

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:20.819
Which has pretty much the same colors in it,
and more!

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.279
So, that's what the revealed 2 palette looks
like.

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:30.479
I did my own swatches on them and I was comparing
them one day and they are very, very, close!

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.919
A lot of the colors in the revealed 2 palette
are slightly, if not better than the naked

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:38.919
3 palette.

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:42.699
There is a color called trick i the naked
3, which is a rose gold color.

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:46.078
I'm obsessed with rose gold!

00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:50.349
When I wanted to apply it on my eyes, I wanted
it to be bam!

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:51.349
Rose gold!

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:57.479
I got that if I used water or sometime of
mixing medium.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.989
Like fix+ or eye drops.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:01.468
So whatever you want to use for that…

00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:05.608
So I did get some pigmentation off of the
color trick from the naked 3.

00:02:05.608 --> 00:02:12.299
But then I discovered this palette and they
have a color right here which is very comparable

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.999
to trick.

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.329
And it comes off perfect!

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.499
I can just swipe it and it's on my finger.

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:25.139
It blends so well — very velvety and I just
love it!

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:31.448
Now, when I go to try and swipe trick, I kind
of have to dig in there just a little bit

00:02:31.448 --> 00:02:37.019
just to get the same pigmentation as I would…
but both are very comparable.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.308
And I'll make sure that I show you guys some
swatch photo's on my blog.

00:02:39.308 --> 00:02:44.299
Like I did last time, you guys seemed to like
seeing still pictures instead of just something

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.839
here on camera.

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.239
So I will have the link to my blog where I
took pictures of all the different swatches.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.829
Hopefully you guys enjoyed this quick dupe
video.

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.039
