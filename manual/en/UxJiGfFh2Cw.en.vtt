00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.320
hi it's AlaskaGranny   look at this

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.350
spring is here and it's time to think
about using your barbecue

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.940
so I am going  to show you how to cleanup
weber gas grill

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.219
so you may think it looks nasty and
dirty

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.350
after sitting around all winter buried
in snow and ice and who knows what

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.820
but a few simple things you do the first
thing you want to do

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.330
is turn on the gas light the burners

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.340
set it on high and burn everything off

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.480
for like 15 min up

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.710
turn it on

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.989
put it on high

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.989
light the burners

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.359
open your lid

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:09.359
take a nice brush

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.860
scrub

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.790
if it is icky up here on the lid scrub that off too

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.020
you wanna do this

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.470
every single time you use your  barbecue
heat  it up scrub it all

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.910
until it's clean if it still looks
creepy

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.470
take sudsy water and scrub

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.170
turn off the gas flip your grates over and scrub on

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.170
on the underneath side

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.190
but down on all the  parts  flavor bars

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.670
all of that ash and soot is off

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.880
be careful  don't burn yourself

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.000
do it on both sides of all of it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
get it as clean as you can

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.160
your kitchen floor

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.760
and nobody is going to be judging you
you're just going to be throwing

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.540
food on

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.550
cooking it and so don't worry about it
being like completely clean

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.100
then you want to go down look down below
to where the grease catchers are

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.870
this one has a big pull out tray and a
left-right so I'm gonna

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.520
scrape all that  out and get rid of it
because you don't

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.300
want it to catch on fire

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300
be careful when you do that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.920
be sure this is off

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.800
so you  don't burn yourself

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.860
when you think you have it as clean as you can

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.890
turn it all on high again

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.020
hit your igniter

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.320
and close the lid

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.320
and let it all cook for another 15
minutes

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.740
a tip I learned a couple years ago your
igniter

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.989
actually has a battery in it I thought
mine was broken and a handy man over

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.090
doing something out and I said ok can
you look at my

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.150
igniter and see about replacing it and he
pulled out the battery and stuck in

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.290
a new one so check yours  out if you
think

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.650
your barbecue doesn't light for some
reason in case that's your problem

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.019
I don't think I'm the only person
didn't know that but you just never know

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.690
heat it up 15 minutes before you use it

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.850
give it a good scrub down with your brush anytime you are going to use it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.210
then season your grill

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.039
take an oily paper towel

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.190
rub it across your grill

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.289
if it flares up hit it with a water bottle to take any bottle fill it with water

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.400
and then close down the lid please always remember to turn off the tank

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.740
after using it so that it doesn't leak out
and cause any kind of problem
