&gt;&gt;Mark Viniello: 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.540
For this particular character,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.020
What we're going to do, she has some pretty
gnarly teeth,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.970
so what we are going to do is take impressions
of Cynthia's teeth and create dentures

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.360
that will then complete the look of the character.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.160
We have several size dental trays here. There's
a lot of dental supply places that you can

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.250
get these from.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.020
And the first thing you want to do

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.250
is fit them in the model's mouth to make
sure they are not going to choke or it's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.360
not uncomfortable. So,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.449
I'm gonna start with the uppers.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.770
Is that relatively comfortable?

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.940
&gt;&gt;Cynthia Garza: Uh-huh.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.680
&gt;&gt;Mark Viniello: K. You aren't going to choke or anything?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.610
&gt;&gt;Cynthia Garza: No.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.660
&gt;&gt;Mark Viniello: Ok.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.320
And what we are going to do is mix up some
more alginate, only it's going to be dental

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.200
grade alginate.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.040
It's going to set up a little quicker.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.259
And this is what dentists use to take impressions
of the teeth.

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.840
A lot of these alginates are flavored as well,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.110
so it's not such a horrible experience.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.229
There's other materials you can take impressions
with; there's various dental silicones and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.179
things. Those get a little pricey.

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.149
But we are going to do this old school.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.119
The important part about

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.200
doing dental casts is getting all the information
you want, the gum line,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.179
you want to make sure you have as much information
as you can

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.140
to create the dentures.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.649
So you do it a little different than some
dentists need.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.479
That some dentists do.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.240
This is a product that is similar to the life-casting
alginate,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.759
that you can add water to if it is a little
thick. Or...

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.739
You can, it's not like the cast, when Cleve
was mixing the hydrocal,

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:08.200
we can not

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.440
add more water after it has already been mixed.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.090
If you have mixed it to thick, you're kind
of stuck.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.360
Another thing to keep in mind when you are
doing any type of dental impressions or things

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.020
of that nature

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.560
is to ask your model do they have any type
of veneers or bonding. I mean it's always

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.360
important to know if there is real dental
work in there. That may want to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.989
choose your decision whether or not you actually
go through with this or not.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.719
Make sure there is nothing that can be affected
by the impression material, a good note, a

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.040
good precautionary note to have.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.159
This is an eyeball thing. There is also a
little scooper in there; you can do one scoop

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.900
of alginate to water.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.900
Ok, Cynthia, hold your teeth, lips out again here
for me.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.840
Ok, open your mouth.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.609
K. Bite down

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:20.609
and then pull your lip over the top.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.450
There you go.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.099
(Laughs)
&gt;&gt;Cleave: If you're okay... say something. 
(laughs)

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.390
Once the alginate has set, you're going to
take the tray and give it a little twist. 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.109
Sometimes it is good to have your model do
it.

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.030
To give it a little twist and you'll feel
the suction break.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.200
Let's see.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.090
Yeah. We have a very good cast.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.799
That is the impression of her teeth and we
have the gum line and all the, enough to do

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.030
a good model. You alright?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.549
&gt;&gt;Cynthia Garza: Uh-huh.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.340
&gt;&gt;Mark Viniello: 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.150
Sometimes when you do this, some people's gums bleed 
and you just have a little cup

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.870
of hydrogen peroxide standing by when that
happens.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.969
That's happened to me once or twice as well.

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:15.650
&gt;&gt;Mark Viniello:

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.170
We're gonna pour a type of a dental stone.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.470
This is called Die Keen;

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.700
It's a very hard,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.280
very accurate

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.130
plaster, essentially.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.750
And what we are going to do is mix it like
we did the hydrocal

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.900
and then we are going to pour it in the negative
and that'll create a positive model.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.900
See how the material is moving and how it'll...

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.770
work its way in to all the details.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.800
Alright, so we are going to start the lowers
now.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.810
Even if you are doing the dentures, it looks
like we are doing both sets here, but even

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.569
if you're doing dentures for the uppers
it is important to get both teeth

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.069
and you'll typically see two trays.

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.680
This one is for uppers.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.580
This one is for lowers.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.199
You want this one for the lowers to make room
for the tongue.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.250
So, that is a good way to, you want the roof
of the mouth and then you want an area for

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.349
the tongue. So that is a good thing,

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:05.970
Uppers. Lowers.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.120
So we have already fit

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.509
the lowers in Cynthia's mouth. These will
work good and

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.080
we're going to start mixing the alginate.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.440
Ok, Cynthia, same deal.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.530
Alright.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.849
Alright. So we're gonna do a quick,

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.550
well sometimes the model can do it, where
you do a twist.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.569
&gt;&gt;Cynthia Garza: Thank you.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.580
&gt;&gt;Mark Viniello: Nice.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:37.090
Now we have a nice cast of the lower teeth.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.240
I'm taking a brush right now and I'm actually
poking the Die Keen in.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.900
Especially in the front lowers, I mean those
are very thin and you want to make sure that

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.830
you

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.840
you get as much detail, or you get all the
detail

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.030
for when we put these two together.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.599
You want to ensure that you have a good bite.

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.770
Make sure you have a good build up too on
these, because these will probably get sunk

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.300
in a base

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.039
and you want to make sure you have enough

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.190
material that you are not going to lose any
gum line

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.889
or any of the teeth. So you wanna

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.259
build it up a little bit higher.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.120
And again, you can always carve down.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:26.120
I think I'll let that settle a bit more.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.759
&gt;&gt;Mark Viniello:

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.819
Very carefully peel away

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:40.159
and there's our girl's teeth.

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:44.080
So you can see too, that we got all the

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.490
the gum information, the little

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.440
muscle that is like right between the teeth.
That's all important to have.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.400
Because you've got to account for that when
you do you sculpture.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.009
That will sink in the base

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.310
like so.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:01.930
I'll get this out of the way.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.039
You also want to be aware that you don't
wanna

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.830
to do anything that is going to pry or put
any stress on it because it is very easy,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.460
especially with the lowers

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.909
to just chop the teeth off,

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.590
bust the teeth off. And you'll see too like
the hand cast,

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.460
we got fantastic detail.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.569
Cynthia has a permanent retainer

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.370
on her lower teeth which didn't affect the
cast but if you look,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.530
you can see that we got all that information
as well;

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:34.090
which is important if we're gonna make dentures
for her, you take that into account

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.400
that there is a bridge there.
