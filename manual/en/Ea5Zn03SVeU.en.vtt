Hi, this is Tom Greenwood from sydneyportraits.com.au.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.840
In this clip we are going to look at outdoor
portrait photography.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.680
We are going to look at some common mistakes
particularly relating to light and background.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.730
So were in the park.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.160
It’s the middle of the day.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.910
It's hot and above all it’s very very sunny.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.470
And we're looking at the best possible spot
to shoot some portraits.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.340
So we’ve chosen to position our subject
out in the open.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.320
We’ve got a nice tree in the background
but straight away we confront a quite obvious

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.320
problem.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320
It’s too sunny.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.320
Our subject is squinting at the camera.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.850
Even if she can manage to keep her eyes open
we are going to get some nasty dark shadows

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.050
around her eyes.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.030
So clearly facing into the sun on a bright
sunny day like this is really not going to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.030
work.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.920
So instead we are going to head into some
shade.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.730
We’re heading into the really deep shade.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.759
And in this instance our subject has no problem
keeping her eyes open.

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.720
But it’s really a bit too dark.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.070
We've had to raise the ISO from 100 to 400.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.060
This isn't a disaster but it does mean a bit
more noise in the image.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.750
The pictures aren't too bad but the light
is a little bit flat and on a bright sunny

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.979
day like today, surely we can find a spot
where the light is a bit more dynamic.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.670
Now we are still in the shade but we're on
the edge of the shade which means we still

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.229
have lots of light.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.939
Here we face a different issue: the background
is much brighter than our subject.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.130
That means that while she looks great, the
background is really burnt out.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.849
So again we are looking for a spot in the
shade but on the edge of the shade so there's

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.749
lots of bright indirect natural light.

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.609
And here we’ve got lots of shady trees which
make a much better background.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.040
So all looking good except, uh-oh, someone
is on the phone in the background.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.099
Now it’s very easy when shooting portraits
to concentrate on the subject and not notice

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.979
what's going on behind the subject.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.760
Finally we’ve found a spot where the subject
is bathed in that beautiful indirect sunlight.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.599
She’s not squinting we’ve got an attractive
background that doesn't distract from the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.860
portrait subject.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.970
So I hope this clip was useful in understanding
the basics of light and background when shooting

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.550
outdoor portraits.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.860
So thanks for watching and please feel free
to leave a comment or take a look at some

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:44.099
of the other clips series.
