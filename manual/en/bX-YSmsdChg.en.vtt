Part of what we're doing this year, you can
see the three roof designs over here. We're

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.460
working with the alternative-energy course
and they wanted some different roofs, so we

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.500
have a fibreglass roof, a steel roof, and
an asphalt shingle roof that they can put

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.300
their solar collectors on. And they can end
up using that for their students, to train

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.789
them on realistic roofs.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.400
The skids that are here. they come from our
campus, from the north campus, and what we're

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.690
doing is, we're recycling them all. The wood
products here, a lot of these skids are made

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.510
out of hardwood, and what we're doing is,
we're taking the skids apart, to give the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.690
students practice with the different types
of saws and tools, nail-pullers, and they

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.519
pull it apart, then they joint it and plane
it down, and we're going to start to make

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.650
products that can be auctioned off to different
charities.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.049
It's very hands-on, and in our second year,
in first semester, we got to go work on-site,

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.360
with Habitat for Humanity. We did a lot of
the framing, building all the walls, sanding

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.830
them, we did the roofing too.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.290
I really enjoy the amount of hands-on work,
but also the relationship that you have with

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.550
your teachers, they're actually connected
o a personal level, instead of just a name

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.550
and a number...

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.390
I love my professors, all of them. They're
always there for you, they're so kind. They're

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.830
really knowledgeable about a lot of their
stuff.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.550
It's very challenging at all times. It's not
just cut-and-dried, like "this is how you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.470
do it, and this is the only way you do it".
It's very problem-solving oriented.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.940
We have a lot of stuff in the shop, we have
a lot of tools.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.060
It gives you a chance to do bigger projects.
You get to do actually rooms and walls and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.060
actual roofs and stuff.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.820
I like to do a lot of custom carpentry, and
I want to get into custom home building.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.240
Right now I'm going to go into the renovating
and housebuilding...

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.420
We're trying to be as sustainable as we can
possibly be. We're teaching a lot about green,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.920
the sustainability, and that involves deconstructing
houses instead of demolishing them. All the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.040
other products are left over. We have the
opportunity to obtain them here at the college,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.470
which saves us money, and makes the program
more sustainable all the way though.
