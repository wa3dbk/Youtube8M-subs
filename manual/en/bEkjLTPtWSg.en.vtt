00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.189
This game costs 30 dollars.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.779
It has 30 minigames.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.310
Thatís a dollar a minigame.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.059
Sounds like a deal, right?

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.099
No, it doesnít.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.490
Besides, some of them only last, like, 15
seconds.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.180
We arrest people for stealing pop, but The
Croods: Prehistoric Party! is perfectly legal.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.930
I donít know.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.820
Whoís really hurting society?

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.050
Anyway, this gameójust released for lots
of platformsóobviously coincides with the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.470
animated film of the same name.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:02.030
As so many of these licensed games usually
are, Prehistoric Party! isówait for itóa

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.030
minigame collection.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.030
So thatís fortunate.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.560
You play as your choice of seven characters
from the movie.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.770
For perspective, Mario Kart 64 had eight.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.030
Thatís Mario Kart 64...from 1996.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.180
Which was, like, 17 years ago.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.640
Just...putting out some numbers, there.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.479
Speaking of numbers, there are 30 minigames,
and two ways to play them.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.010
You can play them individually, or you can
string them together in a minigame tournament.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.390
Itís actually kind of like Mario Kart in
that...players are awarded points after each

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.240
round, based on their performance.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.880
Player with the most points at the end wins.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.940
Only players who manage to stay awake are
eligible, obviously.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.470
So thereís not much here in terms of content...how
do the minigames hold up?

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.620
Uh, thatís a good question.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.201
How much do you like being kicked in the balls?

00:01:57.201 --> 00:02:00.950
You have a bunch of minigames here that are
pretty much recycled from other minigames.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.259
Itís basically standard stuff...jump on the
safe rock, throw the paintballs.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.259
You know.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.259
Head butt the flying popcorn.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.150
At the very least, the game plays well enough.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.590
The controls are fine, the game is functional
on a basic level.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.319
Itís obviously a game for little kids, so...I
mean, thereís nothing wrong with it.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.700
Itís just...seriously, some of the most boring
minigames in history...of all time.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.860
Makes Mario Party look like Dwarf Fortress.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.110
You earn points that can be used to collect
cards.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.000
Which are thrilling.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.290
Can kids even read anymore?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.580
Donít they just play video games and tweet
and watch YouTube?

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.920
Iím grateful, by the way...thanks for neglecting
your social development, kids.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.040
We have good fun.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.130
Speaking of fun, itís The Croods: Prehistoric
Party! for the Nintendo DS.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.810
Fun...guy.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.989
Fungi.

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.219
Fungus is...also in caves.
