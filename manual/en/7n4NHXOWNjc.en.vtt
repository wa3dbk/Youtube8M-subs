Neat toys come in crackerjacks but what about
a Valentine's gift for guys. This is Dr. Paul,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.820
author of Boomer Girls, a Womens Guide to
Men and Dating and host of Ask Dr. Paul. So

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.369
you want to give a guy a Valentine's gift.
Well you won't find it in crackerjacks, but

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:33.520
I think you may find a well wrapped gift to
be especially interesting. Now this is red

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.020
because it's Valentine's day and it's white
because it's Valentine's day, but even on

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.480
Valentine's day you could have black paper
ladies with a red bow. Okay, what's in the

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:57.370
gift, well, that's a part of the nuance. You
want to hold back a little bit, "baby, I wasn't

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.440
sure that I really wanted to give you that,
I don't even know if I want to, I feel really

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.400
strange giving this to you." Now what happens?
Wow, he wants it doesn't he, you're holding

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.440
it back as a take away. "Will you think less
of me if I give this to you? I really, I really

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.670
had second thoughts about this," and you tease
him and it goes on and on, until he's salivating.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.350
Alright, and what's in the box. Well I would
suggest several things, one of which could

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.580
be a picture of you in a little frame with
some highly seductive outfit on. Something

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.440
that he definitely is going to keep and he
certainly is not going to show it to his friends.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.750
When he opens it, he's going to love it, because
men are visual, hello! That's going to work

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:57.320
for you and it's just not the gift, it's in
the presentation as well. May your fantasies

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.880
of today be your realities of tomorrow.
