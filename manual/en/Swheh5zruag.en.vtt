Hi, this is Yolanda from Vanveenbulbs.com.
And in this segment we're going to talk about

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.650
how to divide peonies. Now peonies are a beautiful
flower that bloom in the late spring, early

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.910
summertime. They look like big roses, big
pink and yellow and white come in all different

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.259
colors, they're just a beautiful garden plant.
But they do make almost like big shrubs, and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.250
they can get really big and crowded over the
years. So the best time to divide them is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.579
any time they're not blooming, preferably
in the late fall or whenever the leaves are

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.410
really starting to die back and the nights
are getting cold, or even in the middle of

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.870
the winter if you live in a milder climate
where you can get into the ground. That's

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.489
the best time to divide it. Because any time
you divide it when it's growing, you might

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.360
stop it from growing and with peonies, once
you cut off that greenery it usually doesn't

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.079
grow more 'til the next year. So let's take
a look at this peonies, it's gotten kind of

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.190
big and see how to divide it. So the peonies
get nice, bronze foliage in the fall too which

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.770
is really pretty. And this one is kind of
getting big for the spot, had a lot of blooms

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.110
on it. And when you dig it out it makes just
a mass of root system, so I just kind of work

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.250
all the way around so I start at one side
and then I just kind of work my way all the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:27.140
way around the plant.
Until it kind of rocks out of it because if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.020
you pull on it too a lot of times you'll pull
the stems right off which really wouldn't

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.590
matter at this time of the year, but then
you can't really keep track of where it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.180
at underneath the ground. So this has gotten
to be a good sized root. And you can see I've

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.850
got mondo grass growing right in with it too.
So I love my mondo grass, it's another Japanese

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.480
plant that does really well in almost any
climate. So I'm just going to move that one

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:05.640
over here while I'm at it.
And that way it'll have its own little area.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.000
So now as you can see, I have just a mass
of peony roots, and it's the eyes that matter,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.800
so all these little eyes is where the new
growth is going to be for next year. And that's

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.290
where the stems are going to come out. So
as long as I have a piece of wood that has

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.470
an eye on it, it will grow. So I just kind
of separate them out, and a lot of times if

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.810
it was really hard, too, soaking them in a
bucket of water will soften it up, but I just

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.000
gradually just ply them apart. And I still
like to start and give it a pretty good sized

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.240
root, so I probably wouldn't break it up any
more than that already, but you can see it's

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.650
just got lots and lots of eyes, it looks really
healthy. So what I'm going to do is replant

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.630
it right away, so I'll probably just cut off
the greenery 'cause it's starting to look

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.819
raggedy anyway, and it will dormant all winter
and then kind of come up and bloom up next

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.150
spring. And so I like to leave them on the
bigger side too, so they kind of braid themselves

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.530
too, so this one you can see is totally made
of braid, so you just kind of take the braid

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.240
apart and really when it comes down to it,
it's the eyes that matter, and these eyes

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.180
are pretty intermingled, so I could actually
it right down the middle with a shovel or

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.930
a knife or you take a screwdriver and separate
it even more, but I found in the end peonies

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.450
like to be crowded and the more crowded the
roots are the better they grow and the better

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.020
the blooms are so I'm not going to divide
it any more than that. Peonies are a great

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.230
addition to the garden, and they're really
easy to divide.
