The Langkawi Sky Bridge on Gunung Mat Cincang
is an astonishing feat of engineering that

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.650
allows visitors to literally 'take a walk
in the sky'. At 700 metres above sea level

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.110
the Sky Bridge is one of the world's highest
single support bridges, and offers visitors

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.620
360 degree views of the Langkawi Archipelago,
the Andaman Sea, and Southern Thailand.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.460
Endorsed by the Travel and Leisure Magazine as
one of the world's most spectacular bridge

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.430
designs, the structure curves respectfully
with the terrain, a breathtaking example of

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.950
man and nature working in harmonious accord.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.950
Access to the Sky Bridge is via an exhilarating
15 minute, 42 degree, cable car journey.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.340
The cable car and Sky Bridge do not operate
when the weather is unfavorable, particularly

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.950
during high winds, when you arrive at the
top, you'll understand why!
