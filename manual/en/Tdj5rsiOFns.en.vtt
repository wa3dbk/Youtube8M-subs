00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.999
The crab processing industry in Maryland
and the Mid-Atlantic, U.S.

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:10.900
they produce pasteurized crab meat
and fresh crab meat

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.570
We did some work actually with consumers
and got their feedback and they tell us

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.060
when they look at crabmeat in a can
it has more of a processed connotation

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.060
it raises their concern as to just what
the product is they'll end up with

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.400
for dinner that night
So the industry came to us

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.470
and the Chesapeake Bay 
Seafood Industries Association

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.050
and asked for help with freezing of crab meat
as an alternative to pasteurization

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.370
Still a high quality product
but only if done properly

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.510
If you freeze crabmeat 
under conventional methods

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.510
regular kinds of freezers, it freezes slowly
too slow for the delicate nature of the meat

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.580
The advantages of going to 
a rapid method of freezing

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.140
is to produce a high-quality, fresh-like product
once its thawed out

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.280
And when its thawed out, its very close to fresh 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.840
almost indistinguishable from fresh crab meat
So we have a project

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.710
we now have 3 plants that are participating
each one will get small cryogenic freezers,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.479
or cabinet freezers, for freezing crabmeat
that can be inventoried then

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.130
when the meat is at its highest quality
and most available

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.240
Unfortunately that's the same time of year
that demand is down

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.039
Take that meat, very high quality meat
freeze it, hold it and use it

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.609
through the remainder of the year,
you know, over a 6 month period of time or so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.920
and we get a very, very high quality product as a result

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.939
So we'll be working with the seafood industry

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.509
to evaluate the effectiveness and
how well that product does in the marketplace

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.909
We think that consumers
will be very pleased with the product

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.240
The cans that are used in the pasteurization
process

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.940
are only made by one company in the United States today

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.540
Whereas the cryogenic freezing the product can
be frozen

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.030
either in the plastic cup 
in which its first picked

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.160
or in pouches or bags
depending on what the retailer wants

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.860
these containers are much less expensive
obviously than the very expensive cans

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.690
so I think there are many 
good reasons for this change

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.330
in the marketing of our product to take place
and we obviously think that down the road that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.870
the maryland crabmeat processing industry
is going to be a big beneficiary from this

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.970
For 27 years I was a crab processor
like these fellows

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.290
and I pasteurized during that time
and pasteurization was a very good way

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.710
to extend the life of crabmeat
Since I left the business and came back

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.170
and looked at this freezer project
I didn't realize how much things had changed

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.150
and the pasteurization is not as efficient
and practical as the freezers are

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.100
And without this project, these smaller companies
would not be able to afford

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.300
a large scale freezing operation like this

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.400
it's a great cabinet, excellent people to deal with and they have done a great job hooking it up, excellent

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.100
they saved me a lot of money freezing my own crab meat versus pasteurizing

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.800
We just tried it and it works great and I'm just blessed to have one
