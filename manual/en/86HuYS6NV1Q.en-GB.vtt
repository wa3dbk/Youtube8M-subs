00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Struggling with Writing Task 2?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Here are some tips to help you write your best.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
Oh hey!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.160
Are you preparing for your upcoming IELTS test?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.200
We all have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to English,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.000
and a few people have asked for some guidance

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.060
on how to improve in Writing Task 2.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.040
So I’m here to share with you my personal tips.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.160
Plan what to write.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.140
It’s so simple, but when you’re in an actual test situation

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.200
and don’t have a lot of time it’s so easy to overlook.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.100
After reading the question,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.100
take a few seconds to outline your main points before you start to write

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.200
– you’ll be surprised how this simple step can improve your score.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.100
Make your position or point of view as clear as possible.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.180
Writing Task 2 looks at your ability to express your opinion clearly in English,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000
not your knowledge of the topic.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.140
The best thing to remember is to keep your answer relevant

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.120
and give an opinion to the best of your ability.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.100
Address the task fully.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.060
You have to answer all parts of the question

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.200
to show your understanding of the written instructions.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.040
Take a look at this:

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.100
You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.220
Write about the following topic.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.200
Some people say that university students

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
should pay the full cost of their education.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.200
Others say that university education should be free.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.000
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.100
Give reasons for your answer

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.200
and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.100
Write at least 250 words.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100
Here we can see three things:

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.100
The view that university students should pay fees

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.100
covering the full cost of their studies;

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.000
The view that university students should study for free;

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.180
And your own personal opinion.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.000
In this situation, you must write about all three tasks stated in this question,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
otherwise you’ll get a lower score.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.100
Summarise your main points.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.200
Don’t forget your final paragraph needs to sum up all your main arguments.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.280
I hope these tips will help you improve in Writing Task 2.
