00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Escalators, elevators make us, to do less and less movement.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Why should we even bother with stairs, when technology and progress make it so easy to us?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.500
Not so, Robert Schild ... He's 45 years old and escalators are not his thing.
For him, movement is life, and a little bit more ...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.500
His maxim: parkour

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Parkour is the efficient overcoming of obstacles (in urban areas)

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.000
But this overcoming (Parkour) needs special training and stands for a philosophie

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:29.000
Everone can do parkour ... it's not to jump high or long, but you can use your abilities to improve this abilities.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:50.000
In mature age, it's not possible to do mighty jumps or drops, without a higher risk of injury.
And it doesn't matter, what technique you use - eg. rolling - you have to be aware what you are doing and be respectful.
Respectful to your life and your person.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:21.000
It's not only physical training - it's training in mind ... eg. when a problem in life encounters, I try to work on that like I overcome an obstacle - analyze &amp; decide how to solve that.
So the way I'm doing parkour is the way to overcome obstacles in my life.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.000
Robert's body is working good, but it's a huge effort to keep that.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:46.000
Yes, I need more time to prepare my body - the first hour of training is warmup and small steps and  basics - and my mind to concentrate &amp; to focus

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That means more effort of training for small steps and keep up the level than younger people have.
Younger people are very quick, learning new things - they try that out a few times and they got it. 
I have to do thing very often &amp; repeat already learned things over &amp; over again to keep or improve my level &amp; skills. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Of course it's a hard and sometimes boring training, but it helps me (and others) to find new ways in life.
It's not necessary to wait for an elevator or escalator, when you can use the stairs - which is often much more quicker and efficient than waiting and patter in that crowd like a lemming.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Robert is no lemming ... he's using parkour for his life, but how was the first encounter to parkour?

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:03.000
When I was 40, somewhere an TV, I watched a report about parkour ... and thought to myself, yes that's it! And I tried it out ... how great, if I had that 25 years ago ... but it's better to start now than never!
