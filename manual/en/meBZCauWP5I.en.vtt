We're proud to introduce the latest GoPro
camera lineup, including HERO4 Black and HERO4

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.230
Silver, the most advanced GoPros yet. First,
let's dive in with an all new GoPro for 2014,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.920
simply called HERO. This intuitive camera
makes capturing immersive, GoPro famous footage

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.780
simple. A great option for your very first
GoPro, HERO boasts fewer settings and a unique,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.940
integrated housing. Set the camera to Burst
Photo and you'll be able to capture fast-action

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.560
sequences at up to five frames per second.
Next up, we're proud to announce HERO4 Silver,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.840
the first camera in the HERO4 family, and
the first ever GoPro to feature an integrated

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.700
Touch Display. As you would imagine, the Touch
Display makes it a snap to control the camera's

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.890
modes and settings. You'll also get live preview
and instant playback for a truly convenient

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.170
capture device. Capture stunning 1080p60 video
that's sharper and more lifelike than ever.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.380
High-resolution, high frame rate 720p120 and
960p100 modes serve up exceptionally smooth

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.280
slow motion playback in HD, so you can relive
your highlights in all their glory. HERO4

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.679
Silver goes big on photos too, snapping 12
megapixel images at a burst rate of 30 frames

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.879
per second, an unbeatable photo setting for
moments you don't want to miss. Want to shoot

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.700
the Milky Way or capture a campfire hangout?
New Night Photo and Night Lapse modes allow

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.589
you to document ultra low light scenes in
a whole new way. You'll get customizable exposure

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:49.449
settings of up to 30 seconds for both single
and TimeLapse photos. HERO4 Silver also features

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:54.060
QuikCapture, which lets you power on the camera
and start recording with the press of a single

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.060
button. HERO4 Silver also features HiLight
Tag, a new addition to the HERO4 cameras that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.680
lets you tag key moments while recording so
you can quickly locate your best clips later

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.640
on. Protune unlocks the camera's full potential,
delivering minimally compressed cinema-caliber

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.600
capture. And here's the big news- Protune
is now available for photos too. Protune is

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.000
a must for professional productions, offering
customizable settings for color, ISO limit,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.560
white balance, sharpness, and exposure. And
enjoy the greatest degree of manual control

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.300
available in a GoPro camera.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.620
And finally, the camera you've all been waiting
for - HERO4 Black, the most advanced GoPro

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.640
ever. Featuring a formidable new image signal
processor, HERO4 Black is a vastly more powerful

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.080
camera than its best selling predecessor.
We're talking about a processor that's twice

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.340
as powerful, and video frame rates that are
twice as fast. Higher bit rates and faster

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.480
frame rates result in a truly professional
capture device. Incredible high resolution

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.200
4K30 and 2.7K50 means you'll be able to capture
cinema-quality video for the first time ever

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.320
in a camera this size. We're talking massive
reality. HERO4 Black also delivers 1080p at

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.500
an unbelievable 120 frames per second for
liquid smooth slow motion in full HD. Image

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.720
quality is also best in class. Our proprietary
approach to color management and image processing

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.400
results in the whitest whites and most vivid
colors possible, so wherever you are, the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.210
scene you're capturing looks as brilliant
as it actually is. Like HERO4 Silver, HERO4

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:50.180
Black features fast, powerful photo capture,
Night Photo and Night Lapse, Protune for photos

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.940
and videos, QuikCapture, and HiLight Tag.
Also available for both HERO4 cameras is the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.640
HERO4 music edition, including removable instrument
mounts and a mic stand mount, so you can create

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.450
an ultra-immersive perspective of your performance
with photos and video fit for professional

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.760
productions. The HERO4 Surf Edition includes
camera tethers and a surfboard mount, so you

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.820
can capture your most memorable sessions and
share them with your friends. Whether you're
