00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.460
When I was a child I was fascinated by telepathy
in science fiction.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.849
In fact, I tried really hard to read other
peoples' minds, to project my thoughts into

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.759
other peoples' heads.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.670
And I came to the conclusion that maybe telepaths
do walk the surface of the earth but I wasn't

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.099
one of them.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:27.400
Now I'm a physicist and I realize that with
all the electromagnetic probes that we have

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.540
of the human brain we can actually see thoughts
ricocheting across the brain itself.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.730
We can see the thinking living brain as it
thinks and we can create computer simulations

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.030
of this to understand what people are thinking.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.230
So at the present time telepathy exists.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.530
For example, look at my colleague Stephen
Hawking.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.040
He's lost control of his fingers now so he
cannot communicate even with a laptop computer.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.570
But look at his right frame of his glasses.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.730
There's an EEG sensor that picks up radio
waves from his brain, decodes that and he's

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.670
allowed to manipulate to some degree a laptop
computer.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.100
You can do better by putting a chip directly
on top of the brain.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.940
People who are totally paralyzed, who are
vegetables and they're trapped in this shell

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.540
of a lifeless body -- these people can now
play videogames.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.480
They can read email, write email, do crossword
puzzles.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.420
They can operate their wheelchair.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.960
They can control household appliances.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.250
They can control mechanical arms.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.300
Next they will control mechanical legs and
exoskeletons.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.140
In fact, one of the people that pioneers this
technology for the next World Soccer Cup wants

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.030
to have a paralyzed person put on an exoskeleton
and initiate the soccer games.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.950
That's a goal for one of the scientists that
I've interviewed for my book.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.390
And so we're way past simply understanding
the way in which the brain radiates radio.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.009
We're at the point now where we can actually
interface the human brain with a computer

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.689
and eventually with an exoskeleton by which
they can become Iron Man.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.290
And so Iron Man is not simply a question of
science fiction.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.209
It's something that we can actually visualize
in the laboratory.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.989
In addition to putting a chip on top of the
brain you can actually put sensors directly

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.349
into the brain itself that are like hair-like
thin fibers.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.779
There's a certain class of people with depression
that have been resistant to drugs, pharmacology,

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.019
psychiatry, counseling.

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.260
They are chronically depressed.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.890
It turns out that when you put a brain scan
-- put them in a brain scan you find out that

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.760
yes indeed there's a certain part of the brain
that seems to be associated with this depression.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.670
By putting in probes you can dampen the electrical
activity of this and all of a sudden they're

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.670
cured.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.920
On one hand you see somebody who's chronically
depressed, wants to commit suicide, has been

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.569
plagued by this.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.640
And afterwards they're just cured.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.459
It's remarkable.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.329
But this is just another of the ways that
we can access the human mind.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.830
Another way is through probes in an operation
on epileptics.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.810
Epileptics have many seizures -- many of them
are life threatening.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.219
It's possible to remove part of the cranium.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:34.290
These people are fully awake during this process
because the skull has no sense organs to sense

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.500
pain.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.930
You put a bunch of electrodes directly on
the brain itself.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.900
These people can type.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.519
These people can type very quickly simply
by thinking about it.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.700
They think about a certain letter, a computer
recognizes the pattern and a computer will

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.900
type in this way.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.870
Yet another way of probing into the brain
itself is with an MRI scan.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.599
We can take the living brain, put it in an
MRI and get 30,000 dots like a Christmas tree

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.969
set of lights that code the amount of electrical
activity.

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:18.799
You take these 30,000 dots, put it into a
computer program that can then decipher it

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.030
and bingo, what you get is a picture of what
they are thinking.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.639
We can now visualize what somebody is thinking
about.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.130
In fact it's on the web.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.520
There's a picture of Steve Martin, for example,
in one of his movies and then right next to

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.120
it is a picture as viewed through the human
mind.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.129
This is amazing.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.780
You can clearly recognize the eyes, the ears.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.520
You cannot recognize the fact that it's Steve
Martin.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.760
However, you can also do giraffes.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.710
You can put elephants and clearly you're looking
at an animal and not a human.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.870
And now get this.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.199
We can actually begin the process of photographing
dreams.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.849
This was considered pure science fiction.

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.629
Look at the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio called
Inception.

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.240
It turns out that the first steps in this
direction have been taken already in Kyoto

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.710
and at Berkley.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.900
What you do is you put the patient in an MRI
scanner and he falls asleep.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.509
The brain is then scanned creating 30,000
dots.

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:32.389
A computer analyzes the 30,000 dots of a sleeping
brain and reconstructs the image of what he's

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.389
dreaming about.

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.220
Now I've seen these pictures.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.500
They're pretty crude.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.229
You see a picture of a human and obviously
he's thinking about and dreaming about a human.

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.009
But one day we may be able to refine this
technique so that when you wake up in the

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:53.590
morning and you hit the play button of a computer,
you see the dream that you had last night.
