Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with a review

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.190
of Batman: Arkham City Lockdown for the iPhone,
iPod touch

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.730
and iPad.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.820
Based on Unreal Engine 3, the game features
some

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.680
nice looking graphics and smooth, if a bit
repetitive

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.680
gameplay.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.350
The story revolves around Batman doing what
he

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.679
does best: pummeling bad guys.

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:19.901
It features a few of the

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:22.580
villains from the Arkham City game on consoles
and the PC

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.230
however don’t expect the full open world
experience.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.230
Arkham

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.310
City Lockdown is a strict fighting game with
nothing beyond

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.520
a few short cut scenes sprinkled between different
enemies.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.970
As it’s based on the same engine and features
very similar

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.770
gameplay to Infinity Blade 2 they’re easy
to compare.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.770
I

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.800
found myself liking the controls on Lockdown
more than

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.190
Infinity Blade.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.190
Controls are very simple, you

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.440
swipe up for an uppercut, left and right for
punches,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.410
down to counter and tap on the screen to dodge.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.410
There is

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.790
very little in the way of different moves
and it quickly

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.140
becomes more of a game of timing your attacks
correctly

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.760
than pulling off complicated combos.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.100
Enemies are easy at first but quickly ramp
up in

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.100
difficulty.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.441
Most are finished with simple attacks but
as

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.780
you progress they gain weapons including pipes
and guns.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.100
Sometimes the henchmen will go into a rage
mode where they

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.960
become invulnerable for a short time and it’s
up to you to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.240
dodge their attacks.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.439
If you avoid them you get a short

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.979
window to lay a smackdown but if the attacks
connect they’ll

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.490
do a good chunk of damage.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.789
As you progress through the game

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.229
you get experience points for each grunt you
take down.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.229
As

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.039
you go up levels you are able to purchase
upgrades as well

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.319
as gadgets.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.069
Gadgets add another unique element to gameplay.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.359
Each can be used by activating on the bottom
left of the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.310
screen and do everything from give you a small
health boost,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.790
briefly power up your attacks or distract
the enemy for

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.240
some easy damage.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.600
All of these elements help to give more

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.909
challenge to the game but no matter how you
look at it the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.209
gameplay is quite repetitive.

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.091
There are four sectors, each

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.580
with three sets of normal enemies and a boss
fight for a

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.060
total of sixteen levels.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.889
In the biographies page it shows

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.259
Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy coming soon but
the fact remains

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.159
I beat all of the levels from start to finish
in right at an

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.159
hour.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.869
After you beat the game there is more to see.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.869
You can

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.890
play through the game again on an increased
difficulty, grab

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.439
yourself some wallpapers as well as take a
look at one of

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.509
three Arkham City comics.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:06.700
You can also buy different Batman

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.720
skins including an animated Batman along with
a Batman Beyond

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600
skin for a dollar each.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.030
Overall I’m a bit mixed on the game.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.230
On one hand you have some very solid controls,
good graphics

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.730
and nice design.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.280
On the other hand though, I feel like they

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.470
missed out.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.590
Instead of having an awesome open world game
you

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.840
get a straightforward fighting game that can
be completed in

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.170
under an hour.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.310
If you’re a fan of Infinity Blade styled
games

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.680
or Batman in general this is definitely worth
a look but

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.720
otherwise there are better ways to spend $5.99.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.700
If you enjoyed this review, definitely be
sure to leave this

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.420
