Hi my name is Chris and today we're going
to be looking at one of our voice-activated

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.080
spy pinhole cameras

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.570
Now this little device runs off its battery
so you can put it pretty much anywhere

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.340
One of the benefits is that it can run on
stand-by power for a long time

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.009
It can be activated by sound so it can go
into a dormant state; sleeps and when someone

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.149
is chatting in the room it will wake up and
record

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.869
Sorts of locations where that would be really
helpful if you were leaving your house for

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.190
a number of days and you were worried about
someone having a duplicate key then you could

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.670
pop this little device in there

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.629
As long as when they open the door it squeaks
or they talk it will activate and start to

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:42.289
record them

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.800
What's great is the only bit that needs to
see out is this top bit â€“ so here's the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.640
lens at the top

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.789
Really simple device to use as well

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.969
First of all there is the MicroSD card slot
so that pops in the front just like any normal

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.059
SD card you just slide it in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.059
On the top here you have the voice activation
part so when someone is chatting at a normal

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.850
volume that will trigger the device and it
will wake up and start to record

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.340
So that's the microphone essentially

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.390
On the back here we've got the start/stop
switch. This helps you to turn the device

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.820
on and off like a video camera so if you wanted
to override the settings and just record you

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.430
can just press the button

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.430
We've got the voice mode switch

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.290
Lastly we've got the USB connection port and
this is from where you can transfer recordings

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.520
to your PC and recharge the unit

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.520
The device has a 500 hour stand-by battery
life so if nothing happens in the room for

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.580
500 hours and you walk in and start to chat
it will wake up and still take a video

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.900
That will give you about 20 days of stand-by
time and when it does trigger it takes a 2

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.239
minute video before going to sleep

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.420
Just to show you some of the accessories you
get with it. First of all we have a car charger

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.499
What I will say is that you cannot charge
the unit at the same time as recording. You

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:29.280
either have to be recording or to be charging

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.139
We've got a USB cable that can connect to
your computer and a mains adaptor for charging

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:42.090
The mount for the window so if you did use
this in your car you can mount it in your

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.069
window and make sure your camera is pointing
forwards

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.609
If you are interested in more information
