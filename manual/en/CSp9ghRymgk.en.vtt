Look at these shapes and consider this question:
Which one is a bouba and which one is a kiki?

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.639
This question was asked to American college
students and Tamil speakers in India and more

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.259
than 95% of people gave the same response...I
did too. People thought the bouba was soft

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.869
and rounded and the kiki was sharp and jagged.
Psychologists call it the bouba/kiki effect.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.850
It’s not baby talk, it shows we can draw
meaning from things without… “meaning”.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.120
And even when we’re talking to someone in
the same language, our body language, tone,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.239
pitch and accent convey information beyond
what we intend.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.140
I think a lot about accents because it seems--
at least to some of YOUR ears --that I have

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.609
an accent. I’ve certainly never noticed
it.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.120
Accents develop because people living in close
proximity grow to share a way of speaking

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.870
and we have an own-accent bias. Studies have
shown that even one-year-old babies have a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.130
preference for sounds from the language spoken
in their home.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.130
But… why does the English speaking world
have so many accents in the first place?

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.890
If England colonised South Africa, Australia,
Canada and the United States there must have

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.910
been a point where the British descendants
lost their English accent and developed a

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.250
local way of speaking.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.540
Everyone always forgets about New Zealand.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.820
The records are kind of sketchy. The first
settlement in America was in 1607, but the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.820
first voice records we have are from the late
1800s. Somewhere in that time of 200 odd years

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.940
across the Atlantic, accents changed. In England
it became fashionable to pronounce a soft

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.940
“r”, to have a non-*rhotic accent, so
hard sounds like hahd. And in America they

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.900
retained their rhotic accent so hard has
a hard “r”.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.090
Sp it makes sense that accents in countries
colonised later, like Australia, are non-rhotic.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.010
Like this one.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.679
And the way you talk can carry information
about your level of education, ethnicity and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.540
socio-economic status. It’s not always accurate
but it can affect people’s perceptions.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.349
One study at The University of Chicago looked
at the effects that accents have on credibility.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.900
When a person with an accent made a factual
statement, say “A giraffe can go without

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.420
water longer than a camel can,” people were
less likely to believe it was true. And the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.689
heavier the accent, the less believable they
were perceived to be.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.319
Another study in the UK found people were
more likely to rate a suspect as guilty if

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.769
they had a regional English accent compared
to a London accent.

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.950
Come to think of it, a lot of bad guys in
American movies have foreign accents.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.040
"You have 13 hours in which to solve the Labarynth."

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.760
"This is just how your father looked before
he died."

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.120
"I can't understand a word you said the whole
time."

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.139
"I think what you are hearing is my accent."

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:08.749
When we hear our own accents we have a positive-bias
towards the prosody, that’s the rhythm,

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:15.379
stress and intonation of speech. Because you
like how someone talks, when you're processing

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.379
what they say your brain regions involved
with emotions are involved. It’s called

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.950
affective processing, when you like one thing
and it causes you like another thing even

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.269
more without you realising.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.049
While we favour those from our own groups,
with the internet having it’s own social

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.549
groups and dialect, what is “our own group”
these days anyway?

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.549
With so much ambiguity, it’s almost like
we need an accent-free, universal language.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.859
In case you were wondering a giraffe can last
longer without water than a camel can. Just

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:55.859
trust me.
