00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:07.683
- [Voiceover] Despite popular
culture and the public image,

00:00:07.683 --> 00:00:11.227
paleontology can be
difficult, unglamorous,

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:14.407
and at times, seemingly boring.

00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:16.739
But, with a good dose of patience,

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:21.618
paleontology can be rewarding,
fun, and very exciting.

00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:25.029
Carthage College paleontologist,
Doctor Thomas Carr,

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.941
along with student crews and
museum curator of education

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:30.331
Chris DeSantis, have traveled out

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:33.099
to the Hell Creek formation in Montana.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.652
This short film captures
part of the real life

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:38.807
search for dinosaur fossils
and shares what a day

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:41.391
of paleontology is really like.

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:42.589
(simple western music)

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.075
Paleontology is the
scientific study of life

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:49.148
in the geologic past, especially
through the examination

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.950
of animal and plant fossils.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.889
- We have been waiting
a full year to go back.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:56.720
- [Voiceover] To go about
understanding fossils,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.648
we need to first dig
them up out of the ground

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:00.452
so that we can study them.

00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:02.101
- [Voiceover] Normally,
this is a very long

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.594
and tiring process,

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:06.675
but lucky for you, I've
been able to join Dr. Carr

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:08.994
and his Carthage student
crew on a few digs,

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:11.744
so the hard work is already done.

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:13.108
And in this short film,

00:01:13.108 --> 00:01:15.247
we will share some of the
experiences we go through

00:01:15.247 --> 00:01:17.377
on a typical dig.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.256
- Now we can finally get on to the field.

00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:23.295
This is a very significant moment for us,

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:26.848
so we can actually do what
we've been waiting to do

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:27.765
for a year.

00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:33.688
- [Voiceover] And because
the dinosaur discovery museum

00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:35.965
is so focused on dinosaur evolution,

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:39.397
you'll see those are the
fossils we are after.

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:41.198
(pot clanging)

00:01:41.198 --> 00:01:42.332
- [Voiceover] I have
learned a number of things

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:45.337
from Dr. Carr on these digs.

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:47.804
One is that we have to
start our day early,

00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:52.555
because it gets way too hot
to work in the afternoon.

00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:53.617
- Do you want coffee?

00:01:53.617 --> 00:01:54.450
- Please.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.283
- Black?

00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:56.444
- [Voiceover] We also have to leave camp

00:01:56.444 --> 00:01:58.974
with everything we need, so
there's a lot of prep work

00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:00.285
to be done.

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:01.695
When we have all of our equipment,

00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:03.388
along with plenty of food and water,

00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:08.154
we are ready to head out
for a busy and safe day.

00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:10.233
- [Voiceover] There are
three major parts of a dig.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.118
The first is prospecting.

00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:13.204
- Hey, look at that.

00:02:13.204 --> 00:02:14.553
Look.

00:02:14.553 --> 00:02:16.015
- [Voiceover] Prospecting
is looking around

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:19.528
or carefully observing your
area for bone-like objects.

00:02:19.528 --> 00:02:21.656
Walking around the hillside,
we look for scattered

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:24.542
or possibly just a
single bone or fragment.

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:26.764
- This is what I consider scatter,

00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:28.637
and what we do is we follow it up,

00:02:28.637 --> 00:02:31.367
and there's more going
up there so who knows,

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:34.202
it may continue further up.

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:35.975
- [Voiceover] If we find
something of interest,

00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:38.251
we look at it more closely.

00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.063
We carefully dig around the object,

00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:43.806
exposing it without
harming or disturbing it.

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:44.653
- That's rock.

00:02:44.653 --> 00:02:46.736
- Yeah, that's sandstone.

00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:48.852
- That's rock.

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:50.318
- I might've found something else.

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:52.087
It looks exactly the same.

00:02:52.087 --> 00:02:56.254
Usually, this growth won't
be hanging on to a rock,

00:02:57.867 --> 00:02:59.889
it will be hanging on to a bone.

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.490
So I'm not sure, I think I
should ask Eric to come over

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.490
and take a look at this.

00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:10.930
- Yes?

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.048
- Maybe?

00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:13.548
- Yeah I think so.

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:18.975
- This is usually an indication to me.

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:20.570
This is growth on here.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.943
- Yeah, that's a piece of bone.

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:24.582
Definitely a piece of bone.

00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:26.407
- [Voiceover] Once something
is identified as a bone,

00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:29.096
we start a process called quarrying.

00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:31.053
- [Voiceover] Quarrying is
digging around the fossil

00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:35.394
to expose it and to see if
there are other bones around.

00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:37.737
There are very important
parts to this process,

00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:41.782
including first marking the
object's exact location.

00:03:41.782 --> 00:03:43.474
We do this using GPS.

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:46.244
This ensures that we always know precisely

00:03:46.244 --> 00:03:48.327
where the bone was found.

00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:52.572
Then, as much dirt as
possible needs to be removed

00:03:52.572 --> 00:03:54.905
without disturbing the bone.

00:03:57.777 --> 00:04:01.835
We then apply coats of
liquid plastic called Vinac

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.835
to stabilize the fossil.

00:04:05.572 --> 00:04:08.646
The site is also mapped
before removing any bones,

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:12.253
which helps pinpoint the
relationship to one another.

00:04:12.253 --> 00:04:14.374
This brings up a good point.

00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:18.014
During a dig, we log or
take notes on everything.

00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:21.331
It is important to have
documentation on all aspects

00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:23.227
of fossil digs.

00:04:23.227 --> 00:04:24.839
- I'm just gonna take up some notes

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:26.906
on what we did yesterday.

00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:28.423
- [Voiceover] After the
fossils are stabilized,

00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:29.994
GPS-ed and mapped,

00:04:29.994 --> 00:04:32.753
they are wrapped in a messy
but sort of fun process

00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:34.415
called jacketing.

00:04:34.415 --> 00:04:36.539
- [Voiceover] Jacketing
ensures that each specimen

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.433
is protected as much as possible.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:42.554
We encase the bone
inside a plaster jacket.

00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:46.048
When the top half is dry,
the fossil's rolled over

00:04:46.048 --> 00:04:48.535
and the jacket is completed.

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:51.962
The jacketed fossil bakes
for about a day in the sun,

00:04:51.962 --> 00:04:54.432
and is then ready for transport.

00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:56.582
- [Voiceover] Some jackets get very heavy.

00:04:56.582 --> 00:04:58.800
We had to carry this
one back in the evening

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.069
to avoid the heat of the day.

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.587
- [Voiceover] This step-by-step procedure

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:08.171
of a typical find, prospecting,
quarrying, Vinac-ing,

00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.754
mapping, jacketing,
and finally extraction,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.739
it's not only preserving the bones,

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:18.364
but preserving and
understanding what the bones

00:05:18.364 --> 00:05:20.946
and their location can mean.

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.788
- So I'm definitely ending on a good note.

00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:24.398
It's pretty exciting, I
mean any time you find

00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:25.887
any little thing it's exciting

00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:29.506
but being in the same
grid with the portion

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:32.045
of the femur we found last
year, this is pretty exciting.

00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:33.378
Pretty exciting.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.680
(simple western music)

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:41.209
- [Voiceover] After long hours of digging,

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:43.830
it's time to call it a day.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.299
We make sure our fossils are covered

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:47.415
to protect them from the weather,

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:50.332
so we can pick up from where we left off.

00:05:50.332 --> 00:05:54.415
We grab our personal items
and head back to camp.

00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:00.091
- [Voiceover] Like any
important undertaking,

00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:01.623
patience is key.

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:04.242
And experiencing paleontology for a day

00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:08.409
hopefully demonstrates that
patience has its own reward.

00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:12.870
And, when a discovery is
made, if the work is done

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.999
and the right steps taken,

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:16.916
that patience pays off.

00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:20.585
- Hey, science is not boring.

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:21.668
Check it out.

00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:26.071
(simple western music)
