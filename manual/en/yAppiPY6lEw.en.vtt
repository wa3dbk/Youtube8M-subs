00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:05.817
Hey there

00:00:05.827 --> 00:00:07.827
Everyone's voice is unique

00:00:07.827 --> 00:00:10.807
And often, we judge that voice by the way a person looks

00:00:10.837 --> 00:00:13.237
Take this guy for example

00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:15.277
What would you imagine his voice to be like?

00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:20.097
You'd probably imagine a deep and husky voice

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:22.097
But let's see

00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:25.357
Hello, um, my name is Samantha

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:29.497
  Everyone thinks I'm a guy, and that I'm a sumo wrestler or something

00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:33.377
 But I'm actually just a sweet girl,

00:00:33.377 --> 00:00:34.157
Wow

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:35.577
See what I mean?

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.577
Here's the second example

00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:41.257
 I'm guessing you'd imagine that that bunny has a sweet and soft voice

00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:42.877
 But let's find out

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:45.917
Hi there. My name is Eugene

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:53.657
I get really really angry when people come over to me, and pat me on my head, and think I'm cute

00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:56.577
Because I'm NOT CUTE. I WILL KILL YOU

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:04.737
 Well that was awkward. We've had some minor technical difficulties, but let's move on to the next one.

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:06.737
Take this Hippo

00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:13.877
Um, I would Imagine a kind of rough and bold voice. Just what you'd expect from larger animals.

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:15.917
So let us see what his true voice is like.

00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:19.517
Or her voice. These things are pretty confusing.

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:26.057
Hiiiiii. My name is Max, and I'd like to set some things clear here. Just because I'm a GIANT

00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:31.637
Doesn't mean I'm gonna beat you up or something, ok! And it doesn't mean I have to sound like Morgan Freeman.

00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:33.497
OH MY GOD!
