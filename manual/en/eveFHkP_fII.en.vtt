00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.740
Some find this concept as strange as a sport
truck or a high performance SUV.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.879
But once you drive this incredibly fast and
agile big Jag you'll fully understand why

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:23.780
the XJ deserves an R. Whether it’s AMG,
M, S, R or some other assortment of letters,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.740
most manufacturers offer their customers a
high-performance variant of their mainstream

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.910
machines.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.230
For those of you contemplating a Jaguar purchase,
the R models get the heart beating just that

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.740
much faster.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.879
Supercharging is the name of the go-faster
game at Jaguar and nearly every car they sell

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.170
has one.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.840
In particular, the R models come stuffed with
a 5.0-liter V8 boosted to generate 550 horsepower

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.540
and 502 pound-feet of torque.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.549
Then, that power is harnessed by an 8-speed
automatic transmission with sport mode and

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.970
paddle shifters driving the rear wheels.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.430
And no matter in which car it’s utilized,
it’s a powertrain that wholeheartedly satisfies

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.010
rapid motoring and makes the Jaguar perform
more like a cheetah.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.790
This new for 2014 XJR for instance is cable
of a 0-to-60mph time of 4.4-seconds despite

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.630
being the largest car in their lineup.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.560
And let me tell you, it feels even faster
than that.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.210
Replacing the XJ Supersport is the XJR - available,
like this one, in standard wheelbase or in

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.070
long wheelbase form.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.539
This is Jag’s new flagship model and it’s
an absolute beauty.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.079
Since joining the market in 2011, the XJ’s
new design has been a bit polarizing but I

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.369
absolutely love its unique style.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.990
And here on the XJR it receives the edginess
of multiple aerodynamic additions, gloss black

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.439
grille with chrome surround and red brake
calipers tucked in behind the 20” grey finish

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.999
wheels with staggered width Pirelli P Zero
tires specifically designed for the XJR and

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.450
priced at over $1,600 for a set of 4.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.420
Though there’s a Winter mode for greater
capability in low-grip conditions you’re

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.480
still going to need snows.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.480
And how about this captivating Osmium Blue
metallic paint?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.850
Unfortunately you won’t find it on the U.S.
build menu but 11 other hue choices await.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.390
In the realm of upper echelon executive sedans,
the XJ stands apart.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.420
It's less business and more after party.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.360
It has a sensual side its competitors can't
match and it feels more exclusive.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.220
Give it the R treatment and now you've added
another layer to its personality; one with

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.860
a refreshing irreverence for the status quo.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.980
The chassis systems all have been calibrated
to augment the XJR’s improved handling characteristics,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.700
such as Dynamic mode with a Trac DSC setting
for greater performance latitude, an active

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.400
rear differential for better cornering ability,
enhanced steering feel and continuously variable

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.901
shocks tuned for both the road and the track.

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:10.680
The transmission plays right along with Corner
Recognition, sensing when you’re negotiating

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.420
a curve and holding the gear until exit.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.650
The primarily aluminum body and lack of all-wheel
drive components mean it’s by far the featherweight

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.120
of its class so it drives smaller than it
appears.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.700
And its sound is distinctly Jaguar with a
loud roar upon take-off.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.100
The ride is supple and the XJR as a whole
is executive sedan quiet and inclusively comfortable.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.460
It is a phenomenal car to drive for either
work or play.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.210
Gas mileage is rated at 15mpg city/23mpg highway.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.180
My XJR tester is enhanced with the Illumination
package adding blue accent lighting to the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:59.050
interior and radar-based adaptive cruise control
for an as-tested price of $120,895.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.010
Even in regular wheelbase form, the XJR’s
dimensions are impressive and the design is

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.980
particularly sensuous and uncluttered for
a car of this ilk.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.520
But some of that has to do with the lack of
depth afforded by the infotainment system

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.489
which trails Audi’s MMI system in richness
and features.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.650
It’s also slow to react.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.040
No Wifi, Google Maps or telematics here.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.010
And speaking of Audi, they sell a faster,
less expensive, more fuel efficient all-wheel

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.750
drive car called the S8 that’s a thorn in
Jag’s side, though the XJR provides a bit

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.879
more space all around.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:39.800
But there’s no doubting Jaguar has something
special here that a select few will surely

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.470
enjoy.
