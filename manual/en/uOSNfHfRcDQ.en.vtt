What's up guys, this is Breanna AKA Mini Marley
and in today's video I'm going to be showing

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.630
you guys how to rock some super cute hair
jewelry like this one so yes. I feel like

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.750
to a really big misconception that naturals
with really big kinky curly hair can't wear

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.210
the same hair jewelry that other people can
because it's just a little bit trickier to

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.570
do and it's harder, but I would not take no
for an answer. I am really, really feeling

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.840
the bohemian vibe for this summer. If you
haven't already checked out my bohemian

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.660
inspired spring lookbook then you should definitely
do that for some fashion inspiration to go

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.450
along with your new hair jewelry, but yes
so I am definitely feeling that look so I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.030
had to figure out a way to rock some cute
hair jewelry and I did so if you're interested

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.280
in figuring out how you can do it too then
keep watching this video. I know you want

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.859
to see how to do this girl.
So, I've already washed my hair and I'm rocking

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.780
an old wash and go and I washed it using the
Motions Lavish Conditioning Shampoo and the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.779
Moisture Plus Conditioner and you guys have
seen me use this before because it's so great

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:24.979
for cleansing my hair and the conditioner
really helps me detangled. So, I'm basically

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.920
going to go ahead and get ready to apply my
first piece of hair jewelry by twisting a

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.090
little section of my hair on each side of
my middle part and then I'm just going to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.209
go ahead and pin that down as you can see
me doing here. So, I'm going to

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:55.490
show this exact same step on the other side.
So, once you have each side of your hair pinned

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.579
down at the front this is what it should look
like and it's time for our first piece of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.359
hair jewelry. Now, I love these. They're basically
a headband and they have a chain attached

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.660
to them and they come in a million different
styles. So, I'm going to go ahead and push

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.260
that down right behind my two little twisties
and that basically just gives me a flat surface

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.500
for where my hair jewelry can lay because
when your hair is all the way out it's almost

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.500
impossible to do this. So, now that I have
that pushed in I'm basically just going to pin

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.970
down these sides because they are a little
bit loose and I want to make sure that my

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.000
hair jewelry stays put all day and after you've
done that you're basically done with our first

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.280
style super easy, super simple, but look how
cute it looks and it really dresses up whatever

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.460
outfit you decide to wear that day.
So, I just want to show you this with another

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.800
piece of jewelry. It's basically the same
idea just a different style and I'm going

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.200
to do the exact same thing, just go ahead
and pin those down on either side and you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.310
have another look. I really, really love this
so of course I have to take a million and

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.370
one selfies. Make sure that you guys are following
me on Snapchat for these. Do I look bohemian

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.960
yet? So, for this next one I'm basically just
going to do a roll and tuck throughout my

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.210
entire head and it's really self explanatory.
You're just basically pulling your hair into

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.150
this little rolling motion and just rolling
around your entire head and they basically

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.180
just meet at the back. So, this is much easier
for me to show you than to tell you so just

00:03:30.180 --> 00:04:08.230
keep watching. Now, I know that can be a little
tricky, but practice makes perfect and you

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:20.269
can just keep pinning your hair as you go
to make it easier. And I'm ready for my next

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.129
piece of jewelry. This one has to be my ultimate
favorite and It basically has these two

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:30.729
little clips and what I'm going to do is just
push those down in my hair right at the center

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:40.879
and bam, I have another look. So, this one
is super, super cute and again it goes really

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:47.740
great with the bohemian look if you're feeling
that vibe for the summer.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.009
So, for this next look all I'm going to do
is create a low ponytail on my hair and I'm

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.020
just leaving out my two little side pieces
as I always do and then I'm just basically

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.599
going to use a rubber band and put that over
my hair one time. I'm not going to really

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.650
wrap it multiple times because I just want
a loose effortless puff and for those of you

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.259
that ask me how I get my puff to look so big,
there it is super easy. All you do is basically

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.120
pull one side of the rubber band and hold
it down on your head and then fluff out your

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.460
hair and it basically forces the rubber band
to be bigger which allows you hair to basically

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.490
just be really fluffy instead of small and
contained. So, this is how big my giant puff

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.539
Is looking right now and let's moved on
to the next piece of jewelry. This is one

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.199
of my favorites as well. It's just a really
nice head piece and I'm just going to pull

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.069
this over. I'm going to make sure that the
front of this is sitting on my forehead and

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.240
then pull this over the top of my hair then
I'm just going to use this little comb to

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.680
make sure that all my hair is smooth out and
through this hair jewelry and then I'm just

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.639
going to separate the chains and there you
go. This is super cute, super easy and the

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.169
low puff just helps it sit nicely on your
head.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:11.550
Now, for those of you that watched my bohemian
lookbook this is the same style of hair jewelry

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.020
that I wore in that video and here it is how
I applied that one. I basically had a really

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.219
sleek nice bun that day and I again use the
Suave Professionals Firm Control Sculpting

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:26.839
Gel to make sure that my hair was nice and
sleek down and then I applied that headpiece

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:31.639
and this is what it looks like. Again, super
easy and this one is easiest to do when you

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.029
had your hair in some kind of low puff or
bun. So, these are all of my different styles

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:41.699
using hair jewelry with natural hair. As you
can see, it's definitely possible and it's

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:46.639
so cute and it gives you that nice bohemian
chick look so I really hope you guys enjoyed
