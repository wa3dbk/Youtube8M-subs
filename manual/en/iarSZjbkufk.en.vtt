Hi, I'm Paes 164.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.980
Now I am going to show you how to do a character.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.760
Once again, getting your base wall color down,
I feel that black is a great color to start

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.310
a character with, that way you kind of build
up off your shadows.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.730
So I'm just going to do a little goofy little
monster, something I might typically replace

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.770
my E of my graffiti piece, so it'd be P-A,
graffiti monster, S still representing my

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.770
E.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.840
Let's go ahead and start off with the base
shape of the monster and I'm going to use

00:00:33.840 --> 00:01:14.100
the same color that I'm going to paint my
monster, a blue monster in for my sketching.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.700
Having that black as a background, as a base
definitely eliminates spending a lot of time

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.609
having to shade in all that black.

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.100
You can just come in and see what I'm doing.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:36.159
I'm kind of just building this blue into the
black and only as my base color.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:46.829
Doing some of the same flair techniques, as
I've shown in the other videos.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:54.139
Kind of working my way all the way around
the lip with this blue.

00:01:54.139 --> 00:02:03.809
Again, whether realistic or cartoonish the
black really serves as a good base to fade

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:04.950
into.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.539
I also came in with a little bit of a darker
blue, but you can still see how I'm utilizing

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.860
that black to build my shades up off of.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.579
I got these big bubbly eyes popping up.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:33.540
I'm going to go ahead and re-outline them
white and color them in.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:44.180
Getting into your character it's definitely
better to use thinner tips and outline tips.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.900
Like the graffiti piece itself where you're
building up from a primer and building into

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.219
it with the cuts and the fades and everything
we talked about.

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.959
Now I'm going to come in and also add a little
bit of the background.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.870
Kind of the same type of landscape background
that we worked on in other pieces, just by

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.629
fading in my darker color purple.

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:13.730
I'm using a little bit of a fatter tip.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:26.370
That way you get a nice fade easy.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.550
Right now, I'm going through and just getting
all my outline done, some areas doing some

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.250
thicker lines.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.049
I'm getting this setup for all the highlights
I'll be doing in my green.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:52.189
All right, I'm working my way through this
character looking pretty shabby-shabby.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.360
I'm just going to take a little bit of this
green, something that's going to compliment

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.109
the blue, do a couple of highlights and you
know just have a lot of fun.

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.069
Whenever you do do characters, like I said,
it's just kind of a format on how to break

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.069
it down.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.890
Whether it is realistic or cartoonish just
get your base color down, get a good background

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.890
color going.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.079
Use the right type of tips and just break
it down and format it right back out.

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:28.360
This green is really going to set it off.
