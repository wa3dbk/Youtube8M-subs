00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Trouble spots in your lawn have you puzzled?

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:04.389
No problem

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:12.585
Finally, there's a single tool that lets you inexpensively repair 
 bare spots in your lawn quickly and easily.

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:20.550
It's the revolutionary Grass Stitcher, the world's first and 
 only hand tool for fast, effective lawn repairs.

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:29.536
No bulky power machines, no heavy sod, no messy, 
 ineffective patch materials, no wheelbarrow heavy top soil.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:39.636
No need to remove dead lawn, the Grass Stitcher works right through dead grass, 
 and, leaving the organic material in place, adds beneficial mulch and nutrients.

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.516
It's as easy as one, two, three.

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:46.417
One, perforate the trouble spot with the Grass Stitcher.

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:49.923
Two, spread grass seed.

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:53.568
Three, and water the area.

00:00:55.426 --> 00:01:00.163
The Grass Stitcher, it's quick, easy, effective, and you'll love the results.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:04.041
Grass seed needs several conditions in order to germinate. 

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:12.678
It must be planted at the proper depth, surrounded by soil, kept 
 moist, and covered with mulch for protection from the sun

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:17.183
These were the design requirements when when engineering the Grass Stitcher.

00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:26.982
I've been in the lawn caring industry for over thirty years, and during that time, I've often needed to 
 repair small lawn areas that were just too small for the big bulky seeding machines that we have.

00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:35.132
So I used whatever tools that were available to me on the market, none of 
 them was designed and built for repairing lawns, none of them worked very well.

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:36.804
So I set out and invented my own.

00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:42.000
But I knew there were certain requirements that I had to meet 
 for this tool to be successful and to work properly.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:54.220
Grass seed needs to be planted at the proper depth, it needs to have good seed-soil contact, meaning the seed needs to be surrounded 
 by soil so it wouldn't dry out, and it needs to be protected from the sun, so the sun doesn't dry it out.

00:01:54.707 --> 00:01:59.020
The tool needs to be easy to use, and it has 
 to be rugged and durable for years of use.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:04.320
After many years of research in many prototypes, I 
 finally got it right with the Grass Stitcher.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:10.540
The combination of the efficient handle design and the unique 
 patent-pending in the wheels solved all the requirements.

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:16.140
And best of all, you don't need to remove the dead lawn, 
 just make the perforations directly through it and leave it.

00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:23.590
The dead organic lawn material axes mulch and protects the seed from 
 drying out, then decomposes and adds beneficial organic soil food.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:29.770
Finally, it's easy to make lawn repairs, just stitch, seed, and sprinkle.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.110
The Grass Stitcher makes the whole process simple and easy.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:43.840
By leveraging  leg power or body weight, depending on soil stiffness, the Grass Stitcher 
 innovative handle design efficiently transfers the correct amount of force to penetrate the soil.

00:02:44.304 --> 00:02:47.900
So you get proper planting depth every time with minimal effort.

00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:55.310
And the Grass Stitcher is a great value, it effectively repairs damaged 
 lawns at a fraction of the cost of other methods.

00:02:55.984 --> 00:03:01.320
Eliminate those unsightly damaged areas quickly and easily with the Grass Stitcher.

00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:04.230
The Grass Stitcher goes where other tools can't.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:09.220
You can stitch the edges of curbs, walks, 
 or around sprinkler heads in a snap.

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:12.700
The Grass Stitcher is perfect for thin lawn areas.

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:18.600
thicken sparse areas easily and quickly by stitching directly through remaining grass blades.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:24.640
The sturdy Grass Stitcher delivers a return on 
 your investment every time you use it.

00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:31.420
This makes the Grass Stitcher much less expensive than 
 any other method, and it works every time.

00:03:32.672 --> 00:03:35.320
So don't waste time and money on inexpensive gimmicks. 

00:03:36.317 --> 00:03:42.390
Have you ever sprinkled one of those messy bag patch materials 
 only to see some of it germinate then wither away?

00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:47.650
This happens because poor soil-seed contact results in the seed drying out.

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:50.990
Choose the method that really works every time.

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:50.990
Choose the method that really works every time.

00:03:51.224 --> 00:03:54.940
The Grass Stitcher, for successful repairs every time.

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:59.510
People everywhere are turning to organic lawn care to insure a healthier environment.

00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:06.020
the Grass Stitcher is the perfect tool to create a 
 healthy, safe, and beautiful lawn free of chemicals.

00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:10.820
Never again, use chemicals to address insects and diseases in you lawn

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:17.560
Repair your pest or disease damaged lawn quickly, 
 effectively, and inexpensively with the Grass Stitcher.

00:04:18.577 --> 00:04:20.530
Water with a lot of crabgrass forever?

00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:23.860
Break with the crabgrass cycle with the Grass Stitcher.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:31.120
Just stitch, seed, and sprinkle directly through it and 
 watch your grass over grow that unsightly crabgrass.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:35.110
Plant your favourite plants, flowers, or alternative ground cover.

00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:41.010
Just stitch, seed, and sprinkle then watch you yard transform to a colourful retreat.

00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:45.370
Have you ever used a grading rake or one 
 of those other tools to repair your lawn?

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:57.770
Then you know how difficult it is to penetrate the soil, how quickly your arms get sore, plus 
 you get poor results because those tools can't provide the proper planting depth and soil-seed contact.

00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:02.900
Unique patent-pending wheel design creates the perfect environment for seed germination.

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:10.100
As the the tines penetrate the soil it creates a mounding and loosening 
 of the soil around the rim of an extra wide hole.

00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:13.610
That extra wide hole will accept the seed very easily.

00:05:14.027 --> 00:05:20.250
Then, when you water, the loose soil falls around the 
 seed, creating a perfect environment for seed germination.

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:27.960
So stop wasting your time with the wrong tool for the job 
 and let the Grass Stitcher fix your lawn with ease.

00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:31.160
If you have extensive lawn damage, no problem.

00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:33.320
Large law repairs are a snap.

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:39.080
Just purchase an additional  head to double the size 
 of your Grass Stitcher for even quicker lawn repairs.

00:05:39.824 --> 00:05:43.080
It's as easy as one, two, three.

00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:46.050
Just stitch, seed, and sprinkle.

00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:52.040
With the Grass Stitcher, it's quick ,easy, effective, and you'll love the results.

00:05:53.617 --> 00:06:00.350
