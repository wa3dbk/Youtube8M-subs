00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.720
Today we’re going to discuss putting in
a convertible car seat for your infant.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.400
A convertible seat is a seat that can be rear
facing up to the specified weight limit of

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.980
your particular seat and forward facing after
that.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.489
So when you are getting ready to install the
car seat, make sure that you read the owner’s

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.300
manual to see how you can determine whether
it is at a 45 degree angle. With infants it

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.210
has to be a 45 degree angle, most seats, because
the child does not have control over their

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.210
neck.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.450
If you will look here on the side you will
see that there’s a line. This line needs

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.360
to be parallel to the ground. A 45 degree
angle is right about there. So if you need

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.189
to add some support underneath the seat for
the child to be at a 45 degree angle that’s

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:05.489
ok. There are a couple of options. You can
go to the dollar store buy a really long noodle

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.250
and cut it, and stick it underneath, so that
will keep it at the 45 degree angle. Or you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.880
can grab a towel from your house and roll
it up and put it underneath.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.380
When you get ready to put your child in the
seat after you’ve got it installed correctly

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.440
in the car, make sure you are using the correct
belt path

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.780
The harness straps for this seat, when your
child is in this seat, should be at shoulder

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.170
level or below. Also when the harness straps
are clipped in, you should not be able to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.210
pinch any fabric between your fingers. And
the harness chest piece should be at armpit

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.620
level and most of the seats now will have
that printed on the chest piece.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.710
If your child is a small child and you are
worried about wiggle room from side to side,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.650
again, dollar store noodle, you can put a
dollar store noodle on each side or again,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.740
you can roll up a baby blanket or a towel
and put that on each side. It won’t affect

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.250
the safety of the seat.
When purchasing a car seat, be sure to purchase

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.250
a car seat that you will use correctly every
single time. Be aware that all car seats have

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.310
to pass the same strict safety standards.
A lot of parents want to use the car seats

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.739
with the handles. Those car seats are just
as safe. However, be aware that you will only

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.060
be using that probably for about the first
4 months. Your best bet is to buy a convertible

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.010
car seat. It is rear facing up to the weight
limit on that seat and then front facing also

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.019
up to the specified limit on that seat.
