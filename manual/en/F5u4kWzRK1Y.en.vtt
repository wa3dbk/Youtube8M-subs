00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.230
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.310
Hello and welcome to the Daily Spin.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.530
I'm Steve, the owner of inlineskates.com, and today, joining us

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.750
is Mike Powell from K2 Skate. The skate guru all the way in from Seattle.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.890
Thanks for joining us, Mike.
Hey, thanks for having me.
So, we're getting into some cool skates now.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.930
This is the F.I.T. X Pro from K2. This is sort of the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.190
middle-of-the-road, performance skate, it's got a lot of nice real bells and whistles.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.390
We're starting to get into the, kind of, cool things that you guys do that's different from many of the other vendors.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.560
Yep.
So, there's a bunch of things going on with this skate but

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.720
let's kind of start out at the top. So, the closure is different here than it was on the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.780
model below this one. You've got the Speedlace system. Kind of tell us about that.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.000
So, the Speedlace system really makes it easy to get in and out of the skate. It's definitely

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.190
convenient and a performance feature as well. You get a great fit.  Pretty much

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.660
you have this pull right here and when you get your foot in, it's just one strong

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.700
pull of this handle.
It locks by itself.
And it locks by itself and you're

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.830
ready to go.
That's snugger than a typical tie lace, right?
It's snugger and a lot

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.030
quicker than a regular tie.
Plus you can even tighten it on the fly because you're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.230
skates, you tend to loosen up a little bit on the fly sometimes.
Yeah, you know, you can be going really

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.400
fast on the trail and just lean down, pull up and you got it a little bit tighter so it's easy to do.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.810
And you combine that with the Powerstrap that really holds the heel back in that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.930
heel pocket and this ratcheting buckle here that engages

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.990
the cuff and gives you a lot of support and it is the total package for a great fit.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.170
Okay. So, that's on the upper. Now, on the lower, we've got a couple of upgrades. We've got an upgrade in

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.360
the wheels and in the frame.
Yes. So, you've got an

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.510
aluminum frame here which really transfers power from the skater to the road.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.640
So, this is the first price point of getting the aluminum frame

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.840
versus the composite frame.
Exactly.
What's the benefit of an aluminum frame?

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.030
It's just in power transfer. You're going to be able to hit higher speeds. It's going to be more stable at speed.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.200
It's just a better skating frame for that higher end skater.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.340
It doesn't flex as much so it transfer the power directly to the wheels.
Exactly.
Now, this one's got Hi-Lo.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.420
Smaller wheels in the front, higher wheels in the back. Why do you do that?
So, we do that.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.650
it's a mix of low center of gravity, maneuverability,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.820
and speed. So, you're going to generate higher speeds

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.860
from the bigger wheels in the back. You're still going to have maneuverability because you've got smaller wheels in the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.930
front so it's going to allow you to corner and just go edge-to-edge a little bit faster and,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.150
you know, the combination gives the best of both worlds.
And it sort of follows the natural contour of the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.310
foot where the heel is higher and the forefoot's lower

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.420
so it allows you to keep the skate low while still giving that performance

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.490
wheel in the back.
Exactly. Exactly. It's a tribute to the engineers that were able to figure out how to mkae

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.660
that work.
Yep. And then this has the real fitness boot, the K2

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.830
is really known for - that nice, tighter, anatomical fit, right?
Exactly.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.970
It's got that really great padding in here. Really molds to the foot while

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.120
you're skating and, you know, one thing that we didn't touch on on the wheel down here that I'll throw in as well,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.310
you got an ILQ5 Bearing and what that is is we work with a company

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.560
called Twin Cam. They engineered a bearing specifically for inline skating.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.750
It's the only bearing that's really made for inline skating. It's got 6 balls

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.910
instead of 5. The balls are a little bit bigger and bigger balls make for better

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.440
skate.
More balls makes for a better skate too. Any other features we missed

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.580
on this?
No, I think we nailed it. Just, you know, the comfort of the K2 Softboot and the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.700
performance it delivers along with the features we talked about make this an excellent value 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.940
for the new and experienced skaters.
Okay, that was my question. Who is the perfect customer for this skate?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.300
You know, the new skater who wants an aluminum frame is going to want to go straight here and,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.500
you know, a person who's got a lot of experience skating who wants a great maneuverable frame

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.710
will be just as happy.
Somebody's who's bought an inexpensive skate and is now ready to move up to something with

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.830
a little better performance, better fit, better power, better speed.
Exactly.
Okay.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.030
Well, there you have it. There's the F.I.T. X Pro from K2. It's been Mike. I'm Steve

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.070
and thanks for joining us on the Daily Spin.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.120
 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.160
