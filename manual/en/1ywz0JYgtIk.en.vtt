Tweet of the week goes to Jonathan Rail, 'Archive
binging on Cristen Conger's YouTube vids.

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.099
Her initial explanation on why female nipples
are sacred is hilarious'. And I don't exactly

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.760
know what you're referencing but I'll take
it. I would also like to acknowledge something

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.240
a little bit different about this video which
is my Ariana Grande-esque high pone, that's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.350
short for ponytale. I'm not trying to make
any political statements I just want to let

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.660
the pone speak for itself and it says I'm
a little nervous, I'm not sure why I'm here,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.540
wouldn't life be easier with wigs?

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.149
It was a big week here on Stuff Mom Never
Told you, on Monday I kicked off with 'How

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.039
to Eat like a Man?' On Wednesday I finally
talked about 'Why Women Pluck Their Eyebrows'.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.769
On Friday it was 'Seven Stimulating Facts
about the Clitoris' which some of you were

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.929
able to watch when it was accidentally published
a couple weeks ago. Now onto Ask Cristen,

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.069
first of all thanks to everybody who watched
and commented on last week's Ask Cristen video

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:06.500
'How not to compliment a fat girl'. There
were a lot of comments about skinny-shaming

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.810
slash thin-shaming. I made a whole video about
that a while ago and the link is floating

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.479
somewhere around my head. If you want a more
in-depth look at this whole body-shaming thing,

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.180
my podcast co-host Caroline and I did an entire
Stuff Mom Never Told You podcast episode on

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.719
it. Now onto your comments. Elena Murphy said,
'I think it's awesome you used the word "fat".

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.270
I'm sick of people saying "curvy", "plus-sized",
"bigger" or just plain "over weight" in an

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.549
attempt not to offend. Whenever I hear these
words used, to me it seems like an insult

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.840
because in their heads they're saying "fat"
as an insult. No on else uses other words

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.180
to describe someone who wears glasses so why
should we use other words to describe someone

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.920
who's fat? Both are part of ones appearance
but only one is stigmatize.' Elena it's not

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.100
the one that is a-stigmatized. You get it
like a stigmatism? Mikey Surratt said, 'My

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.619
friends always tell me I'm not fat in a way
that makes it clear that if I were fat it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.179
would be some terrible thing. I try to explain
to them that being fat doesn't make me ugly,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.460
lazy, stupid or anything but fat. Yes I'm
overweight, I've got wide hips and big thighs,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.120
I weigh nearly 200 pounds and I am beautiful.
I am also passionate and funny and overly

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.560
optimistic and in love with math. I am so
many things and I refuse to be ashamed of

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.980
any of them'. There is so much Mikey in that
statement to love and that we can probably

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.220
all learn from. Now onto this week's Ask Cristen
question which is along the same theme as

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.239
last week. This is from Quwe William who says,
'I'm a heavyset black male and on a daily

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.659
basis I can count some ahole either saying
"what up big man" or "hey big guy". Fast food

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.940
workers have even commented that I look like
I would be happier with the large size. Am

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.599
I not supposed to feel hurt by these comments
because I have a penis?' Like Quwe there were

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.599
a lot of other guys commenting in last week's
video about how the fat stigma is not something

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.200
exclusive to women and girls. There were a
number of studies that I was looking at in

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.230
preparation for this episode, all of them
were acknowledging that only in recent years,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.620
in say the mid two thousands, say two-thousand
five onward were researchers even starting

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.099
to pay attention to and dig into well, how
does fat stigma affect men not just in the

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.970
sense of statistics but really understanding
how it intersects with our gender constructs,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.760
with masculinity. I do think that there is
a stark difference in how fat stigma is applied

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.280
to men and how it's applied to women. Fat-shaming
directed to men can possibly be a little more

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.189
subtle such as Quwe talking about being called
'big guy'. Celebrity Johan Hill has talked

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.069
about how as he has transitioned his career
from being straight comedy into more serious

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.099
stuff and lost some weight along the way her
got a lot of flack initially from people saying,

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.610
'Uh, you lost weight? You're not as funny
now man, you're not the fat funny guy that

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.439
we used to know and love.' Perhaps because
of masculinity constructs as illustrated by

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.239
Quwe's question of okay so these comments
aren't supposed to hurt me because I have

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:16.119
a penis, that might make it seem more okay
for people to make jokes about big guys and

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.039
fat guys and beer-bellies and man boobs. It's
just another brand of the fat stigma. It all

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:31.599
ultimately roots back to the same problems
of moralizing about weight regardless of health.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.720
One thing that I did not emphasize in last
week's video that does need emphasizing, that

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.880
is empirically validated is fat-shaming, all
you people who want to fat-shame and who want

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.440
to talk about sugary sodas and who want to
talk about how amazing it is that you do yoga

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.100
all the time and how other people should just
do it too already and get off the couch. Fat-shaming

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.660
does not actually inspire people to lose weight.
A lot of studies have found that stigmatizing

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.509
language like that, that kind of outright
criticism of just like pointing at someone

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.430
and calling them a hippo as some people said
that they were called by their families, that

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.120
doesn't cause people to lose weight. That
only reinforces that fat identity in their

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.000
heads and actually, statistically tends to
lead people to stay at the same weight or

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.319
even gain weight. Confronting and uprooting
fat stigma is often misinterpreted as just

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.889
some kind of health free-for-all of everybody
do whatever you want because health is just

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:38.309
a construct. No that's what gender is silly-billies.
It's more about creating a healthier approach

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:45.539
to health and body-image and confidence and
all the ways that we all get along. But now

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:51.250
I've talked enough. Guys what have been your
experiences with fat stigma and other people's

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.330
thoughts on how we can possibly, is it possible,
uproot this kind of stuff. Let me know in

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.849
the comments below and as always ask me your
questions so I can give you a little bit of

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.430
soap-boxing, hopefully some answers and maybe
sometimes a little high ponytail.
