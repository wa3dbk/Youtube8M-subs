00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:08.660
X Rebirth 3.0 has many improvements for more
pirate-like gameplay. Things like sabotage

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.980
, station hacking and even stealing a stations
cargo.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.420
Unsurprisingly, stealing can be very lucrative,
but is dangerous.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.359
The act starts with finding out where your
target stores its most valuable goods. Scan

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:35.230
a station to 100 percent, especially including
those modules with a higher secrecy level.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.090
For those secret areas you will need special
scanner drones, the remotely operated vehicles,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.090
Beholder ROVs. Once you found the valuable
storage, it will often be a module like this

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.789
one here. Check out the storage either on
the map or directly on the event monitor in

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.789
your cockpit to get to the storage menu of
only this part of the station.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.989
Now starts phase two: Hacking this module
and stealing the cargo. Before we do this

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.440
however, we should first take out some of
the security systems of the station.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.440
Land on platforms and search for the different
terminals and security control panels. Terminals

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.030
can be hacked to sabotage a station’s production
or repair functionality permanently or to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.210
get great discounts. To hack a terminal you
need a Temporary local security ID, which

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.930
can be crafted from very rare objects. Since
they belong to the stations own security system,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.760
you can only use them on the same station
you found them.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.760
For our goal of stealing cargo however, we
need to hack the defence control panel and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.780
maybe also the security control panel. They
are a little easier to hack, because you only

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.140
need a security decryption system, crafted
from components sometimes dropped from ships

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.450
or found in space.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.500
Crafting a security decryption system requires
an AGI core from Xenon components and the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.140
only way to get that is through shooting down
lots of Xenon ships.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.790
You can of course greatly increase your chances
to get this rare drop, by flying to Xenon

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.070
installations for example those in Maelstrom.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.810
To find the different security panels you
may have to land on all platforms of your

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.090
target station.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.790
For each system you want to take out, you
need one of these decryption systems and you

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.530
have to get the mini-game right or the item
is lost.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.530
Once you have succeeded, the whole station
loses this system for a short period of time.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.370
So to prepare our robbery, we could first
disable the station’s security. This makes

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.370
the hacking using the Trojan ROV a lot easier.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.210
Back outside at the storage, I now change
into the Trojan ROV and select the HACK action

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.090
on the storage module I want to steal from.
The mission now sends me to different locations

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.520
on the station and I have to play the mini-game
well. Every time I fail with a hack point,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.550
the station can detect my presence and will
send more security vessels to search for me.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.480
Luckily I disabled the whole stations security
beforehand, so I have some minutes without

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.360
any risk.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.990
Once the hack has succeeded, the storage system
fails and many large ware containers are dropped

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.540
into areas near the station.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.540
Before we start picking those up however,
we should ALSO hack the stations defence systems,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.180
because once you tag containers and your capital
ships start moving in to pick them up, the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.700
station WILL notice and retaliate.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.700
So back to the platform, finding the defence
control system and hack this as well.From

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.090
this point on, I have only a few minutes to
pick up as much loot as possible.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.160
Change into cargo collect mode and make sure
you have large freighters with as many cargo

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.600
URVs as possible nearby. The more URVs, the
faster you can collect the loot.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.070
Another important trick to maximize your profit
from stealing goods is to only pick up the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.900
most lucrative containers.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.900
Do not waste time and URVs to pick up things
like energy or food as long as there are containers

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.970
with things like high tech components floating in space.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.700
