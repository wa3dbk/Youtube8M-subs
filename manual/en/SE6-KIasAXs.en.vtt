00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.850
I am really impressed is how Jaguar manages
to stay up there. The found they way to do

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:21.748
it. They can compete with that big German 
automotive machine.

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:32.763
So how do they do it as such a small brand?
It is with 'pleasure'. Not that it isn't fun

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:39.876
to drive a porsche 911, but somehow there
is always that clinical feel of perfection.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:44.352
It is what makes a Porsche a Porsche.
But Englishmen can get away from that. Look

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.496
at the XKR or the XKR-S. Or even a little
in the XJ.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.628
And I can tell you, th same goes for this
F-type. It isn;t the best car in the segment,

00:00:55.902 --> 00:01:00.025
but the enjoyment... You notice that driving
fun was their primary goal. I can enjoy a policy like that.

00:01:24.068 --> 00:01:34.168
So, the F-Type... Isn't it great to look at?

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:37.173
Such a basic design and still very nice. Same
as with the XK.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:44.622
I don't play the tourist board very often,
but I am near Pamplona Navarra Spain, and

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:50.645
it is one of the most beautifull area's I
have ever seen.

00:01:53.202 --> 00:02:01.390
But now, the car. Lovely roadster, a little
more compact than the XK. How to place it?

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:08.066
Jaguar refuses to anwser that question. Of
course the 911 makes a good competitor, but

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:16.258
what about something smaller like a SLK 55
AMG? They could work aswell. It comes wth

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:29.349
3 engines for now, two V6's with 340 and 380
PS, both with supercharger, and a supercharged

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:40.727
V8, than you get 495 PS. Right now we are
driving the V6 S, with 380 PS.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.884
Before we start with the driving, check out
the sound!  With this button you open valves in the exhaust....

00:03:05.932 --> 00:03:09.123
It is not even a nice pitch, but a heavy noise,

00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:13.975
which is almost embarrassing. A little to
much sometimes.. but ....

00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:20.272
that is what makes it so good... but.....
the fun-aspect of it just keeps coming. Such

00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:25.102
a great part of this car.
it has enough power and climbs a little more

00:03:26.427 --> 00:03:32.195
in the rev range than the normal V6, And it
has more than enough speed and power, it is

00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:35.528
not like I feel like that I miss power. I
do not miss that V8 right now.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.022
the interior is more basic than I am used to
from Jaguar, more clean. Some stuff looks

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:09.016
great, but the buttons look a little cheap
compared to a XK or XF.

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:21.516
The drive: this isn't a hardcore sportscar.
It is very sporty to drive, but compared to

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.793
a 911, that is more hard and has less bodyroll.
Here they left some. But by the time you notice,

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:40.518
you have to very fast or be on the track.
On roads like this
it has a very natural balance and the steering

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:48.752
is very nice. Light and direct, not artificial
heavy or so. This is more like it should be.

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:03.875
So does this car make a new standard in this
segment? well no. It doesn't work like this.

00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:08.967
This isn't a better car than the stuff is
out there. I am not saying it is worse either.

00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:17.357
Are their reasons to buy one? Well PLENTY!
The design, how proud you can be, the sound,

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:24.862
the steering, the weight goes towards 1700
kg, but it doesn't matter that the 911 weighs

00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:32.510
less. The way pure FUN reaches you... I am
a little down to earth and people sometimes

00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:39.264
complain that I should look a little more
happy in the video's, but in this car, I don't have to try. It goes by itself..

00:05:44.974 --> 00:05:51.528
+ great design, great sound - still heavy,
expensive.
