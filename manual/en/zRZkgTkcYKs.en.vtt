Hi, this is Josiah Owen with Expert Village.
And today, we're talking about recipes for

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.502
those who are on a diabetic diet. All right,
now what we're going to do is we're going

00:00:07.502 --> 00:00:12.160
to go ahead and throw this bread in the oven.
We don't want to cook it too long. About five

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.800
minutes on 400 would do nicely. If you want
to put this on the top rack, that way it will

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
cook a little faster. Go ahead and singe the
tops, and also make the insides kind of squishy.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.260
So we're going to go ahead and throw these
in the oven. All right, now that we've put

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.289
this in the oven for about five minutes, we
can notice that around the edges, it's slightly

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.040
brown. Not too brown on top -- it's still
soft to the touch. That means that the butter

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.970
has cooked in nicely. And it's going to be
crispy on the outside and squishy in the middle.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.050
Now, hold on, and we'll go on to our next
step. All right, now that our bread has been

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.631
toasted and we have our bruschetta to the
side, now what we have to do is go ahead and

00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:57.170
cut our bread. The way I like to do it is
to take this one edge and cut a triangle.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.880
And actually, you can just eat this piece
or let one of your kids or one of your friends

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:15.490
eat it. It's fine. And cut it at another slight
angle. Just keep going. Make about one-inch

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:26.370
pieces. Remember, you don't want to squeeze
too hard. So you want to be kind of gentle

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:36.740
with this because you don't want them to break.
And depending on how uniform you want this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.490
to look; you can either keep this last piece
or let somebody eat it as well. I want you

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.211
to do the exact same thing to the other pieces,
and then we'll show you how to top them. And

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:52.100
now, we're going to go ahead and talk about
topping our bread. You see that the bread's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.231
already been cut. We've got our topping out
of the refrigerator. It's been there for about

00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:06.270
an hour. So we're going to take one small
scoop and you just want to put it right in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.890
the middle. You don't want it falling off.
You want about 1/8th of an inch to a 1/4 of

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.150
an inch on each side, that way you can pick
it up and it doesn't fall off. Nothing worse

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.480
than picking up a big mound of topping on
a piece of bread and having it fall over your

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.370
hands. Sure, you get extra topping, but still,
it's a bit messy. You go to the next piece,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:38.670
and you just want to put it right in the middle.
Get one more piece of tomato on there. And

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.220
just go all the way down the line.
