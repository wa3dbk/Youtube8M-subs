00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.750
Hi, my name is Heidi Hummel, and I work here in the petting zoo at the Orange County Zoo,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.750
and I work with all the goats.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.890
Here in the petting zoo, we have 12 goats of three different types:

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.810
African pygmy goats, Nigerian dwarf goats and one mini Lamancha goat. A lot of little kids come in. We have brushes,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.299
they can brush and pet the goats, just get some kind of hands-on experience with them.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.100
The goat I've been training right now is Dora.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.879
She is the major escape artist in the group and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.720
whenever the door opens she bolts out the door. At the red barn

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.599
there's food that you can feed the goats and sheep outside of the petting zoo. The ones in here and get crazy around food

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.729
so we don't allow it inside, but all of them know that it's out there at the red barn, so Dora

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.429
bolts and goes straight towards the red barn and eats all the stuff that guests have dropped on the ground

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.470
around the feed machine and around the gate where the other animals eat.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.930
I noticed that she had a lot of energy

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.819
so I thought that maybe if I could take that energy and put it into something else,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.610
maybe she wouldn't try to escape as much during the day, so I started with just hurdles running in the back here,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.950
just letting her get out some of her energy.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.380
And it seemed to work, so I moved it to doing it after we closed as well.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.130
And she seems on most days, she won't try to escape as often. Sometimes, she still gets the urge to go exploring.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.019
 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.959
I started training Dora just using clicker training and a bowl of treats

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.769
and then every time she looked at me and responded to her name,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.719
I'd give a click and give her a treat right away.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.219
We did that for a couple of days just to get her used to the idea, and then

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.239
the more she got used to it the more I can just click and

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.709
decrease the treats and the click is what she wants to hear and verbal praise as well.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.370
Now every time I ask her to do a new behavior, I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.660
can just click after every behavior and decrease the amount of treats, so she'll go five, ten or fifteen

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.299
behaviors before I actually have to give her a treat.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.049
 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.459
 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.629
I'd say my favorite part of working in the petting zoo is

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.809
seeing all the little kids come in. A lot of them

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.089
it's their very first experience hands-on with an animal and some are just terrified and some are

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.470
really excited, so it's cool to see their first reaction to an animal and if they're terrified at the gate

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.029
and I try to convince them to come in and by the end they're hugging the goats, kissing the goats.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.389
It's very

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.918
cool to be able to feel that and know that I got them used to

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:08.469
another animal and they can just have fun and pet the goats and have a good time and then not want to leave.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.979
It's always fun when they cry because they don't want to leave and that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
feels good.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.900
