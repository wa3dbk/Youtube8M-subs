And today, we are going to start with Dark Chocolate Truffles

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:25.595
Yummmy

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:27.413
you probably love chocolate truffles

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:29.716
and you probably find it expensive

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:30.784
I find it expensive 

00:00:30.784 --> 00:00:33.097
and you may think that it is difficult to make

00:00:33.097 --> 00:00:37.873
But today, I am here to show you how 
 to make it in one minute video

00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:39.839
Seriously, this video is only One minute 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.723
and you are going to be a prof in chocolate truffles

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:46.223
If you want to know the details of the ingredients and the recipe

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:48.970
It is look below all the videos, just for understand. 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.877
And are you ready

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:52.071
Let's start!

00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:54.318
Place the heavy cream in a sauce pan

00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:57.839
add the honey, and let them get bubbly on medium heat.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.670
Add ground cardamom or any spice of your choice

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.851
get them to a boiling point

00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:08.129
and take them directly to meet the beautiful dark chocolate and creamy butter!

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:10.599
It will take them 1 minute to settle down

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:13.548
then mix them together until they melt away

00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:15.060
Place in a pan

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.212
let them cool down in the fridge – 
 well deserved after all this heat. 

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:23.385
Use small spoons to scoop this goodiness into small balls 

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:27.462
that you again place in a plate and 
 keep in the fridge for 1 hour

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:34.313
And finally, roll these sweet beauties in either cocoa powder or dried coconut.

00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:36.526
Of course both are unsweetened 

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:38.498
otherwise, we will have a sugar candy 

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.930
instead of yummy elegant creamy chocolate truffles J

00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.620
Now try to bribe a friend – it will work!!!  

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:48.410
Guaranteed J

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:51.980
YUMMMMMMY
