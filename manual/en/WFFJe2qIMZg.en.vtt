Hey guys, it’s your girl Keiko Alingas back
with another video not just for all my Gear

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.370
Addix, but for all my fellow wrestling addicts
as well.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.279
As a lot of you may know, World Wrestling
Entertainment launched their highly anticipated

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.660
WWE Network earlier this week.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.510
But what you may not know, is that I’m a
huuuuge wrestling fan!!!

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.820
I was even fortunate enough to be on hand
with the Gear Addix crew to cover the WWE

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.199
Network Announcement back in January while
we were in Vegas for CES.

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:43.170
Now just a quick recap for those who don’t
know, the WWE Network is essentially a 24/7

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.530
streaming network with all kinds of original
WWE programming that you can access on your

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.750
computer, smartphone, tablet, and numerous
gaming and media devices.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.260
They even have a huuuuge on-demand library
that contains practically every Raw, Smackdown,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.729
Pay Per View, and so on in the company’s
existence.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.760
Without a doubt this is an exciting and revolutionary
concept and is by no means a traditional television

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760
network.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.590
And being that the network does not have an
actual television home, then you’d have

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.340
to use one of several methods to get the full
WWE viewing experience on your big screen.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.299
Let’s face it, it may be fine to watch an
old episode of Raw on your phone while on

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.850
the treadmill, but that’s no way to watch
a live broadcast of Wrestlemania 30 with your

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.850
friends.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.009
With that said, if you’ve seen the ads,
WWE does disclose that there are several devices

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.100
you can use to get the Network on your big
screen, such as newer generations of Roku

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.100
or Apple TV.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.920
If you’re a gamer, however, then you can
simply use one of the gaming consoles that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240
you may already have, such as the Playstations
3 &amp; 4, or Xbox 360 and One.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.060
But if you happen to own none of those devices,
and don’t want to shell out another couple

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.200
hundred bucks, then perhaps your best and
cost efficient bet would be using our favorite

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.040
gadget, the Google Chromecast, which still
runs for a very reasonable $35.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.380
Now despite the fact that the Chromecast has
never been mentioned in any of the network's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.350
public advertisements, we happen to have first
hand knowledge that WWE is a huge proponent

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.350
of this device.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.350
How do we know?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.740
Well, these guys were actually part of the
goodie bags that WWE was gracious enough to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.369
give us during the network announcement.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.420
So thank you WWE for that!

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.870
We’ll just add this to our collection.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.150
If you know nothing about the Chromecast,
we actually have an in-depth two part review

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.310
of this guy that you can watch linked right
after this video.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.190
But for now, I’ve already got the Chromecast
hooked up to this TV, and I’m logged into

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.420
my WWE Network account on my computer.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.700
As you can see, we have a live stream of the
Royal Rumble playing right now.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.500
So in order to get this on my TV, all I have
to do is click this cast button on the top

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.950
right of my browser….

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.950
…. and there you have it.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.050
As you can see, my WWE Network webpage is
now mirrored on my HDTV.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.070
And to get the full screen experience, I just
hit hit the full screen button on the bottom

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.600
of the media player, and there we go.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.210
Definitely the WWE Network as it should be
viewed!!!

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.210
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to
waste another couple of hours catching up

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.640
on my favorite undertaker matches.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.180
So if you dont see any new videos from me
for awhile, you'll know why.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.150
But for more information on the Chromecast,
and the WWE Network be sure to log onto our

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.150
website at GearAddix.com.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:28.220
I’m Keiko Alingas and I’ll catch you guys
next time!!!!
