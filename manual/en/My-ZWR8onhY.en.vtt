00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.390
I feel buried under the lights of this empty city

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.660
Wandering, my eyes more empty than my surroundings.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:12.310
I’m trying to uncover… something I cannot see,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.730
I’m searching for that something, all alone, I cannot see…

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.970
I’ve come this far, all on my own, and yet

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.730
Somewhere in my heart I feel… there’s something deep that I’m lacking.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.720
It’s as if small thorns have pricked my heart

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:06.390
As I’m assaulted by these inexplicable emotions

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.590
It’s almost as if I’ve lost a piece of myself,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.580
Ah, why does this feeling bother me so much?!

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.540
If I am able to find out what is wrong,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.070
Will this feeling go away?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.260
Driven by emotions I have nowhere to place

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.170
I just want to scream, as loud as I can.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.060
But, I don’t even know what it is

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.710
I should scream, and no one could tell me.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.050
The words I cannot find turn to sobs,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.590
Escaping from my trembling lips.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.910
My heart is… unhinged.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.130
…Please someone, tell me why I’m crying…

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:26.160
My heart is in denial of something.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.890
It’s crying, “This ‘reality’, is a lie!”.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.930
What if… What if everything is false?

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:53.230
What if I’m just buried under a twisted form of reality…?

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.470
I’m forgetting something.
What if I’m just buried under a twisted form of reality…?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.300
I’m forgetting something.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.540
I’m missing something.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.540
Remember!!

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.650
What is it!?

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.650
It must have been,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.640
Something important

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.870
It must have been,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.850
Something irreplaceable

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.220
What was it that was so

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.300
Important to me?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.470
…”My”…

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.600
…No! That’s not it!!

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.230
…”Our”…

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.730
How could I have forgotten that name!

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.170
Forgotten how we were separated, why I’m alone!?

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:43.400
I never thought, I never wanted to forget anything!

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.290
The fever rising inside of me,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.990
Turns to anger, and surges out of me.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:01.550
How could you disappear like that, all on your own!? I’ll never forgive you!!

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.970
I’ll chase you! No matter how far I have to go,

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.710
Until once again I can call your name!

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:19.250
Never again will I give up, I’ll swear on my heart!

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.740
So I can stand to face all of the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.450
Illusions standing between you and I,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:36.440
Once more, I’ll raise the curtain with these words, the ones that started everything.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.050
“Hey, Merry!!!”
