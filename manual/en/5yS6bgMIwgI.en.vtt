00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.390
Hi, you can see can’t you, our house is
a little different from the others on the

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:18.730
street, that’s because well we’re a little
bit different. I’m Mark Berry and I’m

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:31.270
deaf just like everybody else in my family,
welcome to our house and welcome to our world.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:40.379
This is our mum, she’s tidying up after
us all again.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.530
I’m Carolyn, my sign name is this because
I have rosey cheeks.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.850
In deaf culture most people have a special
sign that refers to an aspect of their personality.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.850
My name means “big smile”. Here’s my
sister, she’s texting as usual.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:16.830
I don’t always text! I’m Kylie, I’m
18. I was flatting before, now I’ve moved

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.090
back here, I’m saving money and then I’ll
go to Auckland.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.960
Her sign name refers to the way she used to
suck her fingers when she was little.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:43.140
If you’re inside wondering where my dad
is he’ll definitely be outside for a bit

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.280
of quiet time with his love birds. Dad…

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.240
Hi my name is Peter, my nick name or sign
name is Popeye and that’s because when I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:08.060
was younger and used to ask questions and
my eyes used to pop out of my head. My hobby

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.480
is the love birds, I like to breed them and
I’ve been doing that for just over ten years

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.450
now. I’m interested in crossing the colours.
It’s a good time out if the kids have been

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.090
arguing I come out and have a break.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.120
Now I’m going to introduce you to my younger
sister Rachel. She really loves music (more

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.270
than the rest of us) and the reason for that
is her hearing is much better than the rest

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.150
of the family and she can hear more.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.769
Hi my name’s Rachel, my sign name is Rachel
because when I was little I used to have curly

00:02:48.769 --> 00:03:00.550
hair and I have more hearing. This is my family
member Honey who is also our family dog.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.260
The older three children went to Van Ash School
for the Deaf but Mark wants to find his place

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.260
in the hearing world.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:15.590
I am a deaf person, I’ve had that upbringing
of being in deaf culture so I have to learn

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.870
the majority culture which is hearing society.
If I make mistakes along the way that’s

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.470
fine, it’s never too late to learn.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.409
Rachel went to Avonside Girls High.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.550
Sometimes when I’m in the hearing world
I feel like signing and when I have to do

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.129
a speech at school I have to talk, sometimes
I don’t feel comfortable but in the deaf

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.590
world I can do both. Deaf people are impressed
“wow you can speak”.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.799
What feels really different is deaf people
are really straight up and will say if they

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.849
don’t like you so you know where you stand
but with hearing people I’m sometimes not

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.000
sure, have they understood me? If deaf people
are talking to one another if you’re uncertain

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.010
you’d say “what are you talking about?”.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:15.680
Personally I think deaf people are more fun
 – no offence!

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.600
Rachel acts as an interpreter for her family.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:26.670
They can’t say which one they want so they
ask me to come along to speak to them and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.310
tell them what they want and it’s a lot
easier for them.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.160
In six out of ten cases deafness is genetic.
Carolyn and Peter were both born to hearing

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.350
parents so weren’t sure if their children
would be deaf.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.060
No it didn’t matter at all. Our aim was
to have healthy children – deaf, hearing,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:57.130
disabled – we were going to accept them.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.650
This is Bunnings where I’m working to save
for uni next year. I enjoy working here, it’s

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.970
helped me gain confidence, learning how to
lip read. I’m independent making friends

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.070
my own age… I like it, it’s good fun.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:25.190
Staff here made Mark feel welcome. His boss
has even learnt basic sign language.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.190
Hi Mark

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.510
Hi how are you?

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.810
I’m good thanks.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.820
I’m just wondering what you want me to do.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:40.630
OK great work. Can you please go and get a
wave and bring it here and pull down all the

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.610
product to fill up the shelves.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.090
The biggest effort has been made by Mark because
it must have been pretty scary for him to

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.560
come and work with a whole lot of hearing
people. We did a night where we all wore ear

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.880
plugs for an evening just to try and get an
idea of what it was like to be deaf and I

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:06.180
found that the biggest challenge that I faced
being deaf for that night was to not know

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.150
if people were talking to me or to feel that
I was left out so after experiencing that

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.960
we’ve made a very concerted effort to make
sure that he’s included in everything.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.470
The only hurdle that I can see is people’s
attitude. He has a fabulous attitude when

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.900
he’s working and wanting to communicate
and wanting to help people, it’s just the

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.800
hearing people and how much patience do they
have.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.270
When I meet a customer that doesn’t want
to use pen and paper to communicate I fine

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:49.700
that disappointing because I know that I can
help but their attitude stops that. They think

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.990
I can’t help and ask another staff member
for assistance instead.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.050
How much do you need?

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.500
Probably only 2 litres.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:05.710
Mark spent a year in America, he went to high
school there and says people were supportive.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.080
While I was in America I learnt that hearing
people in the US have a more advanced attitude

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.670
and this was through years of lobbying by
deaf people. Deaf people aren’t stupid.
