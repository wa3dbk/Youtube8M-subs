hi guys! as you can tell

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.769
obviously by the title is that

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.849
this video will be showing you how to go from

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.300
dark hair to red hair

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.060
and obviously um... I'm not the one that went red

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.699
it's actually one of my younger cousins

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.250
who let me dye her hair red

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.339
um all the materials and pricing

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.670
and where I got them from will be listed in the bottom description box so make sure to look

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.530
there

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.330
if you still have some questions or concerns or whatever um

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.220
make sure to leave a comment to let me know and I will try to respond as soon as possible

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.220
other than that enjoy!

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.469
ok guys as you can see here

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.980
I had already

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.790
divided her hair in 4 sections, It just really helps making sure

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.719
you get all her hair throughout the head evenly

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:30.949
but anyways start applying the dye from the tips all the way up to the roots

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:37.949
um you'll keep repeating this process throughout her whole head

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.620
here what you see is I had already

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.189
finished adding the red hair dye to all 4 sections

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.389
all I'm doing is making sure the hair line is all 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.749
touched up and even 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.199
after you are done with that just

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.859
wrap up your hair and clip it up

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.219
and if you have a plastic cap that will work

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.239
perfectly

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.559
but if you don't

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:19.289
don't worry a plastic bag will work just as fine

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.440
so what you do with the plastic bag

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.309
is just wrap it around your head

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.149
and tie it up

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:29.359
and what this does is help create heat

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.549
which helps the dying process

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.699
go a little bit better
