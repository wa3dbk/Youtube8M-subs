Welcome to the Gracie and Mommy Show. The
most professional channel on YouTube. Oh that's

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.820
right. We are, we are.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.720
So, today is Saturday. Mmm, hi sweetie. I love you so much. Well, not the day we're recording this.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.539
-- But the day you're watching
this is Saturday. Of course, we got this a

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.119
little bit earlier. So if you remember last
week - hello Dolla, hello. If you remember

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:35.659
last Saturday, we were able to show you Fun2draw's
Spats drawing, which was amazing, so let's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.520
take a look at that again - through the magic
of YouTube. Fun2draw, Spats. And here's Dolla,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:52.200
being crazy. And uh, and we told you that
Mei Yu from Fun2draw was working on a beautiful

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:01.320
piece of artwork for our second kitty. The
very illusive -- She's like a shiny Pokemon

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.689
-- Yeah, she is. The very illusive, but very
- I'm sorry, I'm reaching across to get my

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.420
iPad so we can look at the picture - the very
illusive, yet very beautiful, and very - pshhh

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.899
- Ah, she's like a motorboat. So Mei Yu had
a big challenge for Fun2draw a famous YouTuber's

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.200
cat this week, because it's hard to even get
pictures of Merida. I take a lot of pictures

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.119
of her. Gracie takes a lot of pictures of
her, so we were able to use some of those.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.950
It's hard to get her on video, but I know
that Mei Yu said that she went and looked

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.999
at video footage and pictures that we sent
her, but so she did use this one reference

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:46.310
picture, so here's the picture that she used
primarily for her reference. Oh, so we have

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.359
this kind of a theory, because she has - in
addition to having very unusual markings,

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.880
which is why I say that Fun2draw has a very
hard time -- And probably having her own like

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.529
little apartment under Mommy -- Well that's
another story. She has a bunch of different

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:07.779
personality traits that kind of relate back
to a bunch of different cats that I have owned

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:14.979
over the years who have passed over the rainbow
bridge into Heaven, and so one of our working

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.510
theories is that Merri is a multiple reincarnation
of several of my past cats. Okay. Okay, so

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.989
let's unveil - are you ready, cause it's adorable
- the art -- Oh, Spats is your wallpaper.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.989
Spats is my wallpaper. -- Of, that Mei Yu
from Fun2draw did, of Merri.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:46.379
Oh my gosh. Now, you will notice, that Merri
is many many different colors and many different

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:53.479
kinds of cat. Apparently Gracie has the hiccups.
Do you have the hiccups? Yeah, okay. Um, what's

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.239
your favorite part about this picture? I like
how she's kind of just like -- She's just

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.539
in a cute little... she's in a cute little
pose. I actually love that she's sort of sitting

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.549
on something sort of plushie, comfy, because
that's a very Merida thing to do. Of course

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.760
I love the bow, I love the little touches
with the accessories Fun2draw does, but I

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:30.000
can't get over how well she got the coloring,
because Merida is so - she's a tuxedo cat,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
she's a tabby cat, and she's a calico cat.
All rolled up into one. And we've kind of

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.319
gotten used to it, but I know when people
see her for the first time, they're like - oh

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.599
my God, she has the most unusual markings,
she's so beautiful. And I realize that that's

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.209
kind of, you know, when we first met her it
was surprising. I've never seen - I've seen

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.489
a mixture of a tuxedo and a tabby before,
but I've never seen calico thrown in. And

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.040
that was a real challenge for Mei Yu, because
part of Merri's face is calico cat, and part

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.590
of her body is too, and I think she did an
amazing job. An amazing, amazing job, um,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.190
just capturing the unique coloring of Merri's
face. And if you guys want to see how Fun2draw

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.610
brought Merri to life, head on over to her
channel, YouTube.com/Fun2draw, and of course

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.560
we will link it here, in the description,
in the end card at the end of the video, and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.470
you can see how Mei Yu from Fun2draw drew
Merri, and uh, I think it was really cool.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.449
I loved watching last week how she drew Spats.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:48.539
I want to thank Fun2draw for coming to us
and asking us, you know, if we wanted to do

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:54.069
this collaboration, because um, Gracie knew
of her channel but I had never seen her channel

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.410
before, so a) I've got a new channel to check
out that does adorable art work, and b) I

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.699
have two pieces of absolutely amazing, professional
art work. You should frame them. I am, I'm

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.060
gonna print them out on really really nice
paper, and frame them and hang them up behind

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.069
me over here, because that's how much I love
the art work. So thank you so much Fun2draw

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:21.400
guys, you gotta go check her out and subscribe.

older than me -- Or if you're older like you

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.620

learn how to draw more advanced things, you

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.740
