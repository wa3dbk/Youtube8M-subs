00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:02.996
A typical American
college campus,

00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:06.976
Salt Lake Community College,
in the great state of Utah.

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.646
It's a beautiful, crisp
autumn day for the beginning

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:13.446
of fall semester and
the students are excited

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.696
for the new challenges

00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:18.986
and opportunities the new school
year will bring; new subjects,

00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:23.126
new instructors, and
new close friends.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.856
Betty and Bill are two
such students at SLCC.

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:31.036
As freshman they
share an Introduction

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:34.606
to Geology class together
taught by Professor Dastrup.

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:38.746
There is much to discuss
during this first day of class

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.146
and Professor Dastrup has
some wonderful new ideas

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:43.526
in his approach to the subject.

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:48.236
All students entering Salt Lake
Community College have a number

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:51.906
of general education
or gen ed requirements

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:55.306
that must be completed in
order for them to graduate

00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:59.356
with an AA, AS, or AAS degree.

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:04.616
Gen ed touches all programs
at SLCC in one way or another.

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:09.476
Professor Dastrup is
presenting the general education

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:13.976
requirements, known by the
innocent name of ePortofolio.

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:24.826
[ Explosions ]

00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:29.176
But this needn't be your
experience when it comes

00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:32.566
to e portfolios, not if
you're willing to look

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.216
at your ePortfolio as much more

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:37.166
than a mere requirement
for a grade.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:41.686
Let's re-join Betty and Bill
in Professor Dastrup's class.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:45.706
Yes, the ePortfolio
requirement is still the same

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:48.106
but this time the
students understand

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:51.586
that ePortfolios are an
amazing learning, reflecting,

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:54.246
communication and
self-marketing space.

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.826
Eportfoliios will help them
transform their learning,

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:01.476
making meaning from diverse
learning experiences,

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:04.036
of connecting and
integrating their learning

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:05.876
from across disciplines
and time.

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:10.936
EPortfoliios can also be used
as a self-marketing space

00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:14.466
that will help students
showcase their college studies.

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:18.916
This might be helpful for
scholarships and grants as well.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:22.046
There's no need to duck and
cover when an instructor talks

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:23.876
about an ePortfolio assignment.

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:28.206
An ePortfolio opens the
window to one's past, present,

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:32.036
and future by inviting students
to reflect on and connect

00:02:32.116 --> 00:02:34.836
to their myriad college
learning experiences.

00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.896
Then they can say look world,

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:42.436
here I am in their own
unique, personal way.

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:45.546
SLCC's ePortfolio
program is unique

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:48.596
in that the college doesn't
provide you with an already set

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:53.246
up ePortfolio, you create
your ePortfolio using web 2.0

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:58.176
platforms like Jimdo, Wix,
WordPress, and Google sites.

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:00.826
You can hide these
form search engines

00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:03.226
and make them available
to your professors.

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:08.686
As long as you follow the SLCC
ePortfolio outline you can make

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:10.386
it look the way you
want it to look.

00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:13.566
In fact, the more
personality you put

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:17.816
into your ePortfolio the
more you will get out of it.

00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:21.516
SLCC's ePortfolio is designed
to help you get the most

00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:22.986
out of general education.

00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:27.336
Too many students see gen
ed as a series of hoops

00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:30.206
or unrelated courses
that they have to jump

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:32.136
through to move on
to other things.

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:33.556
Don't think that.

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:38.646
Use the ePortfolio to help you
see how your gen ed courses are

00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:40.996
connected and to
build a foundation

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:44.456
for your future learning
and life's experiences.

00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:49.466
Innovative instructors such as
Professor Dastrup are critical

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:52.126
to successful ePortfolio
experiences.

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:56.356
The last thing a student needs
in preparing for life-long

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:59.236
and life-wide learning
is an instructor

00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:00.706
who hasn't caught the vision

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.986
of what an ePortfolio
can accomplish.

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:05.736
Isn't that right
Professor Dastrup?

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:10.966
So remember, when you hear
the word ePortfolio don't duck

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:15.136
and cover, instead reflect
and connect, be brave.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:17.696
Show people what you're made of.

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:18.966
Take pride in knowing

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:22.906
that you're securing your
future today as a student eager

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:26.626
to learn and grow and tomorrow
as a citizen of the world,

00:04:26.946 --> 00:04:29.146
contributing to an
educated workforce

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.926
and strengthening
the human race!
