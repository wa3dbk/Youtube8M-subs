00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.779
When we first started shipping the machine, it was hard to imagine we'd really have a factor in making

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.540
the best quality desktop stereolithography machines and shipping them all over the world.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.420
Everybody who goes through this experience of bringing

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.200
a totally new product to market comes away with some of the same realizations

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.000
that any extra part or process is a source for an issue.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.660
There are over 150 parts in the Form 1+ coming from dozens of suppliers all around the world.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.280
It only takes one missing part to prevent you from making a machine.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.700
We began with the mechanical assembly process.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.480
Here we take each of the component parts and bolt them, glue them, and fasten them together to build an entire printer.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.440
Once it's sealed up, it starts going through a number of testing and calibration steps

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.300
in order to verify that the printer is really printing up to our standards and really high quality before it ships to the customer.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.460
We wanted the Form 1+ to work out of the box. We didn't want our users to have to set any parameters

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.400
or do anything specific to get their machine running.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.180
A lot of what's really impressive about the manufacturing of the Form 1+ isn't really visible in the machine itself.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.100
It consists of tools and processes and software that are used to calibrate and test the machine in the factory.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.640
We put a huge amount of effort into fit and finish of our machine. They're really made by hand to a large degree.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.420
It's been really amazing to get up the point where we can make these highly tested and calibrated

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.500
precision machines come off the line one after another.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.560
The most exciting thing for me is take what we've learned building the Form 1+ and use that to push the future of 3D printing.
