00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.929
Feral hogs are an exotic, invasive species that have many negative impacts to humans

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:13.809
and the environment.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.130
Land managers have a variety of tools
available for managing feral hogs.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.990
Box traps are a tool that land managers
can use to reduce feral hog populations

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.949
on their property.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.880
In this video, we will discuss structural
modifications that can be made to

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.000
to improve the effectiveness of box traps. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.700
Box traps offer several
great features that make them useful in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.160
feral hog management. They are easily moved
and operated by one individual

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.530
and could be placed virtually anywhere.
The traditional box trap is typically

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.430
four feet wide by 8 feet long

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.480
with the 24 to 36 inch entrance. The
dimensions of this traditional design

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.100
limit its trapping potential since only a few
hogs can enter the trap before it is triggered. 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.280
The enclosed nature of the trap also
presents a hazard to non-target species

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.329
such as deer

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.650
which can be injured while attempting to
escape. Research suggests that corral

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.040
traps are more efficient in capturing
feral hogs the box traps.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.830
However, some situations and
environmental conditions preclude the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.080
use of corral traps,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.490
making box traps a viable alternative.
Several modifications can be made to box

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.020
traps to improve their effectiveness and
safety.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.740
These include increasing the size of
the trap, using fencing panels with four

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.420
inch by 4 inch squares,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.970
increasing the size of the entrance
door, removing the floor from the trap,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.009
removing a section of the roof, adding an inward opening

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.000
rear-loading door, and adding a locking mechanism to the doors. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.930
Box traps are often built
using a variety of fencing panels.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.079
Using fence panels with four inch by 4
inch squares throughout

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.729
will ensure that all hogs captured will
remain in the trap.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.640
A piglet that escapes today can be
reproductively capable

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.350
at six to 10 months of age, so it's
important to ensure that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.360
hogs are not able to escape through the trap's
panels.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.280
Increasing the size of the trap allows
for more of an effective trapping area

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.060
by increasing the distance between the
entrance and the trigger mechanism.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.270
A larger travel also allow for the
addition a further modifications

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.030
that will increase its effectiveness.
Adult feral hogs can be reluctant to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.430
enter smaller or confined entry points.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.000
Expanding the entrance area of a box
trap from the traditional 24 to 36 inches

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.330
to 48 or 60 inches will allow hogs of all sizes to easily enter the trap. 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.800
Removing the floor from the trap gives
it a more natural look and feel to the hogs. 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.750
The installation a rooter bars spaced six
inches from the side

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.470
and running the link to the trap prevent
a heart from escaping by digging out 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.000
from beneath the trap. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.170
Removing a section of the roof
from the center of the trap

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.450
can allow non-target species such as
deer to escape. Panels that cover the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.019
corners

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.010
and extend from each into the trap
prevent the hogs from jumping out.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.459
Adding an inward opening

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.580
rear loading door allows you to safely
load the hogs onto a trailer for

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.970
live-cell or to allow for non-target species to
safely escape

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.150
The rear door opening should be slightly
elevated

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.310
which will allow it to function in the
event of debris or mud build up along the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.250
edges at the trap.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.500
In Texas, both male and female feral hogs
can be sold to approved holding facilities.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.430
Additionally, males can be sold to
authorized hunting preserves.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.379
Both holding facilities and hunting
preserves are inspected and regulated by

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.230
the Texas Animal Health Commission.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.500
Once inside the trap, feral hogs will
typically put the most pressure on the entrance.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.840
Continuous catch gates offer the
potential for trapped hogs to escape.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.870
Adding a locking mechanism to your trap's doors will prevent

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.330
unintentional escapes. In this video, we
have suggested some modifications to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.459
improve the effectiveness and safety a
box traps.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.459
Trapping hogs is a process, not an
event.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.250
It's important to understand each step
in the trapping process.
