00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.650
In this clip we will be talking about the
time signatures that are less common. They

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:14.059
will include 5/4, 9/8, and 12/8. So the first
5/4 is a time signature that can be divided

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:25.880
up into either 2 3 or 3 2, and it refers to
whether it's 2 3 or 3 2 depends on the piece

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:34.991
and the music and the feeling of the music
will define whether or not it's a 2 3 or a

00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:40.370
3 2, and this can come up with a couple of
different time signatures, and it will say

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:50.020
a little 3 2 above the time signature. So,
the 5/4 and a 2 3 pattern would be down, left,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:59.840
right, right, up, down, left, right, right,
up. And then, a 3 2 would be down, left, left,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.450
right, up, left, left, right, up. So, that's
usually how you'll do it, and it will say

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.180
it in the score above the time signature if
it's a 2 3 or 3 2. The next is 9/8, and that

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:23.450
is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine; one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:34.900
six, seven, eight, nine; and it's pretty straightforward.
12/8 is kind of like 9/8 it's just three extra

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:44.520
beats, so it's one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve;

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.979
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven, twelve. So you'll go down,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:01.759
right, right, left, left, left, right, right,
right, right, up, up, up. And, in books and

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.509
stuff if you look up conducting in books,
the patterns will be described exactly like

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:16.220
that, so it exactly creates arches, and then
to the right, and then up. And it makes a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.820
little more sense when you see it in a book.
