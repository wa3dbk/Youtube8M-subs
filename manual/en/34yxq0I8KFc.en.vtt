Hi! This is Jenny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village, and today we're

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.990
going to do one my favorite things about Halloween.
We're going to roast pumpkin seeds. Yum-yum.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.160
Now, we've come to the ooey-gooey part of
roasting pumpkin seeds; getting them out of

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
the pumpkin. If you're going to go right from
the pumpkin to the oven, now would be a good

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.449
time to preheat your oven to 250 degrees.
Well of course, the first step is to get the

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.499
pumpkin open. You need your heavy duty knife
for that, and do this very carefully. I like

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:38.600
to put it down in the sink so that it's a
little bit lower. Cut around your top and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.910
remove the lid. Usually there are seeds clinging
to the lid caught in the fibers. You just

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.829
want to pull those off and put them your bowl
of water that's in your sink. Then you're

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:01.870
either going to reach in with your hands and
pull the seeds out or you're going to use

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:11.070
a good stainless steel spoon and scrape them
out. Depending on whether or not you mind

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.180
ooey-gooeyness, you can use the spoon or your
fingers. I find that my fingers actually work

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.350
pretty well because they get down in there
and kind of go through the fibers and get

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.910
those seeds. You want to get as many of those
seeds out as you can pulling them through

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.220
the fibers either with your spoon or your
fingers until you've really cleaned out your

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.790
pumpkin. You really don't want to have any
seeds left because of course, you want to

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.860
roast every single one of these toasty, tasty
treats. Once you've cleaned out your pumpkin

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.730
thoroughly and there are no seeds left and
you have them in the bowl of water, now's

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.780
the time to get rid of the rest of those strings.
Sometimes you can pull up a clump of strings

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.170
and bring them right out, and sometimes they're
still attached to the pumpkin and you need

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.400
to separate them. Once you have all your extra
strings out, you just put your hand in the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.110
water and rub the seeds with both hands. You're
pretty much going to get all the rest of the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.950
strings away from the seeds. They don't really
matter it's just good pumpkin, but they look

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.370
better when you roast them without strings
hanging to them. The last step in preparing

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.569
your seeds for roasting is to put them in
a colander and rinse any of those remaining

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:52.409
strings off of the seeds. Sometimes warm water
seems to help. Squish it around. Usually by

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.489
this time, all the rest of the remaining string
will separate from the seeds and you will

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.810
very easily be able to put them out and lay
them on a towel. Now, I have nice clean seeds

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.922
that are ready for roasting. I can always
pull those last few bit of strings off before

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:04.819
I go to the next step. That's how to get your
seeds.
