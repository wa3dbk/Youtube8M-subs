00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.080
First, you must spread a thick layer of peanut
butter onto the white part of a slice of bread.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.651
You can only spread the peanut butter on the
white part, and the white part only.

00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:12.340
You may only spread peanut butter on one side.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.810
Spreading peanut butter on both sides will
provide an inferior sandwich.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.480
Next, you must spread a thick layer of jelly
onto the white part of a slice of bread.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.950
You can only spread the jelly on the white
part, and the white part only.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.900
You may only spread jelly on one side.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.030
Spreading jelly on both sides will provide
an inferior sandwich.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.230
You cannot spread jelly onto the same slice
of bread onto which you have spread peanut

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.230
butter.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.829
Also, you cannot spread peanut butter or jelly
onto more than one slice of bread, as this

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.030
will provide an undesired excess of either
ingredient.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.319
Additionally, only peanut butter and jelly
can be spread onto these slices of bread;

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:50.679
no other ingredient will suffice, and no substitute
can be used in a sandwich that is to be legitimately

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.760
recognized as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.410
Likewise, only bread may be the substance
upon which the peanut butter and jelly are

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.530
spread, as anything else does not fit the
standards of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich;

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.740
if the peanut butter and jelly are spread
onto a culinary medium that isn't bread, the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.030
meal at hand simply is not a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.460
Once you have accomplished spreading a thin
layer of peanut butter onto the white of one

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.950
side of one slice of bread, and likewise has
been accomplished using grape jelly on a separate

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.680
slice of bread, you must match the slices
of bread up to each other, forming a peanut

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.420
butter and jelly sandwich.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.260
In this scenario, the peanut butter-covered
face of bread must be facing the jelly-covered

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.530
face of the second slice of bread so that
the peanut butter surface touched the surface

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.740
of the jelly.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.090
The surface of the peanut butter is not allowed
to touch a jelly-less substance of bread,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.799
resulting in the jelly facing outwards, and
likewise applies to the jelly.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.670
If a substance is found facing on the outside
of the sandwich, the product will not be accepted

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.740
as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.619
The side with peanut butter and the side with
jelly on it must match up and stick together

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.610
to form one solid sandwich.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.710
When the eater picks up the sandwich, he or
she must hold both pieces of bread at the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.950
same time, or else one slice will fall off,
and eating only one slice of bread will not

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.880
be recognized as the same or even similar
to eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.500
Next, you must take a bite of the sandwich.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.680
This action will consist of moving the sandwich
within such a close proximity of your face

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.220
that a small "bite" of the sandwich will enter
your mouth for you to mash up with your teeth.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.130
This bite must be a bite that includes both
slices of bread, peanut butter and jelly.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.740
Make sure that all obstructions are clear
from the mouth and esophagus, not including

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.120
peanut butter, jelly or bread or any combination
of said ingredients.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.970
If you have followed all previous steps, this
goal will be easily accomplished.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.120
Not doing so will create an incorrect and
inferior dining experience and thus will not

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.450
be a peanut and butter sandwich that is being
eaten.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.950
However, if one successfully gets both peanut
butter and jelly in one bite that fits in

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.210
the mouth and does not result in choking,
the dining experience is thus far acceptable.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.580
For your complete experience with a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich to be considered

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.080
complete and unobjectionable, you must perform
the previously mentioned series of taking

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.730
bites of the sandwich, chewing them, and swallowing
them repeatedly until the entire sandwich

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.410
has been removed visible existence.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.480
These circumstances may only be reached by
eating the entire sandwich, and no parts of

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.100
the sandwich may be thrown away or given to
somebody else.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.460
This is your sandwich, and your responsibility.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.880
For the Dining experience to be completed,
the sandwich must be completely digested.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.350
In the context of completing the process of
consuming a legitimate peanut butter and jelly

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.840
sandwich, there are no extenuating circumstances.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.190
Actions such as vomiting, surgical removal
of the sandwich from the body, or placement

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.020
of the sandwich inside the lungs opposed to
the esophagus will not be taken into account,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.230
as they do not result in the complete digestion
of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.750
The process must come to a close via rectal
excrement of feces that have been provided

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.710
by the digestion of the peanut butter and
jelly sandwich.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.450
Once the peanut butter and jelly sandwich-fueled
feces have exited the rectum, they must remain

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.270
free from the rectum to be considered conclusive
in the process of physically processing a

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.880
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:17.549
If the feces re-enters the rectum, the process
will be rendered a failure, and must be started

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.949
again.
