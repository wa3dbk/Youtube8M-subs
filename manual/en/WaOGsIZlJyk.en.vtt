00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.066
- By now you probably know
how much I love

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.400
scaring my producer, Andy.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.366
The only person who's easier
to scare than Andy

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.933
is his assistant, Jaclyn.

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.200
So for Halloween, we sent them
both to a haunted house,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.533
together.
Enjoy.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:18.000
- Hello. We're at Universal
Studios Hollywood

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300
at their Halloween
Horror Nights.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.900
This is Jaclyn, my assistant.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.666
Tonight,
I will be assisting her

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.100
as we go through some sort
of Dracula maze.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.266
And this is all happening
for Ellen's

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.700
twisted personal amusement.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.500
And I hope
this makes her happy,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.700
somewhat.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.800
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.166
- We got this.
We got this.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.466
Just listen to me.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.466
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.500
- We're good.
- Yeah.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.200
- And you see, right?
Ahh! (bleep)

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.600
- Oh, my God.
- It didn't even start.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.466
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.466
- So that's--got it.
- Okay. It's okay.

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:57.233
- Okay, we got it.
Oh, God.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.666
That's loud!
Are you kidding me?

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.200
- No!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.700
- I can't hear.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.400
Okay, that's not scary.
See? Not scary.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.366
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm--Ahh!

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.833
- We got it.
We're good. We're good.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.800
- Ahh!

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.366
- Good, we're good.
I got ya. We're good.

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:24.433
I have you.
I'm here.

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:25.933
- We're good.

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.200
I don't see anything.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.666
I don't see anything.

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.466
- Ahh!
- Ahh! Stop it!

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.266
- Ahh!
- Stop it!

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.266
- Stop, stop, stop.
- [bleep] damn it.

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:46.200
- Stop, stop.
- We know.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.000
No. Ahh!
Stop! Stop it! God!

00:01:58.833 --> 00:01:59.833
- Okay.
- All right.

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.200
Is this a lot longer?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.666
Or is this almost done?

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:08.666
- Ahh!
- Whoa!

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:11.933
- [bleep]

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:14.133
- We're good. We're good.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.766
We are good.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.533
- Ahh!
- Okay, okay.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:23.500
- We got it, we got it.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.700
That's what they did--stop.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.633
Got it.
We got it.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:36.933
Okay, I see--
Where?

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:39.066
Do we go that way?

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:41.700
I feel like it should be
the end soon.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.833
Soon.

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.333
Nothing?
Nobody?

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:47.700
This is clear.
This is--Ahh!

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.366
And those aren't real.
Not real.

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:54.400
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.933
Okay, okay, Ahh!

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:17.366
Ahh!

00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:27.500
- We see all of it.
We're good.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.633
I got you.
Just stay--stay.

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.166
- Ahh!

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:43.433
- Stay. Stay.
- We got it.

00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:48.066
- We're good.

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:49.366
We're good.

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:51.500
Drapes, curtains,
nothing.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.633
Nothing.
Wall, wall, I see you.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.700
- Yeah, no.
We're okay.

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:02.466
- I got you.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:05.000
Stop it.
I got you.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.200
Oh, my God.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.533
Definitely not scary
at all.

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:11.133
No, I wasn't scared either.

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:14.333
- We had so much fun.
- Yeah, it was really--Ahh!

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:19.366
- Right? We got it.
Wonderful. Good night.
