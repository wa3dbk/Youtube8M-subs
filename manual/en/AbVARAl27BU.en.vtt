00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.680
Working with Pressure-Sensitive Laminates

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.680
Typically laminating is the most overlooked
step in the graphic production process.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.580
When done properly, you can get a beautiful
print with long lasting durability, but when

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.999
done incorrectly, it can lead to application
failures.

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.210
There are many different types of laminators
available.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.250
Some of the most sophisticated laminators
will have much larger rollers which helps

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.800
avoid wrinkles.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.660
They will also have room for multiple options, such as slitters, heat- assist, and multiple take-ups.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.400
In this video we will be demonstrating proper
laminating techniques for pressure-sensitive

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.330
laminates, on a base level model without heat-assist,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:58.050
something commonly found in many sign shops.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.240
A mistake at the laminating stage can lead
to visual defects or application failures

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.320
and typically means reprinting, reworking
and completely redoing the job.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.960
That means it costs you money.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.251
First and foremost – make sure that your
working environment is clean, and that you

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.780
have properly cleaned your rollers.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.070
This is usually done with a tack cloth.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.870
Avoid using any types of cloths that contain alcohol.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.720
Over time this may dry your rollers out and
eventually crack the rubber coating.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.700
The keys to a successful lamination are alignment
and heat management.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.490
The critical first step is to get the print
properly aligned with your laminate, so that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.810
everything feeds straight.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.760
Pressure sensitive laminates are designed
for cold application, so heat is not necessary

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.010
during lamination.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.479
However, many users like to use just enough
heat to minimize silvering, which is a normal

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.869
occurrence that usually disappears within
24 hours.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.140
If you do use heat, maintain a temperature
between 100°F – 120°F.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.920
As the print feeds through, maintain a proper
amount of tension to keep the laminate from

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.820
wrinkling on the roller.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.280
Too much heat, combined with too much tension,
can cause overstretching.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.560
You can see here how the laminate is no longer
lined up with the print.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.200
This is known as "hour glassing," and is the
most common error seen when laminating.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.920
To avoid this and to ensure a smooth application,
feed continuously and steadily until the entire

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.400
piece is laminated.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.200
If you follow these steps, it will lead to
a great looking finish and a successful application.
