Kelly McCullen: With the economy the way it
is, some people who need a new vehicle consider

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:25.550
car auctions as a place to find good deals.
Greenville's U-S-L Auto Auction sells vehicles

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.939
every Wednesday night to licensed dealers
AND the general public. If you've got the

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.020
deposit, you've got a ticket inside. Will
Guttu/GM, Auction \'96 There's a five hundred

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.500
dollar cash deposit that goes towards your
purchase price. There's also a once a year,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.600
$30 membership fee. Kelly Mc: The weekly auction
brings out all types of people with one thing

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.250
in common. They want a used car and they want
it cheap. Steve Brumfield \'96 It's all walks

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.730
of life. All socio-economic levels, all education
levels. I mean, everybody. There's no demographic

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.670
line you can draw amongst a bidder here. I
see every walk of life, every person. Kelly

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.850
Mc: There are dealers who come every Wednesday
and ordinary people who only come when they

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.850
see a vehicle they hope to buy. The auctioneers
are full-speed sellers but know when to slow

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.680
down the cadance. Liddy Brown/Auctioneer \'96
With our individuals, we want to be a little

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.710
slower, a little bit clearer so they can understand
us as auctioneers. Your dealers are participating

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.820
at the sales every week, where the individuals
might just come tonight and might not come

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.450
for another month or two. Kelly Mc: We're
focusing on the U-S-L Auto Auction because

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.750
it allows the general public to compete with
dealers. Most dealer car auctions ONLY serve

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.180
licensed auto dealers. The U-S-L team works
all week accepting vehicles. [Natural Sounds....Car

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.500
Registration] Kelly Mc: The auction team signs
in the cars, assigns them numbers and lines

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.280
them up. Steve Brumfield \'96 Cars are checked
in all week. The public can come at 4:30pm

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.729
and they're pretty much set up. They peruse
the cars at their leisure, crank them up,

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.120
make sure they get in gear, listen for any
funny sounds, look for abnormal lights that

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.979
shouldn't be burning on the dash. Natural
Sound of Outdoor Car Inspection....... Kelly

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.560
Mc: Many cars have been repossessed. Others
cars were traded-in when a customer bought

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.920
a new vehicle from a dealership. Some cars
are ready to roll off the lot but many need

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.950
a brief stop at a garage for mainenance, cleaning
or T-L-C. Steve Brumfield \'96 There are a

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.950
lot of deals here if you're knowledgable enough
about a car to know what you're doing. Everything

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.950
here is probably going to need a little something
done to it, that's why it's here. Jeff Robinson

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.840
\'96 If you're coming out here, most likely
what you're going to look for is a mid-grade

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.480
car with fair miles on it. I'm not going to
say all the miles are going to be perfect

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.540
on it. Kelly: Fair being 50 to 100,000 miles.
Jeff Robinson: 50,000 to 100,000 \'96 maybe

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:50.880
a little over 100,000 miles. Kelly Mc: If
you're a private citizen who's never been

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.500
to a car auction, the pro's say, \'93be careful.\'94
It's exciting out there. So exciting, you'll

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.860
forget you're competing with professionals
and that every bid makes the price rise. Harold

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.130
Jones \'96 You're going to get bit on some
deals and the time you spend at the auction,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.790
watching other dealers, that's just experience
you've got to pick up. And if you don't go

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.950
easy when you first start spending money,
somebody is going to eat you alive. Natural

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.282
Sounds....Car Auctioneer Cadence Jeff Robinson
\'96 Expect - You want to know what kind of

00:03:23.282 --> 00:03:28.570
car you're looking for, you want to know what
kind of price range you want to be at and

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.120
you certainly don't want to be the first person
to bid on a car. You want to wait and see,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.379
you know, is there a dealer that's going to
be hot on it? Are there going to be two dealers

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.840
who are hot on it. You don't want to get in
a bidding war with somebody who has a vast

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.340
amount of experience with doing this every
day of their lives. Kelly Mc: In these wars,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.640
there's no one to bail you out if lose control.
The auctioneer's cadence, by design, lures

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.849
you to bid higher and higher. It's always
been that way. Kelly Mc: How long does it

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:55.849
take before you're not getting \'93charmed\'94
by the auctioneer? Harold Jones: I would say

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:56.849
it takes a good twelve months before you get
your feet on the ground and you know really

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:57.849
what to expect and know that you're not being
taken for a ride when you're in there bidding.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:58.849
Kelly Mc: I understand you take yourself for
the ride. You're the one raising your hand.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:59.849
Albert Jarman: You have to know what you're
doing. Kelly Mc: But, if you do your homework,

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.190
spot your target and keep cool, you might
buy a vehicle cheaper than a dealer would

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.300
sell it you. Steve Brumfield \'96 Perception
\'96 It's a perception. If you feel like what

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.410
you spent got you what you wanted, that's
a deal. There's no rule. It's how you feel

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.209
about it. Natural Sounds of Car Auction.....
Kelly Mc: Is there anybody in there to protect

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:23.139
me from myself? Jeff Robinson: When the auctioneer
lays the mallet down, it is a contract. It

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.379
is a law in NC, you've bought the car. Kelly
Mc: As our household budgets tighten and we

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:33.500
seek a deal where we can find one, the car
auction might cross your mind. But, like anything

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.770
else, the pro's say do your homework and know
when to quit lifting your hand. You might

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.019
just cruise out of Greenville with a bargain.
