Hi! I’m Louis Ortiz on behalf of Expert
Village, and we’re back to show you the

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.960
second part of the procedure for cooking fish
and en-papillote style. En-papillote means

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.150
that it’s going to be inside. Some people
will misinterpret that and think it means

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
bag, but en-papillote actually means balloon,
which is what is going to happen to this parchment

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.161
paper as the cooking procedure goes on. As
heat is added, there’s going to be steam

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:27.890
generated within the inside and it’s going
to puff up like a balloon, so that’s where

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.410
en-papillote comes from. What we’re going
to do first is we want to season the fish

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.710
with some dry seasonings. I’ve got some
fresh cracked black pepper. We’re just going

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.050
to kind of dust that onto the top. I’ve
got some fresh ground sea salt here. We’re

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:52.820
just going to do a fine grind on that so it
looks nice and pretty not to over salt. Now

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.510
that we’ve gotten the dry seasonings on,
I’m going to go ahead and place our fish

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:13.420
like so. Little bit of an angle there, okay.
Next, I’m going to throw some herbs on top.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.910
This is just tyme. All I’m going to do really
is just pick some of the leaves off of this

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.060
fresh tyme and just sprinkle those on. I don’t
want to overdo it. We still got some more

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.200
things to sprinkle on. This is nice and convenient
because essentially all the prep work and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.069
the seasoning and everything is done all in
one. Then once you cook it, it’s done, obviously.

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:45.219
I’ve got some basil. I’ve got, want some
of that. I’m going to sprinkle some of that

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:57.630
over the top, some little curlies. Alright,
I also have some that I cut into small little

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.669
slices and such, and I’ve got some corn,
which I’ve taken off the stock. I’m just

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:10.819
going to sprinkle that on there on the top.
Like I said, all the prep work is down. It’s

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.700
all inclusive, so you’re just putting all
the sides and everything together all in one

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.810
bunch. Okay. Now, at this point, I’m going
to throw on just a couple of supremes, and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.709
I’ve got some lemon supremes here. I’m
going to put a couple of those on. Then we’re

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.930
going to get really crazy and put some orange
supreme. Both of these supremes, the orange

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.459
and the lemon, I’ve actually shaved off
with a and added some zest to them so we can

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:52.360
amplify the flavor as well. What’s left?
Well, butter of course. We’re going to put

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.030
a couple of pats of butter on the top. Now,
I’ve got some made from scratch sea food

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.129
stock, as well as some white cooking wine.
I want to drizzle just a little bit over the

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.950
top. There’s going to be moisture within
the fish that actually comes out throughout

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.930
the cooking process, but I’m going to kind
of help it along so that we can create that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:19.180
steam that I was talking about. We’re going
to pour just a tiny bit of the white cooking

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.770
wine over the top. Like I said, you don’t
want a whole bunch because you don’t want

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:34.379
to just water log the whole balloon. I’ve
got some seafood stock here. I’m going to

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.150
pour just a little bit of that there as well,
since we were making like a little reduction

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.120
sauce throughout the cooking process. So,
that’s everything that’s going to go in

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.659
here. Now, at this point, you can add vegetables
and I’ve got some asparagus. We can actually

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.819
put a couple of these in here, and what’s
going to happen is the vegetables and the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.499
fish will all be steamed together. So essentially,
we’ve got a complete meal by the time all

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:05.109
this is done. This is our assembly process.
We’ve got all the ingredients that we’ve

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.819
listed here. I’ll come back here in just
a second and show you how to actually seal

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.250
the bag and prepare it for cooking
