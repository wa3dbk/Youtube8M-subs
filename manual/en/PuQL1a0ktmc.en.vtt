00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:03.885
Tatsuya Kawajiri

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:07.231
Q: You had an impressive win. How do you feel?

00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:15.328
A: I wasn't thinking about winning by ippon so I'm somewhat disappointed in myself.

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:29.848
Q: Your impression of Josh Thomson?

00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:36.695
A: He's a great fighter.

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:38.768
But he wasn't anything unexpected, I mean there were no surprises.

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:43.560
Q: It's been your first match since the title match. How is your leg?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:54.337
A: As long as I'm not put in a leglock I'm okay. No problem.

00:00:54.337 --> 00:01:02.184
Q: What was your strategy?

00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:06.273
A: A stand-up knockout.

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:10.723
I knew I could get a mount on the ground so I went for a shoulder lock, 

00:01:10.723 --> 00:01:21.367
but he defended against it.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:46.905
Q: In the video you said that if you beat Thomson you would go to America. Any idea of when?

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:55.609
A: I'll go if I get a good offer.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.666
Q: Even if it's not Strikeforce?

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:07.785
A: Probably Strikeforce. I beat Thomson, right?

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:24.125
Q: Thomson was talking about coming to another country and dealing with jetlag and new envirnments.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:59.696
How would you prepare for fighting in America?

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:05.983
A: I'll do what I have to if I get an offer.

00:03:05.983 --> 00:03:14.885
I want to be a fighter that isn't affected by those things. 

00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:17.021
I don't want to make excuses.

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.853
 I just want to go to America and show how strong I am. 

00:03:19.853 --> 00:03:33.900
That's what a fighter does. Vanderlay Silva came to Japan from Brazil and had amazing fights. 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.054
That's the kind of fighter I want to be.

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:48.544
Q: Before your fight, what did you think about Aoki fighting with those rules and losing that way? 

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:51.631
And what do you think now?

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:59.782
I was surprised that kind of thing happens before a fight. 

00:03:59.782 --> 00:04:08.281
I thought he was fooling around in the first match. 

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:11.388
He probably was serious, but if you act like that, you get hurt. 

00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:16.300
Now I'm just worried about his injury.
