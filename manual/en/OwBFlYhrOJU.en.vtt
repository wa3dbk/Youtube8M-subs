University Housing creates a unique experience
for students, especially first-year students,

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.060
to really get into that college experience,
being able to know that you have your room

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.060
and your space here at the University of South
Carolina.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.800
I like it a lot. I mean it's really convenient,
I mean I'm close to everything on campus right now.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.050
I can walk to the football stadium, I can

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.380
walk to the baseball stadium, all my classes
are within fifteen minutes.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.850
From my first meeting in Bates House the day
we moved in, I felt right at home and became

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.899
part of a great community with about 20-25
guys. We go to all the football games together,

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.469
I joined a fraternity with about 15 of them;
they become like your best friends.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.660
The person I roomed with two years ago, I
still grab dinner with, still grab lunch with,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.859
and hopefully have formed a lifelong friendship
with that roommate. He was from California

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.469
and I'm from right here.
We were random roommates assigned last year,

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.890
but we became friends really quickly. We have
similar majors, we're from similar areas,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.429
and we decided to live together this year
and next year as well.

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.070
The first few weeks of school, a lot of people
leave their doors open, so if you're walking

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.990
down the halls you can just pop your head
in and meet new people. We've had a couple

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.509
of field days where we've had free food and
carnival games out on the front lawn that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.950
kind of bring people together.
I was planning on sitting outside and doing

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.119
my homework on the front lawn. It's gorgeous
and it's perfect for seeing other people and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.170
just relaxing, especially on the weekends.
The community itself was very focused on study,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.569
so you could get your homework done, but at
the same time, everyone was just so smart

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.319
and funny and really engaged and meeting everyone
in the dorm.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.560
I lived in Patterson last year. It was the
first year Patterson opened, and so I was

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.429
like, I've got to live in this place. So I
did, and I absolutely loved living in Patterson.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.509
It was such a cool experience.
There are really no limits to the community

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.640
that you can form.
It's very safe, it's really comfortable. I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.300
was very surprised at the quality of living
here, and it's made my experience so much

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.980
better.
I love living on campus, I.. I can't imagine

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.500
living anywhere else.
