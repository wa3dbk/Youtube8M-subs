Hello everybody, welcome to my 13th tutorial!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I am back with a customization tutorial.
I hope your week is going well.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.149
I take this Wednesday afternoon to do this new tutorial.
I don't know where you live, but the weather

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:33.000
is now really cold, this is why I decided
to customize a cap!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.800
I will introduce you to two different customizations.
This tutorial is very simple.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.000
Here are the accessories you will need
Thread coil

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.000
Needles
A pair of scissors

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Pompoms
Lace

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Feathers
Two caps

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Like you saw, I'm going to use pompoms, feathers and lace.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.200
Of course, everytime I do a customization,
all the accessories are examples.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.000
If you want to use a piece of fabric, pearls
or buttons, it's up to you!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.400
Everything is ready so I start my customization.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:32.100
I start with the black cap with pompoms.
Take a needle and thread.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.700
Position your different sizes of pompoms wherever you want.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.770
 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.779
You can do it in your own way.

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:48.779
 

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:58.509
 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:07.079
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.000
Once you're happy with your composition, you can start sewing.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.230
I start my second customization.
I will use feathers and lace.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.409
I took three difference feathers.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:44.409
I sew on my cap with a thread which match the color of my cap.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:56.900
Take your needle and fix everything.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.110
 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:36.530
Once it's done, I will sew the lace all around
my cap. You have to measure the length you need. Cut where it's necessary.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.000
Now, you can sew.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.100
Both of the customizations are done! We can
now have a look at the results.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:33.000
I repeat myself, but of course the customization I did are examples for all the type of customization you can do. Don't hesitate to go and buy a very simple and cheap cap and then customize it. It will always be less expensive than buying one already customized in stores.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:44.200
Once again, thanks for everyone who watch my videos and leave comments. Next time I will be doing a new customization tutorial.
But I don't tell anything more about it.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.260
I wish you all a good week. Good luck to all of you at school or at work.
See you very soon, bye!
