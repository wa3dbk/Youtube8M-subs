00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.480
Installation of artificial grass, part 2.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.579
Unroll your artificial grass. At
the beginning of the project

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.120
go ahead and unroll your grass. This
accomplishes a couple of things.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.930
Your artificial grass has been rolled up
tightly for at least a week or longer

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.670
so the fibers are going to be tightly
matted down. Allowing your unrolled grass

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.140
to sit out in the sun for an hour or two
allows it to breathe. The fibers will

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.420
begin to naturally stand up on their own.
Artificial grass is by nature a little

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.700
expansive so allowing the grass to sit
unrolled in the sun allows the back to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.360
warm up, ensures that you will get a good
tight stretch during the installation

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.360
process. Also the warmer the backing the
more pliable the grass will be and the

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.920
faster it will take to the shape of any
undulations and the easier it will be to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.360
work out any wrinkles.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.800
Measure and cut the appropriate length
or linear feet of artificial grass.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.780
Remember artificial grass has a grain to
it and the grain always needs to be

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.340
pointing in the same direction. As a
general rule you want the grain pointing

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.930
towards the direction it's going to be
viewed from most often. So in front yards

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.670
the grain points toward the street. In
backyards it points towards the house. In

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.540
some instances grain direction is going
to be determined by the layout that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.290
minimizes waste rather than where it
would be viewed from most often.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.420
Rough cut the edges. Put your artificial
grass in place and rough cut the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.990
perimeter being sure to leave at least a
couple inches of excess.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.910
Seam your artificial grass. Seaming can
be done in one of two primary ways. You

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.260
can secure your seam with sod staples
and nails or with seaming tape and glue.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.200
Sod staples and nails is faster, lower
costs and seaming taping glue is more

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.840
expensive but more robust. Purchase Green
recommends a moisture-cured glue

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.060
specifically designed for artificial
grass. When seaming your artificial grass

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.630
you want to pay particular attention to
the distance between the adjoining

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.990
stitch rows. Pay attention to the gauge.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.130
This is the distance between stitch rows.
It is normally three-eighths of an inch.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.110
When preparing your pieces to seem you
want to ensure you maintain that gauge.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.600
iI you are too close to the edges

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.440
it will bunch up and the scene will be
noticeable. If you're too far apart there

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.540
will be a gap and the scene will also be
noticeable.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.459
Fine cut the edges. Now you want to more
precisely cut your perimeter.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.780
If you are using a wonder edge then you
have about a half inch to work with.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.680
If you're using a subgrade bender board
you want to cut the grass so that it

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.060
extends one and a half to three quarter
inches beyond the perimeter on all edges

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.769
where there is a constructed restraint,
such as a sidewalk, walkway, patio or

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.670
driveway.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.650
You are leaving this excess so you can
tuck it into the quarter inch gap

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.250
you left between the subgrade bender
board and the constructed edge.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.480
This creates a very beautiful, natural
aesthetic mimicking the appearance of a

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.040
freshly edged lawn without any gap
between the walkway or patio and the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.860
artificial grass.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.600
Tuck your edges. Using a chisel, tuck the
extra one and a half to three quarter

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.920
inch of artificial grass into the gap
between your sub grade bend-a-board and

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.060
your constructed edge.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.620
Stapling your artificial grass to the
subgrade bend-a-board. When using the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.580
subgrade bend-a-board one of the last
steps is to staple your artificial grass

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.840
to your bend-a-board.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.639
This provides a very secure, durable
installation. Purchase Green recommends a

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.720
one-inch 18 ga pneumatic staple on
every inch along the perimeter.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.520
If a subgrade bender board was not used
then the perimeter is typically secured

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.980
with a 5 inch nail every three inches.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.150
The concern with this installation
method, although it is the quickest and

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.590
least expensive, is that the nails may
come loose over time. The perimeter is

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.800
the most vulnerable part of an
artificial grass installation.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.460
It is for this reason that it's often
well worth the added expense to use this

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.600
sub-grade bend-a-board perimeter
installation. Brushing up your artificial

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.220
grass. Your artificial grass has been
rolled up for a couple of weeks so you

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.750
will need to brush it up.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.550
This can be done with the power broom, a
stiff bristled broom or a grandi rake.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.080
The sun will also do wonders in helping
the artificial grass to stand up. This

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.010
step also helps to prepare your
artificial grass for the application of

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.910
infill.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.979
Stay tuned for our next video on the
types of infill and how to install.
