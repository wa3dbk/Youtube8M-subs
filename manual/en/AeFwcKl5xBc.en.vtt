00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.360 position:98%
If you’re considering making improvements to your home to lower your energy bills

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.220 position:98%
or fix comfort problems, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.490 position:97%
the Department of Energy want to know about home performance with ENERGY STAR.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.470 position:98%
Home performance with ENERGY STAR is a comprehensive, whole-house approach to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.540 position:97%
improving energy efficiency and comfort at home while helping to protect

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.370 position:64%
the environment and fight global warming.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.280 position:98%
Rather than focusing on one, single problem, like an old heating or cooling system,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.530 position:98%
not enough insulation in the attic, or leaky windows, home performance with

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.330 position:97%
ENERGY STAR looks at how the improvements throughout your home can

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.830 position:67%
work together to give you the best results.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.720 position:97%
Homeowners who make improvements through home performance with ENERGY STAR

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.130 position:97%
find that their utility bills are lower and their homes are much more comfortable.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.940 position:75%
Let’s take a closer look at what you can expect.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.740 position:98%
Home performance with ENERGY STAR starts with an interview with you, the homeowner,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.100 position:98%
to help your contractor understand the concerns you have about your home’s performance.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.170 position:97%
Things like high energy bills, cold floors in your kitchen, or an upstairs bedroom

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.020
that’s too warm in the summer.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.800 position:97%
After the interview, the contractor will evaluate your home to determine

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.140 position:97%
where the improvements are needed. They will inspect your home

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.300 position:98%
inside and out, including the heating, the cooling equipment, duct systems,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.880
and even lighting and appliances.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.480 position:97%
Your contractor will also inspect your attic, basement, or crawlspace,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.830 position:98%
if you have one, and may run diagnostic tests, such as a blower door or

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.550 position:97%
duct blaster, or use an infrared camera to find the trouble spots. Your contractor may

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.650 position:98%
also review your utility bills to compare them to similar homes in your area.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.240 position:98%
Each home’s problems are different, but there are some recommendations that the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.450 position:70%
home performance contractors frequently make.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.880 position:97%
Did you know, if you added up all the small holes in a typical home, it would be

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.650 position:89%
like leaving a window open 24 hours a day, all year long?

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.660 position:63%
That’s a huge waste of energy and money.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.260 position:95%
Sealing air leaks and adding insulation where it’s needed are

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.110 position:98%
critical first steps to improving the energy efficiency of your home.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.140 position:97%
If your home has an attic or a basement, the biggest air leaks are usually hidden there.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.900 position:98%
In the attic, you may not have enough insulation or you may have air leaks around

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.610 position:98%
pipes and chimneys or around recessed lighting. Your contractor may recommend

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.070 position:64%
sealing these and adding more insulation.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.930 position:98%
In the basement, leaks are commonly found here, around the edge of the house,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.500 position:72%
where the basement walls meet the floor above.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.450 position:97%
We also find leaks around doors, windows, and pipes. Your contractor may

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.660 position:98%
recommend sealing these leaks with caulk or expanding foam. They may also

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.110 position:63%
recommend insulating the basement walls.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.910 position:97%
If your home has a crawlspace, leaks can draw in cold air in the winter and humid air in

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.150 position:95%
the summer, making your home less comfortable all year round.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.260 position:98%
Here, your contractor may recommend lining the floor with plastic to keep the dampness out,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.930 position:75%
and sealing and insulating the crawlspace walls.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.220 position:97%
You and your family spend most of your time here, in the main living space of the house.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.620 position:97%
This is where you often feel problems, like air leaks around doors, windows,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.130
and pipes under sinks.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.810 position:98%
Sealing these leaks cam eliminate drafts and may keep our dust and pests.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.630 position:98%
If your heating and cooling system is more than 10 years old, your contractor

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.610 position:98%
may recommend that you replace the equipment with models that have earned

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.550
the government’s ENERGY STAR.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.850 position:98%
Installed correctly, these high-efficiency units can save up to 10% on your annual utility bills.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.490 position:98%
You can get additional savings by installing and using an ENERGY STAR

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.200
qualified programmable thermostat.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.400 position:97%
Used correctly, it can save you up to $180 a year on your heating and cooling costs.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.480 position:98%
If your home has forced-air heating or central cooling, ducts move air from those

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.030 position:66%
systems to the rooms throughout your home.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.690 position:97%
If your ducts have gaps, leaks, or tears, you may notice that some rooms

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.430 position:97%
are never comfortable, no matter where you set the thermostat.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.740 position:97%
That’s because they’re not getting the right amount of heated or cooled air.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.350 position:98%
Sealing leaks and making sure ducts are straight and properly connected

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.950 position:97%
and insulating where needed, will improve your home’s comfort and energy-efficiency.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.200 position:98%
Energy used for lighting and appliances accounts for nearly half your utility bill,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.490 position:97%
so there’s a big opportunity to get savings by installing energy-efficient models that

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.550 position:64%
have earned the government’s ENERGY STAR.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.300 position:97%
The ENERGY STAR label can be found on more than 50 different types of products

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.590 position:98%
for your home, including refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers, and home electronics,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.440 position:91%
as well as lighting fixtures and compact florescent bulbs.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.910 position:98%
And buying products with this mark means you’re doing your part to reduce

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.340 position:97%
greenhouse gas emissions. Once energy-efficiency improvements have been made

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.430 position:98%
to your home, your contractor may recommend other measures, like installing

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.320 position:64%
solar panels or a solar hot-water system.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.280 position:97%
Remember, these are the most common recommendations. Your contractor will work

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.860 position:97%
with you and your family to determine the best improvements for your home.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.320 position:98%
After the evaluation, the contractor will prepare a detailed work proposal.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.510 position:98%
They can also show you how the recommended improvements can qualify for special

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.300 position:72%
financing or other incentives where available.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.300 position:97%
Once you decide which improvements to make, your home performance contractor

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.840 position:58%
will help you get the job done right.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.510 position:97%
When the work is completed, your contractor may run another set of tests to show the

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.260 position:97%
difference the improvements have made. Local home performance with

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260 position:98%
ENERGY STAR sponsors also spot-check contractors’ work, so you can have added

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.320 position:75%
confidence that your job will be done correctly.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.110 position:92%
The comprehensive approach offered by home performance with

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.780 position:97%
ENERGY STAR will make your home more comfortable and energy-efficient.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.430 position:91%
Depending on the improvements you choose, you can save 20%

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.200 position:56%
or more on your annual utility bill.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.130 position:97%
And because you’re using less energy, you’ll also be helping to protect the environment.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.730 position:98%
