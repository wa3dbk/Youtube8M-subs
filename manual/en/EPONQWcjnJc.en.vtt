00:00:01.237 --> 00:00:08.377
The Imperia Online Battle

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.549
Part I: Army Composition

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:19.912
Upon arriving at its mission destination, the attacker's army is deployed against the defender's.

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:27.002
Both armies are divided into three battle lines: the Frontline, the Archery Line and the Artillery Line.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:34.639
The Frontline and the Archery line are divided into Center and two Flanks. They contain all of the soldiers.

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:44.458
The bulk of these soldiers form the Frontline. All of the Melee units are grouped there – Swordsmen, Spearmen, and Cavalry.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.620
In every battle, 10% of these melee troops, proportionally taken from among all units, are always held back in Reserve.

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:57.773
They will join the fray when one of the Frontline groups has succumbed to the enemy.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:07.144
The default formation of the armies breaks down the front troops as follows: 15% in each Flank, and 60% in your Center.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:12.603
To change these values, the player must assign a different formation before the battle.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.109
Formations are unlocked in the capital through research.

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:24.533
They grant the ability to change your Flank/Center ratio, and may be very useful, depending on the players' army compositions.

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:31.199
To make the best choice of formation against a given enemy, the player had better spy his enemy before the battle,

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.129
and, thus, establish his army composition.

00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:40.584
Each unit type has a priority positioning on the Frontline, according to its best performance.

00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:49.708
From Flank to Center, the priority order of the units is: Cavalry first, followed by Spearmen, and finally – Swordsmen.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.680
If the amount of troops exceeds the size of the division, positions will change.

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:58.176
Behind the Frontline, is the Archery line.

00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:00.437
It is split into Flanks and Center.

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:05.422
Archers are split between the three positions, with no archer reserve set aside.

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:09.909
Archers positions also depend on the choice of Formation.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.100
For example, a Flank Archers formation will be advisable when the enemy has no Cavalry, but plenty of Spearmen.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:22.208
Spearmen are strong on the Flanks, however, vulnerable to Archers.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:27.625
If boosted enough on the flanks, the Archers can easily destroy all of the enemy's spearmen.

00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:36.643
At the back of the army the siege engines are deployed - rather ineffective against enemy soldiers, but a perfect Fortress destroyer.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.590
Terrain, skills of the General, colony bonuses and military technologies can influence the army's performance.

00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:52.513
In the chaos of war, however, there’s one thing that’s even more decisive to the outcome of a battle than the strength of arms:

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.720
the soldiers’ Morale.

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:58.555
The more damage the troops suffer, the more morale they lose.

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:05.324
When its value drops beneath 50, there’s a growing chance that each following loss will route the division.

00:03:05.674 --> 00:03:11.574
Some of the troops may return after the battle, but many of them will desert the army permanently.

00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:19.327
Since the morale loss can be fatal for the attacker’s troops, it is of no consequence for the defender's fortress Garrison troops.

00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:26.202
When they are besieged, they have nowhere to run and, will gloriously fight to death.

00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:30.888
To be continued in Part 2
