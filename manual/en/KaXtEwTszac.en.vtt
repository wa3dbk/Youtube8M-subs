Every day, we listen to the stories of women.
Every day we hear what's going on in their

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.540
daily lives. We hear about the businesses
they're trying to keep afloat, about the doctors'

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.520
bills they can't pay, the mortgage they can't
afford. We hear about how they're taking that

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.520
extra shift or working the extra job. They're
saving and sacrificing, never spending a dime

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.140
on themselves, because they desperately want
something better for their kids. So to us,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.510
the debates about the issues of the day are
not abstract.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.510
In the end, we are not fighting these battles
for ourselves. We're fighting them for our

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.739
daughters, and our granddaughters. We're fighting
for the world we want them to have. And I'm

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.710
fighting not just as a mother who wants to
leave a legacy for my girls. I'm in this as

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.700
a citizen who knows what we can do together
to change this country for the better.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.390
So believe me: Barack knows what it means
when a family struggles. He knows what it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.390
means when a woman doesn't have a chance to
fulfill her potential. And today as a father,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.580
he knows what it means to want your daughters
to grow up with no limits to their dreams.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.470
And we know that here in America we can shape
our own destiny. We know that if we make the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.570
right choices and have the right priorities
we can ensure that everyone gets a fair shake

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.780
and a chance to get ahead.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.780
So we can't afford to be complacent or tired
or frustrated. We don't have time for that.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.909
It is time to get to work. So I have one last
question:

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:05.579
Are you in?
