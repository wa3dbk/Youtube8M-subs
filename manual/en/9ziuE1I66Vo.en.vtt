00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.900
After many days on the road, we finally returned
to Doraleous Castle.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.470
Um, there's a giant wooden horse in front
of the castle.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.490
What the hell?

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.950
You know what this is - this is a gift from
the Wetalds.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.239
Oh, the Wetalds!

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.239
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.239
It is.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.650
They wouldn't just have given us a shit stick.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.650
This is a gift, man!

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.550
They gave you a gift, Doraleous.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.550
It's for us!

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.550
It's for us!

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.460
They really appreciate what we did.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.370
No, Doraleous, I've seen - I've seen something
like this before, okay?

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.629
We've got to be careful.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:48.629
I don't know.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.390
This shoddy craftsmanship - these things fall
apart in, like, a week.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.390
Uh ...

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.390
Oh, no.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.390
Mirdon, come on, it don't matter man!

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.390
They built this for us!

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.812
I can't tell you how touched I am right now.

00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:58.030
I don't think the Wetalds built it.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.600
If they did, it'd, like, it'd be made out
of, like, pinecones and bones.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.600
Doraleous is crying.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.180
I'm not crying.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.740
I'm just happy.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.740
You're crying, Doraleous.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.740
I'm so happy right now!

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.740
Look at you.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
You're like a little girl.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740
Let it out, Doraleous.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.740
This is what it's all about, guys.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.740
We're getting noticed.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.740
That's right.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.500
Okay, here's what you guys have to do: just
bring this in the back gate,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.140
leave it in the courtyard, then you have the
rest of the day off.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.360
Because Walken and I - we're going to take
a little trip and grab some things.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.479
And when we get back, it's party time!

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.479
Awoo!

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.030
It's party time when y'all get back?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.030
Hey, all right!

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.030
Oh!

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.030
Because we deserve it!

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.030
Everybody deserves it!

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.030
(group) Yeah, we do!

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.030
Yes, we do!

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.030
Yeah.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.030
Okay.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.030
I'm into that.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.030
So just do that, and we'll see you soon.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.030
All right!

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.030
All right, Doraleous!

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.030
All right, see ya!

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.030
See ya!

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.740
Did you guys see him crying?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.189
What a bitch.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:58.439
Doraleous, you've got a wild bunch back there,
but I think things are coming together nicely.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.579
I think you're right, Walken.

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.810
I think you're right.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.219
But the dwarf - his voice.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.830
It hurts my ears.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.520
Is it just me?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.710
No, no.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.259
It's not.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.090
You know, some people think your voice is
annoying too, right?

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.290
Naw, can't be true.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.200
People love my voice.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.350
(laughs)

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.490
Help!

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.640
Help!

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.790
Wait!

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.790
You hear that?

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.650
Sounds like a damsel in distress!

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.650
No!

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.650
No!

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.650
No!

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.650
Oh!

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.650
Let's hang him from a tree!

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.650
No!

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.020
Let's cut his guts out!

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.210
Let the boy go!

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.840
Who are you?

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.110
The name's Doraleous!

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.940
And today is not your day.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.370
No, today is not YOUR day.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.230
No, today is not YOUR day.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.660
It is our day, and today is not YOUR day!

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.960
It's not your day!

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.030
It IS our day!

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.480
It's - enough!

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.260
I'm a trained warrior, and I'd rather not
kill anyone today.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.350
Unless I have to.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.510
Get him!

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.680
(yelling, grunting)

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.120
Doraleous, why'd you do that?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.800
Walken, these men chose their own destiny.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.500
No, you put your damn sword back in with all
the blood on it.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.980
The oils alone are going to corrode the blade,
make it rust.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.980
Dullen it.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.980
Lessen the value.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.900
All right, well, I'll clean the blade later.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.900
Ah.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.900
Okay.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.900
That's fine.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.900
And maybe I'll wipe my ass later.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.900
Hey, you okay?

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.900
Oh, yes sir.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.900
I'm fine sir.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900
Thank you!

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.110
I'm so glad you came along when you did.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.010
Hey, do you need us to walk you home or anything?

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.010
Oh, no sir.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.010
This is my home.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.230
I live here in the woods.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.230
Really?

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.230
Yes.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.230
I'm on summer break from Shackleton.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.230
Shackleton?

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.560
That's a wizard school.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560
Yes!

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.760
And the finest wizard school there is.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.460
I'm learning so much and I have so many good
friends there.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.460
That's nice.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.760
I'll tell - I'll tell you what.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.400
Do you want to follow us back to our castle?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.800
Maybe just for a few days?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800
Oh!

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.300
Oh, I'd love to!

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.950
That sounds absolutely wonderful!

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.950
Good, good.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.970
I'm DOraleous, and this is Sir Walken.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.970
Aye.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.470
It's a pleasure to meet you both.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.250
My name's Harry.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.930
Harry Pooter.
