&gt;&gt; MOORE: Chief Almir had seen Google Earth
in an Internet cafÃ© in 2007 and he asked

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.790
for our help.
His idea was if we could teach the young people

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.920
how to use YouTube, how to interview the elders,
record this content, attach it to Google Earth,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.780
it would be a way of sharing their culture
with the world.

&gt;&gt; MOORE: When we came down this year, we
trained the Surui people in how to use a new

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.340
technology using cell phones.
So, when illegal loggers penetrate their land,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.159
they'll be able to take photographs, videos
that are GPS-located, immediately upload to

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.779
Google Earth, alert the law enforcement authorities,
and use this as a way to protect the forest.

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:41.539
So, whoever's responsible for enforcing the
law, they can't deny that it happened anymore

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.319
because half a billion people around the world
can see it with their own eyes.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.060
Tropical deforestation accounts for 20% of
the greenhouse gas emissions that we all produce.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.539
A few years back, many members of the tribe
organized to replant the forest that had been

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.009
illegally logged.
Using cell phones, they can document what

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.869
trees are there and where there's the blank
areas, and document their plans for planting,

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.420
so that they can gain access to the carbon
offset marketplace.

deforestation this year.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.400
Go to your country representative to the Copenhagen
Climate Change Treaty and get your government

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.730
to support REDD.
