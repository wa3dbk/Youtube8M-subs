00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.110
Hey, so this actually the
morning after the surgery.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.880
I would have done
a video last night.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.390
But my surgery was in the afternoon,
so I didn't actually get out till,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.230
I think it was a bit about
7 o'clock or something.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.150
Then I had to
travel quite a way,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.170
so by the time I got home
I wasn't feeling up to it.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.130
I was pretty tired.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.450
I don't know if it probably
happens to everybody,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.600
but I don't react very
well with anaesthetic.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.950
It seems in my previous operation
that I had when I was younger.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.610
It seems I kind of,
I reacted the same.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.720
But when I come out of it,
for the first hour or so,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.470
I gets loads of the hot and
cold sweats, hot flashes.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.570
And because I was getting
the hot flashes whenever,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.840
I don't react
very well anyway.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.240
I must have swallowed a bit
blood in the actual operation.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.870
And apparently you sort of just
rejects blood swallowed like that.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.720
So I was sick a little bit, 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.240
but it wasn't painful,
my nose, being sick.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.070
As long as obviously you
don't try to stop it.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.460
Yeah I actually felt
a lot better afterwards, 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.780
once I actually brought it up,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.400
because it must have made
me feel quite sick beforehand,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.570
and I didn't even realise.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.390
So I did that, and I felt
a lot better afterwards.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.500
I wasn't in any pain
when I woke up.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.300
I still don't have any pain.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.340
I haven't taken any pain killers
since the actual surgery,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.440
so that's pretty good.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.580
It feels a little bit weird, 
but I think it is more like the cast

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.590
actually wrapped around my nose that
it feels weird more than anything.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.010
I haven't actually, because you can see
I haven't actually gotten

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.560
any bruising or anything so far.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.750
I'm not really
swollen to be honest,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.890
so they must have
been pretty gentle.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.830
So I am happy about that.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.130
I mean obviously it is the
first day, so I am hoping,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.060
I don't know what you count as,
if I had the surgery yesterday.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.170
Is it day 1 or day 2?
I don't know.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.550
So I am hoping if I don't have any
bruising by tomorrow or the next day,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.470
I shouldn't really get
any at all anyway.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.810
So I think probably
third day is the worst.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.350
So if I haven't got it by then
hopefully I won't have it at all,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.520
which is good.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.050
Nobody wants bruising.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.770
Yeah with the sedation method 
they gave me, the local anaesthetic,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.650
they gave me the sedation
and as it started to work,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.140
it just makes you feel
like you've drunk.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.350
Kind of sleepy but more
drunk than anything.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.280
And I must have gone to
sleep quite soon after,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.760
couldn't remember them putting the
injection in, I didn't feel it.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.890
So that bit I didn't feel at all.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.500
Didn't feel any of the injections,
didn't even realise they put them in.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.520
I woke up a few times in
the operation I remember.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.370
And I remember them saying
about playing Johnny Cash,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.740
if I like Johnny
Cash, so I said yes.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.840
But I couldn't feel
anything at the time.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.150
It just feels like when you kind
of first wake up in the morning,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.540
and you are really like
kind of still half asleep.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.580
And you can't open your eyes,
because you are tired,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.350
that's the kind of
feeling you get.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.820
But no pain, I must have woke up when
they were doing part of the surgery,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.050
because I felt some pressure.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.490
I assume well I don't know if
that's what I actually felt,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.090
or I was just assuming because
I knew what was going.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.530
But no, it didn't hurt at all.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.170
I couldn't hear anything
it wasn't weird in any way.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.080
It didn't freak me out.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.600
You really don't care to be
honest, when you wake up.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.170
So don't be worried about if you do
wake up, because you really won't care.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.560
You will just want
to go back to sleep.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.770
So yeah the
anaesthetic was fine.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.540
I mean with me being sick I
think that's a very rare case,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.950
because I think it is just I personally
don't react very well with anaesthetics.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.540
So I won't be worried about,
particularly having that,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.660
I think it was just
I was an exception.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.500
And it wasn't really that
bad anyways to be honest,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.770
so I wouldn't be worried.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.690
Yeah, I have basically just being
laying in bed doing nothing, chilling.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.940
I have been taking my antibiotics, 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.440
and like sipping water,
and having some

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.110
like flat ginger beer
like they recommended.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.370
Which I like ginger beer anyway,
so that was quite plus for me.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.290
I think some bits of advice
I could probably give,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.750
is where obviously you are
breathing through your nose.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.790
I can breathe through my mouth rather,
but I can breathe through my nose,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.200
but I don't really want to
because I don't want to push it.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.160
But if you are breathing through
your mouth all the time

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.110
which obviously is expected, you get
really dry lips and dry tongue,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.100
obviously because that's where
you are breathing through.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.070
So I would recommend
have Vaseline nearby,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.840
because it just made 
my lips more comfortable.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.970
Otherwise it just feels awful.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.180
And if your lips feel awful,
you start to feel more awful anyway.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.620
So the Vaseline really helped
to make my lips more,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.990
 a bit more moisturised.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.390
Also just try and
drink as much water,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.800
because it makes your tongue and
everything feel a lot better,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.160
especially when you are breathing
out of it all the time.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.410
I have had a slice of toast when
I first woke up this morning.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.130
Didn't have any problem with that,
I mean chewing is a big difficult

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.010
and it takes about full hour,
so it's a bit of a long process,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.990
but didn't feel sick
afterwards or anything.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.560
I have had some soap
as well for lunch,

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.090
to take my antibiotics
and that's fine.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.930
Yeah, so it seems like
eating seems to be fine,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.330
it is just a bit slow process
actually chewing it.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.670
Apart from that,
I feel fine to be honest.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.370
I mean, another thing I could
probably recommend, is one of these.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.870
Because where you have to sleep
upright, might be uncomfortable,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.170
even though I have got loads
of pillows behind me,

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.910
loads and loads and
loads of pillows.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.920
It just, I don't feel like can get
support around my neck very much.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.790
So I got one of these
which my mum found.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.550
One of the kind of think
you have on an airplane

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.020
and that's made sleeping upright
a lot more comfortable.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.430
So I would recommend either
getting one of those ready,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.760
or having one of those,
or borrowing one of those

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.600
because it did make it a lot more
comfortable sleeping upright.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.410
It kind of, I think it probably
helps rolling over as well.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.980
Because I, well it's obviously
supporting you on either side,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.240
you can't really
roll over so much.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.620
So I didn't roll over in
the night or anything.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.320
I think the only problem was that I
just woke up a lot in the night.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.080
Obviously I have got nothing
to do, so waking up at night

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.260
doesn't really bother me because I
can just sleep any time of day.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.600
But it is just a little bit annoying
I guess if you are, if you are tired,

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.070
and you wake up and you want to
go back to sleep straight away.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.370
No I think everything is fine.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.610
I wouldn't say be worried about
anything if you're getting it done.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.410
Because this has gone a lot better
than I kind of assumed it would.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.970
Because when looking at pictures
of other people having it done,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.020
they seem like they
have loads of bruising

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.350
when they first came
out of the operation,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.350
and it all looked
really gruesome.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.460
But as you can see
I mean it is quite clean, 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.960
I haven't got any bruising.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.460
I have got a bit of blood rather,
but it doesn't hurt or anything,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.620
so I am pretty pleased.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.500
So don't worry about it.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.370
And, yeah, I will try and take
another video tomorrow sometime.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.540
Hopefully it will
be the same,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.570
I won't have any more bruising,
so wish me luck.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.810
And yeah I'll get
back to you soon.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:13.473
