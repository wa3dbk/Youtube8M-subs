00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.800
&gt;&gt;Narrator: We've always counted on the Sun to heat the Earth   

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.100
but billions of tons of carbon
dioxide and other gases 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.470
from burning fossil fuels now trap that heat 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.700
that warm our planet like a greenhouse.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.490
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.520
 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.869
In 2006, California took the lead in the
battle to slow global warming

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.270
with passage of Assembly Bill 32: the Global Warming Solutions Act

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.940
AB 32 made the Air Resources Board the
agency responsible for leading the push

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.120
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to
1990 levels.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.900
Seven years later, California has a suite of well-developed programs to reduce greenhouse gases

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900
and expand opportunities for sustainable
economic growth

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.300
while giving businesses the kind of
regulatory certainty they require to thrive.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.890
&gt;&gt;Edie Chang: The AB 32 Program is first and foremost an emission reduction program.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.700
It's designed to make sure that we reduce
greenhouse gas emissions 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.450
back to 1990 levels by 2020.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.900
Now of course we recognize that AB 32 has economic impacts,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.800
and we're working to make sure that those impacts are positive.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.720
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Getting here has required a tremendous public process

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.760
and a full state-initiative drawing on a
number of agencies from Cal EPA

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.700
the Natural Resources Agency and other
departments.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.300
The 2008 AB 32 Scoping Plan combines existing programs with new ones,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.860
and serves as a flexible, updatable roadmap to AB 32 implementation.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.110
All these programs increase energy
efficiency,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.500
conservation, and use of renewable energy.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.100
In fact, a large portion of the emission
reductions come from

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.100
increased energy efficiency in homes and businesses.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.720
AB 32 makes greenhouse gases the combined focus,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.510
coupling healthier, cleaner air with greenhouse gas reductions.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.790
AB 32 includes four primary programs

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.800
all geared toward increased energy efficiency:

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.400
Advanced Clean Cars,  

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.900
the Renewables Portfolio Standard,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.700
the Low Carbon Fuel Standard,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.400
and Cap-and-Trade. 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.970
California's air quality rules have helped make today's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.980
passenger cars 99% cleaner-running

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.700
than they were in the mid-1970's.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.400
The Advanced Clean Car rules passed in 2012 continue that push:

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.790
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
tailpipe emissions.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.700
and coincidentally increase gas mileage.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.300
The enhanced zero-emission vehicle program drives the market for vehicles with no emissions,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.600
and puts California in the forefront of developing those vehicles and the fuels to power them.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.340
These vehicles are on the road now,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.820
will save consumers an estimated $5 billion in 2025

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.000
and $10 billion by 2030,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.610
are removing 52 million tons of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere by 2025.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.500
The Renewables Portfolio Standard requires that a third of electricity generated in

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.200
California by 2020 be generated with cleaner renewable fuels.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.250
Reliable electricity is essential to the health with California's economy,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.030
and a wider variety of fuels and fuel sources for generation

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.000
secures that supply while reducing emissions.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.110
The Low Carbon Fuel Standard,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.860
or LCFS, requires a 10% reduction in carbon emissions by 2020

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.360
 from transportation fuels sold in California.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.730
The LCFS will help make a wider choice

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.700
of cleaner fuels available to Californians.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.300
Many are available now. 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.300
Development of that cleaner fuel has 
already drawn companies, 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.840
such as Propel Fuels, to our State.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.970
 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.000
The Cap-and-Trade Program reduces
emissions from the state's largest industrial sources,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.000
including energy generation.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.200
As the cap declines each year, greenhouse gas emissions must come down with it.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.120
Covered businesses must turn in a permit,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.000
or allowance, for every ton of carbon they emit.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.700
the more they reduce emissions, the fewer allowances they need.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.000
Buying and selling carbon allowances lets industry set the price on carbon.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.780
Industry received 90% of allowances free

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.400
as the program began, with the number
declining in later years.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Utilities get 100% of allowances free

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.590
with the money from their sale at
auction used great players

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.200
Allowances let businesses decide when to
make actual emission reductions in a planned way

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.690
as they incorporate greater efficiency
into their business plans.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.800
AB 32 programs dramatically but
gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.200
It will reduce smog-causing pollutants
as well.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.919
This improves the health of Californians and our environment,

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.500
but there are other considerations.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.250
A recent UC Berkeley study finds these programs will result in more than 50,000 new jobs annually by 2020

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.310
and reports by both Ernst &amp; Young and
PricewaterhouseCoopers

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.270
find that California receives two out of
every three green investment dollars

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.500
in the United States.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.630
A 2012 poll by the Public Policy
Institute of California

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.550
finds 70% of voters support
the State's climate change law.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.740
They see the need for these programs, and they are now beginning to reap the benefits

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.580
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.320
To ensure those benefits are sustainable,
a new AB 32 scoping plan is under development

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.840
to carry California to 2020 and beyond.
