00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.200
My name is Charles Cornelius and I've been
working with Crete now for over 9 years.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.430
I want to share with people that if you're
looking for a job that there are a lot of

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.560
jobs out here.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.550
And the trucking industry is looking for people.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.810
If you send out an application you're going
to get a lot of replies.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.079
And you can go with a lot of different companies.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:29.050
Crete and Shaffer do not hire everybody, but
if you can get on with Crete and Shaffer this

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.240
is the place to be if you're going to be on
the road.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.680
We have what's called 6 day RDO which is required
days out, we have a 12 day and a 21 day so

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.719
you can get home weekly or stay out longer
if you want to.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.489
There's just so many things here.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.290
And if you're looking for that right place
to hang your hat, this is it.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.820
Our relationship with our driver managers
as a driver development fleet here in Lincoln

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.219
is excellent.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.379
Out of over 5,000 drivers with Crete and Shaffer
trucking, we have about 150 trainers.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.129
And I have an excellent relationship, I mean,
this is a large company, there's a lot of

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.129
drivers.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.500
But yet when you walk into your terminal or
come here to corporate it's not like you're

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.230
a stranger.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.030
And they take good care of us out here on
the road too, if I need anything I can pick

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.361
up the phone and make a call.

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:20.631
If I need to get home for an emergency or
if anything comes up that I need, there's

00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:24.040
a place I can call and they're here to help
us.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.170
My favorite part of being on the road, there's
some things I'd like to share with you about

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.170
that.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.060
One is my wife, and if you have kids that
under 18 they can come not he road with you

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.060
anytime.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.770
The rider program, you just fill out the paper
work and they can come out anytime.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.990
My wife and I for instance, she rode up with
me to Lincoln here to the Christmas party,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.439
and we just had a good time.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.649
If you wanted to you could take your wife
with you and take your time off.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.630
If you wanted to see the grand canyon your
could take your time off around there, rent

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.241
yourself a car and go see the grand canyon
or anywhere you want to go.

00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:58.640
This is a place where you can get rewarded.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.409
If you come out here and do your job and you
do it well, you get rewarded for it.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.010
Set your goals high.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.500
Look at the different companies and find one
that's going to suite you.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.429
There's a trucking job out here for everybody.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.250
Crete and Shaffer, I think we're the best
there is on the road.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.730
If you're going to be a truck driver this
is the place to be.
