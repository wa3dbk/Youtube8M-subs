00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.230
The brain

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.230
..is the most important organ in the human  body

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.020
The brain controls everything that we do..

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.040
..like the ability to write with a neat handwriting,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.490
learning English,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.820
play sports,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.860
music,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.240
and our ability to process information.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.340
World renowned neuro-scientists all agree that

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.400
a strong brain has a lot of connections between neurons

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.000
the more connections, the stronger the brain wil be.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.280
giving us the ability to better process information

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.260
and therefore perform better in all areas.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.680
The 5 main areas of the brain have the following functions:

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.680
1) Vision processing

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.660
2) Auditory processing and language + reading development

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.960
3) Sensory-motor

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.960
4) Attention

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.340
and 5) Emotions

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.540
If we are able to exercise each of these areas to process information better,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.940
information would be processed more efficiently,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.480
increasing success in all activities.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.120
And if the training is done right,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.740
New connections will be made between different areas of the brain

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.200
making the brain stronger.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.560
The result is that students will be able to better process information

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.460
an understand classwork quicker

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.620
We are not a tutoring center

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.360
but we improve the underlying cognitive function

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.820
for students to succeed in all areas.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.820
We have courses that exercises 5 areas of the brain

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.980
that are fun, engaging, and intensive.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.800
We understand how to re-wire the brain for better performance.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.140
All activities are fun, intensive, and individualized,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.680
constantly adapting and pushing the ability of each student

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.020
to reach their maximum potential

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.080
Disguised as fun activities, students have a lot of fun while exercising their brains.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.920
We use a controlled environment with modern equipment

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.180
including the most advanced software

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.680
that exercises the brain while improving English language

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.960
which is Fast ForWord and Reading Assistant.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.260
smart moves improves the brain's ability to process sensory-motor skills

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.960
Smart Vision improves the ability to understand visual information

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.780
Smart Listening builds auditory processing skills

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.820
which is the foundation for all Engish language and reading development

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.220
and also trains phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.420
Smart Focus is the last course

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.320
We use a bio-feedback system **not neuro-feedback anymore**

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.600
that trains the brain to remain calm and focused

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.640
If a students is weak at Vision, sensory-motor, or Auditory processing,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.200
they would not be able to focus

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.080
therefore when a student has attention issues

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.180
we have to first train the root causes (vision, sensory-motor, auditory).

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.020
then further enhance with Smart Focus.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.320
It is important that a child has a good start in all foundations

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.100
and constantly grow at or above-age in all areas

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.540
The ability to learn and develop all these skills through play

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.460
that is fun, engaging, and constantly changing

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.080
will improve foundation cognitive skills

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.120
and increase processing power within the shortest period of time

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.920
enhancing confidence and social skills.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.300
The end result is a child that is ready for life-long success.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.460
At BrainFit, we are aware of all the details required for success

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.860
Because with the right kind of training,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.640
skils gained will be life-long.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.260
Summer holidays is a great opportunity for enhancing brain fitness.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.740
Let your child join us during the holidays

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.980
to be ready for success in all activities  including schoolwork

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.680
and to have a great start to the year
