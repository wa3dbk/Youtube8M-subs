00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.840
In part 1 of the companion video, I gave a
very simple explanation of Expect, or E-values,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.230
and how they are used.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.030
Here, I’ll answer a few common questions
about E-values that we get at NCBI.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.000
Question #1:
How are scores and E-values related?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.130
In simple terms, the higher the score the
lower the E-value.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.960
This makes sense in light of the simple definition
of E-value, the number of hits you expect

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.190
to see by chance.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.239
It also makes sense if you think of E-values
as a false positive rate.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.120
Take a look at formula #3 in “The Statistics
of Sequence Similarity Scores”, which has

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.879
a link on the BLAST Help page.

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.089
In addtion to defining a normalized, or bit,
score, formula #3 also states that E-values

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.850
are proportional to the product of the query
and database lengths.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.800
The current blast programs subsume this product
in a calculation called the effective search

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.069
space.

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.539
The practical implication is that E-values
cannot be directly compared when searching

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.710
different databases.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.530
Even identical alignments from searches of
different databases will receive different

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.240
E-values; the bit scores, however, will remain
the same.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.200
Quesstion #2:
What is the highest, or poorest, E-value that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.590
I should consider as significant?

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.990
This is one of the most frequently asked questions
about E-values, and the least answerable.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.820
There is no magic cutoff, you will have to
decide what is significant based upon your

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.689
goals and sequences.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.829
Let’s look at a couple examples that may
help clarify this point.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.579
In a typical blastp search with a query of
100 amino acids against a large database like

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.719
refseq_protein, the full-length, 100% identical
alignments might have E-values of 2x10-61

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.079
or lower.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.189
Note that in BLAST we tend to use the notation,
2e-61.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.780
But, what if you search a large database with
an 8 amino acid query?

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.110
The best alignment you can get is 100% identical
over 8 residues, and that is likely to have

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.940
an E-value around 1 or higher.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.069
If what you know, or hypothesize, about that
motif is consistent with the biological function

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.150
of the database sequence, then the alignment
may indicate biological relevance, even though

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.500
such relevance can not be inferred on statistical
grounds alone.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.310
I mentioned in part 1 of the companion video
that at NCBI we use a cutoff of 1x10-6 for

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.709
some internal processes using blastp against
the BLAST nr database, but that may be too

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.879
restrictive for your purposes.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.459
Quesstion #3:
What is an E-value of 0.0?

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:58.310
E-values are written as 0.0 if the calculated
value is less than 1x10-179.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:06.959
