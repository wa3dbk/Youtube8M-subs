00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.259
Utilizing reliable, synthetic insulation,
the Mountain Hardwear Bozeman Flame Sleeping

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.380
Bag is perfect for campers and backpackers
who are looking for a budget friendly sleep-ing

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.650
bag that is cut to be a little bit more roomy
and a little bit longer than your traditional

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.579
mummy sleeping bag.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:24.449
Now this is a mummy style sleeping bag where
you have a traditional hood and it tapers

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.910
down into the foot box.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.970
But, as I said, it is a little bit more roomy.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.869
So there is two sizes with this men’s bag.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.910
There is the regular which fits up to six
feet five inches.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.110
And the girth is all the way up to 63 inches.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.710
The long version of this sleeping bag is all
the way up to seven feet and the girth on

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.000
that is 65 inches.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.740
So, as I said, it is kind of a little bit
more roomy than a traditional sleeping bag.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.290
So if you feel a little bit claustrophobic
in mummy bags, this might be the right bag

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.340
for you.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.890
Going through the features, it is insulated
with synthetic Thermal-Q insulation.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.210
So the great thing about synthetic is that
it is really water resistant, very reliable

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.850
performance there.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.740
And the comfort rating or the temperature
rating for this sleeping bag is right around

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.670
20 degrees.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.890
But the comfort rating is 28 degrees, so take
that into consideration before taking this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.030
bag into the back country.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.440
Starting up here at the hood you have a really
nicely baffled hood.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.979
So you can cinch the top and the bottom part
of the hood down if you need to batten it

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.530
down to stay warm at night.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.710
And that is really easy to use draw cord there
at the top.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.500
You have a full length zipper here and that
goes most of the way down to the bottom of

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
the foot box.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.200
If I peel this back you can see that the foot
box is really nicely baffled.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.740
So when you are in the sleeping bag you have
a lot of room for your feet to move.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.090
The top of the sleeping bag isn’t just sewn
to the bottom.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.149
You do have that box shaping.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.010
If I uncover the bottom of the bag, you can
see that they offset the zipper a little bit

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.349
to be on the bottom.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:25.040
So that is a little bit more thermal efficient
than having the zipper on the side.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.130
Up here at the top there is a Velcro closure.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.290
So if you want to vent the sleeping bag from
the top, but you don’t want to lose the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.680
top of the bag, you can just attach that there
and nicely vent from the top of the bag, or

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.680
you can vent from the bottom, because this
does have a two way zipper.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.590
Behind the zipper there is also a draft tube
so that keeps out unwanted cold air from com-ing

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.590
through the zipper.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.070
And there is a nice durable material sewn
in behind the zipper.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.989
It is an anti snag design there, but also
if the zipper were to get snagged on that

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.160
material, it is more durable than the lighter
weight material used for the bags.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.910
So it is not going to damage the sleeping
bag.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.320
This bag comes with an included stuff sack
and a nice thing about the stuff sack is on

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.230
the inside you have got a really soft fleece
material.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.599
So if you turn this inside out and you put
a couple of layers in there, you can use this

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.599
as a pillow.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.940
But the sleeping bag stuffs down really easily
inside this stuff sack here.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.680
And for a synthetic, 20 degree sleeping bag,
it does stuff down to be pretty small.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.670
All in all, the Bozeman Flame is a really
great budget friendly synthetic sleeping bag

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.489
that is going to give you reliable performance
in the backcountry.
