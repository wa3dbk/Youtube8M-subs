00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.930
Hi, Barry Young here again with part 2 of
the tool bit grinding video.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.400
Now, I didn't explain something in part one.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.510
This is a right hand tool bit.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.000
You can tell because if you look at the business
end the cutting edge is on the right.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.170
This is left hand for exactly the same reason.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.780
If you're looking at the end of it, the business
end, the cutting edge is on the left.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.680
I'm going to show you now how to do a left
hand tool.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.020
We do it in exactly the same way.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.830
Side 1, side 2, and side 3.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.470
Just like we did last time.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:06.850
This one will go a little bit quicker because
you already know so much about doing it.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.260
Again, I'm grinding this way faster than you
would.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.140
Don't forget that.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:27.820
We're going to zoom through it.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:41.909
You can hear it boiling that water.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.469
Ok, that's side 1.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:57.270
Side 2 is going to be the side rake.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.799
Which is exactly like grinding the top rake
on a right hand tool.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:12.650
But we do this first.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.950
I'm actually resting this tool on the tool
rest and just tipping it up.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.590
And many people find that easier.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.030
I don't do that unless I'm trying to really
hurry myself.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.200
But you may find it easier.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.210
Some people do.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.920
Alright, that's side 2.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.310
And it's smoking a little bit still.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.910
That's the side rake.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.240
Now we are going to go on the other side of
the wheel and cut the top rake in exactly

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.100
the same manner.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:08.890
You can just slide it into the wheel and rotate
the cutter to get the rake if you choose to.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.550
Not the way I normally do it, but that's ok.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.260
Here's how I normally hold the cutter.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.370
It seems to work well for me.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.900
You can do whatever works.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:40.230
Grinding this fast makes the tool very hot.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.250
And when we get close we're going to just
grind until we see sparks come off the top

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.490
of the tool, and that means we're there.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.400
Now I would continue grinding this a little
bit.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.980
It's not exactly sharp yet, but you get the
idea.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.600
This is what she looks like.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.820
That's a left hand tool.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:15.640
And I'm going to throw a radius on there really
quick, just as we did with the right hand

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.540
tool.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.709
And there you have it.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.660
If this were high speed steel and we continued
grinding a little bit until the cutting edge

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.360
was truely sharp we would have a wonderful
tool to cut with.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.090
Ok, throw that in your toolbox and you'll
be able to use it for a number of years.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.409
Thank you!
