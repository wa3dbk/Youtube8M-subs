00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.130
RedLynx has some pedigree when it comes to
physics endowed platform-racers, and now the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.430
developer behind the highly addictive Trials
is just as active on iOS as it is on consoles.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.210
The studio's latest touchscreen effort is
MotoHeroz, a minimised version of the well-received

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.740
WiiWare title.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.040
Stripped down and fast-paced, the game offers
bite-sized tracks, hidden treasure, and the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.260
sort of second-shaving gameplay that will
have you howling at your iPhone in rage.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.010
It's tough, gorgeous, will make you hate supernaturally
talented leaderboard-topping strangers, and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.350
is moreish enough to make you forget about
the rest of your life.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.850
Your job is to get a vehicle across an obstacle-strewn
level, leading it through loop-de-loops, over

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.670
enormous jumps, and across hazardous terrain.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.579
On-screen buttons let you control the vehicle's
movement and, more importantly, its balance.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.500
Racing as fast as you can through each of
the tracks will end in tears.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.739
You need to position your monster truck variant
carefully, making sure it's going to land

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.360
on its wheels and moving its weight around
so it doesn't flip.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.030
While crossing the finishing line is sometimes
an achievement in itself, it's not enough

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.310
to earn you progress to the next level.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.270
Every time you race, two ghosts are competing
alongside you, and you going to have to beat

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.250
one of them to complete the level.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.230
The blue ghost represents the time you need
to beat to score a star on the track.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.410
These stars unlock further levels and stages,
and also give you cash to spend on upgrading

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.410
your vehicle.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.210
The red ghost represents your closest human
competitor on the leaderboards.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.670
Beating the blue ghost is the key to moving
forwards in the game, but beating the red

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.460
ghost is the key to chest-beating pride.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.290
Unlocking the next level is a sweet feeling,
but it can't quite beat the sensation of clawing

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.260
your way up the leaderboards.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.230
Power-ups are scattered around the levels,
from speed boosts to sticky wheels and bouncing

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.440
springs, and learning to use them wisely is
vital.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.650
There are treasure chests hidden around each
of the tracks as well, and while they''re

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.880
not essential for completing the game they
will give you extra cash to spend.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.340
At its best, MotoHeroz is a remarkable achievement
in track design and high score-chasing.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.840
At its worst it's a teeth-grindingly difficult
battle against fractions of a second.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.170
The button you're going to end up pressing
the most is the one that restarts the level.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.030
But even when you're being constantly pipped
to the post, even when all hope seems lost

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.010
and your chances of getting that next star
seem impossibly remote, you'll keep trying.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.480
The game almost goads you into it, with its
insidious leaderboards and that hateful red

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480
ghost.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.209
This is a cartoon-infused racer that turns
its most frustrating features into its strongest

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.260
points.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.940
The difficulty curves might be steep, but
the glorious leaps to victory at the end of

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.239
them make it all worthwhile.
