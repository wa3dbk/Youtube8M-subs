00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.179
For many centuries, maps of the southern sky
showed extensive blank areas – the Terra

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.619
Incognita of the heavens.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.980
1595.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:30.009
For the first time, Dutch traders set sail
to the East Indies.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:37.150
At night, navigators Pieter Keyser and Frederik
de Houtman measured the positions of more

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.550
than 130 stars in the southern sky.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:53.530
Soon, celestial globes and maps showed twelve
new constellations, none of which had ever

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.870
been seen before by any European.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.239
The British were the first to construct a
permanent astronomical outpost in the southern

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.100
hemisphere.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.420
The Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good
Hope was founded in 1820.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.890
Not much later, John Herschel built his own
private observatory, close to South Africa’s

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.920
famous Table Mountain.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.460
What a view!

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.640
Dark skies.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.829
Bright clusters and star clouds high overhead.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.970
Little wonder that Harvard, Yale and Leiden
observatories followed suit with their own

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.640
southern stations.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:48.159
But the exploration of the southern sky still
took lots of courage, passion and perseverance.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.570
Until fifty years ago, almost all major telescopes
were located north of the equator.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.939
So why is the southern sky so important?

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.180
First of all, because it was largely uncharted
territory.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.329
You just can’t see the whole sky from Europe.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.810
A prominent example is the centre of the Milky
Way, our home galaxy.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.560
It can hardly be seen from the northern hemisphere,
but from the south, it passes high overhead.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.060
And then there are the Magellanic Clouds – two
small companion galaxies to the Milky Way.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.110
Invisible from the North, but very conspicuous
if you’re south of the equator.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.390
And then finally, European astronomers were
hindered by light pollution and poor weather.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.480
Going south would solve most of their problems.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.700
A scenic boat trip in the Netherlands, June
1953.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.340
It was here, on the IJsselmeer, that the German/American
astronomer Walter Baade and the Dutch astronomer

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.409
Jan Oort told colleagues about their plan
for a European observatory in the southern

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.569
hemisphere.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.390
Individually, no one European country could
compete with the United States.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.170
But together, they might.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.599
Seven months later, twelve astronomers from
six countries gathered here, in the stately

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.549
Senate Room of Leiden University.

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.010
They signed a statement, expressing the desire
to establish a European observatory in South

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.739
Africa.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.390
This paved the way for the birth of ESO.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.400
But hang on!…

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.420
South Africa?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.620
Well, it made sense, of course.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.770
South Africa already had the Cape Observatory,
and, after 1909, the Transvaal Observatory

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.470
in Johannesburg.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.549
Leiden Observatory had its own southern station
in Hartebeespoort.

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:59.550
In 1955, astronomers set up test equipment
to find the best possible spot for a big telescope.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.159
Zeekoegat in the Great Karoo.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.700
Or Tafelkopje, in Bloemfontein.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.530
But the weather was not all that favourable.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.079
Around 1960, the focus shifted to the rugged
landscape of northern Chile.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.480
American astronomers were also planning their
own southern hemisphere observatory here.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.669
Harsh horseback expeditions revealed much
better conditions than in South Africa.

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.909
In 1963, the die was cast.

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.000
Chile it would be.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.760
Six months later, Cerro La Silla was picked
as the future site of the European Southern

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.960
Observatory.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.250
ESO was no longer a distant dream.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:52.409
In the end, five European countries signed
the ESO Convention, on 5 October 1962 — the

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.300
official birthday of the European Southern
Observatory.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.830
Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands
and Sweden were firmly committed to jointly

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.140
reach for the southern stars.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.099
La Silla and its surroundings were bought
from the Chilean government.

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.890
A road was built in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:22.610
ESO’s first telescope took shape, at a steel
company in Rotterdam.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:30.820
And in December 1966, the European Southern
Observatory opened its first eye on the sky.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.400
Europe had embarked on a grand voyage of cosmic
discovery.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400
This is Dr J, signing off from this special
episode of the ESOcast.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.409
Join me again next time for another cosmic
adventure.
