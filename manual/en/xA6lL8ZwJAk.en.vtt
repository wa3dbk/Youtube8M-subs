00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.470
These thoughts are hard as frozen ice.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.170
I just can't come and tell you,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.970
so I just stand here all along.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.270
What does it mean to become an adult?

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.770
I don't understand!

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.270
Please tell me, so I don't have to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.120
pretend to be stronger than this.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.670
I'll become the snow, I'll ride the wind

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.470
And I'll chase after you.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.770
I want to hold your slender arm

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.770
But I just can't tell you, so once again

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.170
I end up alone and wanting to cry.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.870
I know it's pure selfishness,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.670
but please notice it.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.370
I want to fit into your eyes

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.070
and deliver it straight to your chest.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.670
I'll become the snow, I'll ride the wind

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.480
And I'll chase after you.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.780
I want to hold your slender arm

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780
But I just can't tell you, so once again

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.080
I end up alone and wanting to cry.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.970
I want to hold your slender arm

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.970
But I just can't tell you, so once again

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.370
I end up alone and wanting to cry.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.870
I want to hold your slender arm

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.870
But I just can't tell you, so once again

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.270
I end up alone and wanting to cry.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.070
Please melt this ice with your warm breath.
