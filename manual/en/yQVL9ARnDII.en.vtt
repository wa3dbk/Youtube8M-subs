00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.590
Hi! I'd like to demonstrate the magical

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.450
Disappearing Bedside Clock

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.809
app for iOS devices.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.189
Let me start it up...

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.130
As the title suggests,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.880
it's a bedside-clock app that shows
you the current time,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.300
but then the time fades away into darkness, so you don't have a bright light 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.730
shining in your face all night long.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.600
What makes the app magical is: all I
have to do

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.010
is reach out and wave my hand near my
iPhone and the time reappears

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.649
for an adjustable time interval at which
point it again fades into darkness.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.670
I can also touch the screen

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.649
to make the time appear. Or, I can swipe
right and left

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.760
to turn it on and off immediately. If I double tap

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.780
I can put the app into always-on mode
which is indicated

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.460
by the little icon in the lower corner.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.810
I can pan up or down to change the full-on brightness,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.500
and I can double tap again to put it in disappearing mode.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.630
Now if you're like me and wear glasses, what is really nice about this app is:

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.400
I can wake up in the middle of the
night and simply reach out towards my iPhone

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.560
and I can see the big minimal-display
digits

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.359
very easily without my glasses.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.199
0h, I also use Siri to set my alarm.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:47.020
Siri, wake me up tomorrow at 7:30. 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.760
[Siri:Your 7:30 AM alarm is on.]

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.400
Thank you. And thank you for watching this demo.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.259
Again, it's the Disappearing Bedside Clock
app

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.679
available on the App Store.
