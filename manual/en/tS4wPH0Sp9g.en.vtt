00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:14.300
Today we don't start with driving, but with space. 

00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:18.370
Because that is something this Civic Tourer excels at. Space. 

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:26.310
This car has the biggest boot in this class. Bigger than the Golf or Octavia. 

00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:35.795
And look here! Even more space. For big bags even. 

00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:43.886
And if you move this here, you get even more space, for tall plants or so. 

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:59.395
And even more smart stuff: the magic seats. Of course you can fold them like this, as in most cars. Over 1.600 liters then. 

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:15.540
But this trick is something you don't see elsewhere. Fold them upwards. And create this space here. 

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:22.123
You can move in a bike or something. Very handy. 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:32.812
And lets check the space when seated: legroom sufficient, but a little tight at you feet. Headroom is okay.

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:49.757
So we had to wait for a wagon version of this Civic, the aerodeck in de '90 was the last one. 

00:01:51.214 --> 00:01:56.439
Honda used the facelift for that. So this car is a little better than the hatchback, that is facelifted as well, on the road.

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:13.291
They tweaked the suspension a little, the car handles more smooth on bad roads. 

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:31.507
And this Tourer has adaptive damping on the rear axle to cope with extra payload. And you can choose it manually if you want. 

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:47.462
The steering is licht and direct, a nice combination. And the car itselfs remains leven in corners thanks to the good damping. 

00:02:48.002 --> 00:03:00.007
Clutch and gearbox are briljant, as in every other Honda. Short strokes and and light linear clutch. 

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:09.606
The whole combination feels easy. And with that i mean, it feels so effortless, that I wonder why other brands ruin the clutch. 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.412
Like with Opel, who has a very annoying clutch. Why so complicated?

00:03:21.276 --> 00:03:34.022
Only 2 engines: a 1.8 pretrol with 142 PS and this 1.6 diesel with 120 PS. We know it from the CR-V.

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:44.261
Nice engine. A little rough on sound, but is has 300 Nm torque and that is nice a low revs. It pulls nicely. 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.973
And Honda made the diesel cheap, so they say you don't need much millage to choose diesel over petrol. 

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:59.599
Only 12.000 km is enough. A little different from the 25-30 k you often hear. 

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:18.255
So suspeniosn okay, drivetrain is nice and the space is good. So all good? Well, the design is a little, uh, extreme. 

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:25.641
Wheels and colour make a big difference, but still. Short wheelbase, long tail...

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:40.135
And the interior looks very oldfashioned. Big buttons, bad ergonomics. cheap materials. 

00:04:40.135 --> 00:04:46.474
It feels like Honda only cared about the technique, and the looks didn't matter after that. 

00:04:48.145 --> 00:04:53.518
Look at this leather. Looks like te 80's... You see the same in the Honda Jazz.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:05:00.915
So the question is how important is that to you. You want it to be handy everyday, or to look and feel nice aswell.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.022
+ space is briljant, drivetrain nice. - Materials cheap, ergonomics a mess.
