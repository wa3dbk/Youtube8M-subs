MARIEVE HERRINGTON: Alright, so now we're
making the coating for the French toast. So

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:25.220
I'm going to break into that shallow dish
here, four eggs. And

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.991
to the four eggs I'm going to take--you could
really do it--you could do it with half and

00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:36.830
half, you could do it with milk, whatever
you want but I'm doing it with milk today

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:46.649
just because it is a richer bread so I don't
want to just overdo it. So I've added the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.950
cup of milk, now I'm also going to add--some
people like their French toast with ketchup,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.860
they like more savory French toast. When I
heard that, I couldn't believe it 'cause I've

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.379
only ever had a sweet French toast but--so
if you like your French toast with ketchup,

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.420
don't add these two tablespoons of sugar.
But, if you're like me and like it with maple

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.580
syrup, then go ahead and do that. And even
though we've just added some sugar, we're

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:25.280
also going to add a quarter teaspoon of salt.
I'm going to break those yolks up. Now you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:35.310
can really--it's up to you what other flavorings
you want to add. If you wanted to do a cinnamon

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.100
French toast, just go ahead and add a teaspoon
or so with cinnamon to this. If you wanted

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:52.440
to do and get really fancy, you could have
an almond French toast. Put some almond extract

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.730
and then put some on the top. But today were
just doing your standard ones--well with some

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:08.630
really lovely bread. And then, so layer your
brioche right in there. I'm going to need

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.730
a smaller piece here to fit in. And this I'm
going to let soak for--good amount of time

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.050
just because--like I say, it's day old bread
so it's going to absorb it, flip it over and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.170
then we're going to be ready to go and fry
it out.
