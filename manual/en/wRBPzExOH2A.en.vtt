00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:03.667
- Let's get some practice
understanding the variables

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:07.066
and the negative numbers
that they might represent

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.766
or the positive numbers.

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.500
So we're told to order
the following expressions

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.566
by their values from least to greatest.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.200
And they've given us
these three expressions

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.267
q minus n, n, and n minus q

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.534
and then they plot n and
q on the number line.

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:20.467
So just to get our bearings,

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.100
let's see, three hash
marks to the left of zero

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.900
is negative three.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
So each hash mark we must
be going down by one.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.733
So this must be negative
one, negative two,

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.066
and this is negative three.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.600
And then so as we go to the right,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.366
each hash mark must increase by one.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.867
So zero, one, two, and then three.

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:39.933
And then this just helps us
get a little more bearings.

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.633
But let's just think about
each of these expressions.

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.967
So this first one is q minus n.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:47.433
And q is to the right
of n on the number line.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:51.300
We know that q is greater than n.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.367
So if q is greater than n and
you're subtracting n from q

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.629
it actually doesn't matter
if they're both negative

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.900
or both positive or one's
negative and one's positive.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.833
Just the fact that we know
that q is greater than n

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:08.033
that means that q minus n
is going to be positive.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.873
And if you actually want to look at this

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:14.366
particular circumstance, q
is positive, n is negative.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.233
If you subtract a negative,

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:19.433
you're going to
essentially add a positive.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.266
So this value right over here,

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.866
not only is it going to be positive,

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:26.433
it's going to be a positive
value greater than q.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:27.800
And if we had to compare it versus q,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.400
we would know that it's greater than q,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.233
but they don't ask us to do that.

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.033
Now we have n.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:36.800
n is a negative value.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.867
It's a negative number.

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:39.433
And it's a negative number
between negative one

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.233
and negative two.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:44.600
It looks like it's
approximately negative 1.8.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.700
We don't know for sure
but if we just eyeball it,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.300
this thing is negative
and it looks like it's

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.066
approximately negative 1.8.

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.233
Now what's n minus q?

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.466
n minus q?

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:01.400
So it's going to be the
negative of q minus n.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.067
So n minus q, we have the smaller number

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:08.400
and from that we're
subtracting the larger number.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.800
So this thing right over
here is going to be negative.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.769
So the largest of these values
is definitely going to be

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.900
q minus n which is going to be positive.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.400
And then we have to figure
out which is going to be

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.766
more negative.

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:23.300
This n value or this n minus q value?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.766
Well let's think about it a little bit.

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:27.576
We could just try to
approximate what q is.

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:30.281
And if we look at it, q
looks like it's approximately

00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:34.577
this looks like roughly
0.8 and this looks like

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:38.700
it's approximately, we've
already said, negative 1.8.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.400
So if we make those
assumptions right over here

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.633
this thing is going to be

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:46.366
approximately negative 1.8

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:50.633
minus 0.8 which is

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:54.100
equal to negative 2.6.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.733
So when you look at it like
this you clearly see that

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:59.000
this is going to be more negative
than this right over here.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.698
So this is the smallest,

00:03:02.698 --> 00:03:06.933
and this is the largest, or the
greatest I should say maybe.

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.800
Maybe let me call this the least.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.900
That might be better because
sometimes when people say

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.634
small and large they're
referring to absolute value.

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:16.400
But let's say this is the least and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.667
this is the greatest.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.966
So if we wanted to order them

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:26.266
we would go n minus q, and then

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.000
if you're doing this on
Khan Academy exercise,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.700
you can actually click on
these and move them around,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.366
but if we can't, it will be n minus q

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.134
which is the most negative,

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:37.933
then you have n which is still
negative but not as negative.

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:41.700
This is roughly negative 1.8,
this is roughly negative 2.6.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.933
And then q minus n which is going to be

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:49.067
roughly positive 2.6.

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:53.000
So this is the greatest.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.641
And so let's do the next question.

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:02.200
Order the, whoops, order
the following expressions

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.100
by their values from least to greatest.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.467
So once again the kind of
same drill although here

00:04:07.467 --> 00:04:09.066
each hash mark looks like it's a half

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:10.300
because it takes two to get to one,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.766
so this is half.

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:15.100
This is negative 1/2 right over here.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.288
And we want to compare a minus b,

00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:21.876
to a, to a minus 0.5.

00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:23.466
So all of them were either a,

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:27.013
you can even think of
this as a minus zero.

00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:28.931
Right that's the same thing as a.

00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:29.855
So let's see.

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:32.300
In all these we have an a and
we're subtracting something.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.333
Where in here we're subtracting zero.

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.700
I guess we're subtracting nothing.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.100
Here you're subtracting b.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.966
And here you're subtracting 0.5.

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.205
So in general the more you subtract,

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:45.752
the more that you subtract,

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.233
the smaller it's going to be.

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.266
So let's see.

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:52.200
In which of these cases
am I subtracting the most?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.966
Well here I'm subtracting
a positive number.

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:57.033
Here I'm subtracting zero.

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:01.467
Here I am subtracting a
b is a negative number.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.567
Here I am subtracting a negative number.

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:06.266
b is negative.

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:08.400
This is clearly positive.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.900
So if you subtract a
positive number from a,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.233
you're going to get a lower value

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:15.566
than if you subtract a negative number.

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.166
In fact if you subtract a negative number

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:18.533
you're going to add to a.

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:20.500
You're going to get a
number greater than a.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500
So the least is when you
subtract the largest value

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500
or the greatest value.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.900
So a minus 0.5.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.433
We're subtracting a positive number there.

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:32.200
We're subtracting 0.5.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.800
Followed by a where we're
not subtracting anything.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.667
And then you have a minus b.

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:39.433
This right over here is
going to be the greatest.

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:40.400
Why is this?

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.300
Well we know that b is a negative number.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.033
Notice it's below zero right over here so

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:48.667
if b is a negative number, you
subtract a negative number,

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.066
you're actually going
to get a value that is

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.133
greater than a.

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:52.133
Let me make it very clear.

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:55.533
This value right over here
is going to be less than a.

00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.601
This value over here clearly equals a.

00:05:57.601 --> 00:05:59.400
And this value over here
is actually going to be

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.866
greater than a.

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:02.700
So now we've ordered it
from least to greatest.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.567
Once again if we were doing it
on the Khan Academy exercises

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:06.567
we would have a little
tool where we could click

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:07.900
and move these around.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.033
But this is the least followed
by this, followed by that.

00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:13.333
Now another way that you could do it,

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:14.633
just like we did in the last example,

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:18.133
you could try to estimate
roughly what these values are.

00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:20.667
b looks like it's, I don't
know, it's not exactly,

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:23.845
it looks like it's about negative .2,

00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:27.166
so approximately negative 0.2.

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:28.967
Remember this is negative half.

00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:30.809
This is negative .5.

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:34.200
a looks like it is
approximately, I don't know,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.953
negative .7, negative 0.7.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.767
And so you could actually do it

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:45.100
with the actual values if you like,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.089
but you would get the same result.
