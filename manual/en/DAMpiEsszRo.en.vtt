00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
Hi everyone!
Today I'm gonna talk about a battle

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.980
that takes place every year. PES or FIFA? At the same time

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.159
I'll show you demo gameplays.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.679
This 2016

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.959
it will be a hard fight. And I'm
gonna tell you why. Let's start with

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.939
FIFA 16. This FIFA

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.239
innovates across the entire pitch
to deliver a balanced,

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:26.509
authentic, and exciting football experience
that lets you play your way, and compete

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.480
at a higher level.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.050
You'll have Confidence in Defending, take
Control in Midfield,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.870
and you'll produce more Moments of Magic than never before. FIFA 16 - Play Beautiful.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.449
FIFA 16 gives you the tools
to stop your opponent with confidence.

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.190
Move with greater freedom as a
defender - rely on your team to defend

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.740
as a unit, and your back line to track menacing runs,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.230
to create balance between attacking and
defending.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.870
Use 25 innovative feature
changes to mobility and locomotion

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.960
to track skilled players. Mobile

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.770
defenders can close down space and
change direction quickly using

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.079
swing-step behavior

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.770
to stay with your opponent.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.420
You'll feel freedom of movement
as you track runs and look to break up

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.470
attacks.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.350
When you close down an attacker,
rely on your teammates to cover gaps.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.369
New defensive AI gives
players better awareness of dangerous

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.859
space on the pitch
relative to the ball. Your

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.349
teammates will track back to
stop sophisticated attacking runs,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.010
and close down angles of attack.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.070
Get stuck in and win back the ball with

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.159
new tackling mechanics and animations.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.359
All new slide, standing, and fake tackles

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.680
make going in for the ball
responsive, rewarding, and fun!

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.659
Games are won and lost in the
midfield - in FIFA 16,

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.740
the midfiled matters. Stay in
possession with patient build-up play

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.480
or ping clinical passes through
space to start an attack.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.330
Players anticipate passes and
move to shut down options and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.780
close passing channels.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.030
Smarter teammates will look for
space and allow more opportunities

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.800
to build play through
the midfield.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.520
FIFA 16 is a revolution in passing.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.580
It lets you play sharp, incisive passes

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.540
to find teammates with precision.
Using a new mechanic, ping driven

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.649
ground passes to find
teammates in tight spaces.

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.240
Create more WOW moments.
In FIFA 16,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.760
players will have that cutting edge
every team needs

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.629
to create moments of magic
and unlock defenses.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.150
The best touch can be the one you don't
take. With No Touch Dribbling,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.299
you'll buy time, create separation, feint,
and blow by your defender,

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.539
just as Messi does. It's near limitless
creativity on the ball.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.129
"Send that cross in!"

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.170
Authentic crosses let you find
teammates with greater accuracy.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.020
Attacking players make defenses scramble
as crosses are played

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.729
behind the back line with vicious intent.

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:53.679
Strike the ball right and finish
like a pro: better placement of the foot

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:57.310
and ankle gives players variety in
shooting and goals scored.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.810
You'll be able to feel where the ball is struck

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.340
and improve your accuracy and power.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.120
Reach your potential with FIFA Trainer.
Learn as you play with an

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.519
optional graphic overlay that prompts you
with gameplay

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.370
options depending on your position and
trainer level. Basic commands

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.799
get you started, while deeper
hints will improve the game

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.289
of the most skilled players.

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.520
FIFA 16 launches on PC,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.329
Xbox One,

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.549
Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.260

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.499
September 25 in Europe,

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.389
and September 26 in the UK.

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.659
Now let's talk about PES 2016.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.759
Love the past, play the future.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.680
In its 20th anniversary,
Pro Evolution Soccer is back

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.879
with the game engine Fox Engine.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.239
The physicality of the game has been
realised with an imrpoved collision system,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.820
calculating how players interact, creating a unique outcome

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.769
depending on type of impact.

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.960
The new dynamic weather feature

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.630
will see the chance of weather changing during
the match and improved weather effects.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.669
Goal Keeper ID System adds
personality to each keeper

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.039
and introduces all new parameters: catching,
clearance, collapsing and deflecting.

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.849
Master League has been revamped,
it's undergone a complete overhaul and

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.219
introduces a new player transfer system.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.850
And for the first time in

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.010
the series, PES 2016 will include a dynamic camera, which will zoom and tilt

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.479
depending on the ball position.

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.279
Players now have full control over
goal celebrations!

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:31.729

or unique actions

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.289
with a press of a button!

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.219
Thanks to player feedback,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.440
perfect team kit replications and even managers!

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.139

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:58.900
based on your team aims.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.699
Building your Team and creating your legacy
will be even more engaging this time around!

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.809
With the new physicality system,
aerial battles are a

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:11.530
unique experience this year: use the left
stick to battle the opposition, to disrupt

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.180
a larger more powerful player, or
find the best position to make the header/volley.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.420
The 1v1 player control have been enhanced,
offering a wide

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.750
range of movements
with the existent

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.870
controls. Response times have been improved
allowing players to

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.430
manoeuvre in tight situations,
which benefits the upgraded feint

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.779
moves that allow sudden directional change.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.490
PES 2016 will launch on PC, PS4, PS3,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.510
Xbox One, and Xbox 360.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.350

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.220

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.629
