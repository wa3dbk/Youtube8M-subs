MICHAEL PLUNKETT: Hello. This is Michael Plunkett
on behalf of Expert Village. The next topic,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.940
we're going to look out for guitar tab reading
is what we call the "bend." This is where

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.290
we literally take one of our guitar strings
and we bend it from where the fret that it's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.880
at. We bend it up to get to hit a different
note. And so, you'll see it commonly, it's

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
written something along the lines of this.
You'll have a note or a fret, in this case

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.320
the 11th fret, a little lowercase B, telling
us to bend to the 12th fret. Now, what that

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.780
means is we're going to take our string. We
never actually leave the 11th fret but we

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.800
bend it up until it sounds like we're playing
at the 12th fret. So, for instance, if I'm

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.670
here at the 11th fret, I want the sound of
playing here, that's my 12th fret, and so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.840
I bend this until I get to this pitch and
I literally bend the string up. You can also

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.510
bend it--commonly only see bending up towards
one or two frets above the pitch that you're

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.110
at. In this case, I'm bending up towards 13.
So, here's my pitch at 11, and I wanted to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.950
sound like 13. So, it's a pretty far bend.
You can hear it though. You can hear that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.280
same pitch. So, we have to bend pretty far
up. For the most part you really just push

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.330
on the string. It takes a little bit of ear
training but you can really--you can hear

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.320
when it matches. A lot of the times you want
to check the note that you're reaching for

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.170
and see if you can hit that note. You'll also
sometimes see this kind of case. Where I see

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.650
11, I bend up to 12 but then I bend back to
11. So, it's saying I'm going to start with

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.820
this note, I'm going to bend up to this note,
and then bend back again to 11. So, it'll

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.772
look something like this. I actually bend
back down with it and I end where I started.

00:01:49.772 --> 00:01:58.510
We want this sound so we take our 11, we bend
it up to get that sound. In this case, we

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:07.540
have 11, we want the sound of this fret, the
13th fret, so we take our 11 and we literally

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.469
bend it up 'til we get that same sound. You
can also bend it up and back again to have

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:24.450
a sound that resembles this, 11, 12, 11, so
we do this. Bend up and back again, and we

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.900
end where we started in that case. So, those
are three common types of way you'll see bending

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.540
written in guitar tablature.
