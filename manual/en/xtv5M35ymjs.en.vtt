00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, what's your name?


00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm is Bell Nuntrita

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
What are you going to show us today?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.500
I'm going to sing two songs which i've remixed them myself.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's do it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.500
Just being close to you,
sharing the air with you.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.800
Even if we're just friends,
still, it's too hard to resist.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.700
There's always a question in my mind. I want to know your feelings.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I just can't tell you how much I love you.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.400
(Change Song)

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.010
I know I'm just no one.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.910
I know it can't be possible.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.410
There's no hope for me,
no matter what.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.510
Since you has nothing to do with me.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.010
No matter how hard I've tried, you wouldn't love me.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.810
And soon,
all my hopes will be faded away.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:46.410
Even if i love you this much, it's just meaningless to you.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.810
I'd just been hoping too much that someday you'd love me, too.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.410
Despite the fact, it's impossible. And i'm not the one for you.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:08.410
It's still okay. Let me just keep you in my heart till the times ends.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.620
Don't know how long will it take for me to erase you from my mind.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.720
Don't know when i will be able to love again.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.820
I love her already.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.720
You deceived me ever since our first met.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.320
It's impossible.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.120
- Isn't she pretty?
- She is.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.120
I have to say you really nailed it.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.020
But then the song was changed, I was like, stunned. We all were.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.720
What do you say?

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.420
- I actually sensed something.
- What was it?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.230
I knew that she's not what she looked like.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.030
But when she started singing, I thought I had lost my senses.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.330
Then she changed her voice.
So, I can count on my senses again.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.030
Anyway, I must say it was really good.
Let's see what'd the judges say.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.030
Miss Nuntita, I said it's impossible.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.230
It is possible now, I vote YES.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.430
Thank you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.830
- YES from me, too.
- Thank you

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.830
Just keep deceiving, please. You've just got 3 YES.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.230
Thank you

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.840
I'm upset now.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.640
Those guys have know me for 10 years.
They've never hugged me a bit.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.740
They'd always made fun of me. Called me FAG, DRAG QUEEN.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.740
But what could i possibly do?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.640
And my dad had never accepted for what i am.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.640
The worst, he once beat me badly.
He beat me hoping I'd quit being a transsexual.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.640
I want to tell my dad that...

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.440
I love you, and i finally made it now.
