00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.440
Through the ever changing seasons

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.520
Crossing over sea and sky

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.320
The wind embraces everything

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.200
Knocking on spring’s door

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.680
As the snow begins to melt, let us sing a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.480
Gentle melody and dance a waltz of flowers

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.600
Feeling the coming of spring, flowers of all colors blossom

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.140
Soaking in the deep clear blues, praying these peaceful days continue

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.220
With faintly colored emotions

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.060
Hearts dance, smiles overflow

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.680
As a gentle breeze rustles through the trees

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.000
The little birds sing their melodies

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.740
As small buds open from their deep deep sleep

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.180
I bring you happiness, swaying in the March winds

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.560
Feeling the coming of spring, flowers of all colors blossom

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.800
Soaking in the deep clear blues, praying these peaceful days continue

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.600
Soft and dreamlike ecstasy

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.520
Into a utopia filled with light

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.980
I’ll always be right here

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.620
So please don’t ever forget

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.780
As a gentle breeze rustles through the trees

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.400
The little birds sing their melodies

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.560
As small buds open from their deep deep sleep

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.120
I bring you happiness, swaying in the March winds

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.720
Feeling the coming of spring, flowers of all colors blossom

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.040
Soaking in the deep clear blues, praying these peaceful days continue
