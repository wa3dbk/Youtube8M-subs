00:00:00.722 --> 00:00:01.939
- For most professions,

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:03.757
having a good resume or cover letter

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:05.906
is the most important
factor in getting a job.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:10.851
For animators, though, it's
all about the demo reel.

00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:13.618
Over the years, I have made
many demo reels for myself

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:15.794
and watched dozens of
other people's reels.

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:17.666
In this video, I have
collected all the information

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.490
I have learned about how to
make an effective demo reel

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.410
that actually gets you hired.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.562
Here are the guidelines of
what I found to be the rules

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:26.450
for an effective demo reel.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.450
The length of your reel should
not be over two minutes.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.370
Ideally, it would be under one minute,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.794
unless you're a veteran animator,

00:00:32.794 --> 00:00:33.627
which in this case,

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.682
you don't really need to
watch this video anyway.

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:36.754
I mean, if you think about it,

00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:38.722
it doesn't make sense
that a beginner animator

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.866
would have more than two minutes
worth of amazing content.

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.066
And that's what we're looking for.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.675
Amazing animation.

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.861
I cannot over-emphasize this.

00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:50.018
The reel should only include awesome work.

00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:52.514
A 30 seconds reel of amazing animation

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:56.130
is much preferable to a two
minutes reel with mediocre work.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.530
Don't include anything that
is less than amazing work

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.882
as a time filler.

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:01.050
If you're not convinced that a piece

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.754
is worth putting in your reel,

00:01:02.754 --> 00:01:04.634
either polish it or don't use it.

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:06.202
Regarding the content of the shots,

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.170
try being original as much as you can.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.850
Don't do the stuff that everybody does.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.907
Lifting something heavy,
walk cycle, bouncing ball.

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:15.098
Try putting your
personality into the shots.

00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:16.418
Try standing out.

00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:17.251
For example,

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.829
for my reel, I wanted to
add a diving board shot.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.034
But instead of a guy jumping,

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:22.875
I made him slip and fall down.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:26.930
That way I added my own
little twist to the shot.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.490
Put first best work first.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.754
It takes people a few seconds to decide

00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:31.522
if they want to keep watching your reel.

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:35.022
So make sure you have things
that grab their attention.

00:01:35.022 --> 00:01:36.414
If you have dialogue pieces,

00:01:36.414 --> 00:01:37.974
include the original sound.

00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:40.975
A quiet, unintrusive music
in the background is okay,

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:43.006
but be careful with the choice of music.

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.334
It should not distract
the viewer or annoy them,

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.934
but only act as a connector
between the shots.

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:52.078
If in doubt, just turn
off the music completely.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.382
Give every piece the time is deserves.

00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:57.174
Don't edit to music, or get too creative.

00:01:57.174 --> 00:01:58.719
This isn't a motion graphics reel.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:59.790
In an animation reel,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.238
you want to present each shot separately.

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:04.614
Sometimes even with a
title card before each shot

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:07.094
so you can let the viewer
understand what they're watching

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:08.752
without confusing them.

00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:10.630
Don't forget to number
the shots in the reel

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.206
and then write about each
shot in the description

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:13.289
of the video.

00:02:14.838 --> 00:02:15.902
After finishing your reel,

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.311
you might ask yourself,

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.702
where should I upload it to?

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:19.974
You have two main choices.

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:21.567
Youtube or Vimeo.

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:23.030
Both valid options

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.678
but they have advantages
and disadvantages.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.390
Youtube has much more viewers,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.662
which means your reel
would have more exposure.

00:02:29.662 --> 00:02:31.359
But it's considered less professional.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.158
Vimeo has less viewers,

00:02:33.158 --> 00:02:34.558
but it's got one great feature.

00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:37.286
You can replace the
video under the same URL,

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:39.750
which means that when
you update your reel,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.590
you can replace the video
and the link to your reel

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.750
with always have the latest version.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.126
That's pretty huge.

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:47.070
That's why my verdict is Vimeo.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.310
It's considered to be the Youtube

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.950
for artists, filmmakers,
and professionals.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.937
And the fact that you can
always update your reel

00:02:52.937 --> 00:02:55.630
without changing the
URL is really important.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.774
Think about a person who
wants to check out your reel

00:02:57.774 --> 00:02:59.830
a year after you send it to him.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.190
If you have used Youtube,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.294
that really would not be relevant anymore.

00:03:03.294 --> 00:03:04.926
Sure, Vimeo is less exposed,

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:06.134
but that doesn't really matter

00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:08.038
since the people who are
going to view your reel

00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:10.358
would most likely be people
you've sent it to them,

00:03:10.358 --> 00:03:14.094
and not some stranger
who happened to find it.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.742
If you're in that place where
you're looking for ideas

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:17.046
for your reel,

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:19.710
here are some suggestions
for animation exercises.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.110
Flower sack animation,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.934
dog walk or run cycle,

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:26.350
a man juggles, throwing
knives on a board, or darts,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.999
man hits a ball with a bat,

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.615
although it's a bit of a cliche,

00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:32.134
someone chews food and
then likes it or hates it,

00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:34.310
a sword fight, kung-fu fight,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.526
man on a pogo stick,

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:37.094
diver on a diving board,

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:39.870
a character's expression as
it gets bad or good news,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.846
laughter,

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.246
some dialogue piece,

00:03:42.246 --> 00:03:44.145
under water, a man or a fish,

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:46.056
transition between walk and run,

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:47.720
a bird flying.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.848
Once your reel is done,

00:03:48.848 --> 00:03:50.273
don't forget to check out this video

00:03:50.273 --> 00:03:52.465
on how to light and render
your animation shots

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:53.961
in a very basic way

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:55.384
so that you'll have something nicer

00:03:55.384 --> 00:03:57.232
than a collection of play blasts.

00:03:57.232 --> 00:03:59.457
