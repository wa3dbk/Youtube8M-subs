00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.940
When I'm playing Assassin's Creed or Call
of Duty, my brain is totally absorbed in this

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.040
virtual environment.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:16.500
But what happens to my brain when I come out
of it?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.920
Is it different?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.679
This WEEK, we humans will spend 3 billion
hours playing video games; 1.2 billion people

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.260
play regularly...

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.671
99 percent of boys and 94 percent of girls
under 18 lock their eyeballs on a video game

00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:36.090
quote "regularly" according to game designer
and author Jane McGonigal.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.420
That's an incredible amount of time living
in what amounts to an alternate reality for

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.420
the brain.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.690
A study from the Proceedings of the Royal
Society B that came out last December (I think

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.690
it just came out in the journal - maybe the
study was conducted last December?) , looked

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.699
at the brains of gamers while playing and
offer another alleged turn in the thumbscrews

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.059
of action games…

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.540
Their study found that video game players
have a less robust striatum nucleus -- the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.879
part of the brain that constructs an internal
representation of the outside world.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.280
Essentially, games aren't helping people learn
to map the real world, at least according

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280
to this study.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.040
Action gamers are using something called "response
learning" instead of the more advanced "place

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040
learning."

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.070
To simplify, imagine you're trying to get
to a familiar place like a friend's house

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.670
or your favorite restaurant: "response learning"
is when your brain creates a map using landmarks;

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.549
but "place learning" is an advanced internal
map so you know to turn based on distance

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.109
and direction -- it's the difference between
associating lots of little bits of information

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.000
… "I have to turn when I see the gas station"
as opposed to combining that information into

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.140
an understanding of the external world.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.369
These researchers think the action video game
players are under-developing their striatum

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.030
to such a degree that it might affect them
throughout their lives; they may even develop

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.830
a neurological disorder!

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.680
Some news outlets have called this a risk
of Alzheimers, but that's a pretty damn big

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.680
jump.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.250
Here’s the thing: for every study of games
negatively affecting our brains there are

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.510
plenty of studies saying the opposite.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.119
A study in July of last year in Molecular
Psychiatry put gamers into magnetic resonance

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.870
imagers to reveal how grey matter was developing
in their cabezas.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.869
They found a correlation in the size of the
entorhinal cortex, and left occipital cortex/inferior

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.300
parietal lobes related to their 'joystick
years' or the amount of time they played certain

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.580
video games.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.830
According to their results, people who played
more logic, puzzle, and platform games had

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.720
a larger entorhinal cortex, but action-based
role-playing games had a smaller one.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.410
The entorhinal cortex works with the hippocampus
to create memories and maps of your life -- so

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.470
you know when and where something happened
as well as how it fits in with what happened

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.000
the day before, or last time you met that
person.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.850
Another study in that journal from February
of the same year found similar results using

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.780
games like Commander Keen and Super Mario
64.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.330
Science is saying, platformers and logic games
are great for the entorhinal cortex, even

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.790
while action-based games aren't.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.820
That being said, however, the hippocampus
and grey matter in ALL video game players

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.670
had added plasticity overall!

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.360
Plasticity is the ability for the brain to
adapt and change neural pathways.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.050
More plasticity is better!

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.350
And it's not just the plasticity, a study
done with chimpanzees published in Science

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.570
News last month assessed how chimps brains
responded to video games.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.850
After teaching them to play a cooperative
game, the researchers found cells in the chimp's

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.700
brains predicted what the next move of the
OTHER chimp 79.4 percent of the time!

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.730
These chimps understood what was going on
in the brains of their co-op players.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.500
We KNOW video games change how our brain works,
but whether that's a good or bad thing seems

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.610
to change as new research comes out…

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.060
We cover this research all the time.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.070
For instance, do videogames make you more
aggressive?

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.550
Joe Bereta explores that idea in this episode
