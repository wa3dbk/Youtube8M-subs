00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.440
At the end of 2010, we secretly started the project.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.100
In 2013 we were able to show something to the world.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.200
In 2014 we prepared everything to be ready for production.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.540
And that's what we're presenting now, at the end of the year.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.700
The sound isn't the issue.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.620
The guys at Vencer have worked very hard at it.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.060
It needs to sound strong to at least appear like it's just that.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.080
It's wet, so you need to pay attention.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.380
This particular car is sold to a gentleman in China.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.220
And it's not the intention that he gets the car in pieces.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.200
No, the entire car soon needs to leave for Shanghai.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.340
So I was kindly requested to keep it in one piece.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.300
In the back, right in the middle, an LS V8 by General Motors that's been modified.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.200
An Eaton Compressor was added, with quite a bit of capacity. 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.740
Per revolution it pumps two liters of air towards the 6.3 litres of displacement.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.280
The normal diplacement of the GM engine is 6.1, but it was bored out by Vencer.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:50.000
So it's now got a bigger displacement and in the end that's good for 622 horsepower and 838 Nm.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.580
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a LOT. 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.280
That power is connected to a gearbox with very, very long gears.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.940
Look, for all this time, I've just been using one gear.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.560
And it just keeps on going and going. It has so much low-end torque, so much power.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.840
There's no need to change down.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.200
You can just leave it in a high gear, push the pedal down and just keep going and going.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.740
And eventually, when you keep pushing in sixth gear, you'll reach speeds of at least 338 km/h.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.860
That's what they've calculated, that's the speed is should reach.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.420
The base of the Sarthe is a steel frame.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.680
Attached to that are the carbon bodypanels.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.940
So the car is made out of carbon. Even the dashboard.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.520
You only see leather, but behind it, everything is made out of carbon.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.160
Lots of carbon parts.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.860
But the structure is, well, it's a hybrid structure, made out of different materials.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.360
It's not a carbon monocoque, like a Pagani for example.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.780
The car weighs over 1400 kilograms, but of course that's not a lot for a car that has 620 horsepower.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.980
A gearbox like this that demands a strong hand, no automatic gearbox, no paddles behind the wheel...

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.060
you need to change gear, and clutch yourself. Actually it might be more fun.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.740
Especially because a lot of manufacturers don't sell a car with a real manual anymore.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.460
It's very difficult for a manufacturer that only builds a couple of cars a year...

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.060
and a couple means around twelve cars, when production is at maximum capacity in Vriezenveen. 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.120
One a month.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.140
A manufacturer like that isn't able to put a stability management program in the car.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.160
ABS is do-able, but still a tough task. This car doesn't have it for example.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.660
Some things just can't be implemented in the car as a manufacturer.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.900
It depends on certain certifications, but also costs.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.240
What is easier, as a manufacturer, that if you don't have systems like that...

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.400
to then change the design and philosophy of the car accordingly. 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.320
They did exactly the same thing at Noble.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.780
"It's an 'analog' car, because we don't have this, this, and that."

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.900
No, that's right, you don't have this, this and that, because it's too expensive. 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.800
But that doens't really matter, it also makes the car unique.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.340
A Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche too these days, almost always have an automatic gearbox.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:34.186
They're cars that have a lot of different settings you can change.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.360
Cars that are very good, sometimes a bit more comfortable, but sporty when you want to.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.480
This car has no settings. There's nothing to choose from.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.620
But if you start to disect all the things of the car, the feeling in the pedals, the engine characteristics...

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.400
how it builds and drops revs, how the chassis behaves, the steering. Everything is well-thought-out.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.200
The steering is nice, honest, clear and also precise. 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.540
The only thing that doens't really fit is the feeling when you're braking.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.400
The lack of power brakes, it just doesn't feel right. 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.240
Because of that, the car falls between two stools.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.900
On the one hand it's a super sporty car. Mid-engined, with a good balance and a good weight distribution...

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.520
no power brakes, lots of power. On the other hand it's also a bit of a GT.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.640
Because of the incredible amount of torque, because of the quite comfortable damper settings...

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.000
and the very long gears, it's a car that you can easily take on a very long trip, without it being very tiring.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.480
So, one the one hand a GT and on the other it's almost a hypercar.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.360
For a price of 265.000 euros, before taxes.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.920
Is it a desirable car, the Vencer Sarthe?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.020
I think so. The design takes some getting used to. The design is a bit 90s, a bit Noble M600, a bit edgy.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:20.400
It almost has the looks of a classic sportscar, but it's also timeless. Is it a one day fly, Vencer?

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.460
I don't know. I think it's a difficult question to answer. I sure hope not. 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.320
I think that if you're a motoring enthousiast, especially in The Netherlands...

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.860
that the brand Vencer exists. We still have Spyker, but what's really left of that?

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.200
I just think that the guys at Vencer should have approached things a bit differently. 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.060
Like Pagani did with the Zonda and Koenigsegg too.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.700
You start with one model and after that you bring out an 'evolution' of that model. 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.420
So you start with 500 horsepower. After that 550. 600. And it goes on from there.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.540
Maybe you release an 'R' version, after that an 'RS'.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.200
In short: you can build just one car as a manufacturer, and you let that car evolve.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.040
Vencer started off with a version with over 600 horsepower. 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.160
The policy at Vencer, they've built a Sarthe and that car will be improved on tiny details.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.400
It's a bit like the iPhone philosophy. 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.920
Time will tell if that's the best policy.
