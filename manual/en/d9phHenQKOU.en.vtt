00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.950
What's up, guys?

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.950
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.639
We're going to bring you another ATHLEAN XPRESS
Tip here.

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.960
This time, to get you doing your leg workouts
better.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.189
What I mean by better, guys, is that in order
to have an effective leg workout, you have

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.880
to get into the range of motion required by
the exercises you're doing.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.680
So, whether you're doing a Squat and you have
to get down to parallel, or whether you're

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.680
doing Lunges and

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.910
you need to be able to keep your trunk upright
while you get full mobility through your hip,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.910
the idea is,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.870
guys, sometimes you're being restricted because
you're not accurately preparing your body

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.780
to do that stuff.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.300
What I want you to do is something really
quick and easy, actually two little drills.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.250
And I'll show you two ways to do it.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.670
We take this right from our Major League Baseball
warm ups, guys.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.780
And what we do is set something up at hip
height so we can do something called a Hurdle

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.780
Under.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.300
Alright, basically, all you're doing is, here
I've got a super machine, and I'll show you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.760
something to do without any equipment at all,
really.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.760
And you set up.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.200
And you go down.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.030
You get a nice groin stretch on the left side.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.670
You sink all the way down and try to keep
your head straight up as you slide under the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.670
bar.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.170
Here we've got a really low sumo squat position.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.200
Good mobility of the hips.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.979
Slide across until the right groin is stretched,
and come up and out of it.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.399
We come back down again.

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.399
Reach.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.990
Right groin gets the stretch.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.079
Sit into it.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.890
Again, nice and low.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.290
And then slide across.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.670
You work on that back and forth.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.619
You might be saying, But Jeff, what if I don't
have something like that?

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.929
You know that I got you hooked up, guys, and
you don't need that.

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.179
How about a foam roller or something a little
brother, that you can tell him to sit here

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.319
and stand for a minute.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.200
Basically, you work the same way, use it as
a visual.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.329
I stand in front of it.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.899
I want to reach my foot out, sink down until
my head is right at the top of that Foam Roller.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.689
I slide across, and I come out.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.689
Again, down.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.689
Slide.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:53.689
And come out.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.240
Already my hips are feeling much looser than
even on the first rep.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.750
To work the other aspect of it is some dynamic
flexibility of the hamstrings.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.799
We use this as our Hurdle Over.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.280
Kick out, and over.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.640
Got that nice circular motion of the hip as
well.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.850
And we try to do this without kicking the
Foam Roller over.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.850
Alright.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.510
So, there you go guys.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.020
Work about 20 reps of that.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.489
The key is, if you want to do your leg workouts
properly, you want to make sure that you're

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.489
mobilized.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.730
And it takes just a couple minutes to do it,
but you got to make sure you're working on

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.730
the right movements.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.400
These are the things you want to start doing,
guys.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.630
This is what athletes do.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.239
And as I say all the time, if you want to
look like an athlete, you got to train like

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.239
an athlete.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.239
And here's the best part.

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.920
When you do, you see results faster and better
because you're training your body the way

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.620
it's meant to be trained.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.190
You guys can start doing that at ATHLEANX.COM
right now by getting our 90-Day Training Program.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.250
In the meantime, let me know if you liked
