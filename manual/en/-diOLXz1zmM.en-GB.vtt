Heather: Hey guys! This is Heather from healthyeatingstartshere.com.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.070
So today we are going to talk about foods
to help gain weight which, I know, is going

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.340
to sound really weird to some of you who are
trying to lose weight but I get a lot of questions

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.780
from people who are trying to either gain
or maintain weight on a plant-based diet.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.900
Now the reason this is so difficult is because
when you get into eating healthy whole plant-based

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.650
foods, they have a lot of water and they have
a lot of fiber which decreases their calorie

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.449
density. Calorie density is when you look
at the amount of calories for a given volume

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:52.039
of food. So whole plant foods are very low
calorie density. They have not very many calories

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.870
but they fill up your stomach really easily.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.329
So for those people who need to increase their
calories, it can be difficult. For people

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.010
who want to lose weight, it makes it a lot
easier for you. And you can take the tips

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.390
that I am going to talk about today and reverse
them if you want to look at losing weight.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.460
Now of course, when I look at foods to help
gain weight, I am looking at healthy foods

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.860
because there are ton of foods that are really
calorie dense but you want to look at gaining

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.960
healthy weight not gaining fat.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.240
Now before I get into talking about these
foods, I just want to make one thing really-really

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.310
clear, if you are looking to gain muscle,
you cannot eat your way to muscle. The way

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.020
you gain muscle is by doing strength training
and what you eat can support your muscle growth

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.030
but that's not how you grow muscle.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.660
So getting into the actual foods. Foods that
are high in fat are calorie dense because

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:58.080
fat has nine calorie per gram whereas carbohydrates
and proteins have four calorie per gram. So

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.570
healthy foods that are high in fat; nut, seeds,
avocados. You are looking to gain weight,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.771
eat more of those. You can have them whole.
You can have them as nut butters. You can

00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:14.560
puree your avocado into a dip. Try all kinds
of things with them but those are good foods

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.580
for gaining weight.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.890
Then you can look at changing the structure
of your food. So you can puree your foods.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.950
That helps to condense them. It helps to break
down the fiber so you can fit more into your

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.600
stomach. So if you are looking at fruit, you
can make a smoothie, you can add some greens

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.980
to it especially if you finding that you want
to eat more greens but you don't have enough

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.770
room in your stomach for all that salad, puree
it and you can drink it. It will fit a lot

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.160
more in.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.440
Then you can look at baking and dehydrating
foods that evaporate some of the water and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.270
so more of the food that has the calories
will fit into your stomach. Things like dried

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.730
fruits, vegetables, dehydrated vegetable crackers,
and then you can also look at making healthy

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.730
baked goods.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.530
Now I am not talking about going to the bakery
and getting muffins because those have unhealthy

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.900
calories from refined sugar, refined flour,
refined oils and fats. But if you make your

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.620
own at home with whole grain flours, whole
food fats, like the nuts or seed butters,

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.480
and healthy wholesome sweeteners like apple
sauce, pureed bananas, stuff like that, you

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.680
can make your own healthy cookies and muffins
at home that will have higher calorie density.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.120
Another food you can look at to help gain
weight is protein powder. Now it's not necessary

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.680
for getting the amino acids on plan-based
diet, that's not what I am saying. What I

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.390
am saying that it's a concentrated source
of calories and it's a concentrated source

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.599
of protein.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:03.239
For people who are exercising regularly and
exercising very intensely, their body might

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:11.879
need more grams of protein than someone just
living your average lifestyle. So what you

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.930
can do is get protein powders to help increase
the percentage of protein in your diet and

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.169
also to get some dense calorie.

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.260
Alright. So those are the few ideas for foods
to help gain weight and as I said, if you

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.100
are looking to lose weight, you can do the
opposite of those and you can find lots more

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:38.180
information about that on my site at healthyeatingstartshere.com.
So that's it from me today. I will see you

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.770
guys next time.
