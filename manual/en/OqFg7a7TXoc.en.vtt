00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:10.736
This is a short compilation from the first test runs. 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.600
The jet engine should run with propane and gets started with an electric motor or compressed air (we tried both).

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.360
Unfortunately it is not self-sustain, but sometimes it doesn't look so bad, but this you can watch now.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.560
To improve it we have now two approaches. 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.280
The first one is the diffuser, which you see here now. There we have to change the angles.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.800
Also we have to add a Stator between Combustion Chamber and the Turbine wheel. 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.280
Then we will try it again.
