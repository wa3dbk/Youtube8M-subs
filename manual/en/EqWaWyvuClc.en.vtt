00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.409
Suck on a fish head lollipop

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:07.830
and chew bubble gum shaped like butt cheeks.
It's episode 24

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.050
of LÜT.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.910
Vat19's chameleon lamp detects
the color of the surface

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.100
it's on and glows that color.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.100
You can also turn your iPhone into a
laser pointer with an app

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.390
and a smart dot that plugs right into
the headphone jack.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.269
But what has even more energy than a laser?
That's right,

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.120
Vsauce t-shirts.
The official team jerseys

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.800
of Wesaucers everywhere, for boys and girls.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.079
We just launched this store.
If you get one and where it to VidCon,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.500
reward yourself with cookies cut into
Pacman shapes

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.520
or just march the shapes down Abbey Road.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.199
Busted Tees has more apparel designs.
You can twist nerdy

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.640
brains with "Similes are like metaphors,"

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.190
or my favorite, Helvetiva written in Comic

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.420
Sans.
Or the first true

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.200
digital cowboy.
Busted Tees also offers

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.970
bookends? Well, this one makes it look like
your books are about to squish a guy.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.000
Knob Creek Metal Arts makes even more.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.729
Chainsaws, giraffes, mermaids,

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.960
abductions and more.
Butt

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.540
magnets, animal butt magnets.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.619
Are you trying to carry stuff more often?

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.750
Well, TheCheeky brings you glasses you can't set

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.729
down. They have no flat bottom,
so they'll spill if you try to put them down.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.119
Now, this amazingly intricate chocolate
temple is even more

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.619
intricately wrapped in silver foil.
But here's an even better idea.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.750
Make hard things soft.
These pillows

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.860
photo realistically reproduce
textures like plywood and concrete, but if

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.799
you prefer

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.020
be musical with boombox pillows

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.400
and keep it cute with glasses that give you anime eyes.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.620
Of course, these glasses make it look
like someone's got their

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.829
hands over your eyes, but I prefer to shade

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.060
my sight with a country.
The USA.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.200
Now, you don't really need glasses when it's rainy,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.580
but how will you write on paper?
Easy, with write in the rain - special

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.810
waterproof paper

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.989
that a pencil will always write on,
especially if you sharpen it inside the nostril

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.239
of a nose pencil sharpener.
When the Sun comes back out,

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.069
this iPad case will charge the iPad in
it using solar power.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.129
But even without the Sun,
sprout bookmarks make it look like

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.400
life and leaves are springing from your novels.
Novels you store on

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.150
invisible shelves.
The special peace holds 15 pounds of book,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.379
but hides inside the bottom book,
so they appear to float

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.170
in the air. Now, back to leaves.
If you get leaves like spinach and other junk stuck in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.310
your teeth after eating,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.590
fear no more with a mirror in a plate.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.209
Once you're done eating you reveal
a mirror to check your teeth.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.230
You can look beyond your own face and into space

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.560
with ThinkGeek's space-y serving bowls - the Moon,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.890
the Sun and Earth.
For the kids or yourself,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.330
I like this landscape dinner set.
A Sun cup,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.599
a house plate, evergreen utensils and a cloud bowl.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.940
Now, if the food on the plate is bland,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.170
season it with salt and pepper from
shakers shaped like

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.599
Fred and Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby,
Kermit and Miss Piggy

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.000
or fozzie bear and a banana peel.
You can precisely

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.900
warm your now seasoned dishes in the
oven with this magnetic

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.409
timer that makes your fridge look like a safe.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.890
Or just use a watch that is a giant

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.220
10-key number pad. ThinkGeek also offers
a chocolate-scented t-shirt featuring

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.349
a chocolate molecule from Theobroma cacao.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.409
Even sweeter is upgrading your unsightly mudflap girls

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.749
with these smart mudflaps girls.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.239
Now jam to some tunes played out of your Marshall

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.629
amp.
Just kidding, it's a mini fridge full of

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.960
beers you can open with the jaws of a brain-hungry

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.160
zombie. If zombies scare you,
try using a night light shaped like a creature

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.340
trying to

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.440
unplug itself.
Or, light your way with this

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.400
USB powered lamp that looks like a cup
of melty chocolate

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.400
pouring all over.
But if you need more USB ports,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.830
Fred Flare offers this cute little poodle USB

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.290
hub.
You can turn any photo into a hip retro

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.590
polaroid with these polar frames.
And stop flicking your wrist

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.610
to tell the time with this watch.
It's tilted 55 degrees,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.639
so it lines up with the natural way you
hold your arms

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.990
in front of you.
Now, earlier this week I was in Munich

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.550
at Frühlingsfest where I successfully saw
historical things,

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.770
ferris wheel things, ate a half meter long sausage

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.150
and met Bernd das Brot.
I got water on my glasses, because it hailed.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.460
I did get a giant pretzel...
And as always,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.760
thanks for watching.
