00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.760
I’m in. Locating security panel controls!

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.340
Reversing the polarity of the neutron flow.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.350
Disengaging the Hostile Action Displacement
System

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.230
Neutralising Siege Mode protocols, quantum
locking the under floor lava pool.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.660
And finally, turning on lights to scare off
the Vashta Nerada!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.170
We’re in. This is Steven Moffat’s secret
writing lair, at the heart of a hollowed out

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.010
volcano underneath 221b Baker Street!

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.739
This is where he writes.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.870
This is where he does his hair.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.399
This is where he eats.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.180
And this is where he keeps his specimens.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.399
To business. We’ve broken in to steal the
most valuable thing in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.699
the universe.

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:59.250
The scripts for Doctor Who Series 9.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:13.530
Here, come and look at this!

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:25.430
Get rid of that one!

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.640
Ah ha!

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.850
Yes!

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.070
[SIREN]

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.690
This TARDIS really ISN’T bigger on the inside.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.360
No?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.920
Er, we seem to be experiencing some technical
difficulties so instead we’ll bring you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.890
exverything we know about episodes three and
four.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.350
The episodes as yet untitled are written by
regular contributor Toby Whithouse.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.410
Alongside four previous Doctor Who writing
credits, Whithouse has also written for Torchwood

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.239
and created supernatural series Being Human.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.439
so it’s no surprise that Steven Moffat has
described this as “brilliantly creepy”.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.989
Filming began at the start of January, with
guest cast including Paul Kaye from Game of

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:19.590
Thrones

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.230
And Colin McFarlane from Torchwood: Children
of Earth

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.230
and Sophie Stone who’s the first deaf actor
to graduate from London drama school RADA.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.409
And that’s literally all we know.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.549
[Knock, knock, knock, knock]

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.689
[Knock, knock, knock, knock]

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.819
[Knock, knock, knock, knock]

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.959
[Knock, knock, knock, knock]

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.099
[Knock, knock, knock, knock]

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.670
So, he caught me. And now I’m a specimen
in Steven Moffat’s specimen pod.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.409
Oh well, to pass the time, let’s take a
look at some of the cool stuff you’ve sent

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.099
in.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.620
Joe visited the set of series 9 and bumped
into Peter Capaldi and Ingrid Oliver

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.519
and sent us these great pics!

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.620
He also asks if Sgt Tom Osgood is Osgood’s
dad.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.849
Who knows, Joe! Who knows…

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.859
We love a good collection at The Fan Show

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.170
and Brian from Wigan wowed us with these fab
pics

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.069
of his Doctor Who themed bedroom.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.560
And don’t forget, you can get in touch at
dwthefanshow@bbc.com or tweet us @dwthefanshow.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.670
And now, out cosplayer of the week!

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.639
[DRUMROLL]

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.739
It’s Roxas as the 10th Doctor, TJ as Rose
and Jordan as a UNIT solider.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.459
The 10th Doctors coat is handmade by Roxas
who also made the thing that goes ding!

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.069
And they tell us it actually dings! Excellent
work guys!

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.829
And finally, check out our favourite clips
in this week’s Who Tube annotation attack.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.840
Well, that’s all we’ve got time for. Hopefully
Steven Moffat let’s me out.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.379
Bye!
