Hi, I'm magician Paul Weatherbee. I'm going
to talk to you a little bit about the three

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.521
card monte. In some cities that you go to,
there's a scam called the three card monte,

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:17.160
they use three cards. The trick of it is,
always keep your eye on one card. Today I'm

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.820
going to have you keep your eye on the center
card. It's a red card. Not only is it a red

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:33.050
card on the back, it's also a red card on
the front. It's a nine between two black eights.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.420
You can always keep your eye on that because
it's got a different colored back. People

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.579
think that they can follow the card during
the three card monte. Could you just slide

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.640
that out? Keep it face down for a moment.
Now, you would bet that you had the nine,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.300
correct? Well, whenever you bet on the three
card monte, you're always going to lose, and,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.710
go ahead and turn over your card . You should
never bet on the three card monte, 'cause

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.170
you'll turn out to be a joker! Now I'm going
to tell you how that fun trick was done. What

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:18.470
you have to do is to make a gimmicked card.
You cut a corner off of a card, and tape it

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.460
on to a card, just like that. You show the
cards, but you're really holding that in your

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:35.140
hand. You take the odd-colored card, and you
place it under that fake bit of card, and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.380
you put the third card over the whole thing
like that. That way you can show the front

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.570
and the back and everybody thinks it's the
same card. Once they slide the card out, simply

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.430
put the bottom card over the fake bit of card,
and you can show the two eights. And when

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:02.100
they turn it over, they can see they've gotten
the wrong card. I hope you have a lot of fun

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.810
with that. Until next time, keep the magic
in your life.
