00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.980
To me Korea means a second home
 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.520
With so many faces letting me know I ain't alone 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.680
In the land of smart phones 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.020
 Some are sweatin' off the spice

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.480
But if you into something different you can try the fried rice

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.870
Subways full of peace and quiet

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.160
T-Money in my back pocket
In case I'm taking a ride

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.809
From my soul to Seoul
With the help of Scotty Soul

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:30.380
Korea is full of life I know you're feeling
it Saul

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.920
So much culture
My favorite 닭갈비 (stir-fried spicy chicken)

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.400
Life's so fast that we call it "빨리 빨리"

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.940
To the beach of Busan I'm trying to make it in a hurry

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440
Trying to have a good time

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.629
I'm chillin' with my honey
So much to explore

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.389
You know you want more

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.649
They ask you how you're doing tell 'em, "좋아요!"

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:46.469
"맞다 맞다!" (That's right, that's right!")

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380
Korea is the place where you wanta

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.860
Turn up from the summertime all the way to winter

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.920
From Haeundae beach to Itaewon

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.170
I don't need to have a worry 'cuz I got that
won

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.190
From Haeundae beach to Itaewon

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.540
I don't need to have a worry 'cuz I got that won

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.420
From Seoul to Busan

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.800
I'm trying to see it all the way to Gunsan

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.080
Cuz' this place is only showing me a good time

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.640
So join me on the journey to the good life

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.520
the good life
Let me hear you say

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.620
I moved out to Yongin then I went to Bundang

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.020
If you don't live in Seoul son tell me what are you on

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.759
Ask me when I'll go home and I'll tell you, "언젠가" (someday)

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.580
I ain't living nowhere that ain't got 감자탕  

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.100
노래방 (karaoke bar) four in the morn' my favorite song

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.569
We all gotta work tomorrow 잔 하나만

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.420
Everybody speak that language of that la la la

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.020
But I'm starting to learn the 가사 (lyrics) to the 아리라리랑

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.340
곱창 막창 다 좋아 (곱창 막창, it's all good)

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.080
곱창 막창 뭐가 달라 (곱창 막창, what's the difference?)

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.380
곱창 막창 나 몰라 (곱창 막창, I don't know)

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.220
곱창 막창 먹자 먹자 먹자

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.080
See all my homies swoopin' on the Hangang

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.580
Sippin' bubbly in Hongdae, Hongdae
It's 1,000 won to get to Gangnam

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.480
But you gotta be a little quiet on the subway

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.280
I'm talking about the R.O.K. and what it is to me

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.360
I'm talking about the R.O.K. and what it is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.560
I'm talking about the R.O.K. and what it is to me 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.200
I'm talking about the R.O.K. and what it is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.000
Let me hear you say, "한국위하여!"

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.880
한국위하여

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.440
한국위하여

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.360
한국위하여
