00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.780
And we're back here with Arts and Crafts and
Everything Fun with Marybeth Murphy, our spiritual

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.760
coach, and she's going to summarize everything
we've learned about the Minor and the Major

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.050
Arcana cards. Right, okay, and as I said Tarot
is, some people think of it as very negative

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.730
and it's not. I hope, after watching this
information you don't feel that it's that

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.359
dark. We went through the Minor Arcana and
the Major Arcana. The Minor Arcana were the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.469
four groups, which were the Wands, the Swords,
the Cups and the Coins, and each of those

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:44.030
four sets had Ace, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine and ten, as well as

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.760
a Page, Knight, Queen and King card. Those
are the four sets, each of those that I went

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.290
through before, were in the four sets and
those are the Minor Arcana. And then you have

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:04.650
22 of the Major Arcana. So all those cards
combined to compose a deck of about 78 cards.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.260
Then, I know later on we'll be doing some
readings in other shows and we'll see how

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.680
all these cards work together. Don't forget,
when you use these, I've given you some literal

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.990
definitions of these cards and how they're
all used, but be aware that your intuition

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.950
plays a huge factor when you do give someone
a reading or when someone gives you a reading,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.290
so please keep that in mind. Great. Thank
you, thank you for teaching us about all this,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.070
this is fascinating. It is isn't it? It really
is exciting. I know, it's awesome and that

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:45.650
was it for learning how to use the Tarot cards
with my guest Marybeth Murphy. If you want

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:55.730
to contact Marybeth you can email her at mmurphysmile@yahoo.com,
and she can do a reading for you. Sure, I

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.100
can do phone readings, I can do, if you want
to meet in person, if you're local. So they

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.510
don't need to be present? No, they can be
in another part of the country. Contact me

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.349
through email and we can set that up, and
yea, definitely, I do phone readings all the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.670
time. Fabulous, that mmurphysmile@yahoo.com.
