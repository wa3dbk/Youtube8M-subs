00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.102
- [Voiceover] So we have three
folks: Jenna,Sarah and Bill

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:06.233
and they're keeping track of their weight.

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:10.166
And in particular they're
keeping track of their weight

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.620
over a month.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.418
And right over here we
have their weight change

00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:14.423
over the month.

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:16.206
So if you take their ending weight

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:18.666
and from that you subtract
their starting weight.

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.874
So, let me just write that,
that's your end weight

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:23.930
minus your starting weight.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.584
That's going to be your change
in weight over that month.

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:30.300
And so we have the change in weights here.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.911
So, Jenna's change in weight

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.382
is negative three pounds

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:38.133
which means that she lost weight.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.300
Sarah's change in weight
is positive 2 1/2 pounds

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.766
which means she gained 2 1/2 pounds.

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:48.634
And then Bill's change in
weight is positive four pounds

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:51.166
which means he gained four
pounds over the month.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.700
So, given that, let's
answer some questions.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.567
Who lost the most weight?

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.702
Who had the largest change in weight?

00:00:57.702 --> 00:00:59.425
And who had the smallest change in weight?

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.876
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:03.363
and try to work through it on your own.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:07.100
Well let's just plot all of these

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.907
on a number line here to
help us think through it,

00:01:09.907 --> 00:01:13.502
although some of you might
already have an answer here.

00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:17.333
So Jenna's weight change
is negative three pounds.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.502
So that's Jenna right over there.

00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:21.666
I'll say J for Jenna.

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:25.234
Sarah's weight change,
and she had a weight gain

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:28.800
is 2 1/2 pounds so
that's right over there.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.702
Positive 2 1/2 pounds for Sarah.

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:34.300
And then finally Bill gained four pounds

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.468
so that is Bill right over there.

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:40.401
Now let's answer the
question, who lost the most?

00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:43.206
So when we talk about lost,
where we care about directions,

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.399
we said hey, who moved most

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.299
to the left of zero?

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.094
Well Sarah and Bill didn't move
to the left of zero at all.

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:52.333
They gained weight.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.800
That's why they're to the right of zero.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.876
Jenna's the only person who lost anything.

00:01:55.876 --> 00:01:59.468
So the person who lost the most is Jenna.

00:02:00.068 --> 00:02:02.470
Now who had the largest change?

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.771
And if we think about the largest change,

00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:05.000
one way to think about it is,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.469
who is the furthest away from zero?

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.866
So one way to think about it is,

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.169
which of these is the
largest absolute value?

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.833
Well the absolute value
here, the absolute value

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:18.333
of negative three is,
and we can just call this

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.830
the absolute change,

00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:25.601
is just going to be the absolute value.

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:29.034
The absolute value of negative
three is positive three.

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:32.915
Absolute value of 2.5

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:35.478
is 2.5.

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:38.701
Let me make this a little bit clearer.

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:42.733
Absolutue value of four
is just equal to four.

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:45.001
So who had the largest absolute change?

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.158
Well Bill had the largest absolute change

00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:48.650
and then second place was actually Jenna.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.749
She lost weight, but she
had a pretty big change.

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.289
She had a three pound change

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.217
although it was a three pound loss.

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:55.834
Bill's was a four pound gain.

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:59.617
But the largest change is definitely Bill.

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.267
Now who had the least change?

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:03.973
Well another way to think about it,

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:05.870
this is the least absolute change.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.467
Who changed the least from zero?

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:10.284
Well if you look at here,

00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:14.100
Sarah had the smallest absolute change.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.966
Jenna lost weight so the
weight change of Jenna,

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:21.369
she has negative three
vs. Sarah's positive 2.5.

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.386
But if we talk about who had
the least change from zero.

00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:25.586
If your weight change was zero, that means

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:26.976
you didn't gain or lose weight

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:29.139
from the beginning of the
month to the end of the month.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.038
So who had the least change?

00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:32.564
Well that's the least absolute change?

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:33.971
Well, we see that right over here.

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:38.534
2.5 is less than three or four.

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:43.246
So the least change is Sarah.

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.047
And we're done.
