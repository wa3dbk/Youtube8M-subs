"The Best of São Paulo" elects Maní
and Fasano as the city favorites.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.550
The review The Best of São Paulo
brings this year 32 restaurants and 16 bars

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.800
elected as the best places in the city, according
to a research by Datafolha and a specialized jury.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.850
Datafolha interviewed over 1000 people,
from the higher social classes,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.560
who go to bars and restaurants
at least twice a week.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.649
While Datafolha was out on the field,
reporters looked for 100 gourmets and bohemians,

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.000
who chose their favorite bars
and restaurants in the city.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The best restaurant, elected by Datafolha,
was once again Fasano.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.200
And the surprise of the year,
elected by the jury, was Maní.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.000
The best restaurant: Maní

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Today, what is the dish that you
have got to taste when you come to Maní?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I love the arracacha gnocchi, with arrowroot,
that we make with tucupi (Brazilian spice).

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
How did you start working with these products?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You meant to study the Brazilian ingredients,
or did you see that was a trend there?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I learned about the terroir in Europe.
This notion of working with the a certain territory,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
using local products... So, actually, all
this time that I've been abroad I thought,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.210
"Wow, look at all that we have in Brazil!"

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The best restaurant: Fasano

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They are all imported.
From Italy, Argentina, Canada...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That is what I aim for, a special quality,
top quality always, approaching the original recipe.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.240
Potato gnocchi filled with ossobuco,
the sauce from the ossobuco itself,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.000
accompanied by a gremolata, that has a base
of parsley, lemon zest and rosemary.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
A dish can go well with many wines, not just one.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.910
There isnt one wine for each kind of dish,
but plenty of wines

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.000
that can make a good combination
and give different results.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.310
The other chosen restaurants can be checked
on the site of the magazine

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.000
and on the application that was specially
designed for The Best of São Paulo.
