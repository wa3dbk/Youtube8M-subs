00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.970
So finally I got my new galaxy note.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.170
I have seen lot about this phone online.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.260
I have watched quite a few reviews of it.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.949
I have been standing off from getting my on
for a while

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.469
because it did come across as quite big.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.119
I have used the iPhone, Oh WOW that's big!

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.539
It's already dwarfed my hands!

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.820
I mean compared to my S2 (Galaxy S2) this
looks huge!!

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.679
I know this is a 5.3 inch Super AMOLED screen.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.289
The S2 also has a Super AMOLED screen.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.149
But S2 being 4.3 inch screen, it's much smaller.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.020
I am expecting graphics to be a lot crisper
on this note because

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.820
it's got a pixel density of 285 PPI.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.710
There's an instruction manual with it,
pretty full of information, lots to read,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.480
so yep, I will be going through this one.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.199
Warranty booklet with a 2 years warranty I
presume.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.559
USB cable for connecting your phone to PC
and charging.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.570
The larger end goes to the PC or Mac and the
micro usb goes to the phone.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.840
It's quite a large battery, 2500 mAH to be
exact.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.590
I think it's needed for such a big screen.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.800
Headphone with built in microphone and volume
controls.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.360
Plug for the USB cable.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.010
It's nice that they have given the ear buds
in different sizes.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.860
So back to the phone!

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.220
Let me peel off the plastic.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.610
This is a powerful phone running on a 1.4
Ghz dual core processor.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.750
It has a 3.5 mm headphone jack.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.920
Power on and off button.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.670
Volume rocker switch.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.270
The micro USB port.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.280
And there's the S-Pen secured away in its
own slot, at the back of the phone.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.180
I quite like the way, Samsung managed to keep
the phone thin and still have the S-Pen stored

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.209
in it.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.730
8 megapixels camera with autofocus and flash
(rear).

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.430
Now the Note also has a front facing camera.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.319
This one is actually 2 megapixels, which is
pretty good compared to lot of other phones

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.090
and tablets out there.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.359
So now I am going to put the battery in.

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.319
Let's switch it on.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.689
It feels really huge in my hand.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.829
I am not sure how I am going to get used to
using it.

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.829
It's going to be pretty interesting.

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.730
I will be making a series of videos to sort
of,

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.700
chart my progress in using the Note.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.450
And I will be uploading those videos
over the course of next few weeks just to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.440
show you how I
get on with this phone.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.260

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.239
