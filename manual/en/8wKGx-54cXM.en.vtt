00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:08.261
The CMCO major is Cinema and Media Communications

00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:10.472
It encompasses a lot of different types of filmmaking

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:15.697
from journalism to film production to film studies to audio production

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:17.773
just all sorts of media communications

00:00:17.773 --> 00:00:22.454
So all of those concentrations are part of the same CMCO major

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.240
The typical CMCO class is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.993
different than anything else you'll find on campus

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.814
what I found when I was a film student

00:00:29.814 --> 00:00:33.576
is that where I really got the most useful information

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:36.130
was out in the field when I really got my hands on the camera

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.988
or editing late at night, those things

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:42.934
so virtually all of our production classes have extensive hands on commitment

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:45.697
I worked on a variety of short films

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:49.041
I've done things from scriptwriting, to script superision

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:51.358
to art direction

00:00:51.358 --> 00:00:53.824
I've been able to act in several films as well

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:55.113
which is a really fun experience

00:00:55.113 --> 00:00:57.199
everything from being a reporter

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.119
who solves the crime with her sleuth companion

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.457
to a zombie running through an abandoned hospital in the middle of the night

00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:06.836
so a variety of roles, and its just 
 really fun for the people who participate

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:08.797
in front of the camera as well as behind it

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:11.426
The CMCO facilities really

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:14.861
offer a lot of good equipment for us 
 to get our hands on as students

00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:18.228
Our students have 24/7 access to our recording studio

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:20.396
to the TV studio, to the editing suite

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:21.990
cuz we want them to use the gear

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.449
I think its important to study film because

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:28.097
we're living in a society where we are

00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:33.042
very heavily influenced by film and by media

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:37.268
and its really important that we get some 
 Christian filmmakers out there in the world

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:40.460
Everything that we do with our professors, with our fellow classmates

00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:42.800
we're constantly in this environment of faith

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:44.210
and of creating films

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.350
and telling stories that are going to inspire people and touch people

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:50.640
I know that at Fox that our students do High quality work

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:53.080
you get small class sizes

00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:54.110
and available equipment

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:57.470
and good mentors that are able to lead 
 you through all steps of the process

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.650
and help you explore film and help you find 
 out where your passion lies in film

00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:02.870
you bond with your fellow classmates

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.230
and with professors

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:07.040
its a great experience as you learn and grow

00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:08.670
and create ideas and stories 

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:09.920
and tell them through film
