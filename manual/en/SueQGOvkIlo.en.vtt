Hey guys, I'm Alejandra. And I'm Caroline.
And today we're making Peanut Butter Magic Bars. 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.600
These are a really fun treat to bring
if you've ever got a bake sale or a cookie

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.679
swap. Always the most popular item on the
table. Big hit I'm sure. Yeah, definitely.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.369
So, and it's actually very simple to make.
So we've got some graham cracker crumbs, some

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.920
melted butter, condensed milk, little bit
of salt, our Smooth Operator peanut butter,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.620
some roasted salted peanuts, unsweetened coconut
flakes, and some semi-sweet chocolate chips.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.360
All right, so we're gonna start off by making
the crust and it's very simple I've just got

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.200
some melted butter here. Combining that with
our graham cracker crumbs. Nice. Get that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.190
all nice and coated and it's just gonna make
a really delicious buttery sweet base for

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.340
our Magic Bars. You could probably go with,
you know, chocolate wafers too if you wanted

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.440
to do a little bit of a twist, right? Oh my
gosh, you want to do a super chocolaty twist

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.570
that would definitely be the way to go. Nice,
yeah. Or you could do like cinnamon grahams

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.130
have really fun with them. OK, so if you want
to just push those in there and just press

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.069
it down into a flat layer. Meanwhile, I've
got the peanut butter here which I already

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:20.520
warmed up a bit it's just gonna make things
a little easier and I'm adding our condensed

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.340
milk, delicious. So why did you warm the peanut
butter first? Because the peanut butter can

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.389
be a little bit difficult to whisk into the
other ingredients so this just makes the whole

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:33.310
process way easier. Saves you time, and then we're gonna add some salt to balance that all

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.310
out. And it's such a fun recipe because you're
basically just layering levels of deliciousness.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.399
Why the people love it. Nice. All right. And
it's very easy, it's just a couple of ingredients

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:53.879
which is great. I'm just gonna layer this
all in, how creamy and luscious does that

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:58.420
look? Looks awesome, it's like a quickie caramel
kind of. Oh totally, yeah, like a dulce de

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.590
leche type. So we just want to spread this
all out into a nice even layer and don't worry

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.030
if it pulls up some of the crumbs that always
happens. Adds texture probably. It will all

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.500
settle down once you bake it so it's fine.
It's nice you don't have to bake it first

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
so it's just super simple. Now we're going
to add our super fun toppings. So we've got

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.050
our peanuts, our coconut, our semi-sweet chocolate,
and if you want to just help me sprinkle these

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.680
in. Sure. We'll just kind of alternate them
so you get like a fun mix of layers and flavor.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.260
And I use the unsweetened coconut because
since you already have the sweetness from

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.400
the condensed milk and the graham crackers
it's just kind of makes everything nice and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.700
balanced out. How awesome does that look.
Gorgeous! So now I'm just gonna use my hands

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.160
to just press things down a little bit, just
want to push it into that caramel, just a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.250
little bit. All right, and now this is gonna
go into a 350 degree oven for about 25-30

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.420
minutes just until it's all golden and toasted
and ready to eat. Delicious. Good. All right

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.220
guys, so we got this out of the oven and we
let it cool completely, how awesome does it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.210
look? The coconut's all toasted, the chocolate's
melty. Smells nice and toasted coconutty,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.290
it's great. Really fantastic. So if you want
to help me pull this out now we're just gonna

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.450
transfer it over here. And see this is why
it's so nice to have that parchment in there

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.040
it just makes it so simple to lift out. And
an extra set of hands, a buddy helps. A buddy's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.040
also always a good thing. Let's cut us a slice.
I'm so excited to try this, it looks super

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:39.080
decadent and delicious. So decadent. so delicious.
Ooh, that cut beautifully. May I have a plate,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.460
please? Yes. The caramel, you can see it's
like an extra peanut buttery goodness layer,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.680
it looks great. So there you have it: Peanut
Butter Magic Bars. Can we dig in or...? Oh

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:01.840
we can definitely dig in. Awesome I can't
wait. Cool. I love that peanut butter-caramel

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.250
layer. It's like decadent but definitely some
magic in there it's really really good. These

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.850

night snack. What other yummy snacks do you
