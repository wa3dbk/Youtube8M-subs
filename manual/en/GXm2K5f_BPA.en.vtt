00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.510
What’s up man, children?

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.940
Troy here with Muscle Tactics.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.480
And chilling here in Venice Beach right now.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.279
It is a beautiful day in November.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.130
Take in the beautiful view.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.960
Got the Venice Beach pier behind me.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.690
And way down there, about a mile down, is
Muscle Beach.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.770
Obviously home to a lot of famous body builders.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.980
But today I want to preach aesthetics.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.840
I want to talk about the best form of cardio.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.949
It’s going to get you guys absolutely fucking
shredded.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:37.140
And this is a 
form of cardio that really formed the foundation

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.430
for the Science of Abs program.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.719
When I started researching about high-intensity
interval training, I could not believe all

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.460
the numerous studies that backed, you know,
increased testosterone, increased human growth

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.800
hormone, and increased metabolism.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.579
You can actually build muscle and burn fat
with this form of cardio.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.579
It is so powerful.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.219
So, when people are talking about working
out for aesthetics, working out for maximum

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.080
lean muscle, for very low body fat and having
that nice V taper, that really aesthetic physique,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.619
I can’t stress enough how important high-intensity
interval training is.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.470
So like I said, it formed the foundation for
the Science of Abs fast-twitch cardio, which

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.970
is half of the entire program.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.920
And it really forms the foundation of my training.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.820
When I was doing too much weight lifting,
I noticed I was getting really stiff.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.560
I was getting really rigid.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.451
And I just didn’t like the way that my body
looked.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:29.970
But when I started incorporating high-intensity
interval training, that fast-twitch cardio,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.880
I instantly became more aesthetic looking.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.100
I became leaner.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.280
I built muscle more easily.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.640
I increased my strength.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.400
All these amazing things stared to happen
just from the hormonal benefits and the incredible

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.659
form of cardio that it is.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.640
So I want to talk about my favorite high-intensity
interval training routine today.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.080
And first off let me start off by saying this.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.090
I want you to, you know, look at the picture
of a marathon runner and now look at a picture

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.689
of all the sprinters that were in the 2012
Summer Olympics.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.100
And what you’re going to notice, the marathon
runner very frail looking.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.270
Absolutely no muscle mass.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.790
Hardly, you know, does not look aesthetic.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.879
Just basically looks like he’s about to
blow away in the wind, like he’s blowing

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:10.879
away.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.370
Now I want you to look at the sprinters in
the 2012 Summer Olympics.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.330
Guys like Usian Bolt, Justin Gatlin, the Jamaican
guy who took second, even all the guys who

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.910
took, you know, fifth, sixth all the way to
twelfth.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.910
Look at their physique.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.870
Look at how lean, look at how chiseled they
are.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.370
Every single sprinter has a very lean aesthetic
chiseled physique.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.989
And it’s no coincidence that almost they’re
entire training involves sprint interval training.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.209
So they don’t go in the weight room and
knock out all these compound exercises like

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.720
bodybuilders and fitness models do.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.040
They essentially just do this fast twitch
cardio, so that should prove to you how amazing

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.250
this form of cardio is.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.269
So look at a marathon runner who does all
that long static cardio, running for hours

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.970
and hours and look at the sprinter who’s
just doing very fast-twitch, fast bursts of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.230
movement, and look at how lean and chiseled
they are.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.930
So this should show you the most efficient
way to burn fat and build muscle is high-intensity

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.080
interval training.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.420
Many guys think that, you know, they’re
trying to burn the maximum amount of fat.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.610
They’re trying to lose weight.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.239
They go on the treadmill for 30 – 45 minutes,
an hour long, and they just perform these

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.239
long bouts of cardio.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.690
But this is like catabolic activity.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.200
You’re going to be losing muscle mass.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.519
And although you’re burning a lot of calories,
there’s really no hormonal benefits to doing

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.140
this long form of cardio.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.650
So with high-intensity interval training it’s
very short, it’s very precise and you’re

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.980
maximizing your testosterone, you’re maximizing
your HGH.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.129
Also, on all those research studies and all
these different things that backup all these

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.830
claims, but I want to dive into my favorite
high-intensity interval training routine.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.239
And I actually got this from Justin Gatlin.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.800
I had the opportunity to meet and train with
Justin Gatlin a little bit.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.790
We did a little fitness promo job together
and I really picked his brain.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.730
And if you don’t know who Justin Gatlin
is he actually won the gold medal in the 2004

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.670
Summer Olympics in the 100 meter sprint and
I believe he took bronze in the 2012.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.989
He’s the fastest 30 year old in world history.

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.799
And he is a huge component, even for the average
person, to do sprint interval sessions.

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.930
So, what Justin Gatlin told me is, you know,
when he’s talking to an average person who’s

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.750
trying to lose weight and get really ripped,
he says, all you have to do is just do sprint

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.250
intervals three times a week and this really
opened up my eyes.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.900
And he was saying how, he’s helped a lot
of people actually lose weight in his family

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.150
and get ripped just by doing these little
sprint interval workouts and cleaning up their

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.150
diets.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.190
So I was able to kind of incorporate the knowledge
I learned from him with a lot of my other

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.270
background from, you know, training in IMG
Sports Academy and doing a lot of research

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.600
on high-intensity interval training.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.340
And my favorite high-intensity interval training
workout to get fucking shredded is simply

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.750
doing 8 to 10 sprint intervals.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.050
So what I’ll do is I’ll sprint at maximum
speed anywhere between 10 and 20 seconds and

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.860
then for every, say for every 10 seconds I’m
sprinting, I’m resting about 25 seconds.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.370
So depending on how long the sprint is, I’ll
double my rest period.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.410
And all you do is you go through 8 to 12 intervals
of this and it will only take you about 10

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.960
total minutes to do.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.130
The next thing that I do is I will just do
dumbbell squat jumps.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.660
So what I’ll do is I’ll hold a pair of
say, like, 10 – 15 pound weights and I’ll

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.539
just jump up and jump down.

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.370
And I’ll just keep on repeating this anywhere
between 10 and 20 reps.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.950
I’ll keep my rest times very short.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.080
So I’m doing 8 to 10 sets of the sprint
intervals.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.260
I’m doing between, I’d say 5 and 8 sets
of the dumbbell squat jumps.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.690
And this is just such an easy and efficient
way to do high-intensity interval trainings.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.570
So even if you live in a really cold climate
and you’re indoors, you can do sprint intervals

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.570
on a treadmill.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.160
You can grab a pair of dumbbells and you can
obviously do dumbbell squat jumps at the gym.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.479
I own, I just bought a cheap little pair of
10 pound weights, so I can do this workout

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:46.479
anywhere.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.479
I can do it at the beach.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.600
I can do it at the gym.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.470
I can even, you know, if I want to, you know,
throw some weights in my gym bag or my travel

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.569
bag, I can even do this on the road in the
hotels.

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.600
So it’s such an easy and efficient way.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.250
If you do this workout just two times a week
you guys will get absolutely fucking shredded.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.319
I can promise you that.

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.550
So this is such an easy way to get ripped.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.550
And what this does is you’re working your
fast-twitch muscle fibers specifically in

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.470
your hamstrings during these exercises.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.860
So your hamstrings actually have the most
fast-twitch muscle fibers.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.970
And it’s working these fast-twitch muscle
fibers at maximum intensities when you’re

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.520
going to start to reap all of the benefits
with high-intensity interval trainings.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:07:01.070
So that’s a little background on why it’s
so effective.
