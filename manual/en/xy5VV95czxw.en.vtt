00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.689
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome
to NBN! Today I've got quite a few updates

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.700
on upcoming Minecraft version 1.9 for you!
So let's start by checking out this picture

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.120
by Tommaso Checchi. Now, you need to know that
he is a pocket edition developer, so all the

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.680
screenshots have been made in pocket edition,
but most of the features will very likely

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.190
also be put into the PC version. Alright,
the picture shows a village and instead of

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.390
gravel, they used pressed dirt for their walkways!
So if crafting pressed dirt were gonna be

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.640
super hard, you would still be able to gather
a bit from your nearby village!

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.630
I know that some of you are playing in pocket
edition, so I figured I'd tell you this as

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.720
well: the so called „new guy“ is working
on implementing fishing.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.140
Dinnerbone released a seemingly simple GIF
stating that he thinks he had a bug. But if

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
we examine it really closely you can spot
the dragon – apart from chasing its tail

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.600
– spitting fire and you can even see another
dragon egg in the lower corner! Does this

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.280
mean that you'll be able to hatch dragons from eggs
or is it just a coincidence? Please let me

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.719
know about your thoughts in the comment section.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:15.039
Perhaps one of the most annoying bugs ever to
exist will be fixed: BOATS. Tommaso tweeted

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.630
about trying to make boats less fragile, so
that it won't break every time you run into

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.159
a wall. Awesome news! But you know what's
even more awesome? You can take your dog for

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.359
a ride as well!

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.380
If you've ever created a custom world with
low sea levels you have probably seen this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.899
happening: a falsely generated Water Temple.
Well, Searge is working on fixing that for

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.100
the upcoming version!
But there's still something missing: version

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.229
1.8 is not even entirely finished. But Searge
has got us covered there as well! He plans

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.299
on posting a final pre-release on Monday,
the 16th and a full release on Thursday the

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.079
19th. And when that's done, the way is cleared
for the first snapshot, right? Not quite.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.560
Mojang is still trying to find a date to post
the first one, likely a Wednesday, but until

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.810
then, Searge is gonna keep on adding hidden
stuff mainly for survival and adventure mode!

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.160
So will 1.9 be the survival update? Just think
about all the boss changes, new crops, boats

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.790
and all that good stuff! I'm really liking
where this is going!

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.060
Moving on to miscellaneous news:

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.680
If you've ever wanted to go to Minecon and
live in the London area or can easily travel

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.290
there, you're in luck! Jeb has confirmed that
this years convention will be held in London

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.069
on the 4th and 5th of July. However if you
cannot go there, well, we have something in

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.709
common at least. :P

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.939
Java is the platform Minecraft runs on, so
it's important to keep it up to date. Now

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.379
the launcher will do that for you, as Dinnerbone
says here: „The Minecraft launcher will

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.079
now warn you if you're running an old version
of Java and are able to use the new installer.“

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.909
Those were all the significant updates I could
find since episode number 1, which you can

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.939
check out right here by the way. But now:
let's take a look at some comments that I

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.500
wanted to address!

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.739
Master A Crafter says: Super fantastic video.
This news must be a weekly or monthly series.

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.140
Please.
Thanks for that and yes, as long as there

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.189
are updates to inform you about, I will continue
compiling information for you!

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.700
GoldenGamerUK tells us that Minecraft would
have to get a lot harder, before he would

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.780
get back to it.
That's a really interesting point, so if my

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.790
conclusions from Mojang's tweets are correct,
this update may be just what you are looking

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.859
for!

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.780
And lastly fkSpastic guesses that the „c“
we talked about in the previous episode may

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.010
stand for a crown that you get as an ultimate
reward for beating all bosses!

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.799
All of these comments were really awesome,
and if you want to be featured on the next

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.780
episode, why not leave one with your personal
opinion or suggestion?

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.640
Links to everything I've talked about are
in the description box below this video and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.189
if you wanna find me, my links are there as
well. I'll see you next time with some more

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.819
Minecraft 1.9 updates! Goodbye!
