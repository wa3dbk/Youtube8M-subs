Hi everyone! Welcome to Keith's Toy Box.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.420
Today's surprise toy will help us build our own car and airplane with our favourite bricks.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.940
Can you guess what it is?

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.640
It's the Lego Duplo Let's go! Vroom! playset with storybook.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.140
This play set is available for around $13 at Amazon and Walmart.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.440
It comes with over 11 pieces.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.100
And let's you build a car and an airplane.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.320
And it comes with a storybook too so you can read and build.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.080
So let's open the box and take a look.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.740
Here's the storybook.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:56.920
It's a story about how Penny needs to ride on her plane to look for Joe whose car got broken down somewhere.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.280
And it shows you how to build the car and the plane too.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.100
And here are the pieces.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.020
Now let's put it together.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.420
Here they are.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.400
Let's take a closer look at racer Joe and his car.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.080
It has real working wheels.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.200
And a connector in front and at the back so you can connect it to other cars if you have them.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.380
Like this.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.420
Now let's take a look at Penny and her airplane.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.980
The propellers spin too.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.380
Let's take racer Joe for a spin.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.820
Vroom

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.140
Vroom

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.980
Now let's take Penny to the sky.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.520
So that's the Lego Duplo Let's Go! Vroom! playset with storybook.
