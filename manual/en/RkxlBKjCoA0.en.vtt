00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.920
Anthony: Scientists have stopped light and
trapped it in a crystal for a full minute.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.830
Show offs.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.929
Anthony: Anthony here for Dnews and look!

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.760
I've set out some candy, and I trapped a Sourcefed!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.870
Hello lady Sourcefed.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.960
Lee: I'm Lee Newton, or just Lee.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.550
Anthony: Lady Sourcefed everybody!

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.250
Lee: Anyway, light thinks it's pretty impressive.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.430
It gets to be a particle and wave at the same
time.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.590
And it travels at the speed of around 300,000
meters/second.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.060
Which means it can get to the moon and back
20 times in a single minute.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.240
Until we trap it in a crystal for that minute,
Zod style, who's impressive now, light?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.620
Anthony: A German team from the University
of Darmstadt, stopped particles of light for

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.260
a full minute using crystals and lasers,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.300
which is the most 80's scifi thing I think
I've ever heard of.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.010
So you've got an opaque crystal and its atoms
are all vibrating around, like they do.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.050
And at any time, those atoms could be in a
couple of different states.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.210
And the team fired lasers into the crystal
to make those atoms exist in a quantum super

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.210
position.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850
Lee: Which is the worst James Bond move.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.600
Anthony: Which is a mix of those two states.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.850
In that super position, the opaque crystal
became transparent to certain kinds of light.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.010
So they fired a second laser into the now
transparent crystal, and it passed through.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.310
And then they shut off the first laser and
whoops!

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.509
Crystal is opaque again.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.789
And the particles of light from the second
beam are trapped in the crystal.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.990
Lee: Now this isn't the first time we put
light in its place either.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.999
A previous experiment by a German team, two
years ago, used super cold atoms to stop light

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.020
for a couple of seconds.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.319
Anthony: Why do this?

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.859
Basically, so the other scientists fear and
respect you.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.520
But also, if we trap light, we can use it
to store and retrieve data.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.979
And that's a big deal because currently, computers
store data as a 1 or a 0 and they process

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.560
that data 1 bit at a time.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.599
Lee: Because light can exist in different
states at once, we could store data in a 1

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:56.099
or a 0 both at once.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.180
Meaning computers could crunch data much faster
and work on multiple problems at the same

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.180
time.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.180
It's called quantum computing.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.719
And if we can make it work cheaply and reliably,
we'll be sending and receiving incredibly

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.119
secure data and processing it at speeds completely
unreachable by today's computers.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.010
Anthony: Sexy, secure Snapchats at the speed
of light everybody!

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.879
That's all I can think to use it for.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:16.879
Lee: I know.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:17.879
It's all we could ever do.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.980
You know what I think?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.040
So many puppy pictures all at once.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.260
Secure puppy safe and secure puppy pictures.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.099
Anthony: Now you guys might be wondering,
"Hey, what's Lee Newton doing here?"

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.010
What are you here for Lee Newton?

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.840
Lee: I just followed the hand basket I was
in.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.650
Anthony: Lee is here for the next few days
and Laci Green is over at Sourcefed.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.069
Lee, where is the Sourcefed?

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.260
Lee: It's at youtube.com/sourcefed.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.579
Go say hi to Laci.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.650
Anthony: There you go.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.269
