What is a candle flame really made of?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.080
I am at the Palace of Discovery in Paris to
do an experiment

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.080
that beautifully demonstrates the answers.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.500
Ok so we're turning on an electric field here

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.580
and we see that the flame is spreading out.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.380
Thats very cute,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.500
it's like a butterfly.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.060
And you can see that the flame

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.180
has two separate pieces to it now.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.260
One is going towards the negative plate.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.720
Those would be the positive ions,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.580
and the negative ions will be going
towards a positively charged plate.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.740
So we see the flame kinda flattening out.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.080
But if that didn't convince you

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.700
that flame contains ions,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.480
then check part two of our experiment

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.080
where we compare the conductivity of a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.940
flame to the connectivity of air,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.860
which is normally a pretty good insulator.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.740
It requires about 10,000 volts

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740
to break down a centimeter of air.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.120
So right now this plate is is about 20,000 V.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.640
You see that the spark is only little,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.660
but if I put it around the flame,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.820
we will see if we can get a bigger spark happen.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.780
Look at that, yeaaa!

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.120
Because the flame has those ions in it,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.520
that means that we can break down

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.280
a greater distance of air.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.640
This greater conductivity.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.520
It's awesome!
You love doing this, right?

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.260
A strong enough electric field

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.280
can actually extinguish the flame

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120
but watch carefully what happens 
when the flame goes out.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.580
Just like in the flame, 
the opposite charges in the smoke

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.580
are pulled in opposite directions.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.280
Now while some may argue that a flame is not

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.500
truly a plasma because it's not hot enough

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.660
and it doesn't have a high enough density of ions,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.640
one thing is for sure, it does contain ions

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.700
which have important electrical properties,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.560
which can be demonstrated if 
you have a strong enough electric field.
