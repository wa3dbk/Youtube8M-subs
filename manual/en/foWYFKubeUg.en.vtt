00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.710
[Music]

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.950
If this solitary oak were a xmas tree - then
the decoys would be the baubels, Crowman's

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:25.190
Cousin Gary, The Fairy, with the pigeon hide
under the tree packed full of surprises.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.210
BANG BANG

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.070
It's a cold morning and Crow has been keen
to get out on to this maize stubble field.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.150
When we first arrived, a few thousand pigeons
and crows lifted.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.420
It could be a fun day - especially if those
lofted decoys catch the eyes of the flighting

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.329
birds.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.019
These old lofting poles are pretty flimsy.

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.190
We want to get some lofters out of the top
of the tree.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.190
These go up to about 20 foot.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.280
You get a 20 foot lofting rod up there, bit
of wind, with the weight of the decoy swaying

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.630
like that you can't get it where you want.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:08.300
So what we do, we cheat a bit, we take a ladder
and stick it up the tree and get up the tree,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.260
you only need about 10, 15 foot of pole.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.090
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you
know what you are doing, because it is pretty

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.979
dangerous and that is why I send Gary up.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.140
That is the only reason I have invited him
today.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.380
Gary works his way squirrel-like around the
tree and with pinpoint accuracy he carefully

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.870
places the decoys on to the branches.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.479
Over many years Gary has turned this into
an art form, getting the angle just right

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.980
so as not to put the birds off.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.630
Well, it is cold up there.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.399
We've never filmed Crow using the lofting
poles before so why today?

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.390
Pigeons have been shot at a bit and this tree
is right out in the middle of the field.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.719
It is a bit of a flight line up through here,
it just helps out with the decoys really.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.210
If I can get up ......if Gary can get up the
tree at this time of year I always stick him

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.500
up there so....just get them right up the
top.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.970
Will you put decoys on the ground as well
though?

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.890
Yes, we will spread the decoys out.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.720
What I have found at the moment I am probably
going to put a whirlie out to the right hand

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.500
side of us, back behind us more just for a
bit of movement.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.150
What I have been finding is they haven't been
wanting a whirlie or a flapper.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.150
Other people might be finding it different.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.230
Different birds, but in this area they just
don't want too much movement.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.440
But today it is quite a lumpy field and I
am going to put a whirlie out just for a bit

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.190
of movement just to try and attract their
attention and see what happens.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.420
But they might want it or they might not.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.030
If they don't we just take it in and carry
on with just a few floaters and the cradle.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.970
The field is scattered with fallen maize - a
high protein diet and important to the birds

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.420
as all of a sudden the temperature has dropped.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.000
You can tell which birds have been feeding
on the cobs by the way they peck at it.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.440
Pigeons tend to pull the grain out whereas
a crow will peck like hell at it and just

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.890
take the insides out.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.400
They will take it whole but a pigeon prefers
to take it whole.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.770
Because the maize is such a good food source
Crow expects that the now "pigeon free field"

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.510
will soon be bringing the birds back, both
pigeons and crows.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.700
Even though pigeons are the name of the game
today, Crow wants the pattern to look natural

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.700
so he sticks in a few plastic crows as well.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.930
Right let's get this show on the road.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.700
The chances are that we've pushed the pigeons
on to Andy's neighbouring rape crop which

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.770
is actually what he's trying to protect - but
the maize should bring them back - and they

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.930
do return in large numbers..

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:54.180
BANG

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.080
The birds are dropping in from the front and
from behind.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.190
The lofted decoys attracting them as they
fly down the centre of the field.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.230
Both Andy and Gary are making some good shots
- not everything is passing just yards in

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.070
front of the hide.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.380
The cousins have been shooting together for
more than 30 years and they have a system.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.660
Gary calls the shots so they shoot in unison.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.049
This means the birds don't flare.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.540
Say when

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.540
Now...now

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.530
I hit that....

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.020
Say when

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.020
Now.....

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.889
Gary always calls, he says now and that is
when we both shoot, you usually only hear

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:30.919
one shot like then.

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.600
He says now and we both shot the same time,
two pigeons came down.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.820
It doesn't always happen because Gary usually
misses, but, no he doesn't, he is a good shot.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.620
Just means the second one won't flare.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.620
Yes that is right.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.810
All you hear is just one shot.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.229
If I can't get on a pigeon and Gary says now
then Gary takes the shot.

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.229
He is the conductor.

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.659
Yes, he is the conductor.

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.699
It works better that way.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.770
The thing is if I start calling and he misses
it is my fault.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:12.610
At least if I let him call.......

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.130
When there is a quiet moment, the crows look
tempting but Andy will not be distracted and

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.910
stays with the programme.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.310
There's plenty of time for him to get into
the Crow zone later in the week.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.539
Over the course of the day there's a regular
stream of pigeons and by the end of it the

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.189
boys account for 189 pigeons, three crows
and two jackdaws.

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.219
He gives in to tempation after all.
