00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.660
It turns out there's a practical limit to
the rate of fire in a single-barrelled weapon.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.980
The good news is you can always add more.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.100
The Minigun.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.840
A scaled-down rotary cannon capable of a terrifying
level of output.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.640
So, what are the advantages of a multi-barrelled
design?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.610
How did miniguns become a staple of first
person shooters?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.460
And is it even possible to carry one?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.580
Multiple-barrelled firearms have long been
a solution to increasing rate of fire: early

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.260
volley guns peppered the battlefield with
multiple shots - but each barrel still needed

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.440
to be reloaded individually.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.949
Named for its inventor, the Gatling gun used
a rotating array of barrels to automate the

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.420
firing/reloading sequence through mechanical
means.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.061
Operated with a hand crank, it provided an
unprecedented level of sustained fire, with

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:14.630
effective use by Union forces during the American
Civil war.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.950
Such designs are generally misfire-tolerant,
as any cartridge that fails to fire will simply

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.680
be extracted: one of the benefits of not relying
on the cartridge to power the action.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.390
By the early 20th century, the now-mature
single-barrelled machine guns were the predominant

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.030
solution for sustained fire: but the principles
behind Gatling's rotary cannon would prove

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.660
the basis for a new generation of post-war
designs.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.811
General Electric developed the M61 Vulcan
rotary cannon in 1959, in an effort to provide

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:54.620
more effective armament for jet-powered fighter
aircraft.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.200
During the Vietnam War, a similar solution
was sought for helicopter-mounted weapons:

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.640
with conventional machine guns such as the
M60 proving inadequate from the air.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.780
The 20mm Vulcan design was scaled down to
fire a rifle cartridge instead - and this

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.250
smaller design was dubbed the 'M134 Minigun'.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.310
Like its bigger brother, it has 6 barrels
that rotate continuously during firing: this

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.700
assists air cooling and allows the chambering
/ firing / extraction sequence to be performed

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.790
simultaneously on different barrels.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.980
The net result? The M134 is capable of putting
out between 2000 to 6000 rounds per minute,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.120
without pause.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.580
That's up to 100 rounds per second: an incredible
rate that will saturate a target area, even

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.860
when firing from a fast-moving platform.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.190
Designed to be vehicle-mounted, it is commonly
seen strapped to helicopters or humvees in

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.210
games, as it would be in real life.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.810
Here lies frequent use in the turret sequences
so often seen in modern FPS: the clichÃ©d

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.700
shooting gallery, with waves of enemies succumbing
to your unending fire.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.879
While often on rails, such sections are at
least exhilarating - they come as a climax,

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.069
or mark a pivotal plot point by means of frantic
action.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.261
Often emerging towards the ultimate chapters
of a story, facing overwhelming odds, continuous

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:28.300
fire can be your only saviour:

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.270
Just hold the trigger and hope for the best.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.799
It is a shame to leave such an awesome weapon
attached to its emplacement, however - and

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.120
so while unrealistic, the platform is often
man-handled.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.980
1987 film Predator is largely to blame for
this: the 6 barrels are given significant

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.840
screen time, furiously tearing through the
jungle, at some invisible threat.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.700
Terminator 2 saw a similar treatment, albeit
in slightly more believable fashion, wielded

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.799
by a future cyborg.

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.909
So, is such use even possible?

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.780
For all the firepower it offers, the minigun
is a very compact weapon - at just over 800

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.130
millimetres long, it's shorter than most rifles.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.570
Despite this, it's not particularly portable:
it weighs in at 40 kilos, not including ammunition.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.880
The high rate of fire and full-powered rifle
cartridge would make for some mean recoil,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.560
too - and on top of all this, the weapon demands
an external power supply: so man-portable

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.750
use in any practical sense is impossible.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.650
Virtual depictions in games are not bound
by reality, of course - and it should come

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.210
as no surprise that such a memorable weapon
had an impact on the earliest FPS games.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.370
The chaingun of Wolfenstein and Doom set a
prototype for those that followed, and ensured

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.940
that any future clone worth its salt would
have a multi-barrelled option.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.940
Technically, the in-game appellation is incorrect:
'chain guns' are a similar class of externally-powered

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.190
weapon - but they have only a single barrel,
unlike the minigun's multiple.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.970
Still, these gatling-style inclusions in early
classics set a powerful precedent.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.160
The ability to wield such a potent weapon
exhibits super-human or heroic status: an

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.930
extraordinary feat beyond any ordinary man.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.259
A signature for Serious Sam, nothing puts
more lead downrange than a minigun: with an

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:40.820
endless belt, high rate of fire and no need
for precision - you can mow 'em all down without

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.020
ever needing to reload.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.510
Similarly, the Heavy Weapons Guy from Team
Fortress 2 is clearly built for the job - shooting

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.199
many bullets is his raison d'etre.

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:00.240
Some need external augmentation in order to
employ the weapon: the XMGs from Call of Duty:

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.880
Advanced Warfare are dual wielded with the
help of a powered exoskeleton.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.540
Not a standard weapon by any measure.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.130
It is sometimes reserved as a reward - delivered
as a killstreak, outside of a conventional

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.630
weapon power band.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.070
Here it can be as overpowered as it needs
to be: although the weapon is often lumbered

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.199
with at least some disadvantage.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.740
A heavy weapon will leave you less nimble:
movement speed is often slowed with the minigun

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.210
is equipped, rendering you more vulnerable
to retaliation.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.910
Quite often you'll need to spool up the barrels
before you'll be able to fire: a pause that

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.120
reduces reactivity and can potentially warn
the enemy of your presence.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:53.199
The soft whirr of the electric motor a prelude
to a cacophony of carnage.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:59.070
Chaos in a compact package - the very definition
of a bullet hose.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.240
From classic FPS to modern military shooters,
nothing delivers more.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.610
The antithesis of precision; a hammer to crack
a nut.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.490
Completely unrealistic to wield solo - but
it gets a pass by virtue of being absolutely

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.120
awesome.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.280
The Minigun.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.580
Six barrels.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.169
Endless fire.

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:29.550
Payback time.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.640
Thank you very much for watching - and until
next time, farewell.
