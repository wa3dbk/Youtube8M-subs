00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:05.581
- Spider-Man is not only one
of Marvel's biggest heroes,

00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:07.978
but one of the biggest
heroes on the entire planet.

00:00:07.978 --> 00:00:10.457
He's also my personal favorite
comic book super hero.

00:00:10.457 --> 00:00:11.717
I just love the web slinger,

00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:14.439
especially the sound that
his web slinging makes.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:15.739
Thwip.

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.974
It's certainly a commonly
used onomatopoeia

00:00:17.974 --> 00:00:20.697
throughout Spidey's comic book career,

00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:22.749
and it's also just fun to say.

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:23.548
Thwip.

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:25.844
Welcome to Flashpoint, a
new show to end all shows.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:28.060
Basically this is where I'm
going to quickly discuss

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.847
any miscellaneous comic book trivia

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:32.975
that doesn't fit into any of
the other shows that we have.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:35.942
I'm Scott, and today we're
talking web shooters.

00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:37.445
Peter Parker created his web shooters

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:38.664
all the way back in his first appearance

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:40.371
in Amazing Fantasy number 15

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:43.195
because if you're gonna
be a spider themed hero,

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:45.308
you're gonna need some kind of webbing.

00:00:45.308 --> 00:00:46.954
The web shooters are devices that he wears

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:50.590
on his wrist that shoot out a
highly pressurized web fluid.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.786
And the sound effect that web fluid makes

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.304
when Spidey shoots it
off is the classic sound

00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:57.987
that we all know and love, thwip.

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:00.525
But that wasn't always the case.

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:03.146
It started out as a whizzzzt
in his first appearance,

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.207
then it slowly developed over the years

00:01:05.207 --> 00:01:08.043
into a twnnnng, a thwap, a thyup,

00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:09.668
a whipp, a whap, and a zap

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:12.269
before finally landing on thwip

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:14.219
in Amazing Spider-Man number 28.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.479
Did I just have a stroke?

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.307
I've seen a misconception
passed around the internet

00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:18.790
in regards to the sound effect.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.350
It's the idea that Marvel owns a trademark

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.630
on the word thwip.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.231
The sites I found don't always
include a source to this,

00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:27.750
but when they do, they always link back to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.594
the same Wikipedia
article about onomatopoeia

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:33.358
that doesn't actually mention anything

00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:34.881
about the sound effect thwip,

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.213
let alone the idea that
Marvel owns a trademark on it.

00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:39.351
So what are we to do?

00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:41.342
How can we possibly find the answer?

00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:43.821
Well, we simply go straight
to the actual source

00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:45.995
of the information when
it comes to trademarks,

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:47.418
in this case the website of the

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:49.713
United States Patent and Trademark Office,

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.699
and do a very simple search for thwip.

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:54.223
And what do we find?

00:01:54.223 --> 00:01:55.462
Absolutely nothing.

00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:56.966
There does not appear to be any kind

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:59.953
of registered trademark on
file for the word thwip.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.330
I have no idea how this rumor got started.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.524
And just to be clear, the
website also allows us

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.206
to search for both live
and dead trademarks.

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:10.436
And we still found nothing,
meaning that if at one time

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:12.590
Marvel did have a trademark on thwip,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.658
but abandoned it, we should
still be able to find it.

00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:18.096
Marvel does, however, have
a registered trademark

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.782
for the sound effect snikt,

00:02:19.782 --> 00:02:21.712
the sound that Wolverine's claws make.

00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:23.723
That we do have evidence of.

00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:25.877
I hope we finally put this rumor to rest.

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:27.848
If you guys have a favorite
sound effect in comics,

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:31.139
or just wanna make one up
for your everyday life,

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.008
or one for NerdSync even, I don't know,

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:34.796
let me know in the comments below.

00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:36.260
And if this is your first
time hanging out with us

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.966
here at NerdSync, we make
new videos every week

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:40.587
that ask questions and examine
comics beyond the surface

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:43.045
because we believe that
doing so can actually

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:45.036
enhance your comic book reading experience

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:47.697
and make comics just a
little bit more awesome,

00:02:47.697 --> 00:02:49.485
