00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.159
Hi I’m Dee Schlotter, National Color Brand Manager for PPG Pittsburgh Paints. 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:16.070
We are at a beautiful Model Home in a Heartland Homes Community

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.019
called Pinecrest, here in the North Hills.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.259
This living area and this living spaces has
become

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.519
the new living space for homeowners
today. It’s not your traditional

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.710
living room, it's an open space area that
opens into the kitchen and into the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.720
eating area.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.930
So you have a space to gather with your
family, a common space.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.230
And the space has very high ceilings
typically

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.520
and it's a very open
space that a family can be together

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.150
no matter where there are.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.660
The colors 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.650
extremely important throughout the
entire house

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.280
in every single room.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740
And especially now,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.310
even though you continue to see neutrals,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.860
through the house, which are very
common colors, colors that people are

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.660
very comfortable with

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.650
and that go with any furniture fabric, or
flooring,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.460
We’re still seeing a lot of
opportunity for accent walls, like the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.890
blue wall behind me.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.890
Or pulling in color other
ways, like through pillows and accessories.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.450
We see the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.720
 continual revival of color

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.130
in the trends coming for 2013

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.820
the last two years we've seen,
again moving away from the greys,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.070
and the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.760
really

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.760
almost somber depression era colors,
to a much more robust, fun, big color.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.600
For example, 2012, the biggest
color the year was a clean red, so it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.820
was a very beautiful clean, bright red
and we saw a throughout all the textile

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.950
market, pillows and fabrics that we
saw coming

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.119
in fashion.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.759
The other big color of the year was Tangerine
Orange, which was this is really

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.880
nice bright clean orange, very happy
colors... big colors; based on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.200
where we were two years ago. In 2012 that trends going to
continue.
0:02:12.200,0:02:16.550
The blue you see behind me, is going to be one
of those trend colors. It’s less

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.739
green those aquas become a little more
blue, for next year. So’s a

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.629
great color to use.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.349
Again these colors that we see in
this room the beige, the cream

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.469
colors are still very

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.389
popular colors, in fact our most
popular paint colors. But the trends

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.660
are still moving towards those big,
bold

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.709
clean colors.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.369
The other piece that we see in color trends
for next year are pastels; and a lot of

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.319
people cringe when they hear the pastels
because, they're worried about the

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.209
eighties those awful pastels! But they're
much more creamy pastels, so they’re

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.129
softened and... you're going to see a
lot of that coming in fashion for

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.430
next spring and those colors will come
into home decor

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.919
the second half of next year!
