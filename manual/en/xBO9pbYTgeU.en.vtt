Hi my name's Elizabeth and I'm speaking on
behalf of expert village. We're talking about

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.100
training parrots. Now one very useful tool
I wanted to talk to you about when training

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.780
parrots especially some of the more intelligent
birds like african greys, cockatoos, and amazons

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.830
but it works also with cockatiels. These birds
are very, they're flock birds they learn a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210
lot by observing other members of their flock
and in a household environment you are this

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.650
birds flock. So a lot of times if you wanna
teach your bird that something's good to eat

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.989
or how to do something simply demonstrating
it yourself seems to help the bird understand

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.510
this concept. For instance if you take a piece
of corn and you offer it to your bird and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.010
the bird's like I'm not eating that what are
you giving me a rock and you ingest it and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.269
your like oh this is so good and then offer
the piece of corn to your bird a lot of times

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.989
in that way they'll be like oh well one of
my flock members ate it it must be edible

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.530
and therefore want it. Sometimes just the
fact of observing you eat it makes them this

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.309
oh well I want what you have and that will
also motivate them to have some interest in

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.740
it. Another thing is that greys are constantly
competing for attention or other parrots are

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.700
constantnly competing for attention so if
you're paying attention to another person

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.850
in your house if you've ever been having a
conversation and the bird's just escalating

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.460
the noise higher and higher it's because your
not paying attention to them. So there just

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.610
trying to find a way to compete. So one of
the ways if they see that Ronan is getting

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.299
a treat for doing a particular behavior they
may try and imitate, either Missy bird or

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.340
Karen in the background, might try to imitate
that behavior to try and get what Ronan has.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.579
An example of watching by observations I can
show Ronan here that I've got this nut and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.310
this seed ball and put it into a paper bag
and crumple it up and you can see he's watching

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.229
what I'm doing and then offer it to him and
just by observation Ronan now know that there's

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.299
something inside that paper bag that he wants.
Otherwise he might not have ever opened it

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.530
he'd just be like it's trash. I think he gave
up because it was kinda big and heavy. Also

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.159
these birds are a little bit nervous being
in front of a camera and with a lot of other

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.841
distractions going on right here but you will
find in a quite environment at home if you

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:15.300
simply demonstrate for your bird what you
want a lot of times these birds will try simple

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.390
behaviors like bobbing up and down or nodding
a lot of times will cause that same behavior

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.590
in their bird in imitation. Again normally
Ronan would happily bob with me but I think

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.870
again he's very nervous and seems to not want
to participate in this game but this is another

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.939
way of training your bird that you might try
at home.
