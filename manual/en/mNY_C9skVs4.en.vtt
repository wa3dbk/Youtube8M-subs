00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.209
We are putting makeup Ricky and Kian today,
and I'm going to go look at their house.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.980
From what I hear, it's a big ol' house with
not a lot in it.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.090
Other than four young boys.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.090
What a dream!

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.090
It's Grace's Faces.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.090
Grace's Faces.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.790
I touch their stuff and then I leave.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.720
Okay, while Ricky is getting his makeup done,
I get to touch their stuff!

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.510
And, this could not be more predicted.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.319
Is there some Boy Bible somewhere that says
that when two or more boys live together,

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.550
you have to own whey protein?

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.170
Let's taste it!

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.230
This is like the cinnamon challenge.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.979
Except that it clumps up together instantly.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.729
I would say not too bad!

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.769
Clearly they open the refrigerator like this.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.549
These boys are super healthy.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:02.519
They're making me feel really bad about my
life because my fridge is like, four jars

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.259
of pickles and two hot sauces.

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.909
And like a couple of bottles of vodka.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:07.909
You know what I'm going to do?

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.259
I'm going to clean their fridge for them because
I'm a nice human being.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.789
This is not what I anticipated when I started
doing this web series.

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:19.609
This is one of the people that live in this
house.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.740
He's famous.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.070
And now we're upstairs for the room portion
of the tour.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.460
Let's go check out, I think this is where
Ricky's room.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.850
It has a lot of smiling stuffed animals.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.700
And they're all looking almost through my
eyes and into my soul.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.810
And a bubblegum beany pillow.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.810
That's fun.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.460
Oh, and a VidCon pillow.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.119
But the couch is noticeably on the ground
so maybe he's some sort of zen master / serial

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.119
killer.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.119
I don't know.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.520
I'm not a scientist, but I can deduce that
this bunny food might indicate that there's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.520
a bunny in here!

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.969
I don't know why but I feel like I need to
be quiet around a bunny.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.340
Their ears are just so big.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.260
Oh, and I see it.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.800
And yes, that is my effect on people.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.530
I make them run into their houses and hide.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.730
Bun-Buns, I know I said some things that I
didn't mean but I don't want us to keep going

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.280
like this, okay?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.080
I think Ricky likes tank tops.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.710
I'm not totally sure, but I think he might
enjoy tank tops as a clothing option.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.560
19, 20, 21, 22, 22 tank tops.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.240
Plus he's wearing one in our video.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.530
That's 23 tank tops.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.040
That's almost a tank top for every day of
the month.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.230
You're going to go on the rack together.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.420
And oops!

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.680
And that's exactly how I found it.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680
What is this?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680
BOP!

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.530
Magazine
So, he either loves One Direction or I have

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.340
a feeling that they're in this magazine.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.770
There they are.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.770
There's O2L.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.140
Just hanging out.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.520
All of them right there.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.520
Oh look!

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.440
I'm in the magazine too!

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.880
Why didn't they tell me?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:31.320
I wore the perfect shirt for this today.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.840
What boy's room doesn't have a bag full of
wigs?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.490
There's so many beautiful choices.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.750
Oh god.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.880
Whoops.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.010
Okay.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.340
This seems natural.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.340
Wow.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:54.440
Sometimes you just need to take a look at
yourself in the mirror, and realize what your

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.500
life has become.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.650
What is this show even about?

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.480
I don't know.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.260
Great question, Me.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.010
Just swallow your pride and keep going.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.150
Hey Buns, look.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.430
I made some changes and I just want to chat.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.720
Okay.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.010
Okay.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.100
You need time to heal.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.280
Thank you for the wonderful time.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.550
Now let's go into this room that it looks
like I shouldn't go in here.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.550
It's a thing!

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.120
I found a thing!

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.180
Come with me, Person!

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.030
I gotta put my camera down.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.030
Let's go!

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.030
We found it.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.030
C'mon!

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.230
Let's go back and see how they're doing!

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.120
Now, Kian is getting his makeup done so let's
go through his stuff.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.930
Okay, he has the same type of bed-futon shennanigans
happening but he's chosen to lift his up off

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.010
the ground.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.850
Interesting choice.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.010
We have lights.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.010
Clearly makes videos.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.300
And we have his camera going.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.840
Hello, Kian's audience.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.170
Say hello to the Grace's Faces audience.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.850
Oh my god, I don't know where to look.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.240
And my head is getting dizzy.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.530
What teenage boy doesn't have a poster of
ducks?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.330
These are fake.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.139
These are fake!

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.600
Everything's a lie!

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.780
The boy likes to rave.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.960
I'm into that.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.430
Yup.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.520
This is what boys do, right?

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.340
Here we go.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.340
Whoops.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.340
Oh no.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.040
Come back my friend.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.860
I feel like a boy.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.770
I want to go skateboarding and touch t*ts.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.220
You need at least 12 more tank tops.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.590
And we have a small snack section.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.300
Someone's got territory issues with keeping
their snacks in the kitchen.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.800
Okay, that's it for this part 1 of TYS.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.190
Surprise, there's going to be two parts!

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.250
Because there are more rooms in this house
for me to touch stuff in.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.030
Make sure you check out the main video, and
don't forget to subscribe to I love makeup

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.460
and to O2L.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.460
BYE!

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.020
It's Grace's Faces.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.300
Grace's Faces.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.630
I touch their stuff and then I leave.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.770
Hey beauties.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.000
I'm Teni from MissMaven.com and I'm so excited
to be here sharing my "Beauty Do's, Don'ts,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.580
&amp; Duhs"
What's up guys?

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.510
So we're on the set of Madilyn Bailey and
Tyler Ward's new music video and we're going

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.530
to be doing makeup.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.530
Hi.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.530
How's it going?

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.530
That's a watermelon.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.380
It is, and that's a fresh face!

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.380
Yes!

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.460
Girl, you look good!

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.300
Why thank you.
