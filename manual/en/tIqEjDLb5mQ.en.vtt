(Huskies howling) 
"Aroooooo!"

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.920
- Look what you got?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.180
Shelby, look!

Dinner for later!

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.580
You can't!  We need a can opener!

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.780
Nice try!

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.280

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.640
Is that, your birthday present?

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.440
I'll take it out of package.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.180
Will take it out of package for you!

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.280
Are you trying to eat it out of package?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820
Will get it out for you!

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.340
Shelby!  Look!

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.720

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.440
Happy birthday Shelby!

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.340
Just like a little kid having to defrost it first!

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.120
You got the frosting on the grass!

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.120
Now, is time for ice cream!

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.860
Good stuff?  Happy birthday!

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.300
You get ice cream too!

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.040
I'm not holding it for you!

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.340
Get your ice cream!

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.080
Good stuff!

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300
Trying to pick how you want to eat first?
