Rita from Boise writes, "my three boys and
their families come over for Thanksgiving

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.790
day every year and I'm always expected to
cook the entire meal.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.390
I just turned 72 and quite frankly, I don't
feel much like preparing all that food and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.920
I can't imagine that I would even be able
to lift the turkey in and out of the oven.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.760
My sons are worthless in the kitchen and I
don't want them to think I'm lazy.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.970
What should I do?"

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.190
Rita, I wonder if it's possible that the boys
think you want to do Thanksgiving dinner and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.000
would be heartbroken if anyone suggested that
they should begin taking turns hosting holiday

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.590
meals.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.890
After all, are these not the same sons who
think babysitting their children is your greatest

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.310
pleasure in life?

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.340
If you can't bring yourself to suggest that
it's time to pass the torch, I think the answer

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.170
is pizza.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.330
I would suggest that pizza is now an acknowledged
American tradition.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.650
You don't have to get up early to bake pizza
for hours.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.410
You don't have to have innumerable side dishes.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.610
You can choose a number of large pizzas, a
family sized salad, and maybe—because it

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.390
is a holiday—several dozen breadsticks,
all of which can be delivered and all of which

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.280
you can lift in and out of the oven without
breaking a sweat.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.320
If anyone suggests that it would be unpatriotic
to replace turkey with pizza, agree with them

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:07.530
and ask what you can bring to their house
for Thanksgiving dinner.
