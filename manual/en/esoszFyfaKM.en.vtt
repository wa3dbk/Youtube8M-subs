Hey guys, John here with realtruck.com.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:08.070
Today I want to show you how to install the
Husky Liner Custom Molded Mud Flaps on this

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:28.859
2015 GMC Sierra.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.439
As you guys can see here, we got it all laid
out everything you need to put these on the

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.829
truck comes included in the kit.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.680
You have your rear set and your front set.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.190
And which if you guys are going to do the
front and rear you'll need to order two separate

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.780
sets for that because these come in pairs,
two for the front two for the rear.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.199
Also they come with all the hardware and such
that you need to get it installed on to the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.199
truck.

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.039
So lets get these onto the truck.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.269
Alright guys, the first thing that we are
going to do is we are going to go ahead and

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.059
remove the factory screws down here at the
bottom that hold our fender flare on so we're

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:16.960
going to pull those out and get ready to put
our custom molded mud guard on here so let's

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.770
get these out of here.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:44.080
Alright once we have those tightened or started,
we can go ahead and tighten those down.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:02:00.430
And 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.950
then the next thing we are going to do is
we're going to drill a hole right here where

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.759
we already have a hole in our mud guard we're
just going to drill through there and install

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.769
one of the screws that are provided in the
hardware kit.

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.930
Now we got everything setup and ready to go
what we are going to do is take an 1/8 inch

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.290
drill bit and we're just going to drill a
hole through this top hole that is already

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.090
in the mud guard into our fender area and
then attach one of the provided screws that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.580
comes in our hardware kit.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:03:02.400
So let's get that hole drilled so we can get
this on the truck.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.490
Alright guys there you go, that's how easy
it is to install these front ones.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.770
We're going to jump over and do the one on
the other side and then I'm going to come

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.140
back and show you guys how to do the ones
for the rear.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.489
The other side, same way as this one.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.970
So let's do it.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.860
So now we're ready to install our rear ones
and it's really simple to install them as

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.860
well.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.830
What we're going to do is we're going to hold
them up here in place where they go, make

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.159
sure that it's all even and flush up against
this factory fender flare.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:36.260
Then we're going to take our marking pencil
and we're just going to mark the holes that

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:47.290
are in the flap already and then that will
tell us where we need to drill our holes to

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.730
install the screws that came in the hardware
kit to get this on the truck.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.140
So, I'm going to grab a drill and get these
drilled out and be ready to put this on the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.140
truck.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.239
Alright guys as you can see here that in order
to make this easier to drill this out, we've

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.340
gone ahead and jacked up the vehicle and take
the tire off.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.610
Make sure that when you do that, you put some
jack stands or something underneath your vehicle

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.909
so it doesn't fall on you when you're doing
this and then we're going to drill these out

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.370
and get that mud guard on here.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:32.910
So, let's get these drilled out.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:05:05.220
Now what we're doing here again, we're just
going along and getting these screws started

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.030
and once we get them started and make sure
that everything is lining up properly then

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:19.560
we'll go back and tighten these down and put
our wheel back on.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:29.160
Okay as you guys can see here now, everything
lined up perfectly so at this point we can

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.020
go ahead and tighten these down, put our tire
back on, and that will complete our installation

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.240
of our rear mud guards.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:06:01.410
Okay guys there you have it.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.880
That's how quick, simple, and easy it is to
install these Husky Liner Custom Molded Mud

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.389
Flaps onto your truck, so until next time,
happy motoring.
