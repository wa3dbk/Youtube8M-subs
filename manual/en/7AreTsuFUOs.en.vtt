00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.950
Two men enter and two men shall leave

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.940
but each must answer now my questions three

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.980
preekotos omnipitos romneytos schieffertos freetos obamatos

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.810
How could we ship all these jobs to Shanghai,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.260
when America invented the chicken pot pie?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.690
We have brought cases against china for violating trade rules

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.910
We are going to insist that china plays by the same rules

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.730
They're hacking into our computers

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.950
counterfeiting our goods, stealing our intellectual property

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.560
our patents, our designs

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.690
China's a potential partner if it's following the rules

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.230
We want to trade with them,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.050
but you gotta play by the rules

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.870
Now that we're finally bringing troops home

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.400
won't the Afghans be lonely when they're all alone?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.230
When Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.050
there's no reason why Americans should die

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.260
The Taliban they're gonna come rushing back in when we go

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.290
the Afghan forces have to be able to provide security

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780
Why should you run the show?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.200
We decimated Al-Qaeda's core

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.930
Tell us cause we need to know!

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.530
I want to bring jobs back to our shores

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050
Two more weeks until we vote

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.680
We need to have strong allies

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.210
Who can really run the show

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.150
My strategy's to go after the bad guys

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.400
Is the threat from Iran getting overblown

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.720
or should I use my Xbox to bomb them with drones?

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.230
Their economy is in shambles

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.970
we organized the strongest sanctions in history

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.080
crippling sanctions do work

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.980
you're seeing it now

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.380
I'm glad Romney agrees

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.890
They wanna see Israel wiped off the map

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.590
If Israel's attacked, we have their back

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.230
Israel's a true friend

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.950
America will stand with them

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950
Should we increase our military size

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.300
so we can keep killing every single bad guy?

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.820
Our navy is smaller now than any time since 1917

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.010
I want to make sure that we have the ships

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.850
that are required by our navy

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.450
You mentioned that we have fewer ships,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.880
we also have fewer horses and bayonets

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940
because our military's changed.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.480
Why should you run the show?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.180
We decimated Al-Qaeda's core

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.790
Tell us cause we need to know!

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.490
I want to bring jobs back to our shores

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.010
Two more weeks until we vote

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.650
We need to have strong allies

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.250
Who can really run the show

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:24.130
My strategy's to go after the bad guys

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.760
Schieffer out, now I'm bout to go home

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.470
been a long day, so it's time to get my drank on

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.010
90 minutes i've been spittin bout our foreign policy

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.930
90 minutes i'll be sippin on a glass of Hennessy

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.340
Let me leave you with a thought from my mom

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.400
