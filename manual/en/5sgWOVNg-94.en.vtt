00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.340
Good day! My name is Elena Nazarenko. And this is our third lesson.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.720
Today we will examine elements such as snake snake forward and back, and simple rotation.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.800
Please, if you have any questions, please write them in the comments.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.220
In order to have turned the snake forward recall the promise of the body (the body is above the legs)

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.100
Movement is created by combining work hips, knees and feet.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:56.200
Note the arms and shoulders still. Sat down on a knee and foot painted in a semicircle, and in the opposite direction.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.600
The movement is somewhat reminiscent of Arabic dance, while due to send the body forward is a movement forward.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.480
Snake ago performed similarly to the snake forward, with one exception created by the movement of the foot,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.920
then drawn semicircle knees and ends at the top of the movement at the hip.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.640
That is, if the snake forward movement is created from the top down, the snake back from the bottom to the top.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.220
When combined with the snake turns, pay attention to the formulation of housing.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.740
Body twisted inside the snake. Thus, it creates a stable position.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.180
In order to combine the snake with rotations remember the second lesson

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.200
When turning - the motion is the lower and middle parts of the body, the feet - knees - thighs.

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:52.454
Unlearn rotation.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.520
The rotation is due to the combination of footwork and body.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.700
The right hand with the arm creates a helical motion

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.980
and the right foot helps speed dial, thereby shifting the center of the left side.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.260
To avoid dizzy necessary to look at a static thing.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.360
In our case it is the hand. It is located just below eye level.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.440
Starting rotation is necessary with two or three revolutions, gradually increasing the number of revolutions.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.680
This concludes our lesson is over. Try as much as possible to repeat these elements

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.780
and then they will turn out you have free and easy
