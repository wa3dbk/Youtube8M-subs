John: Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.610
So Bill Gates is encouraging people to make
videos about what it means to be human.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.850
There's actually a contest, you can win money
and stuff.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.850
Link in the dooblydoo.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.550
But as it happens over the last 3 years I've
been thinking a lot about this question because

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.830
I've been trying to write a novel about what
it means to be human and how we define personhood

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.390
and why those definitions matter.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.839
I've also been writing a lot about tortoises,
but that's less directly relevant here.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.650
All right, so first off I find all of the,
like, biological definitions of humanness

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.550
completely uninteresting because we all kind
of just know that there's something to personhood

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.289
other than just all being members of the same
species.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.210
Like, we know this partly because most of
us believe that humans have a seemingly unique

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.260
consciousness or soul or whatever.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.270
But we also know that personhood is more than
just a species category because we can constantly

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.859
see people denying other people's humanity
even though we're all members of the same

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:46.859
species.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.590
This happens at a macro level when governments,
for instance, refuse to acknowledge the very

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.629
existence of certain ethnic minorities.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.960
And it happens on a micro level every time
I dehumanize someone by imagining them as

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.460
less complex than myself.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.550
Like, it's easy for me to understand that
I contain multitudes, but rather than understanding

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.670
that of other people, too often I imagine
them as merely sick or merely poor or merely

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.991
'them' to some 'us' that includes me.

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:15.329
Hank, for me at least, the deeper I dig, the
harder it becomes to understand what makes

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:16.329
people, people.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.950
For instance, I often hear that what makes
us human is that we can share stories across

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.950
generations.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.670
And I do absolutely believe in the power of
narrative, but there are many people who can't

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.470
hear or tell stories, like people with certain
intellectual disabilities, for instance.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.130
And yet, they are still people.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.189
Or we often associate reading and writing
with humanness, but there are many people

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.150
who can't read or write, and often they're
marginalized people, the people whose humanity

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.829
most needs to be acknowledged.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.090
The same goes for many definitions of humanness:
they often exclude the poorest or the sickest

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.370
or the most oppressed.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.930
And those narrow definitions of humanness
can be very dangerous.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.729
Like one dramatic example is that for many
centuries, Europeans and white Americans denied

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.259
the essential humanity of black people as
a justification for chattel slavery.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.670
But that's not just a problem of history,
like, to be treated as a full human in the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.650
world today, you may need not just a human
body and a human spirit but also an ID card

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.899
attesting to a particularly citizenship.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.510
And wealth and race and sex and class and
many other things can all factor into how

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.430
human the world treats you.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.390
So what can we say inclusively of humans?

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.569
Well, we tend to be capable of empathy and
collaboration and hope.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.260
But in these respects I don't think we're
unique among animals.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.230
It seems to me that to get even remotely universal
and yet specific, we have to be very weirdly

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.260
careful with our wording, like: when able
to access and comprehend the teachings of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.680
our ancestors, we tend to value them.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.090
Here's what I really believe Hank: I believe
that we confer personhood upon each other

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.440
through empathy and compassion and trust.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.110
Like, stuck inside the prison of my own consciousness,
I have no way of independently verifying that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.790
other people even are really human.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.769
Like, it's possible that everyone else is
just a super realistic humanoid robot, and

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.800
I am the only actual feeling human on earth,
but I choose not to believe that.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.080
I believe that when we acknowledge each other's
consciousness and complexity, we lead better

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.849
lives and feel less alone in our grief and
our joy.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.811
Basically I believe that we're human because
we believe in each other's humanness, and

00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:12.470
because we can listen, and we can work together
to alleviate each other's suffering.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.769
And in that sense, I guess being human is
both something that we are and something that

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.659
we must always aspire to be.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:18.870
Now of course, I might be wrong.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.870
I often am.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.180
That's quite human as well I think.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.740
So Hank, nerdfighters, I'm very interested
in knowing what you think it means to be human.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.099
Let's continue to conversation in comments
or via the link below.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.450
Hank, I will see you on Friday.
