00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.010
We knew kids were hungry.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.250
We knew that most of what was happening as
far as their food intake during the week was

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.771
at school, because we had a breakfast program
and we have a lunch program and we knew a

00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:20.619
lot of these kids were not having anything
for dinner.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.490
So what's the next question?

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.070
If this is what they are eating during the
week, what are they eating on the weekend?

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.320
And I think that’s probably where the backpack,
my logic says that that’s where the back

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.190
idea came from, is that let’s provide food
for a family of, I think it's about four for

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.020
the weekend so that these kids don’t come
back to us on Monday morning ravenous.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.840
I am Claire Nelson and I’m the Family Care
Coordinator here at Clinton Elementary.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.230
I am kind of like their grandma.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.420
I don’t know any other way to put it really.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.510
Scott Young, Executive Director of Food Bank
of Lincoln.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.280
Born in Lincoln, Nebraska.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.350
Caring about people in poverty is not an easy
thing.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.340
It can challenge our own values about what
it is we value on ourselves and our families.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.700
So this piece about handing food to people
is, it’s more than giving and receiving

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.579
it’s about sharing with each other.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.789
My name is Alynn Sampson and I’m the Child
Hunger Programs Director at the Food Bank

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:18.789
of Lincoln.

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.079
I grew up in Lincoln, I’m a product of Lincoln
Public School, so all of this work is very

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.149
close to my heart.

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.530
When we look at Clinton Elementary School
we come in here, and we see so many different

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.759
faces and we hear so many different languages,
and you see them loving each other.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.759
These kids don’t care is kids don’t care
where their friend came from or what language

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.679
that they’re speaking, because when they
are out on the play ground it doesn’t matter.

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.709
And I think that’s a great model for adults
to see is, that really pushes us forward that,

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.259
you know it’s it is a beautiful thing.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.170
I grew up here, we spoke one language and
that was it, and teachers were asked to teach

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.859
kids that spoke English.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.850
And now here at Clinton Elementary School
they're asked to teach kids that do speak

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.389
20 different languages who have hunger issues
and poverty issues, but they feel completely

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:09.170
loved here at Clinton.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.560
We have people that go off and it's not just
because they move, it’s because their life

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.909
has changed, they are making okay money, they
can provide now.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.959
And I can't tell you, often how proud that
child is or that parent is to come in and

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.709
say, “You know what Miss Claire, I don’t
need the backpack anymore, give it to somebody

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.290
who needs it.”

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.519
Feeding people is powerful.
