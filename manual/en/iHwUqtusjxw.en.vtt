00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:22.045
There's aquatics, there's cycling, like there's so many opportunities on campus to just  
 get involved and do just about any sport you can think of. 

00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:28.034
and you an just do it for fun, it doesn't have to be serious, you don't have to 
 have mad skills to do it, you can just get out there and have fun. 

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:32.864
I think it's a really positive thing that the university offers because it's 
 a chance for like people to get out and meet people. 

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:37.414
Like sometimes you walk in to these classes and people are really shy, 
 and by the end you're like making a dance together. 

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.006
And it's just, it's fun. It's a great way to meet people outside academics.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.960
Being a student it's very busy with academics and it's good 
 to have a balance; social, academic and athletic life.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:53.855
Well this is my first term playing dodge ball, but I think 
 every term I've been here I've played some different sports. 

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:58.517
I've played hockey, and basketball, and frisbee as well.

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:09.072
I learned martial arts, I learned new techniques, and I have fun while doing 
 it, and it's also good when I go to class  

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:16.219
after muay tai I'm always really attentive, and I know 
 that sounds kind of contradictory because, you know,

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:22.925
 it makes you tired but, it gets my blood pumping, 
 it improves my stamina, it gets me awake. 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.819
At my old university there wasn't a juggling club. I tried to start one,  and 
 it was very hard, and it didn't really work out in the end. 

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:35.291
and here is seems to be very well organized. There isn't really a 
 problem with funding which is actually a really good thing 

00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:36.877
because then you get good equipment.

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:42.800
When I started, tried to start, at my old university, that was 
 my biggest problem was that new clubs couldn't get funding 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.620
So it was impossible to make it take off without 
 spending hundreds of dollars out of my pocket. 

00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:52.800
and I was a poor undergrad at the time so 
 that didn't really work out so well. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.990
University life isn't all about just studying, it's a lot more than 
 that and having campus rec to always keep you active

00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:01.720
it's definitely an important thing to student life. 

00:02:02.717 --> 00:02:07.920
Normally when the semester gets busy, I stop practising my juggling, 
 but with the juggling club I go every week.

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:11.100
It gives me motivation to keep going.

00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:19.840
Overall I've been able to somewhat stay fit and just 
 have a good time playing different sports. 

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:24.640
I think, for sure, that when you're new at uWaterloo 
 it's really important to get involved in different programs.

00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:29.520
like if you just want a shoe tag, it means that you can 
 like go to any of the health and wellness programs, 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.560
or if you actually want to do a specific thing, like it'll explain all 
 of that to you, and be really nice and really friendly. 

00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:36.340
Do it.
