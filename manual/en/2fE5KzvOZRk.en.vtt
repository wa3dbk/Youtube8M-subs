00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.840
Today, I'm going to show you how to make portable soup.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.320
Portable soup was very popular in the 18th Century for many good reasons.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.240
Thanks for joining us today on 18th Century Cooking with James Townsend and Son.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.720
So let's talk a little bit about what portable soup is.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.640
It's a very concentrated form of essence of meat, sort of like a solidified broth, and in the time period

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.080
they used it like we would use soup bouillon today.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.029
It goes by many different names; in period texts you'll see it as portable soup, portable broth,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.680
pocket soup, veal glue - I like this one - portmanteau potage and the list goes on and on.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.500
Portable soup was extremely convenient. It doesn't take up very much space, it's very light,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.200
it's a very condensed food source, and it's very flavorful in that very condensed form.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.900
It was used by the military, by travellers...

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.880
[It was] even used as an invalid food source at times, especially aboard ships, so it was used in many different situations

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.760
but it was very difficult to make, especially in a home setting.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.360
It took a long period of time to make.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.280
You have to watch it all the time because if you turn your back on it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.740
and it got too hot it would ruin all your work, so it was very laborious.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.920
It was even industrialized in the 18th century.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.740
Even if you're not a historical reenactor yet, this portable soup makes an excellent homemade

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.760
flavor booster that's all natural. You can use it in sauces, soups, gravies, so it's great for that.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.700
Now, if you watched our recent bone broth video, this recipe starts off exactly the same way.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.300
You can do this over a [slow] open fire, you can do it on your stovetop, or

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.270
since you're probably doing this at home, and you want to make this easy; I really suggest using a slow cooker.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.800
I'm using a medium-size slow cooker. It'll hold about 5 pounds of meat.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.880
If you want to make a larger batch, I suggest using a kitchen roaster.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.940
The meat I'm using is beef shank, similar to what we used in our bone broth video.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.460
Beef shank is a hard-working muscle, so it's a tough cut of meat.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.500
It has a lot of collagen in it which makes it especially good for this recipe.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.560
Another good cut of beef would be the neck bone. Other cuts will work, but just not as well.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.740
Now this can be done with poultry; you can boil that in water and that will be the basis of this portable soup.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.980
So you can go ahead and place your meat in your slow cooker and cover it with water.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.660
Most of the recipes we found suggested adding nothing else:

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.760
[because] seasoning can come later when it's actually used as the portable soup.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.040
Some of the recipes suggest using only the meat, other ones include the bones.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.040
and that's what we're doing in the recipe today.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.880
Turn your slow cooker on low and go about your business for the next eight to ten hours.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.320
Once the time has gone by, remove the meat. You can now pick it clean of the bones and any remaining gristle and fat.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.980
This is really good tasting beef... At this point turn off your slow cooker and let it cool completely.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.900
As it cools the fat on the top will solidify making it very easy to remove.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.600
Once you're done with that, strain your broth and filter it through a piece of cloth to get out all the settled particles of meat. So go ahead and rinse out your slow

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.040
cooker and return to clarified broth to it and turn it back on low

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.640
Let it go and leave the lid off; let it cook for anywhere from 18 to 24 hours.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.200
What we're doing at this stage in the process is reducing the broth down to a gelatin.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.280
Gelatin is an interesting thing: don't expect to be able to reduce this down into a hard block.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.820
What you end up with is a nice, medium brown gluey substance.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.040
If you overcook it, you will burn it, giving it a very, very, unpleasant taste.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.300
Once your soup reaches this stage turn off your slow cooker and let it cool completely.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.840
Then you can turn the gel out onto a cloth

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.960
Now the soup is still very gelatinous, to get it to the point where you can store it, put it in your pocket, [et cetera] it needs to be dried.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.280
Now, you cannot do this with heat. Any temperature of heat, will just turn this into a liquid again;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.220
and then you'll just burn it. So it needs to be done without heat, you can do this in a dehydrator,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.180
but you need to make sure the dehydrator doesn't heat anything up.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.960
The period recipe actually suggests turning it out on to a

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.300
woollen flannel cloth, just like we've done here and flipping it over two or three times a day for

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.600
10 days or two weeks or so. If you want to speed this process up at home, put this on a cooling rack and

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.160
put it in front of a fan, and it'll dry out in a couple of days.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.660
The end results will be a very stiff paste.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.149
It's almost like leather. You're going to cut this up into chunks and then

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.080
wrap it up in paper or something similar to store it away. It'll continue to harden as it ages

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.680
But it's completely usable in this leathery, hard form.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.260
In our last episode we made a spring soup, we use the portable soup as the base for that,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.500
so make sure to go back and check out that video.
