00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:12.469
The history of Janome is a story of innovation.
It began more than 90 years ago with the idea

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:22.449
of one man. And now, has grown into a sewing
machine company spanning the globe! In 1921

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:30.320
a Japanese entrepreneur named Yasaka Osa began
the Pine sewing machine company. It was his

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.850
country's first domestic sewing machine manufacturer.
At that time most machines used an oblong

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:46.410
shuttle type bobbin. But Mr. Osa had a better
idea. His machines used an innovative round

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.760
bobbin, a design that improved speed and efficiency.
This unique round bobbin reminded people of

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:04.650
a snake's eye and it soon earned the affectionate
nickname eye of the snake, in Japanese, Janome.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.290
This innovation proved so popular that in
1935 the name Janome was established as an

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.920
official trademark. And in 1949 the company
name was changed to the Janome sewing machine

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.030
company. Over the next 25 years, Janome grew
to become a household name in Japan, and seeking

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.130
to expand into the US the company purchased
New Home in 1960. Since then, the company

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:44.590
has established divisions in Canada, Mexico,
Europe, Australia and New Zealand. As well

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.660
as agents in Africa, Central and South America
and throughout the Pacific Rim of Asia. As

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.979
it is grown, Janome has given the sewing industry
many firsts. With the first research centre

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:11.039
for sewing machines in 1964. The first programmable
computerized machine in 1979. The first professional

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.140
style home embroidery machine in 1990. And
the first home embroidery machine to use technology

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.480
developed for high precision robotics. At
Janome, we're proud to say that with each

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.359
development we've brought more sewing enjoyment
for our customers. Each major step in our

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:41.859
history has come through innovation. And we
can hardly wait for what's coming next....
