00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.433
The Press:
What are your thoughts
about Mr. Barton's comments

00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:06.533
this morning?

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.900
The Vice President:
Well, since you know I never
say what's on my mind --

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.300
(laughter)

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.800
-- I probably shouldn't comment on Mr. Barton's comment.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.734
The Press:
Oh, come on.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:15.800
The Press:
Please --

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.767
The Press:
(pleading)

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:21.033
The Press:
Is it that bad?

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.600
The Vice President:
They're encouraging
me, what can I say?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.767
(laughter)

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:25.633
Mr. Gibbs:
Well, okay, you should --

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.033
The Vice President:
Look, look --

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.433
(laughter)

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:31.867
The Press:
How big of a deal was it?

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:35.800
(laughter)

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.233
The Vice President:
Thank God my mother
wasn't around.

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.066
(laughter)

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:44.700
Look, guys, I find it
incredibly insensitive,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.500
incredibly out of touch.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.633
The reason why I got
involved in politics,

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.400
the reason why the
President and I ran,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.100
the President got involved,
is the one primary role for

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.066
government is to protect people
who are being taken advantage

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:07.000
of; protect people who are in an
extreme straits and not able to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.567
take care of the
circumstances themselves.

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:16.934
I've been down in the bayou
area off and on for the last 36 years.

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:18.700
My daughter went
down to Tulane --

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.633
I was worried she was
not going to come home.

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:25.333
I think I know the area
relatively well as an outsider.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.600
There's an entire way
of life in jeopardy.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.066
This is just not about jobs.

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:36.433
This is just not about whether
or not the waterfowl is polluted

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:42.000
and you can't fish -- this is an entire way of life that's in jeopardy.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.834
And to sit there and
say that we're being --

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.100
in effect, as I understood
the statement --

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.900
that he was ashamed we're being
tough on an oil company who

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.800
caused the problem
-- I mean, I --

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.266
look, I just think that it's
pretty important to the people

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.767
of Louisiana all the way through
Florida and even in his home

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:10.867
state of Texas that people
disassociate themselves from that.

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:13.400
That's not the role --
there's no shakedown.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.000
It's insisting on responsible
conduct and a responsible

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.300
response to something
they caused.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.900
And I find it outrageous to
suggest that if, in fact,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.233
we insisted that BP demonstrate
their preparedness,

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:38.734
to put aside billions
of dollars --

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:42.233
in this case, $20 billion -- to take care of the immediate needs

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:49.166
of people who are drowning -- these guys don't have deep pockets.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.800
The guy who runs
the local marina,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.533
the guy who has
one shrimping boat,

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:58.166
the guy who has one
small business --

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:04.700
he can't afford to lose $10,000, $12,000, $15,000, $30,000 a month.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.333
And so the thing
the President did --

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:10.133
and I was so proud of him -- is when we had the meeting with BP

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.433
-- and they were
cooperative in the meeting.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:13.934
They were cooperative.

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.467
He said, look, what I want you
to do is take care of those

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:22.033
people now who, if they
don't get help now,

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:25.400
are going to be under, gone.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.533
Gone.

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:30.800
And I might add, this
fund is not a ceiling,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.133
and people can go back to it as
many times as they can prove

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:38.734
they have been damaged
and they need help.

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:43.633
And the cleanup costs are
all BP's costs, separate,

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:46.700
apart and above
that $20 billion.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.033
What is wrong with that?

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:53.500
How is that a shakedown?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.567
I mean, I just -- I don't know, I find it pretty astounding, the comment.
