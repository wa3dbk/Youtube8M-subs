00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
- Hey guys!

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.550
Today I am here with a very
special guest in my kitchen,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.580
Sara Lynn, from The Domestic Geek.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.010
If you don't already know of her channel,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.500
I encourage you to head
over there and subscribe.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.080
There, you will find some terrific tips

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.670
and techniques and shortcuts

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.160
to make you all a little bit
more creative in the kitchen.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Many of you may know her

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.760
because we've done some collabs together.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.360
But, she was in town this week and I said,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.320
"Sara, you've gotta
come over to my kitchen

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.270
"and show me how to make
a great lunch idea."

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.180
I know you guys are always
looking for great lunch ideas,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.290
and Sara has got a great one.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.750
So Sara Lynn, what are we making?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.050
- Oh, I am so excited Beth.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.760
Thank you so much for
having me in your kitchen.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.820
- You bet.
- It's so wonderful to be here.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.690
I'm super excited today to share with you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.350
my Classic Cobb Pita recipe.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.010
So, it's all the deliciousness
of classic Cobb salad

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.530
except for it's in a wrap.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.330
So, it's super easy, super portable.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.470
You can take it on the go.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.820
And the best part is, it incorporates

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.480
a whole lot of leftovers.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.130
So, we're starting with
some cooked chicken.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.740
Now this can be one of those
cooked grocery store chickens,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.210
or some leftover chicken
from the night before.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.710
And basically, I've just
chopped it into cubes.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.780
And then, we're going to
add to that some boiled egg.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.360
Now, what I love about this pita is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.270
that it's super protein-packed.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.250
So, it will keep you full until dinner.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.310
You won't be crashing
halfway through the day

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.840
and wanting to run to the vending machine.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.550
Which we all know is what happens, right?

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.360
So lots of protein at lunch
is always a good idea.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.000
So we're gonna add some boiled egg.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.280
Know what I like to do is boil
a dozen eggs on Sunday night,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.500
and then I have them all week long

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.990
for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.270
I incorporate them into
all sorts of recipes.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.940
- See, these are the
kinds of tips that you get

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.990
with The Domestic Geek.
- (laughs)

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.810
I love all of those tips.
That's great, genius.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.250
- You know, you just wanna
make your life simpler.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.480
It's not like it's not
complicated enough already.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.330
- It really is.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.020
- And to that, we are going
to add some chopped bacon.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.360
Now, you can leave the bacon
out if you are not into pork.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.050
That's totally fine, but I do find

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.360
it adds a bit of saltiness,
a nice little bite.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.460
Then, we are going to add our tomatoes.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.210
Now, I'm using some
chopped cherry tomatoes,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.060
super, super simple.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.640
You could use whole
tomatoes if you wanted.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.780
That would work just as well, no problem.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.220
And then, some avocado.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.750
Now, you know avocado
is a bit tricky in lunch

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.530
because everyone worries
about it going brown.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.610
Just because it's gone a little brown

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.770
doesn't mean it's still
not delicious to eat.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.290
Plus, it's gonna be covered in dressing,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.270
so you'll never know.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.980
Your kids will never know,
so don't worry about it.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.460
So, that's really the base of
any great Cobb salad, right?

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.700
- What could be simpler?
- Love it.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.520
- And now that we have
all this deliciousness

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.730
stacked up in this bowl,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.380
we're going to top it with
some blue cheese dressing.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.760
Now, I'm using a homemade
blue cheese dressing.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.410
This could not be simpler to put together.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.070
It's actually made with yogurt.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.490
- And if you guys wanna know the recipe

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.060
for this blue cheese
dressing, you can head over

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.520
to Sara Lynn's channel today.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.290
And there she has posted a video

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.990
showing five homemade dressings,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.930
and this is one of them.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.990
So click the annotation,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.440
and you can find out how to make it.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.040
- Homemade dressing really is the best.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.480
It's totally worth the
time investment I think.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.330
- It really is.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.850
- All right, so all we're gonna do is add

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.850
a tablespoon or two of dressing

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.430
to this amazing Cobb salad,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.170
concoction I should call it.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.120
And then, we are just going
to mix this all together.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.530
We're gonna get it all
really nicely combined.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.130
And the next step, all we're gonna do

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.660
is cut some whole wheat pitas in half.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.140
And then, we're gonna use
the pocket as the carrier

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.280
for all of this goodness.
- I love that.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.470
It's like a salad to go.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.500
It's the easiest way to eat a salad

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.060
if you had to have it on the go.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.770
- It really is, and it
wraps up so beautifully.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.770
Like you just wrap this
in some plastic wrap,

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.330
and you're good to go.
- And there you go.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.220
You know what's fun about this is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.400
I can see doing this with
like a Chicken Caesar,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.390
or a Mediterranean Salad.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.550
Any of your favorite salad
you could put in a pita.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.120
I love it.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.020
And sometimes you get burnt out

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.090
between having sandwiches
for lunch and having salads.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.430
This is like a sandwich salad.
- A hybrid.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.350
A wonderful hybrid.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.130
- Oh, and I get to do
the honors, oh thank you.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.800
Oh my gosh, this looks fantastic.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.640
All right, I'm goin' in. Here we go.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.630
Mmm. Oh, that's so good.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.040
- I'm so glad you like it.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.350
- You really gotta try this one.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.590
Tomatoes and avocado, the
saltiness of the bacon.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.850
A real winner.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.470
You guys have gotta give this one a try.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.310
It is such a fantastic idea for lunch.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.120
I think you will really enjoy this recipe.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.450
And Sara Lynn, thank you so much

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.410
for driving all the way out here

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.520
and spending the morning with me.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.950
I love this idea. It's fantastic.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.800
- Oh my gosh Beth, thank
you so much for having me.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.410
It was such a pleasure.
- You bet.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.910
And you guys will love

All right. Until then,
I'll see you next week.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.270
Bye.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.560
I think I'm gonna take another
bite 'cause it's too good.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.840
- Mmm-hmm.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.930
(swing music)

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.270
♫ You're A-OK
