Nicole Chuchmach: We are David Suzuki Secondary School in Brampton.

00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:16.265
It is their athletic week so this event 
 tied in perfect with what my students

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:20.680
were hoping to plan and achieve. This year I thought for their major project

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.225
they'd help raise awareness for the Pan Am 
 Games. It kind of impacts every sector

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:29.833
in coming to Toronto so from a tourism perspective 
 there's going to be a lot of jobs

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.091
for my students in the future so they 
 wanted to raise awareness for the games

00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.360
and do outreach with high school students.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.161
Chelsea Erhardt: We have a volleyball tournament going on between national competitor

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:44.562
Kelly Nyhof as well as Conrad Leinemann. He's a gold 
 medalist from Pan Am and they're kind of

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:48.292
giving an interactive lecture on their experience, what they've done as an

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:52.672
athlete, their accomplishments and then beating up the students in a game of volleyball.

00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:55.583
Conrad Leinemann: The big thing with a lot 
 of athletes is they've gone through hardship

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:59.369
and hearing what they've gone through to overcome that obstacle, whatever it is

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.268
maybe it's an injury. For me, I was a really bad 
 volleyball player. I sat on the bench in grade

00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:08.307
eight, nine, ten and eleven and how did I go 
 from sitting on the bench to going to 

00:01:08.307 --> 00:01:14.145
the Olympics so I share stories about following 
 your dreams, having fun, doing your best

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:17.826
and you know staying on track and good things will happen.

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:20.359
Kelly Nyhof: I think just seeing how much fun 
 the kids are actually having when we're

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.319
actually talking, like they're really engaged and they're 
 having a lot of fun just listening

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:30.112
to us and and seeing Conrad play and hearing about his accomplishments throughout

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:33.087
the years that he's played and seeing where he's traveled and everything like that

00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:36.833
I think that's been the most find to just see 
 their faces light up and are actually really passionate

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:40.170
about hearing about it so it's been nice. It's 
 been an amazing journey for me, I've always

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:45.940
been a student athlete and every year the staff 
 has always been really receptive to me being

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.550
a student athlete which has been great.

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:51.520
Chelsea Erhardt: It's definitely a lot of work but 
 it's fun from the start to finish and

00:01:51.523 --> 00:01:56.320
to finally see the event kind of form and 
 take place and see the turnout of it,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.430
it makes it worth it. Hospitality, it's a business-based 
 commerce program and then it specializes in

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:07.480
hospitality and tourism so you learn all about hospitality. There are a million different

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:15.930
sectors of it so they have airlines, hotels, event 
 planning. Really anything that involves people skills.

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.290
Nicole Chuchmach: I'm a firm believer that hands-on is the best way to learn.

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:24.300
I could go through each lecture giving them the theory, which 
 I do but I really want them to get

00:02:24.297 --> 00:02:28.440
that hands-on experience and the practical approach before they get out in to industry

00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:32.680
and I think they really learned how to work as a 
 team to try to get this event to come together

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.680
so I'm very proud of them here today.
