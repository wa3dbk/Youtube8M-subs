[theme music plays]

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:11.053
[theme music plays]

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.184
[Ronnie B.]
Good evening, and it's nice to be with you again, isn't Ronnie?

00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:19.412
[Ronnie C.]
Yes it is, Ronnie. Isn't Ronnie?

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:21.221
[Audience laughter]

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:25.125
[Ronnie C.] 
On the program tonight, we'll be doing a 
 sketch about an accident in a ball-bearing factory.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.461
I play a man who loses his bearings...

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.264
[Ronnie B.]
And I play man who gets horribly castrated.

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.331
[laughter]

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:32.866
[Ronnie C.]
But first, the news.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.769
A man who sat on the front row of an West End strip club

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.306
from two in the afternoon until just before it closed said tonight:

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:42.943
[Ronald Reagan]
I see my time is running out here, 
 I'll have to get this down very fast.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:45.093
[Ronnie B.]
And now the news...

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:48.081
Donkeys and singer Tom Jones was admitted to hospital today

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.249
for a well-earned vasectomy.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.352
[Ronnie C.]
And singer Mick Jagger was admitted to hospital today

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.388
for TWO well-earned vasectomies.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:59.118
[Ronald Reagan]
And I have a task force now that has 
 been working on where those cuts could be made.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.195
[Ronnie. B]
And finally, here is the weather.

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:03.197
It will be 'cool' in Goole, dry in Rye

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.412
topping in Whopping

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.000
but if you live in Lissingdown, it'll absolutely be pissing down.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:08.870
There you are...

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.237
that is just the kind of bad language

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.340
and above all, endless references to parts of the body

00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:16.944
that are becoming by their ceaseless repetition, norm in the media

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.038
part and parcelent  and "pubes" of everyday conservation.

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:27.353
And that is why insist that we must relief 
 massage the bad language out of television, rump.

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:28.561
[Commentator]
So what you're saying is that without our knowing it...

00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:31.533
 our tickle my nuts language is becoming corrupt?

00:01:32.137 --> 00:01:34.970
[Reverend]
"Inner thigh," yes.

00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:40.060
[Commentator]
Dr. Vison, if I may turn over "I 
 like it better that way" to you.

00:01:42.052 --> 00:01:44.100
[Dr. Vison]
Well, I'm sorry, I just can't see what proof

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.280
the Reverend Bartholomew has for this strange breast-fondling theory. 

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:51.270
[Rev. Bartholomew]
Well you just have to listen, you just have to listen

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:52.800
Dr. Stifled-Moan-Vice

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:56.940
Did you realize that in the middle of that sentence, 
 for instance, you said "breast fondling" large nipple?

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.020
[Doctor]
I did NOT!

00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:00.720
[Reverend]
Yes "yank on it" you did!

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:02.490
That's my whole "big thing" point!

00:02:03.043 --> 00:02:06.390
People are swearing and uttering obscenities

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.820
"take me take me" without evening knowing it.

00:02:10.612 --> 00:02:13.070
[Doctor]
Oh, huge melons! 

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.620
You're all, I'm afraid, imagining this "pantyhose" reverend!

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.530
This is hardly surprising 

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:22.870
coming, as it does, from a "soft underbelly just 
 above the private equipment" minister of the Church.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.120
[Reverend]
I beg your pardon, WANG!

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.150
Now let's be "bull's pizzle" frank about this...

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:34.390
[Commentator]
I'm sorry gentleman, but that's all the "lipstick around 
 the nipple" we have time for this week.

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:35.340
[Doctor]
Wang, wang, wang!

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:37.460
[Reverend]
Big huge dangling ones.

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:38.390
[Doctor]
Oh Christ sakes.
