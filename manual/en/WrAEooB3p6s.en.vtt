Hi, I'm Aaron Gregory on behalf of Expert
Village. And, we're going to talk about what

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.610
happens when your car battery dies, how to
select a new battery, and how to see what

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.150
the problem is. Now, when you go to put the
new battery in, you're going to want to figure

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.619
out where your positive and negative cables
come out so the battery is orientated in the

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.260
right direction the first time. This is positive.
And, this is negative. I know that because

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.520
I took them off of the battery that way. But,
you can find a negative terminal because it

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.660
will be bolted onto the frame of the car and
or the engine or transmission because it's

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.620
grounding the negative side to the body of
the car. The positive side will always be

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.130
fully insulated and go into a fuse box or
to the starter of the car on an insulated

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.890
lug. We're going to put these up out of the
way so the battery doesn't pinch them down

00:00:48.890 --> 00:01:01.780
and carefully lift the battery into place.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.770
Now that the battery is sitting orientated,
let's see if the cables will reach the terminals.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.010
Positive to positive. Negative to negative.
We're in business. Now, let's find the clamp

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.790
and reposition the clamp and the J-bolts to
hold it in place.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.450
Aligning the J-bolts with the slots in the
bottom of the battery tray that you took them

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:37.000
out of, lowering them into place, sliding
the strap onto the battery where it belongs.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.250
Now, we need our 10mm socket, deep socket,
so that we can thread this nut down onto the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.259
threaded rod and tighten the battery. Now,
you've got a few pieces here to hold in position

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.700
when you thread the nut down. Tighten them
evenly so that the battery doesn't suffer

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:06.490
too much pressure on one side or another.
Now, our battery is very secure in the car.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.280
It won't tip over or spill or cause any other
problems. Now that we have the new battery

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.970
installed, we're going to wiggle it and see
if it's tight. It's tight. It's not going

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.840
anywhere. We're going to remember to reinstall
these terminals starting with the positive

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:29.819
and then moving on to the negative. I like
to push the terminal down onto the battery

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:41.109
as hard as I can and tighten it up by pushing
down and twisting. It opens up the ring and

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:48.400
makes the best contact as possible. Then,
tightening it slightly, until you can't twist

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.829
it anymore. Now, our battery is reconnected,
and we have cleaned the terminals, and we've

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.930
checked for corrosion inside the wires. The
engine should start now.
