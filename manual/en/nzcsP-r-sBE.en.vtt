Hi my name is Dave Andrews and today I'm going
to show you how to restore an HP computer

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.849
to factory settings. I have here an HP laptop
and I'm going to boot it up and while it is

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.020
booting I am going to press the F 11 key which
will launch the system restore that is built

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:29.800
into the laptop. It gives you instructions
at the bottom of the laptop while it is booting

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.130
so once I see a screen I am going to press
F11 and that is going to take me to the system

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.711
recovery that is built into the laptop. It
looks like it is loading Windows but it is

00:00:38.711 --> 00:01:24.329
actually loading sort of a subset of Windows
that is the system restore capabilities.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.800
So here we have the HP Recovery manager that
is built into my laptop. Basically it is going

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.119
to tell me that I can use this program to
recovery my laptop to its original factory

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.079
condition and what you need to keep in mind
is that this is going to completely erase

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.310
your hard drive so if you have any files or
important information, pictures or whatever

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.860
this will actually delete all of that and
you are going to get your laptop just as it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.760
was when you opened the box so let's click
next and it is going to ask you would you

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.070
like to launch system restore. If you say
yes here and you click next it is going to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.730
begin the HP system of restoring your desktop.
There is no other Windows that you are going

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:15.540
to get or anything like that. It is going
to begin wiping away your computer and you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.870
are basically going to get a new factory image
once it is done. It might take between 45

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.569
minutes to an hour to complete. My name is
Dave Andrews and I have just showed you how

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.400
to restore an HP Computer to the factory setting.
