00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.440
You guys!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.780
What's going on?

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.600
Listen. I just got the best idea ever.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.080
You do?

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.280
I do. I finally got a solution to our problems, guys.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.540
I know how we can escape from this crappy life and make something of ourselves

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.340
How?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.340
We go... to Kashyyyk.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.660
Kashyyyk?

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.800
Kashyyyk.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.880
Kashyyyk?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.640
Kashyyyk.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.220
Why Kashyyyk?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.140
Because we can.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.220
Again, why Kashyyyk?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.960
Don't you get it? Kashyyyk is the place to be!

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.260
The place to be?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.120
Yeah! Kashyyyk is cheap, there are lots of trees and most important, it's the home planet of the Wookies.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.080
Dude, Wookies are mean. They will rip your head off if they have the chance.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.480
No they don't. Wookies are awesome! And they are way nicer than the retards here.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.020
So, what do you say, guys? Are you going with me?

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.160
No.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.420
Nope.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.720
Why not?

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.100
Instead of you, we don't want to be decapitated. We like living.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.340
Whatever. Screw you guys! I'm gonna live in paradise.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.180
Alright, you win. Here is your money.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.940
Told you that he would go insane.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
'What's that?'

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
'I don't know.'

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.640
Greetings fellow species of this wonderful planet!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
'Who the hell is this retard?'

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.700
Yes, I'm going to live with you wonderful creatures.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
'Let's kill this b**ch!'

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.840
So, let's start by searching for some food. I'm starving. What do you normally eat?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
'Get him!'
