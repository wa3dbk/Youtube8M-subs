00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.420
At UNC Charlotte we are Forty-Niners and Charlotte
49ers Athletics is a great tradition.

Fielding teams in 16 Varsity sports, the 49ers
compete in the Atlantic-10 conference, routinely

placing teams into post-season play.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.019
Forty-Niner athletes also excel in the classroom,
where for 25 semesters they have posted a

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.590
higher GPA than the overall student body.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.200
The excitement generated on campus for our
49er teams is unmistakable and increasing,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.150

in 2013.

refer to UNC Charlotte as a large University

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.230
with small University appeal.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.510
There is a sense of community and a complete
collegiate experience that extends from the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:08.830
classroom to the dorms to the million-volume
Atkins Library, and of course to our new 196,000

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.470
sq. ft. Student Union which is literally at
the heart of our campus life.
