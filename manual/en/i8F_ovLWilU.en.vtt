00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.740
A little greasy cod.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.360
An old greasy cod.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360
&gt;&gt; Nice one, mate.
Thanks, mate.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.740
Are we definitely at the Berkeley tonight?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.050
Because normally, 
you know what'd happen to that.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.290
Yeah, I know normally you would just destroy that right now. You'd get your fry pan out and start cooking it up.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.290
&gt;&gt; We'll definitely make the Berkeley?
Just throw the poor fish back.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.820
And have a cry.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.460
If we have to camp on the beach here and I have to eat dry biscuits and cheese...

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.220
Good luck.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.540
Little jack.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.540
Nice one.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.150
Yes, I'm on again.
&gt;&gt; Oh, you're on again. What've you got?

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.940
A little jack again, I reckon. There's a heap of them just off the edge of that rock there. 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.760
Oh okay.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.270
Get out from under there, you. He's gone under the boat. 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.310
A pretty good colour, that one.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.939
They have a tendency of doing.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.070
How speccy is this spot?
