00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:05.790
Imagine you've heard some chocolate 
contains the toxic metal

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.339
Lead - which some does by the way.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:14.039
As an avid chocoholic you do a quick google 
search and come across "Lead Watch."

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.309
Lead Watch is a device that plugs into your 
smartphone and tells you whether the

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:22.399
Lead in your chocolate is above the 
acceptable level.

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:27.699
(Lead Watch doesn't actually exist, but it 
could in the future.)

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.939
Using Lead Watch, you are happy that your
 chocolate habit isn't leading to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.950
excessive Lead consumption, and all is
good with the world.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.290
A year later,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.210
"Lead Watch 2.0"
is released.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.070
This version warns you when your 
chocolate Lead content is one hundred

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.750
times lower than the acceptable level.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.730
Eager to consumer as little Lead as 
possible, you purchase Lead Watch 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.330
2.0.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.670
Some of your favorite chocolate products
 you previously thought were okay now

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.230
show the presence of Lead. You quickly 
ditch these, but are comfortable in the

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.340
knowledge that the rest are safe.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.060
Then "Ultimate Lead Watch" comes out.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.980
This latest iteration claims to
 detect even a single atom of Lead in the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.740
chocolate you are eating.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.550
To your dismay, every piece of chocolate you 
test now appears to contain Lead.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.409
Disaster!

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.140
You have just hit the "Measurement Conundrum."

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.810
The chocolate you've been eating
hasn't changed. All that's changed is

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.420
your ability to measure what is in it.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.870
Does this mean that what was assumed to 
be safe is now not safe?

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.840
Not at all.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.180
Just because you can measure something 
doesn't necessarily mean that it presents

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.810
risk.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.950
The Measurement Conundrum is real -

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.550
when we can measure something we couldn't 
measure before, we need to know what to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.110
do with the new information. In some 
cases this might mean re-evaluating what

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.710
a safe level is. In others it might mean
recognizing the difference between what

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.520
we can measure and  what is okay.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.330
In both cases though, we need to know 
what the measurements mean, not just

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.489
what they are.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.809
