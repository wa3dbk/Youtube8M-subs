00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
What's the schedule after that?

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.580
Meeting, right? There's a meeting.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.240
Today I'm going to tell you the stuff that
happens when I'm the lead actor in a TV ad.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.080
Usually, before I promote the product,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.920
I'll try to find out information about the product.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.280
This time, when I'm about shoot Antangin FIT,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.200
I went to the factory...

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.560
in Solo.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.480
After arriving at Solo, I went straight to Wonogiri
where the Antangin factory is located.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.300
Welcomed by a grey "mbok jamu",

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.460
and then seeing how this herbal supplement is created.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.940
This is the distillation place.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.380
I don't even know what distillation means.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.960
So this is the machine that inserts the herb, right, Sir?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.940
Into the stick pack.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.800
It goes directly to the bottom.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.220
Look at that.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.740
Now these ladies are packing the product.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.620
I have a crush on some of them.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.760
And this is us taking a picture together.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.380
Uh, yeah, it's kinda...

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.500
After visiting the Antangin FIT factory in Wonogiri,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.300
I went back to Jakarta. As soon as I arrived,
I was called for a briefing.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.100
I was told how the shooting will be.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.420
This is me entering and shaking hands with everyone.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.260
So many people to shake hands with that
our hands collided.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.800
Then the director, Yujin Panji, pointed out the things
I have to do in tomorrow's shooting.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.000
And I, of course, pretended to understand.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.820
Then we tried out the clothes for tomorrow's shooting.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580
The clothes were so cool.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.420
There were some of them that I tried to
sneak into my car to take home but...

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.700
I got caught.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.320
After the briefing was done,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.940
the process of shooting the Antangin FIT
TV ad started.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.780
I arrived still looking very sleepy.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.700
It turns out that the set was almost finished.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.220
As the actor, I went straight into the makeup room,
and did the most important thing...

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.420
...ordering food.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.220
It was delicious.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.120
Then they applied makeup on me.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.760
The process was hard because there's so much to fix.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.700
Then I wore the clothes for shooting later.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.680
Tada!

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.520
I went out and the set was all ready,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.420
the lights were on, the cameras were ready to record,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.860
and as the lead actor I went in and was briefed for
the scene...

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.200
...which was riding a bike.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.060
So when you face this way, the sun will be on your left.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.940
This is me still riding a bike.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.820
Riding a bike! Yay! Yay!

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.480
We shot scene after scene, scratched out the finished ones,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.360
discussion between directors, clients, and the agency
also took place,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.260
then we shook hands. Hands colliding again.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.360
This is Pak Mul, the CEO of Antangin,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.900
which means I have to be nice to him.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.940
See? I'm staying silent.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.920
Then it was time for the most important shot,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.440
which is drinking Antangin FIT.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.980
Mmmm!

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.020
There is one more process of shooting a TV ad
that you probably do not know yet,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.080
in case it is important,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.580
which is dubbing the voice for the ad.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.460
So after we shoot the ad, we record the voice
to be edited into the ad.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.720
The dubbing starts! I just recorded my voice
as usual for the ad.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.720
We tried it over and over again, with different styles,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.020
they told me what was wrong, they told me my voice
was raspy, which is really how my voice is.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.940
And finally... we made it.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.000
We got the perfect sound for the ad.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.580
That's all from me.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.020
Hopefully by watching the making of the Antangin FIT TV ad

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.780
in which I am the lead actor,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.960
you will be inspired to be a TV ad actor, too.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.860
Because I have proved that to be a TV actor,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.120
you don't have to be good looking.
