Hi, I'm Sean from Fotodiox, and we just got
our GoPro HERO4 Silver in a couple weeks ago.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.500
Click here to see our unboxing video. Now
the HERO4 Silver does not have the same 4K capabilities 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.500
as the HERO4 Black does. It only
shoots 4K in 15fps, which is pretty useless.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.660
But one thing it does share with the HERO4
Black is it has improved night time lapse functions. 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.360
So we decided to go to downtown
Chicago at night to see how good these night

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.039
time lapse functions are. Now I'm gonna show
you that footage in a second, but first I'm

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.949
gonna show you the rig that we used to get
our night time lapse. First of all, you can

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.190
see I have the WonderPana GO Filter System
attached to the GoPro HERO4's housing. Now

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.219
this is really easy to attach, you just slip
it on over the housing and then just tighten

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.350
this cynching screw built into the filter
holder. And what's great about this system

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.149
is it allows you to use our comprehensive
line of filters made specifically for the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.260
GoPro. This is a circular polarizer--we used
this for our time lapse as well--you just

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.600
screw it onto the filter holder. And what
a circular polarizer does is it allows you,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.260
by simply turning the front element, to block
out reflections and glare. So, for instance,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.820
if you were shooting, say, water, and you
wanted to shoot through the reflection and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.640
see what was underneath, you would just adjust
this until you knocked out that reflection

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.800
and you could see down below. So, like if
you were shooting goldfish in a pond or something

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.920
this would be a great tool. It's also a great
tool to reduce glare off objects, say for

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.920
instance some big silver object that may be
in downtown Chicago**cough**the Bean.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.540
And we did use this for that very purpose as you'll
see in a moment. Now we decided that we wanted

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.220
to add a little spice to our time lapse video,
so what we did is we went to the local Target

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.380
in downtown Chicago and we bought this little
egg timer. It was just a couple bucks, we

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.180
ripped off the base so it would lay flat,
and then we bought some sticky tack. Now what

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.810
we did with this sticky tack is we merely
pushed it down onto the top of the egg timer,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.500
and then we took our GoPro with our tripod
mount--this is our GoTough Tripod Mount that

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.030
Fotodiox sells--and we just simply pressed
it down. And then all we did is we just kind

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.030
of set it down in different areas of Chicago,
cranked it to the amount of distance we wanted

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.950
the time lapse to move, set the time lapse
going, and then just left it sit.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.110
So using our WonderPana GO filter system, our Circular Polarizer and our little DIY spinner,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.010
we were able to get some pretty awesome footage. Let's take a look.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.780
 **RING** Well I guess that ringing sound means our video has come to an end.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.700
