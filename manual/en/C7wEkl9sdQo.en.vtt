00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.030
Hello and welcome.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.020
This tutorial will explain to you what display
resolution is, and how to adjust the necessary

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.360
settings.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.750
The amount of information shown on your computer
monitor is referred to as the “Display Resolution”

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.950
or just “Resolution”.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.619
The display resolution is determined by the
number of individual points of light called

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.489
“pixels” aligned in horizontal rows and
vertical columns used to make the desired

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:25.699
image.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:33.870
If your monitor was set to 1280 pixels horizontally
by 720 pixels vertically, this standard HD

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.010
resolution is called “720P”, there would
be a total of 921,600 pixels to make up one

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.730
single frame on your computer display.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.210
The higher the resolution the more densely
packed together the pixels are in the monitor.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.980
Higher resolutions provide a more crisp, sharp,
and detailed image, but they also make everything

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.000
appear smaller and may be difficult to see
for some individuals.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.530
Higher resolutions can be harder for your
computer to run smoothly.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.449
If you are experiencing slowdowns in games
or video a lower resolution may help alleviate

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.600
the problem.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.670
Let’s start by setting a higher resolution.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.679
Close down any open applications, if you have
any, so you can see the desktop.

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:24.130
Right-click on the desktop and select “Screen
Resolution” from the menu.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.560
The “Screen Resolution” window will open.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.380
In the top of the screen you will see a representation
of your monitor.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.399
Next to Display” will list the type of display,
in my case an “ULTRASCANP990”.

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.670
If it lists default or unknown there may be
a problem that requires attention before going

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.030
forward.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.610
To change the resolution click to select the
drop down next to “Resolution:”.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.299
The resulting menu will list all the resolutions
your monitor supports from low to high.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:10.580
We will change the slider to a resolution
of “1280 X 720”, and click the “Apply”

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.330
button.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.660
You always want to click “Apply” instead
of “OK”, as if a problem arises and you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.240
have clicked “Apply” it will revert back
in 20 seconds.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.140
Click the “Keep Changes” button.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.100
Now it’s time to set an appropriate refresh
rate for your monitor.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.990
A big part of setting up screen resolution,
that is often overlooked, is making sure the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.560
appropriate “refresh rate” is set for
your monitor.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.730
If you have the big old heavy CRT monitors
this is vitally important to keep from straining

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.930
your eyes.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.650
If you are using a new LCD monitor 60 Hz is
default and is usually fine.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.880
Click the “Advanced settings” link.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.420
This will open the advanced settings properties
window.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.500
Click the “Monitor” tab.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.260
Under “Monitor Settings” it says “Screen
refresh rate:”.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.120
You can see that it was set to “60 Hertz”,
which is too slow for a CRT monitor like what

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.180
I have.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.870
A slow refresh rate will cause the screen
image to flicker and cause severe eye strain

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.730
over time.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.160
Click the drop down menu and you will see
a list of all the refresh rates supported

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.950
by your monitor.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.230
Select the “85 Hertz” option, or whatever
your highest option is.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.130
Click the “Apply” button.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.140
The “Display Settings” window will open
with the question “Do you want to keep these

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.510
display settings?”.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.980
Click the “Yes” button.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.180
Click the “OK” button to close the display
properties window.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.370
Now that we have the resolution set to a high
enough level to provide a clear detailed image,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.130
you might want to adjust the size of items
on your screen to make them easier to read,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.350
while still maintaining an optimal resolution.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.650
On the “Screen Resolution” window, click
the text link “Make text and other items

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.370
larger or smaller”.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.130
This will open the appearance and personalization
display screen.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.410
Adjusting the settings here changes the size
of icons, text, and other items while still

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.490
preserving the display resolution.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.680
Let’s make everything a little bit larger
by clicking to select the radio button next

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:37.950
to “Medium - 125%”, and click the “Apply”
button.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.600
You will receive a new window stating “You
must log off your computer to apply these

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.780
changes”.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.820
Click the “Log off now” button.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.320
Once it logs you off log back into your computer.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.730
Now that we have logged back into our system
we can see that the size of the icons, the

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:01.470
taskbar, the start menu, and window menus
are all larger, while the resolution is still

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.840
the same.
