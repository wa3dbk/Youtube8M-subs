00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.231
Now the main thing you need to know is the
bananas must be riped before you freeze them

00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.490
and you know a banana is ripe because it has
spots. Our country seems to be obese of how

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.630
things look and the way people eat bananas
shocks me because they are not ripe. Oh I

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.510
know and they are not ripe and you can't digest
them as well, they are not as good for you

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.940
when they are like that so it is not how it
looks so it is how it feels inside. And they

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.900
are sweeter. Definitely so this is a example
of a ripe banana and one thing and I have

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.930
to clarified this cause I actually once had
student that did not hear this part you must

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.960
peel the banana before you freeze it. If you
freeze a frozen banana folks you would never

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.170
get the peel off. The other thing I recommend
is you could see that it is frozen hard so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.390
don't have them touch when they freeze put
them on wax paper or plate because they would

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.230
touch. They would stick together but by freezing
them separately I have all these frozen bananas

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.579
that aren't touching. So now all I do as I
plug my machine in I turn it on, I put the

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:05.580
banana in. That is it just a frozen banana.
You could use fruit that is already prefrozen

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.580
like mango, raspberries would be a little
tart, I have use melons like honey dew canalop

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.080
watermelon it is more like a sobert that way.
You just hold the glass for me, that noise

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.250
is normal not to worry but this is so thick
and so rich. It is like the best sauce or

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.080
ice cream that you ever had, I mean you could
give this I think you can give it to a infant

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.950
because there god made this ice cream one
ingredient banana. Now before we dress it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.840
even more. Can I try it. I'm going to make
it even more decadent but I want you to try

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.220
it I like the normal way. Wow. You could eat
this for breakfast now wait we have this raspberry

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.320
coolie that we made in the other episode lets
put a little hit on top. Fruit sundae I mean

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.230
this could be your. Isn't it good? Its great.
Its so good. They should be serving this in

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.759
fast food restaurant and schools kids would
eat this I have 13 nieces and nephews I never

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.310
heard a complaint. Mango is so good in this
machine to you could even mix your fruit blueberries,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.510
peaches. I can't wait for Leslie from chef
inc has let us use her kitchen try this. Thank

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.830
you Leslie.
