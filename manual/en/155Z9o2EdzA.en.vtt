00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.620
The Innovation Center is a collection of
stories of invention and they're the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.809
inventions of technologists, of glass
makers, of glass scientists, pushing glass

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.160
beyond its boundaries and if there's a
story that is emblematic of that quest

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.439
it's the story of the 200-inch desk. To
build a better telescope, you have to

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.400
make a larger telescope. In astronomy,
size matters and at the beginning of the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.230
20th century, George Ellery Hale had a
vision to build increasingly larger

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.219
reflecting telescopes, telescopes that
use a mirror to gather the light as

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.140
opposed to lenses. The 200-inch disk was
the primary mirror for the Hale

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.969
Telescope, one of the greatest scientific
instruments of the 20th century called

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.379
"the perfect machine" in terms of its
beauty and complexity of engineering, but

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.059
when it comes down to it, it's completely
reliant on the successful making of a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.579
200-inch piece of glass. To do that, it
pushed glassmakers to the absolute edge.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.680
The day of the casting of the 200-inch
disk, the glass making of Corning, New

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.790
York was suddenly thrust into the public
eye. During the casting, it became

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
apparent to the makers that something
was wrong, that the mold was failing and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.939
pieces of the mold began to float to the
top, literally bobbing on the top of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.530
the glass.As soon as they understood the
problems, they sprung into action to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.360
create the second casting. The successful
casting of the 200-inch disk that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.650
became the Hale Telescope had a very
dramatic transport across the country

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.079
It was loaded in the bulletproof railroad
car and it was a whistle-stop tour all

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.740
the way across the country with fan
fairs and parades and then transported

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.110
to the site of the Hale Telescope and
installed.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.659
What a glorious path! This particular
glass was the the poor stepchild, it sat

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.110
in the factory disregarded for years,
moved to a rather modest display on

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.100
Market Street in Corning, and then,
finally found its rightful place as the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.570
centerpiece of The Corning Museum of
Glass in 1951. Originally, when you entered

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.259
the Museum, you walked right into the
room with the 200-inch disk and it was

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.660
like a rose window. It was the breathtaking
first impression of the museum

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.980
Today, we have the 200-inch disk set in
the context of the scientific

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.720
innovations associated with optical
glass, especially reflecting telescopes,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.440
and what more appropriate thing to bring
into a museum of glass than the failure

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.680
that led to the success. Invention is 99%
failure and we're surrounded in these

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.930
galleries by the successes that came
after all the failures and the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.400
centerpiece of the Innovation Center is
the 200-inch disk and I can think of no

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.020
better centerpiece than that.
