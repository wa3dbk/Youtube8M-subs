00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
chef buck here today I'm

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.690
cooking up a little linguine with white

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.490
clam sauce this is one of my go-to

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.170
dishes when I don't have a lot of fresh

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.000
ingredients in the house because I

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.889
always got some onions and garlic and I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.070
usually keep some chopped clams and for

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.990
this recipe I'm going to use 3 cans and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.090
the first thing you want to do is you

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.830
want to separate the liquid from the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.580
clams you know go ahead and put those in

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.380
separate bowls then heat you up a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.410
skillet on medium heat and we're gonna

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.590
melt a half a stick of butter and then

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.350
we're gonna add 1/2 cup of olive oil you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
know kind of let that heat up and then

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.629
we're gonna throw in some chopped onions

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.219
and a little bit of garlic now I go a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.260
little heavy on the garlic but you can

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.840
cut back here but garlic you know you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.059
can't go wrong with too much garlic so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.469
go ahead and brown that garlic up you

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.000
know let it let it get a little bit of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.190
color to it but watch your temperature

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.840
because you don't want to burn it but

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.870
once you know once it starts to color

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.539
we're going to throw in 1 cup of white

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.030
wine now you use a dry white wine you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.100
don't want to use a sweet one then we're

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.750
gonna let that simmer for about five or

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.970
ten minutes you know and let it reduce

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.159
down a little bit now once it's reduced

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.750
down we can go ahead and add a little

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.750
bit of chicken broth I'm gonna put about

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.320
1/2 1/4 in there then we're going to put

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.090
in the clam juice from our cans and then

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.680
a little bit of herbs and spices you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.240
know now I like to put some red pepper

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.350
flakes in here and I go a little heavy

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.090
on the red pepper flakes

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
because I like a little kick but you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.439
don't have to put that much put a little

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.200
bit of black pepper in there and a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.759
little bit of dried oregano now if you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.460
wanted to you could go ahead and add

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.399
your little dried parsley here as well

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.090
now get that mixed up and you're gonna

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.220
let it simmer on low heat for about 20

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.610
minutes and while that's simmering we'll

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.530
go ahead and we'll cook our linguine so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.579
let it simmer for about 5 minutes

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.740
because it's not going to take 20

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.810
minutes of cooking linguine but time it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.170
so that when the 20 minutes is up on

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.780
your sauce your linguine you be finished

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.789
so at the end of the 20 minutes we're

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.830
gonna go ahead and throw our clams in

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.350
there you know that's that's one of the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.750
last things you add so get your clams in

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.120
there stir it up and then we'll go ahead

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.890
and we'll turn the heat off on the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.420
skillet and the linguine because if you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.430
got your timing right you Linguini's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.470
done and you'll just be able to pull it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.630
right out of the pot and put it in the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.970
skillet so don't rinse your linguine

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.890
don't don't drain it don't do any of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.690
that stuff you know because like I said

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.370
you know in another video of mine you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.840
don't want to waste that flavor you know

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.180
you don't want to watch the flavor off

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.890
your pasta should just throw it right in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.870
the sauce and get it all stirred up now

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.620
we're going to add some Parmesan cheese

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.750
now you can put a half cup to 3/4 of a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.510
cup and I usually usually stir it in

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.700
about a quarter cup at a time so just

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.340
throw your Parmesan cheese in there give

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.410
it a stir and then that's it you know

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.030
you're good to go you know if you want

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.800
you can chop up some fresh parsley on

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.780
there you know to make it look pretty

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.940

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.519
