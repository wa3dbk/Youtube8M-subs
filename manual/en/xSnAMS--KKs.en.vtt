00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.660
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure for removing and

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.500
reinstalling your vehicle's radiator. In this
step, we're going to talk about the proper

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.141
service procedure for removing our radiator
hoses from the radiator. Now this kind of

00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:21.490
the clamp as you can see, doesn't have a screw
on it. This is called a permanent tension

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.720
spring clamp. My favorite tool for these is
a good pair of long handled channel locks

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.780
just like so. Take and grab a hold of it and
squeeze it off. The longer the handles on

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.489
your channel locks, the more mechanical advantage
you're going to have. It will make it easier

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.210
for you to squeeze that sucker shut just like
so. Once you have it squeezed, you're going

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:58.800
to move it out of the way and with a twisting
rotating method slide the hose off. Now this

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.960
particular hose, I'm just going to take and
fold up out of the way. You're going to repeat

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.370
that same procedure for your lower radiator
hose. I'm going to go ahead and do that now.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.930
Before you disconnect your lower radiator
hose, you're going to want to screw the drain

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.500
cock back into the radiator and slide your
drain pan underneath the lower radiator hose.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.700
There will still be some coolant trapped inside
of it and you want to stay as environmentally

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.786
friendly as possible. I'm going to take my
pliers and reach down and squeeze that clamp

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:47.790
and slip it off of the connection. And there
you go. This right here is our overflow tube.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.060
We're going to wiggle it off the nipple on
the radiator. You're always going to want

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.990
to keep this above the level in your overflow
jug. Just due to the laws of physics and the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.130
way a siphon works if you tipped this below
the level of the fluid in your overflow jug,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.920
it will begin to drain. I'm going to take
and slip it right inside the fill just like

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.459
that. That is the proper service procedure
for unhooking your vehicle's radiator hoses.
