00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:08.719
Sometimes, you also start without the veil
and in the middle of the choreography you

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.661
are going to need your veil. In order to have
your veil in the middle of the choreography,

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:23.230
before you get on stage you are going to get
your veil and you are going to place it on

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:33.210
your hips like this.
Usually, we place it in the back, but you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:45.530
can place it pretty much wherever you want.
This is the traditional way to have your veil

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.600
available when you need it in a performance,
but like I said you can also place it in the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:01.800
front as the same. Make sure that when you
are placing your veil, you need to grab your

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:12.270
veil like this. This is before you get on
stage. You know where, because you have the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.270
sequences on top, so you know where the top
sequences start. Make sure that you remember

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.560
this before you get on stage and that you
are going to place it in the same place that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.810
I told you. And remember that the sequences,
the sequences that you are going to be needing

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.010
is on the top because then when you are dancing
you know where to grab and you are not going

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:48.330
to grab the wrong sequences, because this
is a semi-circle veil. Then when you are performing

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.820
you know that your sequences that you are
supposed to grab are here, available for you.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.820
You are dancing, and now you are going to
need the veil and you are going to just grab

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.480
the veil as far as possible. And there you
have it. And you start your veil sequence.
