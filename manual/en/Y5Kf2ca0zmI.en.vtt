00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.189
 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.140
Our country was built on the belief
that

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.349
all individuals are created equal with
the right to be fully engaged in society

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.059
and with equal access to the workplace.  
The past 50 years

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.460
have seen great strides in bringing
those basic beliefs to reality:

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.350
The signing up the Civil Rights Act...the
founding of the EEOC

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.170
and the OFCCP.  - And the signing and implementation

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.710
of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.580
2015 will give ILG members a unique
opportunity to reflect on the past

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.360
and honor our legacy.   Collaborate to meet
today's changing landscape

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.610
and define the future.  
So join us for the 2015

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.960
ILG National Conference in New York
City as we honor the legacy of our

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.780
country's efforts on behalf of diversity
and inclusion

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.470

share about our new obligations

identity.  

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.340
