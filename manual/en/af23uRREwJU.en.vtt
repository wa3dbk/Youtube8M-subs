00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Where did I put my glasses ?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.400
Two years ago I made a video about Facebook

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.960
Today I'll talk to you about facebook

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.920
I decided to do a little update

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.080
Because Facebook has changed a lot since then.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.160
Now we can say, like, whatever we want

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.200
It didn't exist before and that led to some pretty weird situations

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.200
You know, those who write a status update and like their own status

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.880
who comments this comment

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.240
and like their own comments

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.080
Have you ever seen people like that?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320
Why they do it, I don't know

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.640
Maybe they have amnesia?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.560
It was so cool the party yesterday !

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.600
Oh ! A status ! "like"

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.160
Oh ! A status !

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.040
"it's clear you're right !"

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.920
Oh ! A comment !

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.420
"like"

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.000
Oh !

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.840
Another mysterious thing about Facebook

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.760
The people who puts their jobs in their names

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.080
Like..."Kevin Boulet Photographer"

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.840
It's very often "photographer" by the way

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.520
Someone will have to explain to me the point one day.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.880
Later what will it be?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.400
"Jean-Batiste Pignouf Agent of maintenance of unity of production"

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.360
The unity of productions , it's my passion !

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.040
Not to mention the guys who put "official" in their name

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.200
What's that mean..? There are guys that are "official" ?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.480
And others who are not "official" ?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480
Or they have a clone posing as them ?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.980
I don't know.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.280
"Hello , Kevin Boulet, nice to meet you"

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.000
"How are you ?"

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.160
"IT'S ME KEVIN BOULET OFFICIAL, FAKE."

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.800
"oups !"

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.600
"He discovered me !"

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.840
There's another thing that annoys me on Facebook

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.800
It's the people who change their profile pictures multiple times per week

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800
Not to put a new picture, no

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.760
But just to change it

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.880
They put an old one

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.400
Then, a new one

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.900
Then an old old one

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.600
like that, just to change

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560
I just want to ask the people who do that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.920
WHY ?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.360
Oh yes ! It's because  .......

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.680
No no no no no

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
Ah! Or they ...

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.120
No, no no, it's ...

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440
I don't see the logic there.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.520
Well, the good thing is

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.920
that today, almost everyone is on Facebook!

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.200
And that is very convenient

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.320
In the world of work for example

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.040
- Cyprien, you must give the file to Julien Pichon

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.960
- Yes ! Julien Pichon ...

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.840
- Yes of course ! Julien Pichon! Of course, I've been in the business for 10 years

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.120
I know who it is

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.880
I know his name, of course

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080
it can even save your life a little

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.600
- Hey Cyprien, Anaïs Bouffi from accounting wants a drink with you tonight

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.880
- Anaïs Bouffi?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.040
- No, no no I'm sick tonight, sorry

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.600
- I ... yes I ... I don't feel good I ...

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.840
- I thought she was a man ...

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880
- I told him "Good morning sir" in the morning ..

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.440
There are only people's good sides on Facebook

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.040
My mother is on Facebook

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.540
Worst !

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.120
My grandmother is on Facebook

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.240
Worst of the worst!

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.320
My grandmother comments on my status

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.440
There, I said no!

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.400
That is impossible

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.520
I can't let that happen.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.280
I took the problem at the roots

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.040
- Mamie What are you doing there? You stop it right now!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600
- How would you like me to comment while we change your diaper?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.520
- Beh, it's the same here!

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.020
- Stop it !

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.920
- If not, I will I come to your nursing home

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.560
- And I unplug you

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.740
- Ah, but I do not care!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.720

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.760
