00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.859
[Intro music]
Hello, Iím Riki Gerardy. It is important

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:17.620
to test a cello before buying it to be sure
that it is the right one for you. So here

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.070
is some advice on testing.
[Music]

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.369
Play some long notes with a full sound on
each string. Adapt your playing to find what

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:37.091
sound the instrument wants to make, also to
get used to the size and shape of the cello.

00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:39.290
Itís important to do this before beginning
to play a piece.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.780
[Music]
Try the cello with different bows, not just

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.290
with the bow that you are used to.
Different bows make different qualities of

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.469
sound. And also some bows produce a brighter
sound, others a deeper one.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.261
So find out which bow works best on this cello.
[Music]

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:15.930
If you can, take the cello to a hall. Play
it there, and best of all, get someone else

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.510
to play it to you. This way you are going
to learn much more about the possibilities

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.750
of the cello.
Now if you can take two cellos with you, youíre

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.210
going to learn a lot by comparing them in
the hall.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.490
[Music]
Cellos, which have a loud sound under the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.320
ear, donít always project well in a hall.
Conversely, cellos, which can sound softer

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.619
nearby, through the weight of their tone they
can carry right to the back of a hall.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:53.090
The easiest example to give is that French
cellos can sound louder nearby and old Italian

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.910
ones in the distance.
By playing cellos in a hall, you are going

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.710
to learn a lot about the instrument and your
playing. For example, You might find that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:18.090
you are working too hard 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:33.359
and restricting the sound.
