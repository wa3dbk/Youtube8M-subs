00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.010
Video games, when used a medium to tell a
story, sometimes have a bit of a mountain

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.370
to climb to do it in a convincing fashion.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.930
How often do you play a game and feel cheated
on the story or feel that the characters are

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.930
flatter than pancakes?

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.430
If you’re like me, it sometimes might irk
you when a character in a game is nothing

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.140
more than a boring corrugated sterotype that
isn’t interesting at all.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.750
If that bothers you, then you’re in for
a treat.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.110
It’s the game were even the NPCs are interesting
and funny characters, it’s the remake of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:55.010
the Sega CD classic: Lunar: Silver Star Story
Complete on the Sony Playstation.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.890
You play as the mostly-silent-but-strong-willed
Alex, a young boy from the small villa of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
Burg who dreams of becoming a Dragon Master,
who serves to protect the Goddess Althena,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.330
just like his hero, the former Dragon Master
Dyne, who died 15 years ago.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.750
Nall, who is most certainly not a flying cat,
often hangs out with Alex at Dyne’s Monument

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.140
on a typical day, but one day Ramus, the big
boned son of the village elder, comes up with

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:28.170
a crackpot scheme to get rich quick, and not
exactly a safe one.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:39.299
Alex’s love interest, Luna, disapproves
of their plan but joins in anyway to ensure

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.710
Alex’s well being.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.470
And that begins the quest that changes their
lives forever.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.650
From meeting the dragon and getting a diamond
made out of his…uh, never mind, to travel

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.790
to the flying city of Vane, Alex’s quest
to become a dragon master escalates quickly,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.290
and Luna finds herself is haunted by dreams
and is confused about what her future holds.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.020
What started as a quest to make money and
meet a dragon turns into an adventure to stop

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.530
a plot of a man hellbent on providing guidance
for a godless world.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.160
On your adventure, You’ll meet the overconfident
prick of a magician, Nash, and the drunk womanizing

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.900
swordsman Kyle, and many more crazy, zany
characters, including some not so savory types.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.880
Lunar will spin a tale love that will pull
at the heartstrings and make you laugh occasionally,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.290
thanks in part of the fantastic localization
job by the game's publisher, Working Designs,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.379
who made almost every NPC, character, and
scene, remarkable in some way.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.450
Lunar’s is a successfully well done and
well developed game that engrosses you quickly

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.430
and keeps ahold for the whole ride.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.430
But it can be a bit difficult to talk about
without spoiling the whole adventure.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.650
The battle system in the Lunar series is different
from standard RPGs . This side-view battle

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.480
system isn’t standard, as it combines a
tactical style with a traditional turn based

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480
system.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.050
Attackers must walk to their enemy before
striking, which gives Lunar a solid sense

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.050
of strategy.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.160
If your foe is on the other side of the field,
you may have to waste a turn moving toward

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.290
them, or take advantage of your distance by
casting a spell and not fearing an attack

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.800
on yourself.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.459
Planning distances and movement is needed
in many battles, since you can attack groups

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.470
of foes with certain attacks, or scatter yourselves
to avoid group strikes on your own party.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.910
While it doesn’t seem strategic at first,
you’ll be planning which foes to attack

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.620
and how to make use of your zone-based magic
spells rather quickly.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.680
It’s a fun battle system that makes every
engagement different, and after 10 years of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.760
playing this game, it’s still my favorite
battle system.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.940
Boss battles are also handled slightly different
than some other games; each boss’s stats

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.580
are based on alex’s level, which help to
make the game a little more fair for people

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.050
who didn’t grind through the dungeons.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.000
That doesn’t mean you can beat a boss that
you should fight at level 10 at level 5, mind

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.470
you, but it does even out the playing field
a little.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.020
It’s an element that you don’t see often
in the attempt to keep players from getting

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.489
too frustrated, and enhances the replay value
if you try to play through at different levels.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.980
And since you’ll be eager to move the story
along, the battles should feel cinematic and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.550
not overly difficult or annoying.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.720
Everything else in Lunar is kind of to be
expected, such as walking around town, exploring

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.739
dungeons, etc, but does feature an extremely
well detailed cast of main and supporting

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.780
characters, each of which you will get connected
to and see develop by the end of the game

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.229
in a realistic fashion.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.850
From Nash’s ego to Alex’s resolve, Lunar’s
characters are by far the most entertaining

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.320
and engaging aspect of the game, and a fun
and non-monotonous battle system make for

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.440
hours of solid RPG action.
