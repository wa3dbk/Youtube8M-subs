00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.750
How to Skydive for the First Time.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.500
Admit it, daredevil—you've been waiting
to fly since the day you were born.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.740
Find a great instructor, throw on that jumpsuit,
and get ready for freefall!

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.270
You will need To be 18 or older An accredited,
reputable jump school Good health Photo I.D.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.300
At least $200 Attentiveness and a sense of
adventure.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.210
Skydiving can be extremely dangerous.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.320
Investigate your skydiving school thoroughly,
and consult a doctor to make sure you're medically

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.570
fit to jump.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
Step 1.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.820
Make sure the school and instructors you choose
are certified and rated by the United States

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.100
Parachute Association.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.140
(If you're outside the U.S., look for a certification
from The World Air Sports Federation.)

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.690
Research their safety records and overall
reputation online.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.320
Skydiving schools are sometimes referred to
as "drop zones."

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.320
Step 2.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.720
You need to be in good shape, which means
you shouldn't be taking any medications that

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.710
affect coordination or decision-making process.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.600
If you have a pre-existing condition, consult
the jump school to see if they think they

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.930
can work with you.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.790
Also, don't scuba dive or donate blood for
at least 48 hours, and don't drink alcohol

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.009
for at least 8 hours before your jump date.

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.039
If you suffer from obesity, epilepsy, alcohol
or drug addiction, heart disease, or a tendency

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.819
to black out, choose a different sport.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:22.880
Step 3.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.249
Once you've decided on a jump school, pick
a day and book it.

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:32.159
You may be asked to put down a deposit in
advance, and to call to confirm your reservation.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.159
Step 4.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.209
On the day of your jump, eat a small meal
before heading to the drop zone.

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.539
Wear comfortable clothing that can fit under
a jumpsuit, and avoid overly tight or baggy

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.659
clothing, flip-flops, and high heels.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.459
Also, if there's any inclement weather, you
may need to wait a little while, so bring

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.450
something to keep yourself occupied.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.450
Step 5.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.380
At the school, you’ll be asked to provide
I.D. and review and sign several legal forms.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.369
Usually, these documents certify that you
understand the risk you're about to take,

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.180
and state that you waive the right to blame
the school if anything goes awry.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.259
These forms look scary, but they're fairly
standard.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.330
Read them through, and don't be afraid to
ask questions.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.330
Step 6.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.190
Your first skydive with an instructor can
cost as much as $200 (if not more), so make

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.939
sure you've got the resources to pay before
you go.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.260
For discount rates, try booking your jump
for a weekday or as part of a larger group.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.579
You may also pay more if you'd like to get
a DVD of your jump.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.709
Step 7.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.360
Don't expect to go solo.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.049
It's likely that, for your first dive, you'll
go as a tandem where you're strapped to the

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.480
front of an instructor.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.819
It's still super exciting, and much less dangerous
since your instructor's right there to help.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.819
Step 8.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.420
Before you head up, you'll be given an orientation
class, where you'll spend time getting comfortable

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.640
with the gear, the terminology, what to expect,
how to react, and what signals to look for.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.530
Each school's instruction is a little different,
so even if you think you know what's going

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.280
on, pay close attention.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.319
Step 9.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.160
Once you're appropriately attired with a jumpsuit,
a harness—which will hook up to your instructor—and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.340
goggles or glasses, you're ready to board
your flight.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.340
Step 10.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.480
When the moment's right, your instructor will
let you know that it's time to jump.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.510
Since your plane will ascend to a height between
10,000 and 14,000 feet, you'll enjoy as much

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.590
as 65 seconds of total freefall before your
tandem buddy signals you to pull the rip cord,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.090
which will deploy the parachute and slow your
fall.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.090
Step 11.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.680
Once you're on the ground, you'll sign a logbook,
proving that you completed a training dive.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.900
It's official—you've made your first jump!

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.219
Did you know Skydivers usually jump from 14,000
feet or below; at greater altitudes, the FAA

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.640
requires supplemental oxygen.
