Hi these are the technicians from AAAA TV,
electronics, vacuums, and appliance. We are

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.929
here today to show you how to do a Toshiba
bulb replacement for a Toshiba model number

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
Y-196LMP bulb.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.259
We are going to use a bulb replacement and
keep the original bulb housing. You want to

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.339
have a bulb replacement, you want to have
some gloves on, and a Phillips head screwdriver

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.200
in order to perform this replacement.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.200
First step, you're going to locate the screws
on the actual housing and unscrew them. When

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.320
you re-screw these screws you want to make
sure you don't over torque them or over

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.980
tighten because the plastic housing can warp.
And that's you know just piece of advice

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.960
after years of experience that we've notice
can be really helpful, as sometimes customers

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.940
over tighten screws.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.860
Also when you're installing the bulb over
tightening the screws on the actual glass

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.830
housing of the bulb can also cause cracking
and fracturing of the glass, so you just want

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.500
to be aware of that and you want to be careful.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.370
On this unit there are 2 screws that we loosen
from here, and then there's a screw that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.370
actually holds the power source to the lamp
which needs to be loosened. And that's this

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.650
screw right here.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.650
Toshiba made a great DLP TV technology, but
just like all DLP TV's on average you're

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.570
going to get 6,000 to 8,000 hours of usage.
That usually translates into about 3 to 5

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.870
years of TV watching depending on your frequency
of how much you watch TV. As you can tell

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.990
after we loosened those three screws, you
get into the inside of the housing where you'll

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.990
find the bulb itself and all the wiring. And
there are usually going to be 4 screws that

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.999
hold the bulb in place. You're just going
to unscrew all of those screws these are all

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:18.999
Phillips head screws so one screwdriver should
get the whole job done.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.329
Wearing the gloves is important because the
oils from your fingers can cause premature

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:32.329
burning of the bulb, it can cause the bulb
to wear out or fade sooner. Instead of getting

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.310
the full 6,000 to 8,000 hours of life you
may only get you know 2 -- 3 thousand hours.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.480
On average like I said 6-8 thousand hours
of usage from an original bulb, and that's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.480
what we sell here at AAAA TV Electronics Vacuum
and Appliance. They should last 3-5 years.

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:58.849
Now if the TV and the TV vents on the back
are set too close to a wall or if there is

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.849
a heat return next to the TV, or if the TV
just gets hours upon hours of usage also frequent

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.859
turning on and off of the TV can cause these
the bulbs to prematurely fail and can also

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.269
cause the bulbs to experience or give you
shorter life. It's not unusual for us to

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.739
have customers that come in and replace their
bulbs every year or 2 years.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.809
We have customers that use their bulbs a lot
more frequently than your average consumer,

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:34.809
some people run their TVs 10 to 12 hours a
day for various reasons, so keep in mind that

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.159
when you replace the bulb, that's the only
piece you're replacing.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.129
Another part also to take into consideration
is that when the bulb goes out sometimes it

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:51.029
will burn, sometimes it will explode. In this
situation, you'll notice that the bulb actually

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:56.159
busted, you can hear the shards of glass and
you can see the shards of glass in there.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:03.159
This is normal but a lot of times the bulb
will just burn and a lot of times it won't

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.290
be as visible as this were the bulb may have
just faded or burned after usage.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:18.609
When the bulb busts or burns out it can cause
the ballasts or the color wheels, color assemblies,

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.379
optical systems, to fail as well. You want
to make sure that when you put the bulb in

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:31.379
not to prematurely judge that its defective
all of our bulbs come pre tested and so if

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.599
it doesn't work when you put the new bulb
in, it may mean that there's another issue

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.580
that may need to be addressed.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.580
We're unwrapping and installing the new
bulb now.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.940
You want to be sure to line it up the same
way as the original. You also want to keep

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.909
track of where the wires are because you don't
want the wires to be too short if you angle

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.699
the bulb the wrong way. You want to make sure
that those wires are actually going to get

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.150
to where they need to be screwed in. As you
can tell we probably need to reposition the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.710
bulb so that the wires are actually on the
back side.
