00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.660
Contrary to its curiously irrelevant title,
this is actually a feature-film, and not a

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.750
book at all.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.020
The Wolfgang Reitherman animated family adventure
film was released in October of 1967, and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.750
has since earned over fifty-times its small
four million dollar budget from three separate

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.220
theatrical releases.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.530
Very loosely inspired by Rudyard Kipling's
book of the same name, Walt Disney's 19th

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.050
animated feature is notable as it is the last
one he produced, having died during producing

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.050
in 1966.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.840
The extremely short, but still leisurely paced
78-minute story follows a young human's journey

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.590
as he ventures through the jungle with a talking
bear, after a childhood of being raised by

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.590
wolves.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.589
Along the way he encounters friends, foes,
and plenty of musical numbers to keep the

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.390
youngsters in the audience entertained.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.980
Unfortunately, that's it though - the plot
here is extremely thin, and offers very little

00:00:46.980 --> 00:01:05.729
in the realm of humor or excitement.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:27.070
Undoubtedly, the most memorable part of "Approved"-rated
picture is Phil Harris's central musical number,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.970
"The Bare Necessities", a swing band-style
song that sees the anthropomorphized sloth

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.410
bear he voices shaking his rump and teaching
Bruce Reitherman about life in the jungle.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.770
Likely scoring the gig thanks to his director
father, Bruce does an above-average job as

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.450
the whimsical and clueless "man-cub" who sees
no issue taking advice from a deadly black

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.440
panther, or a carefree bear, reminding them,
"I'm a lot tougher than some people think."

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.130
Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, George Sanders,
the original voice of Winnie The Pooh, Sterling

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.830
Holloway, and even Clint Howard are some of
the names in film's large cast.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.270
On the technical side of things, I'm not really
a fan of the layered animation style - which

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.730
although richly detailed and beautiful...
has an inconsistency to it that's hard not

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.730
to notice.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.040
The characters are rendered with bright fluid
colors, but they feel very pasted on to the

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.600
muted matte-painting backgrounds.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.230
The low-key score from George Bruns isn't
very inventive or varied, and unfortunately

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.270
sounds a bit dated today, especially alongside
some more cartoony sound effects during the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.270
action sequences.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.939
The film's one-note antagonist doesn't appear
until more than two-thirds of the way through,

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.860
when he finally does though - a final confrontation
between all the animals is fast and exciting,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.560
and thanks to some loud music and violent
imagery, it'll also likely scare little children.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.019
Thankfully, everything is wrapped up nicely
in a rushed ending that actually works decently

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.430
well - reminding us all that sometimes the
correct path isn't always the want you think

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.430
you'll want.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.330
Some fun moments for kids, but this movie
just isn't quite on the same level of other

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.349
Disney classics.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.159
"The Jungle Book", "Loose narrative with upbeat
animals."

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:56.290
Here's what you had to say in the YouTube
comments.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.209
Our scores now for "The Jungle Book", an EIGHT
and a SIX.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.019
You praised the fun adventure and characters,
but conceded it is far from perfect, rating

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.040
it a GREAT.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.939
Inherently, my not seeing this until very
recently skews my perception a bit, but I

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.430
honestly wasn't really impressed by anything.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.859
A quick and enjoyable experience, I thought
it was GOOD.
