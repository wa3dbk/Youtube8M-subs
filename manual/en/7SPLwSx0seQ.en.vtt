00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
The old town at the far east of the Hastings
seafront gives us some productive marks to

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.910
fish with clean sand between clumps of rocks.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.790
Quite a good range of species is reported
as being captured here...the mackerel come

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.830
in, plaice, gurnard, sole, bass, cod.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.830
At the extreme east of the mark you can get
down in front of the cliffs to fish the rocks.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.940
You can also fish from the wall, casting into
mixed ground.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.679
The other wall to our right forms the east
side of the harbour and can be fished from,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.160
again with clean and rocky ground below.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.089
We'll venture later westwards towards the
pier but the benefit of fishing this end of

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.789
Hastings is the deeper water in front of you.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.149
Parking is available for hundreds of cars
and is right on the beach.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.260
We're in the middle of the harbour now, the
breakwater you can see forming the other side

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360
of it.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.610
If you fish up against that wall be aware
the gap, which looks tempting, is very snaggy

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.970
for quite a way from the wall.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.480
Every local I've spoken to here says fishing in
the harbour, or just the other side of the

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.260
breakwater, are the hot spots.

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:27.040
To find out more local info, there's a club
in Hastings with a beach section that are

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.660
well worth joining, with matches and a beach
festival.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.209
Moving westwards away from the harbour the
sea shallows up but there is the enticing

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.160
feature of the old burned down pier to fish
up against.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.660
Consider getting up as close to the pier legs
as you can.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.620
The currents scour out hollows as you can
see and food collects there.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.620
Every hole I looked in, sure enough, had something
living in it.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.760
The car park is underneath the pier just off
the main coast road.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
Just before we leave the Hastings area, a
very quick stop off at neighbouring Saint

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.160
Leonards to show you a rock feature - you
can still see the Hastings pier in the background.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.580
This group of rocks is called Goat Ledge and
as you look out to sea is just to the left

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.500
of the sailing club.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.360
Definitely worth thinking about putting a
bait close to those rocks for a bass.
