00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.010
Early evidence of the crash landing at San
Francisco International Airport shows the

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.080
plane was coming in too slow and too low.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.869
The deadly incident killed two teenage Chinese
girls and seriously injured scores of other

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:18.869
passengers.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.160
Hwang Ji-hye has the details.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.179
Clues are pouring in for what may have went
wrong when Asiana Airlines Flight No. 214

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.930
crash landed at San Francisco International
Airport just before noon on Saturday.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.010
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
Chairman Deborah Hersman said at a briefing

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.649
on Sunday... that the plane tried to speed
up and abort seconds before it struck a seawall...

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.140
and then skidded across the runway catching
fire.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.649
The preliminary information came from the
plane's flight recorders that are being analyzed

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.109
in Washington.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.899
According to the recording,... the pilots
did not discuss any aircraft anomalies as

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.570
they approached the runway... but seven seconds
before the crash,... a crew member called

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.850
for an increase in speed.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.300
Hersman said the plane's approach speed was
well below the 137-knot target speed... needed

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.500
to maintain a stable angle of approach.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.690
One-and-a-half seconds before the crash, the
pilots asked for a "go-round"... which is

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.580
pilot-speak for aborting the landing.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.710
Herman said nothing was off the table to determine
the cause of the incident.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.250
An investigation team from Korea, that includes
officials from the transportation ministry

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.470
and Asiana Airlines, also arrived in San Francisco
on Sunday to work closely with U.S. officials

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.750
there.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.610
Two Chinese teenagers were killed... and more
than 180 passengers were injured when the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.840
airliner burst into flames upon landing in
San Francisco.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.660
Some of the injured suffered spinal fractures,
including paralysis, and others had head trauma

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.780
and abdominal injuries.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.950
Forty-four Koreans were hurt.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.570
All but eight had left the hospital by Sunday
morning.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.130
