00:00:06.732 --> 00:00:11.469
The 3rd gen Ford Focus is halfway past its life cycle.

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.414
So it's time for a major update.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:26.680
This facelift includes a new front in line with the rest of the family.

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:30.434
Things have changed under the bonnet, too. 

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:38.911
The same goes for the chassis, steering, electronics and the dashboard.

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:55.197
The old 3rd gen had a terrible array of buttons in the centre console.

00:00:56.408 --> 00:01:11.118
The new design is much more minimalistic with easier controls.

00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:18.342
Also in part thanks to this new touch screen and voice controls.

00:01:18.857 --> 00:01:27.538
You will have to learn the proper commands for that, though.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:38.505
The wheel has been redesigned, too. The buttons are a bit too small though.

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:56.275
As for the engines: the 1.6.'s have been replaced by 1.5's, petrol and diesel.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:09.212
We're driving the 180 PS petrol, which is smooth, quick and has plenty of punch.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:18.442
You will have to shift down if you slow down too much, though.

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:26.953
The gearbox feels light yet direct. It's all good.

00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:49.216
The first 2 generations of Focus are known for their dynamic underpinnings.

00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:59.991
The 3rd gen seemed less ahead of the competition. Ford has worked on that.

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:07.357
It's more stiff at the front, thanks to stiffer rubbers, and the geometry has changed.

00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:17.296
The car handles even better now without losing comfort. Well done.

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:34.007
We're a bit hungry, so let's try out the voice controls!

00:04:32.262 --> 00:04:34.740
+ Simpler dashboard, stable chassis

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.463
- Small buttons on the wheel, set speech commands

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.773
We managed with the voice controls. 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.104
The improved chassis and new engines are what this car is all about.

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:57.948
This car is well-prepared for its second phase. Let's go get some tapas.
