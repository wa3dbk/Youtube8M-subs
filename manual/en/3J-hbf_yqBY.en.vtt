00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.900
Hello and welcome to Botaniskt ("Botanical").
My name is Olle Lindestad,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.900
I study for a Master's of Ecology,
and I intern...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.900
... at the Lund University Botanical Gardens.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.900
In this series, with the help of the
collections of the Gardens,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.900
I will give you a tiny taste of the
huge field of botany.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.900
We will visit the denizens of the Gardens, and look
into the strange and wonderful lives of plants.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.900
To begin with we're going to get
familiar with the Gardens.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.900
Unfortunately, winter still grips the land,
and out here there's not a lot happening.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.900
However, in the greenhouses behind me
it's a whole different story.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.900
The Gardens grow a total of 7000 plant species, and
2000 of those can be found in the greenhouses.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.900
The greenhouses were built in the late 19th century,
and are divided into nine sections.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.900
The climate here in the greenhouses is closely monitored,
but it also follows the seasons -

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.900
so what you get to see, what's in bloom or bearing fruit
and so on, depends somewhat on when you visit.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.900
Here in the Palm Greenhouse, the climate is tropical - between
22 and 28 degrees C and 70% humidity, which is quite noticeable.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.900
The Palm Greenhouse is one of the oldest parts of the greenhouses,
containing some specimens that have been there from the start.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.900
This screwpine, for example, is more than 140 years old.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.900
This is a cocoa tree. Cocoa is made from the seeds
inside these fruits - fermented, dried and roasted.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.900
And then you get cocoa.
And then you get chocolate.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.900
Next to the Palm Greenhouse is another tropical section with
a slightly cooler climate: the Victoria Greenhouse.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.900
Unfortunately the pond behind me is drained at this time of year,
but later in the spring the giant Victoria waterlily will grow here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.900
Its leaves can grow up to two meters in size.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.900
In May or June, the giant waterlily produces a half-meter flower,
which is only in bloom for a couple of days -

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.900
- and then it's pulled down under the water surface for the seeds to
develop.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.900
The Victoria Greenhouse houses several important tropical crops;
this, for example, is a banana plant.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.900
There are also animals - a Madagascar gecko, and this...

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.900
... poison dart frog, which is a lot more difficult to spot.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.900
The next tropical section is the Pimenta Greenhouse, named for
this, the pimenta (allspice) tree, which belongs to the myrtle family.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.900
The specific name "dioica" means that it is dioecious, having
separate male and female individuals.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.900
But we don't know if this is a male or a female, because as far as we
know it has never borne flowers, which is the only way to tell.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.900
Plants may not be known for their fast responses, but this
touch-me-not happens to be an exception.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.900
Watch this.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.900
How does it do this? Well, it doesn't have muscles in its leaves
or anything like that.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.900
In fact it regulates the turgor pressure in the leaf petioles
by pumping water out of the cells.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.900
And so the leaves snap shut.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.900
This is in fact what wild bananas look like - not much
like anything we're used to.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.900
Just beyond the banana plant we find the Monstera.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.900
Monstera grows in Central America. The huge leaves have holes
right through them - it's supposed to look like this.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.900
It lets rain through the leaf, which keeps it from breaking
during a storm.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.900
A bit like the plant equivalent of pre-torn jeans.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.900
The Orchid Greenhouse! Here be orchids.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.900
In the tropics, orchids commonly grow as epiphytes, meaning they're
attached to other plants - not as parasites, just as hangers-on.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.900
That allows you to grow them on pieces of bark, like so.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.900
Across the greenhouse we find one of the world's few edible orchids,
namely vanilla. Vanilla is also remarkable for its small seeds -

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.900
- among the smallest seeds known in the plant kingdom.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.900
This isn't an orchid, but it is an epiphyte - it's known as Spanish moss,
unfortunately, given that it's neither Spanish nor a moss.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.733
It's actually a bromeliad from the Caribbean.
Also makes a good beard...

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.900
You're probably not supposed to do that.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.900
At either end of the greenhouses are two cooler sections.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.900
One of them is the Orangerie, which was initially built to house
citrus trees and other frost-sensitive plants in the winter.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.900
The air in here is quite dry, and the current temperature is
about 15 degrees C.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.900
Lots of nice and handsome trees in here - like this Australian
Araucaria, which goes all the way to the ceiling.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.900
The Japanese loquat tree is notable for blooming in the autumn
and bearing fruit in the spring. It belongs to the rose family...

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.900
... just like apple trees, and... roses. As well.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.900
This is a tamarillo tree, and... indeed, here are some tamarillos.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.900
They're quite edible, like slighly bitter tomatoes, or so I hear.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.900
The western cool section also started out as an orangerie, but these
days goes by the Agathis Greenhouse, after the Agathis (kauri).

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:15.900
Kauri trees grow in Australasia. Their stems are tall, unbranching and naturally
impregnated with resin, making them ideal for making ship's masts in past times.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.900
Here's a bucket of papyrus... 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.900
So yes, this is what the Egyptians made their paper out of.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.900
You take the stems, slice them, lay them out at right angles
and hammer them like this, and then you get paper.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.900
...If you're an ancient Egyptian.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.900
The Fern Greenhouse contains ferns of different shapes and sizes, but
also a selection of cold-tolerant plants.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.900
The vegetation in here might seem exotic, but because ferns like it
cool and shady, it's not as hot in here as in the tropical greenhouses.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.900
The Mediterranean Greenhouse has Mediterranean climate, meaning
winters are cool, summers are hot, and day and night vary a lot.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.900
Here we find several important food plants, such as lemon,
and coffee over here...

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.900
Is it just me, or does the whole plant smell like coffee?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.900
There's also a large and varied collection of carnivorous plants. What they
all have in common is growing in areas where the ground is poor in nitrogen -

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.900
- so eating insects is a good way of getting a bit of nitrogen into your diet.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.900
Lastly, the Cactus Greenhouse. This is the desert section, with large variation
between day/night and between seasons, and a maximum temperature of 30 C.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.900
The plants that grow here are specialized for growing in arid environments,
and some of them are quite strangely shaped, like this elephant's foot.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.900
Quite fat at the bottom, and... very thin at the top.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.900
But what about cacti? Where do they come from, how do they work, and
why do they look the way they do?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.900
In next week's episode we'll dig deep into that topic. See you then!
