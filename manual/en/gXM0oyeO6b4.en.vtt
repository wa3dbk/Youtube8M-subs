00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.090
Natural Remedies of Osteoarthritis

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.090
By

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.090
Dr. James Meschino, DC, MS, ND

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.860
Osteoarthritis is sometimes called degenerative
arthritis, and that’s because it’s often

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.680
related to aging.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.700
As we grow older, almost everyone runs into
some type of osteoarthritis over time.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.420
We used to think it was a wear and tear problem
because it seemed to happen as people grew

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.020
older, but we realized during the 1980s that
was not the case.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.559
In fact, many who use their joints frequently
have the healthiest joints as they grow older,

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.210
so osteoarthritis isn’t caused by wear and
tear.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.800
Since the big breakthrough in the 1980s, we’ve
noticed that one of the underlying biochemical

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.990
and genetic steps to osteoarthritis development
is that the body will stop creating optimal

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.170
amounts of glucosamine.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.000
You’ve probably heard of glucosamine when
being used a supplement, but the body makes

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.979
glucosamine as well, and it needs that same
glucosamine to create joint cartilage.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.240
You see, there is normally a turnover of the
joint cartilage – you break some cartilage

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.170
down and the body synthesizes new cartilage
to replace it.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.689
It’s a natural dynamic flex of the body,
as we call it.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.651
After the age of 40, the enzyme that makes
glucosamine drops off and you can’t make

00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.390
it the same way you did when you were younger.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.399
The result is over time, the cartilage breaks
down and becomes thinner; on x-rays you begin

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.890
to see bones getting a little closer together
and a narrowing of the joint space, as we

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.299
say, when we look at those x-rays.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.329
For a long time, no one really knew what to
do about this, but in recent years we realize

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.009
if a patient runs out of glucosamine that
we could possibly supplement them with glucosamine

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.659
to compensate for the glucosamine the body
no longer was making itself.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.499
Studies now show that’s exactly the case.

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.819
We’re seeing that glucosamine can be very
helpful, but that’s not the whole story

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.260
around osteoarthritis.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.930
There is something like a lining of saran
wrap on our joints, and on the lining of that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.731
saran wrap, there are immune cells called
monocytes.

00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:25.150
These monocytes morph into macrophages, and
as we become older, these macrophages secrete

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.280
a certain chemical – or cytokines – that
also promote more inflammation and pain as

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.320
we grow older, and that becomes a part of
the aging process, as well.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.880
The best way to prevent osteoarthritis and
to manage it long term is to give the body

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.080
back glucosamine in the form of supplementation
because when we put glucosamine in our bodies,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.800
it gives our bodies the raw materials to begin
making that cartilage to once again stabilize

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800
it.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.430
There are no drugs that can rebuild your joint
cartilage to stabilize it.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.310
Some people make the mistake of taking chondroitin
sulfates or they take glucosamine with chondroitin.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.880
The body can’t really absorb much of the
chondroitin, so taking it is sort of useless.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.090
It’s far better to combine glucosamine with
three natural anti-inflammatory herbs – bromelain,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.440
MSM and quercetin.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.200
When you put these three together, you get
a natural anti-inflammatory effect that suppresses

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.850
the inflammatory chemicals, helping to stabilize
the joint cartilage.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.140
Combine this with a good anti-inflammatory
diet – fewer high fat animal products, using

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.660
caution with certain vegetable oils that can
produce inflammation, and a good exercise

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.920
program – you’re on your way to healthy
joints for a lifetime, in most cases.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.440
When many family doctors, rheumatologists
and orthopedists see patients with arthritic

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.090
conditions like this, they will fail to tell
their patients about the importance of diet

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.730
and lifestyle modification in the long term
management of this condition.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.920
It’s very unfortunate – in fact, disappointing
– because the evidence is so strong and

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.100
consistent, and I’ve see it help so many
people that not to inform their patients is

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.100
a disservice.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.510
In addition to whatever drugs a patient is
taking, lifestyle management is equally important.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.870
The best thing you can do to understand this
is to download my eBook on the proven, natural

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.720
remedies for joint pain, arthritis and inflammation.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.650
I suggest you do that right away.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.669
The booklet shows you exactly the lifestyle
plan to help you better manage any arthritic

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.410
condition and it can be used with any drugs
or medical treatments that have been offered

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.420
to you thus far.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.509
In fact, every single arthritic patient should
have a copy of this eBook, Proven Natural

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:47.400
Remedies for Joint Pain, Arthritis and Inflammation.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.080
