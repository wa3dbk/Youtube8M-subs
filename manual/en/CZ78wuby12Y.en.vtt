Welcome to another video about
my old sled

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.030
now it's a beautiful day to
get out on the trail so

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.700
I thought I'd do a quick video with a few tips for

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.880
your first ride. Now I am NOT a
professional but that's okay because

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.310
this video is not for professionals it's for
beginners so, just like me

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.369
... last year I bought my first sled and

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.869
the fellow that I bought it from dropped
It off in my driveway and I had no idea what to do with it. 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.989
So I asked a lot of questions between
then and now

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.110
and hopefully this video will give you some of the tips that I picked up along

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
The way. So before you run your sled at all

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.610
The first thing you want to do is make sure its not frozen to the ground. So you want to pick the back and the front end up

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.610
Just to break it loose if it is frozen, then you're not going to put too much strain on the belt drive.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.179
Now you really don't want to break down when you're miles out on
the trails so take a few minutes and

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:02.159
Go over your sled front to 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.259
back to make sure you've got enough oil,  enough gas, enough coolant.

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.259
take a minute and give the suspension a quick visual inspection

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.250
sometimes that awful feeling that you feel when your sled stalls in the middle of

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.780
nowhere

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.140
is nicely offset when you suddenly
realize that you just forgot to turn the fuel supply on.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.940
check the drive belt for wear or damage
and always make sure you carry a spare

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.030
make sure that your throttles not

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
frozen up because if it sticks when you
start it the sled could take off on you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.340
Now one advantage to buying a good snowmobile helmet, 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.350
is they're designed to keep from fogging up, either because the visor is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.580
heated, or because your breath is directed  away from the visor.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.899
I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.300
what to wear when you're riding, there's already a lot of videos about how to layer or what to wear for

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.729
different types of riding but the one thing I wanted to make sure I mention was around 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.220
the pants

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.790
so

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.520
the one investment definitely make is a good pair of the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.750
the chest high bib style snowmobile
pants and the reason I say that

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.880
I learned the hard way originally when
I was riding I was wearing

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.440
just kinda a pair of the waist-high snow pants and what I quickly discovered is that

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.810
you get a helluva draft

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.980
across your lower back when the jacket rides up

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.980
and you get cold pretty quick, so its a good investment

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.140
Braap

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.519
the basic controls of your snowmobile are fairly easy to get the hang of 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.120
but you do need to remember to lean

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.540
particularly in loose powder the snowmobile is going to tend to tip, or lean

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.549
away from the direction that your
turning and

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.189
so if you are turning right, the snowmobile is gonna want to tip left especially if you're  going

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:54.689
faster

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.510
to make sure that you lean out into the
direction that you're turning to keep the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.000
snowmobile flat... If I have last tip to leave
you with its about a trail

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.100
permit...You've probably probably asked yourself is it worth going out and spending the money on a 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.740
trail permit.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.000
Rather than tell you I can just show you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.710
I mean just look at this - it's like driving down the highway except in the middle

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.220
of the bush and it's absolutely beautiful Alright guys I hope you found that useful if you did go ahead and hit 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.420
subscribe. If you're looking for more
information on snowmobiling, I really

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.470
suggest check out

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.459
your local snowmobile club. Not only will they be able to put you to work as a lot of

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.360

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.370
they can be a huge help to you as well... So

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.030
