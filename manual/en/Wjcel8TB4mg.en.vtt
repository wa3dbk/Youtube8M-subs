00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.050
All right, continuing.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.770
We're going to look
at how to order

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.183
real numbers, all real numbers,
not just rational numbers,

00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:13.340
but all real numbers.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.610
So let's see how we do that.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.190
 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.430
Given any two real
numbers, either they

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.260
are equal to each other or
one is bigger than the other.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.430
This is called the Trichotomy
Property of real numbers.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.500
So this property allows
us to order numbers

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.280
from smallest to
largest or largest

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.730
to smallest, so ascending
or descending order.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.730
Descending means you're going
from largest to smallest.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.320
Ascending means that you're
going from smallest to largest.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.180
Let's say I want to order
these decimal numbers.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.940
If you want to order
decimal numbers,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.680
the first thing
is to get them all

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.960
to have equal number of digits.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.970
If you look right
now-- 45.69 and 3.4--

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.140
they don't have the
same number of digits.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.470
So in all the
missing place values,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.699
you insert 0's so that
they all have four digits,

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:16.490
because that's the
largest number of digits

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.460
across the numbers.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.260
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3,
4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.380
Anywhere I was missing a digit,
I inserted a 0 in its place.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.730
Now look, 4, 1.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.330
2 and 0.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.750
So clearly, 0 is
smaller than 2, right?

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.110
So these two numbers
will have to be switched.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.270
So let's do that.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.000
So you start with the
largest place value.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.080
The largest place value in
our case is the 10ths place.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.600
So we start with
the 10ths place,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.310
and you look at
the largest number

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.880
in the 10ths place--
so 4, 0, 2, 0.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.290
4 is in the largest place, so
that needs to stay up here.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.620
But here we have 0,
here we have a 2,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.370
so these two numbers
should switch.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.340
All right, so let's do that.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.510
Once you've done that,
now we have 4, 2, 0, 0.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.340
But now we need to
look at the next digit.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.170
Clearly, this number is
on top because it does not

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.340
share digits with anybody
else-- the 10ths place digit.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340
So now we look at 2.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.670
2 is in the 10ths place here,
so that also stays here.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.760
It does not share it
with anybody else,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.990
and it's the
largest among those.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.380
But here we have 0, 0.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.240
If the highest place
value digits match,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.030
that means they are equal, then
you have to look at the next.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.040
So here's the next digit in
the units place, or 1's place.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.780
The units place here is 3,
the units place here is 3.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.580
They match, so we can't
really do anything there.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.290
Let's look at the 10ths place.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.390
They both share a 4
in the 10ths place.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.540
So you keep on comparing
them until you have aligned

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.840
all your numbers the
way you want them.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.740
Let's look at the next digit.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.310
OK, here there are different.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.850
So in the 100ths place, here
we have a 0, here we have a 9.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.500
0, 9, so 9 is bigger than 0,
so we need to switch those.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.550
So switching those
will give you that.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.700
Now there are no more digits
or numbers to compare,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.620
so now we have our numbers
from highest to lowest.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.830
So take a look,
our numbers, then,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:50.910
are going to be 45.69, 23.4,
3.49, 3.4-- highest to lowest.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.250
Make sure-- what did we just do?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.770
I'm just repeating the
steps, so you understand.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.780
All the digits should
have something in them.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.380
So if a digit is missing in a
place value, you add 0 in it,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.800
so all numbers have
equal place values.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.370
Then you start comparing from
the leftmost digit, which

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.800
is the highest place value,
and you start comparing

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.040
and then start arranging them.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.870
Let's take another example.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.930
What if they are not
written in decimal form,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.030
they are written
in fraction form.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.950
Well now that we know how to
make equivalent fractions,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.070
we will make equivalent
fractions for all four

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.350
of the numbers that we have.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.680
We have a 3 and a 5, so 15
will be the common denominator.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.880
You can choose any number.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.430
It doesn't have to be
5, just so that they all

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.900
have the same denominator.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.760
So you have 10/15, 9/15,
negative 12/15, negative 5/15.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.290
And this time we
want to arrange them

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.580
in ascending order,
so lowest to highest.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.880
Our numbers, written with common
denominators are like this.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.960
Now take a look.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.430
So when we write our
numbers in ascending order,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.574
since the denominators
are the same,

00:05:10.574 --> 00:05:12.240
you just have to line
up the numerators.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.230
So we have negative 12,
negative 5, 9, and 10,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.250
and that's how it's
going to look then.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.000
You can see negative 12
is less than negative 5.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.480
Why is that?

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.970
Because owing
somebody $12 is worse

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.640
than owing somebody
just $5, right?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.720
So when you think
of negative numbers,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.340
you can think of them as
debt or owing something.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.440
That will allow you to
order them properly.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.180
All right, let's see
if you can do that.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.400
Do the same process like we
did in the first example.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.970
I'll give you a few moments,
so pause the video, here,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.000
and see what you can do.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.770
Are you pausing?

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.900
 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.780
All right, assuming you've
paused and come back,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.540
we put 0's in the places where
necessary and then order them.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.430
Negative 4 should
go at the bottom.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.460
So that would be my first
number, so let's do that.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.072
And then we have
everything in order.

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:20.780
Then, lets take a look
at the next digit.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.470
 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.940
These two are already in
place, but these two shared a 2

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.650
in the first digit, so we
have to keep comparing them

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.040
until they differ.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.610
So here they differ.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.210
We have a 0, here,
and a 3, here.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.260
So what do you think?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.490
It's already in order, right?

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.250
Good, we don't have
to do anything.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.250
Here's your next set of
the video log questions.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.100
 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.220
This number here is 10,012.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:00.440
So we have 9,987.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.710
Here's your next set
of video log questions.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:13.250
This first row is
9,987, 10,012, 8,999.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.810
in case it wasn't clear.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:40.334
