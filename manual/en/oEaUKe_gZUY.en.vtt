00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:09.310
You've just entered the
theater of an alien sky.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.308
If the words and images seem strange to
you there's a reason for this.

00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:17.570
Our world was once a
vastly different place.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.618
To experience this won't hurt you
and there is nothing to fear.

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.750
The mythic archetype of a
great ancestral warrior or hero

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.689
is surely the most popular
mythic theme of all time.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:49.079
And yet, thousands of years after the
first expressions of the archetype,

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.539
can anyone rightfully claim to
have penetrated the mystery?

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.868
Even today, despite countless
volumes written on the subject,

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:01.408
a convincing answer seems
entirely out of reach.

00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:07.659
What human experience could have inspired
a worldwide image of a superhero

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:16.289
rescuing the world, from chaos monsters?
That's just one of the globally repeated mysteries.

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.840
Why the birth of this great ancestor
from the womb of a revered mother goddess?

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.990
Why the exposure or abandonment
of the hero at birth?

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.799
Or the murder or displacement of his father?

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.209
Why was the god himself so
frequently identified as an

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:44.250
unerring arrow, sword, spear or hammer, a weapon
that turns out to be a cosmic thunderbolt.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.999
Yes! A thunderbolt, but with no similarity
to lightning in our sky today.

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.250
Absolutely nothing makes sense
under any familiar references.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.289
And yet the themes are so fully
connected that one archetypal

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.079
attribute leads seamlessly
to another, then another.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.920
There must be an explanation, and yet
common beliefs will not permit an explanation.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.949
That's the logical contradiction arising
from today's accepted stories of human history

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:23.759
and planetary history. The problem lies in an
unsupported theoretical assumption.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:29.250
The assumption is: As today, so before.
Well, that's a trap;

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.219
It holds our attention on today's
uneventful solar system,

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.500
even as the human record
speaks with a thousand voices

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.819
for a violent and catastrophic
planetary history.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.270
In popular accounts, the prominent heroes
are quasi-divine, big and strong men

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.360
who rescue humanity from chaos monsters.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.220
One astronomical tradition after another
names this warrior figure as the planet Mars.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.479
The farther back we go the more the
divine or celestial character

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:20.780
of the hero stands out. Such Egyptian
warrior figures as Shu,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.180
or Horus, or Amon were originally 
celestial figures beyond a shadow of a doubt,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.770
but later localized through
regional storytelling.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.950
The same can be said of the ancient Sumerian
and Akkadian counterparts, Damuzi

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.419
or Tammuz, the Mars gods Ningirsu
or Nergal, and even Gilgamesh.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:47.069
Eventually, localized cult practices
transformed such figures into legendary

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.230
ancestors of those recounting the stories.
Our answer to the dilemma

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.330
lies in a testable reconstruction of
things never imagined in our time.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.760
The reconstruction leads us back to a
gathering of planets close to Earth,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.349
all the events occurring prior to the
present organization of the solar system.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.349
Planets have not always
moved on their present courses.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.360
Our subject is the ancient
polar configuration,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.049
where the warrior-hero finds a full and
complete explanation in the activity of

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.649
the dark, reddish, innermost sphere.

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.970
The planet Mars was the centerpiece
of the cosmic thunderbolt.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.530
The testability of this
reconstruction lies in the contribution

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.300
a visible forms and explicit
sequences of events;

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.639
all testifying to the global
substructure of human memory.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.540
What will happen to our
understanding of human history

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.850
if it can be seen beyond
any reasonable doubt

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.410
that the warrior-hero archetype requires
celestial events having no parallel in

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.439
natural experience today?

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.399
What does it mean when
the warrior-king on Earth

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.970
symbolically dons, as his crown, the
revered glory of heaven.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.160
That even meant the king's conjunction
with, and marriage to the archetypal star

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.910
goddess, identifiable as the planet Venus.

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:43.350
Many parallel symbols are equally
important. Just one example is the

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.210
identification of the exploding radiance,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.600
the essential quality of the star
goddess, as the warrior-king's

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.820
shield, mythically his
gift from the goddess.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.589
That identification magically confirms
the local king as an incarnation, or

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:05.228
avatar of a celestial prototype, the
warrior king as mythic protector and

00:06:05.228 --> 00:06:10.970
owner of the terrifying glory. That's
what the word hero literally means.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.979
Name any broadly repeated theme
attached to the hero archetype,

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.019
observe it's place in the reconstruction,

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.779
and you'll find additional themes
that are just as explicit.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.399
No room for ambiguity or for simply
making up explanations.

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:32.529
Ask the question. Does
any popular explanation

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:37.478
actually work? In the context of our
reconstruction, the required patterns

00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:41.270
must show up. Globally.
If the events occurred.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.770
We'll follow that logic to further conclusions
in our next segment.
