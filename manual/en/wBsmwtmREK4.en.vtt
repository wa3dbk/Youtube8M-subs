00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.980
 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.120
One of the big areas of Android 4.4

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.820
but also an element that is coming really as part of Google+ to all handsets

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.850
is the new photos tool.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.060
Now this tool is absolutely fantastic.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.110
It allows you to interact with all of your
images and videos

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.110
very easily so you can now use it to
browse through

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.660
all of your photos and videos. You can then set certain photos and videos that you want to upload into Google's cloud

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.000
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.180
and have them AutoAwesomed, including the new

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.700
video tool, which I'm going to show you. So the way this works

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.980
is you simply go into videos

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.090
you select the videos that you would like to AutoAwesome. I'll just find a couple I've

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.410
got in here from my holiday collection

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.430
 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.399
Let's just take a couple of these. Now just be careful when you do this because if you tap on the little expander

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.390
down at the bottom here it will send the video full screen and you have to page back you just want to kind of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.059
tap on the centre.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.310
Hit select  and what the system will now do

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.460
is analyzes all of those videos and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.300
it starts to cut them together with music and
transitions and everything else

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.300
to make them awesome.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.080
 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.080
 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.690
 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.200
 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.290
You can see there just three very short
videos

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.110
and it's rapidly cut them together for me.
Now what it does it does like a

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.770
very small resolution render

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.050
and what you then do is you can then add a
title call this

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.720
test and then you can

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.140
oops, let's just go into here, so you've got different music as well that you

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.600
can drop on and also then just save and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.470
off it will then go. And it will then show
you how much of each one it's taken

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.860
to make use of. You can add some more photos if you'd like. And then click save.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.360
And then you can select the quality.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.520
We'll send that up at 1080p. At that point the video footage it's sent over to Google I believe it does all

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.110
of  the rendering and processing there based on

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.120
the settings that you've selected.  This is very much all about the cloud,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.790
your device isn't really doing very
much other than this initial  little bit of

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.650
processing that may help with Google.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.820
Now  this is quite interesting.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.050
Instead of using a traditional kind of slider that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.390
says 10% complete and what have you, it has this circle that spins round and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.440
as the circle grows it's done more and more
rendering.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.570
It's really nice and it's great to kind of get
away from the usual kind of

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.080
tick-tick-tick-tick-tick percentage bar. If you're

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.370
uploading a lot of videos or if you're uploading quite big videos

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.950
initially what will happen is it will
show you a percentage indicator

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.170
just saying, you know, that 20% of this video has been rendered but when you're dealing with just a few small ones

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.170
then it's very quick and easy. It's just a
wonderful wonderful feature.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.820
When you combine that with kind of how the new photo app is working which we

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.120
believe is going to replace the gallery
soon enough

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.140
if it hasn't already in fact, it really is a
fantastic departure from the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.180
previous rather crummy app

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.799
in my opinion.  You can see it's backing up one photo, it's actually backing up a video at the moment and Google probably just need to

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.010
tidy that up a little bit so that

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.610
it's a bit more obvious what it's doing. It's 
backing up a video right now and not

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.630
a photo but anyway, little bugs for you but

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.450
all of your images and everything all in
there as highlights going back in

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.329
in chronological order, or you can
go through and select them. You can put

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.350
pictures and videos all into these AutoAwesome videos and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.530
it will handle them quite nicely. It really is a
wonderful little

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.329
extra that's coming to Android and obviously to Google+ as well.

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.799
I would expect to see it on IOS as well at some point.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.230
 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:16.620
