hi I'm Chris from Fibre Glast

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.589
today we're going to show you our number
684 neutral gel coat

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.130
that we carry on Fibre Glast dot com
number 684 neutral gel coat

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.630
is a high-performance premium quality isophthalic gel coat

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.160
designed for use with pigment during
laminate fabrication

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.439
number 684 is the industry standard
offering superior color consistency

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.740
and a high gloss finish it can be used
as a sandable base coat or

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.260
sprayed unthinned into molds using a gel
coat cup gun

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.200
however many people still do prefer to
thin gel coat

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.050
if you want to thin our 684 you need to do so with styrene thinner

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.840
 never thin gel coat with acetone
because acetone will

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.570
actually degrade the resin 684 can be
used for underwater and marine

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.300
applications providing protection from
sun

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.750
salt and rough handling its general
durability

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.850
high gloss and easy handling make it
ideal for most polyester fabrications

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.540
684 is exceptionally application
friendly

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.450
It pours easily and can be sprayed 
unthinned with the gel coat cup gun

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.370
always measure both gel coat and MEKP
carefully

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.780
number 684 is catalyzed at one and a
half to two and a half percent

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.850
MEKP we recommend double cupping when possible to ensure

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.790
excess catalyst isn't stuck to the sides
of the cup after mixing

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.200
684 has a gel time of approximately 18
minutes

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.650
spray wait until lightly cured and begin
your layup

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.700
if you're using number 684 for repair

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.280
or for surface lamination you need to add
Duratec Clear Hi-Gloss Additive

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.170
in order to get an attractive and fully
cured surface sometimes

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.280
people use the Duratec Hi-Gloss
Additive in mold

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.960
you can also use a combination of
thinner and the gloss enhancer

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.570
whether in mold or out of mold Duratec
Clear Hi-Gloss Additive can be added

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.620
to number 684 neutral gel coat

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.070
for a higher quality finish if you
choose to pigment 684

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.759
pigment should be added prior to
catalyzation and mixed thoroughly

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.920
you shouldn't use 684 when temperatures
are below 60 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.200
also if the temperature is over 85 degrees

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.470
you should only mix in small quantities
as hardening will occur very rapidly

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.830
and once catalyzed do not put the
gel coat back in its original container

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.220
as it could cause the other gel coat to
harden and become unusable

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.810
