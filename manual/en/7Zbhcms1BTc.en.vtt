Hi, I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
Today, I'm going to teach you everything you

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.849
need to know about how to brew a black beer,
or a Schwarz beer. Today, we'll be talking

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.629
about everything you need to brew this style
which includes the ingredients, the equipment

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.370
and the different processes you are going
to need to take all of your basic ingredients

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.370
and convert them into tasty beer. I've been
a home brewer for about nine years. I've got

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.190
about one hundred and forty different batches
under my belt. I'm president of the Employee's

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.019
Beer and Wine Maker's Club. I've even had
some of my beers scaled up and produced commercially.

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.710
There are many different ways to brew beers.
Today we are going to be focusing on extract

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.309
with specialty grades. Our focus will be on
doing this as simply as possible with the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.899
least amount of equipment investment to start
up. We'll recommend the basic amount of equipment

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.440
you need and also some big equipment that
if you want to get a little more into it,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.649
you'll appreciate it later. To start off,
I'm going to give you an overview of what

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.739
you're going to be expecting during the whole
brewing process. To begin, you are going to

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.120
start on the brewing day. On this day you
are going to steep some specialty grains if

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.810
you have them and then you are going to add
some multi-extracting boil all of that, you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.140
are going to add in your hops, and then at
the end of that when you are done boiling,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.590
you are going to cool it down and add in your
yeast. And this usually takes between two

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.000
to three hours. After the yeast have been
added, your work is now beer and the yeast

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.760
will start fermenting away for about three
to seven days. And this is called your primary

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.560
fermentation. Once the yeast starts slowing
down, you're going to siphon out of your primary

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.710
vessel into a secondary vessel. This operation
is called racking and it takes roughly about

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.189
thirty minutes. Once you are in your secondary
vessel, you're going to let it sit and finish

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.920
its remaining fermentation that it has left.
And this will take usually seven to fourteen

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.869
days. At this point, most of your yeast will
have fallen out of solution and your beer

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.320
will be getting very, very clear. Finally,
you are going to be going into the bottling

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.280
phase where you are going to siphon one more
time into your bottling bucket and add some

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.103
priming sugar and then fill up your bottles
and cap them off. Then you are going to put

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:05.759
them into a nice, dark area and let them sit
for two or so weeks. At this point, the beer

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.580
will start carbonating itself, get that up
to a nice level and then you'll be able to

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.500
chill and drink your beer. While this video
will be enough to get you started home brewing,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.790
I'd like to recommend a couple of other resources
that you can use to develop your brewing skills.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.209
First, the American's Home Brewer's Association
puts out a "Beginner's Guide to Home Brewing"

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.260
which you can pick up at your local store
or request at their website at www.beertown.org.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.120
Next, we have a classic book called "The Joy
of Home Brewing" which is going to be everything

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.599
you really need to get started. For people
who want to get a little more advanced, you

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.040
can pick up "How to Brew" by John Palmer which
takes you through a little more of the science.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.129
And for some other good recipes out there,
for some beers that you may have already tried

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.290
one of, to reproduce there is "Clone Beers"
and "Beer Captured."
