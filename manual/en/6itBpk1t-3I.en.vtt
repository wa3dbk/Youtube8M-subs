The first step to a traffic stop, is to know when to have one.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.350
There are many reasons to have a traffic stop
But you must have a good reason to have one.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.950
Examples are reasons to pulling over a vehicle for,
Running a red light, speeding, reckless driving.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.000
Those are just a few examples.
But it is important to have a good reason.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.040
Once you got a reason, turn on your siren
And stop on the right side of the road.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.590
Then you want to call in a traffic stop.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.840
Next, over the radio, you want to give your unit number,
Say that your making a traffic stop, and give your location.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.650
Then you want to approach the vehicle, and ask for their names.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.080
Then you want to run a re-warrant check with your dispatch.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.200
Then you want to talk to the person you pulled over,
 And explain the situation, and why you pulled him over.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.650
You may do this before the license check, but it's up to you.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.560
Then you want to decide if you give to driver a ticket, or just a warning.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.450
Their license may be suspended for a certain amount of time,
But this all depends of the previous events.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.410
The dispatcher may decide if the license is suspended.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:28.770
If the situation becomes out of control call for backup.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.640
Now for some quick tips,
