00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.520
If the school has 6,525 students

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.400
and nine of fifteen students are female

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.700
how many females attend the school?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.960
We were told that nine of fifteen students are female.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.820
That's a ratio of female students to total students.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.020
Which can be written as a fraction.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.020
So nine fifteenth of the students

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.500
are females.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.360
So we want nine fifteenth

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.020
of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.360
the total students which is six thousand,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.000
five hundred twenty-five.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.960
And of means to multiply.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.680
To determine nine fifteenth of 6,525.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.120
We need to multiply nine fifteenth

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.100
and

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.819
6,525.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.060
So we'll write this as a fraction.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.780
The one thing I noticed right away is this
fraction here can actually be simplified.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.860
Which will make multiplying this a little bit easier.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.160
The prime factorization of nine is three times three.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.600
The prime factorization of fifteen is three times five.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.320
Notice how these three's will simplify out.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.900
Or three over three simplify to one.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.580
So we can rewrite this as three fifth

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.840
times

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.320
6,525

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.680
all over one.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.900
And I also notice that this large
number here end in a five.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.100
Which means is divisible by five.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.700
So let's rewrite this again.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.900
Three fifth

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
times.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.840
Now you can check me on this but 6,525

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.200
is equal to five times

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.320
1,305.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.000
So now we can see this factor of five
here and here simplify to one.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.000
So now we multiply we gonna have three times 1,305.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.699
Which is 3,915.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.500
All over one.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.820
Which tells us that we have

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.780
3,915

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.820
females.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.500
At this school.
