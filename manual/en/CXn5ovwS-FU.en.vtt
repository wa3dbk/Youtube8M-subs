00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.427
- Hi every body, it's Heather again

00:00:03.427 --> 00:00:06.453
and today I'm reviewing
another Forever Young wig.

00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:08.720
This one is an ultra long,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.504
which is why I'm sitting back so far.

00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:13.553
This one's called Cosabella.

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:16.582
And, it's in the color 4/27/30.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:20.875
The color is a blend
between a medium brown,

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.587
medium auburn and light auburn

00:00:22.587 --> 00:00:25.116
and I'll show you a
little bit more on that

00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:27.126
later on in this video.

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.062
So right off the bat you'll realize

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.877
that this wig is what I like to call,

00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:32.734
a boob hugger.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:33.578
It hangs out

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:35.239
right, right there.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.778
So if you're trying to draw
attention to that area,

00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:39.050
this one

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.484
is perfect.

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:42.592
She's got layers but the layers are very,

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:43.925
very, very long.

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:47.237
And they don't start until where most wigs

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:48.126
tend to end.

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:50.333
Which is right around

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.582
mid clavicle,

00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:52.415
mid chest.

00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:56.072
And then the layers just keep tumbling

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:58.827
down lower, lower, lower until you have it

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:02.167
going almost down to your belly button.

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:03.126
Mine,

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:04.656
this wig is about 4 inches

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:05.966
short of my belly button on me.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.966
So it's very, very long.

00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:11.228
It doesn't have a bang.

00:01:11.228 --> 00:01:13.865
It also doesn't have a lace front.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.874
Which is really my only
big qualm with this wig.

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:19.812
It'd be perfect if it had a lace front

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.562
but perfection aside,

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:24.774
it's still pretty darn convincing

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:27.926
because of how the cap is constructed

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.285
and how the

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:30.118
hair lays.

00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:36.843
I mean, you don't really
notice it that much.

00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:39.496
Plus if you're a real
stickler about lace fronts

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:40.944
you probably wouldn't be considering a

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:42.542
Forever Young wig anyhow.

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:44.506
'Cause I don't think,

00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:47.149
with the exception of just a couple,

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.414
any of them come with lace fronts.

00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:53.081
It has a very soft wave pattern.

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:56.255
Incredibly soft.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.441
Definitely not something I
would even consider a curl.

00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:03.800
It's just very, very soft.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.070
Very feminine.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.209
And you get a lot of hair with this wig.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.659
You just get a lot of hair.

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.617
This is the most popular
color that this wig comes in.

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:17.036
It's also the one that's
in the manufacturer photo.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.953
It's very, very pretty.

00:02:20.728 --> 00:02:23.919
This is a really, really nice wig.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.281
Especially for the price.

00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:28.651
I mean, I think this
one retails for $42.95.

00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:31.806
So, I mean, if you're in
the mood of a longer wig.

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:34.200
Maybe for everyday use for a month

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.422
or not for everyday use

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:37.265
and you want to keep it for a few years,

00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:39.077
this would be a great option

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:40.841
'cause it just,

00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:41.674
man alive,

00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:44.339
this hair at the bottom
is just really luxurious.

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:45.980
It's very, very pretty.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.761
Personally I don't know if
I would wear this everyday.

00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:51.222
Because I know that the hair fibers

00:02:51.222 --> 00:02:53.963
on synthetic wigs,
especially these longer ones,

00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:57.021
will get tangled pretty easily.

00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:59.316
But man, for a night out,

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:00.863
or for a formal event or something,

00:03:00.863 --> 00:03:03.414
this is, this is a really nice

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:05.031
head of hair.

00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:08.434
Now I'm gonna show you
the sides and the back.

00:03:08.434 --> 00:03:09.700
And please forgive me in advance

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.044
if I can't get all the
hair in a single shot.

00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:14.279
It's a lot of hair.

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:16.059
So this is what the wig looks like

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:17.145
from the side.

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:19.078
If the hair is pushed forward.

00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:21.078
If I push the hair back,

00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:24.548
that's what it looks like.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.189
And I'll show you the other side.

00:03:29.107 --> 00:03:30.024
Same thing.

00:03:31.064 --> 00:03:32.314
Pushed forward.

00:03:34.793 --> 00:03:35.793
Pushed back.

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.552
Now I'll adjust the camera
and show you the back.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.512
Am I getting all this hair in there?

00:03:48.512 --> 00:03:49.345
Yes.

00:03:50.358 --> 00:03:51.941
It's a lot of hair.

00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:55.126
Where does it come down?

00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:56.043
Oh my gosh!

00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:57.964
Wow, that's,

00:03:57.964 --> 00:04:00.381
that's definitely lower back.

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:04.517
Darn near where,

00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:06.744
I'm 5'8" and that's darn near where my

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:07.911
rumpus begins.

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:23.523
So what else can I tell
you about this hair?

00:04:23.523 --> 00:04:25.864
It's Kanekalon fibers.

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:28.947
Which are fairly resistant to damage.

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:31.507
But just like any synthetic wig

00:04:31.507 --> 00:04:33.822
you'll wanna make sure that you

00:04:33.822 --> 00:04:35.191
take some extra precautions

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.622
when you're taking care of it.

00:04:36.622 --> 00:04:38.904
Make sure you don't use a regular brush.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:41.543
Only use a wig safe brush.

00:04:41.543 --> 00:04:44.093
Which they're pretty easy
to tell the difference.

00:04:44.093 --> 00:04:46.261
A good wig brush will have

00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:48.628
looped bristles so that way

00:04:48.628 --> 00:04:51.174
it doesn't snag the hair.

00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:52.434
Some of them don't have looped bristles

00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:54.043
but they have like a coating on the ends

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:55.966
that will prevent that hair from

00:04:55.966 --> 00:04:57.277
getting caught.

00:04:57.277 --> 00:04:59.050
'Cause the last thing you want to do

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.484
is if you hit a tangle,

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:05.364
you don't wanna pull the tangle loose.

00:05:05.364 --> 00:05:07.842
Because unlike human hair,

00:05:07.842 --> 00:05:09.605
this stuff will stretch,

00:05:09.605 --> 00:05:11.017
and when it stretches,

00:05:11.017 --> 00:05:12.100
it loses it's

00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:16.852
it's normal consistency.

00:05:16.852 --> 00:05:19.776
It just gets kinda mangled looking.

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:21.140
And you wanna make sure that you return

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.790
some moisture to the fibers.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.707
Especially at the ends.

00:05:25.856 --> 00:05:27.657
I would recommend like I have

00:05:27.657 --> 00:05:30.047
in my other Forever Young videos,

00:05:30.047 --> 00:05:32.640
some kind of spray moisturizer

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.247
because what that'll do is,

00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:35.531
especially if it's leave in conditioner

00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:37.606
for synthetic wigs,

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:39.718
is that it will add some moisture back

00:05:39.718 --> 00:05:41.545
into the bottoms.

00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:43.897
So that way it will slow down

00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:45.407
the deterioration of the fibers

00:05:45.407 --> 00:05:47.020
because all synthetic wigs

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.996
have a shelf life.

00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:49.232
And after a while,

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:51.138
they'll start to fray at the ends

00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:53.167
and one good thing is with the longer wigs

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:55.064
is you can just trim

00:05:55.064 --> 00:05:57.199
the hairs when they
start to get messed up.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.464
But we wanna prolong the
life of the wig as is

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.824
as long as possible
before having to resort

00:06:02.824 --> 00:06:04.171
to you know,

00:06:04.171 --> 00:06:06.529
doing that sort of thing.

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:07.951
So now I'm gonna take this wig off

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:11.201
so you can see what the cap looks like.

00:06:13.793 --> 00:06:15.073
Like the other Forever Young wigs

00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:16.625
that I've reviewed thus far,

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.867
it has a skin cap.

00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:20.284
Like a skin part.

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:24.000
This one gives you a
slightly more substantial

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.710
skin part than some of the other ones

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.278
so you can actually tell pretty well

00:06:27.278 --> 00:06:28.549
even if the color's not particularly dark,

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:30.775
this isn't a particularly dark color

00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:32.835
it's a light brown

00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:33.752
base shade.

00:06:35.434 --> 00:06:36.851
I mean, it looks like it's,

00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:39.018
technically it says it's a

00:06:40.257 --> 00:06:41.632
a medium brown but in real life

00:06:41.632 --> 00:06:43.727
it looks like a light brown.

00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:45.759
Open wafted sides and back.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.890
Traditional rows lace, nothing fancy.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.571
And then the soft felt

00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:52.093
around the hair line.

00:06:52.093 --> 00:06:54.156
Now I'm gonna show you the
color a little bit up close.

00:06:54.156 --> 00:06:55.906
It is a blended tone.

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.056
So you're not gonna see any obvious

00:07:01.343 --> 00:07:03.260
drastic color variants.

00:07:04.232 --> 00:07:07.342
It should be pretty evenly blended

00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:10.041
with those lighter auburn, medium auburn,

00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:12.124
and light chestnut shades

00:07:12.997 --> 00:07:14.580
blended throughout.

00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:18.201
I like the fact this
one doesn't have a bang.

00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:21.701
I'm not a, personally, a big fan of bangs.

00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:27.490
But if you are, Forever Young has plenty

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.073
of styles that do come
with a pre-cut bang.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.333
You might wanna consider maybe Edge Savvy

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:38.677
or Cowgirl Hot.

00:07:38.677 --> 00:07:39.844
They both have

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:42.617
pre-cut bangs.

00:07:42.617 --> 00:07:44.567
And they're both really long too.

00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:48.311
And I believe they come in this color.

00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:50.287
And I just grab those ear tabs,

00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:52.660
move them where I wanted them.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.827
Just gonna run my fingers
through her a little bit.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.691
And there ya go.

00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:05.723
This is Cosabella by Forever Young.

00:08:05.723 --> 00:08:07.305
Thanks for watching.
