00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Hi everybody this is Marjory Wildcraft
with Grow Your Own Groceries and today I'm

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.799
so excited.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.799
I'm in Phoenix, Arizona with Alex who is
the owner of Tropical Mango Exotic and Rare

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.460
Fruit tree nursery and what I'm so excited
about is what we have here are young baby

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.100
chocolate trees.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.600
Now the Latin name for the chocolate tree
is Theobroma cacao.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.520
We'll just call them cacao trees.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.180
What I'm so excited about is the possibility
of growing these in our backyards in greenhouses

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.930
and I'm going to talk today to Alex about
what does that look like and how do you take

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.750
care of them and how much chocolate are you
going to actually get from that.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.590
Alex, these are one year old seedlings, is
that right?

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.770
&gt;&gt; Alex: Right, I start them in March so they're
just under a year.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.870
We start them directly from seeds from homegrown
ones right here in Arizona.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.739
&gt;&gt; Marjory: About how old does it take before
it starts fruiting?

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.500
&gt;&gt; Alex: Typically the plant usually reaches
five or six feet in about three years and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.420
that's about the time that it starts.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.979
The tall-tell sign is when it starts growing
from a straight and branches at the top at

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.350
that point it reaches maturity and then you
start pruning off the lower leaves and the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.130
branches and fruits.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.619
&gt;&gt; Marjory: How much space would I need in
my backyard greenhouse would I need-how much

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.200
floor space and then how much height would
I want to get?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.909
&gt;&gt; Alex: At the bottom you're just basically
looking for two or three feet.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.619
There's no leaves on the center-the pods
are all growing on the trunk and the foliage

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.950
is all up on top so as long as you're able
to move in around that's about it.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.810
&gt;&gt; Marjory: So like three or four feet in
diameter would be plenty?

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.530
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yeah, you could probably get two
plants in that.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.100
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Really? Then how tall can they
go?

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.880
&gt;&gt; Alex: Again, it's about five or six feet
is the ...

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.319
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Minimum?

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.770
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yes.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.909
Then beyond that it's up to you whether you
want to go that high and you have a big enough

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.439
pot that can handle the root structure and the nutrients that are required to produce the pod

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.880
&gt;&gt; Marjory: What kind of soil are they going
to like-is there any special things with this

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.759
or just a good rich fertile soil?

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.859
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yes, but in the sense considering
they're an acid loving plant so you're looking

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.500
for something in the low sixes as far as ph.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.549
They do very well with some kind of azalea
mix or treating them like orchids.

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.319
They grow in a real loose, very highly rich
organic composted soil.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.200
&gt;&gt; Marjory: You're going to need a lot of
good fertility with these guys?

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.090
Generally they just want to stay nice and
moist?

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.540
They're not real drought tolerate.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.120
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yes.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.610
They like the water to run off, they're used
to a lot of rain, but not puddleing and kind

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.860
of 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.579
swamp type conditions. Similar to like rain forest-you know the water
usually goes off into the rivers

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.829
but everything's wet all the time.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.829
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Am I going to need two?

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.189
Like some things-are they self-pollinating?

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.969
Most fruit trees do do better with more than
one.

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:47.840
Are they self-pollinating?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.010
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yes, they are.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.170
If you're going to grow them indoors and
you're lacking insects or any kind of pollinator

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.360
you'll have to help that process out.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.049
&gt;&gt; Marjory: With the q-tips and the doing
the flowers.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.879
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yes, the flowers are the perfect
so all you need to do is move the pollen around.

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.819
&gt;&gt; Marjory: To get it to self-pollinate-you
can pollinate it for it?

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.540
&gt;&gt; Alex: Correct.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.019
They flower throughout the year so it's a
continual process.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.010
&gt;&gt; Marjory: You're constantly getting fruit
and flowers.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.069
For most people that don't know the fruit
is actually not the chocolate part.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.730
The fruit itself is delicious I've had a
chance to try it but it's the seeds of the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.150
fruit that you process to make chocolate.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.310
Do you have any idea of how many pounds of
seeds we could get out of one tree as a typical

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.700
yield?

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.340
&gt;&gt; Alex: Out of one tree actually it will
be less than a pound.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.340
It's going to take-you'll get anywhere from
30 to 60 seeds per pod and it'll take somewhere

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:47.459
around 500 or so to make a pound of chocolate.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.599
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Wow so it is possible but you
have to really be-you have to love it the

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.079
way I do in order to grow it to get a lot
of chocolate.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.879
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yeah two or three trees would probably
in order to get one or two pounds consistently

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.639
because it'll take about ten pods in order
for you to have enough seeds to work with.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.829
&gt;&gt; Marjory: These are a tropical plant so
they're not going to be able to handle a

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:07.659
freeze at all.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.150
Do you know what is the lowest temperature
that they're going to be able to withstand

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.469
and still be able to fruit?

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.760
&gt;&gt; Alex: Ideally it could take probably down
into 40s and live.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.400
If you're encouraging fruit you're going
to have to maintain at least 60 degrees at

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.560
a minimum and very little of that if possible.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.810
&gt;&gt; Marjory: You're going to have to keep
a nice warm environment for them?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.200
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yes it will have to be a temperature
controlled greenhouse it won't be able to

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.190
wait until morning for sun.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.850
&gt;&gt; Marjory: One of the whole things that got
me so inspired about this was I was in Washington,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.730
DC at the National Botanical Gardens and they
have this gigantic greenhouse and right when

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.570
you walk in there's a 25 foot fruiting cacao
tree there and I don't believe they were

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.130
using grow-lights so it looks like you'll
have enough sunlight for them to fruit at

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.640
the latitude of Washington, DC which is about
Kansas City and Sacramento across the United

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.450
States.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.270
Do you know how much further North that would
go or is that just something we're going

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.170
to have to experiment with?

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.790
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yes-if you look at how they grow
in nature they're an understory plant where

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.760
they're grown commercially for the chocolate.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.880
They're usually shaded with other type trees
so they don't get the full brunt of the topical

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.160
sun.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.250
Diffuse light is fine.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.650
&gt;&gt; Marjory: They may do well in even further
northern climates.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.470
&gt;&gt; Alex: Possibly.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.290
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Possibly.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.480
We'll all have to experiment.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.590
If you know anybody growing one in a northern
climate greenhouse by all means get in touch

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.970
with me and let me know.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.710
&gt;&gt; Alex: I do have sold some as far to Alaska
but I have never been in touch with the owners

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.700
to know how it's done.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.710
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Wow. That's pretty amazing.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.030
Well thank you so much for your time Alex
we really appreciate it and as we get this

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.540
growing we'll stay back in touch with you
and let you know how it goes.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.620
If you want to try this experiment in your
greenhouse in your backyard Alex has a website

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.760
and is available to ship these trees apparently
even to Alaska.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.050
Do you want to give them your website?

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.050
&gt;&gt; Alex: Yes, the website name is tropicamango.com.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:12.050
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Thank you again Alex, this is
Marjory Wildcraft with Backyard Food Production

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.410
and Grow Your Own Groceries and we'll see
you on another segment.
