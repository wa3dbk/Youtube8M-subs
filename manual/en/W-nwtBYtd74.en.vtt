00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:10.809
Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we'll
use our large spoon and scoop out the seeds.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:20.640
We don't want that. Any garbage we don't want.
Scoop that out like that and set that aside.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.111
For the swan we want to be very careful. The
neck is now pretty delicate so we don't want

00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:32.930
to make it too thin, but we do want to get
some of this seed section. We're going to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:42.300
just take the knife and very carefully trim
out the seed section without making it too

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:51.620
weak. There you have it. Then we'll turn it
around. I didn't get all of it. Just very

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.820
carefully because you don't want to work that
too thin because it loses strength and then

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.890
it'll get with while it's on display. Next,
we want to scoop out anything else we have

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.920
in there. Any of the seeds. You want to be
careful not to ruin your design. You can at

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:23.710
this point with the knife trim the inside
of the rear feathers. That'll help you in

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.780
your scooping. Like I said, you want to make
sure you don't take too much of the flesh

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:49.240
off because you need the strength. Just scoop
out and discard the seeds and the pulp that's

00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:03.700
in there. Then you take your other fruits
sections. You should probably have a cutting

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:16.130
board to do this. You can cut these up into
small chunks left over flesh, or you can just

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:27.500
the melon baller. I'll just put it on my plastic
here. You take the melon baller and get as

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:39.780
many balls out of that as you can. Then we'll
reuse that. We'll fill it in the swan in the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:48.480
end. Melon balls are nice. You want to get
them as close as you can and use up every

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.030
bit. Even these little sections here you can
get a ball out of.
