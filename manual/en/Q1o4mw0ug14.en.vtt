00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.660
Okay I think you’re recording.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.819
I've got my lifter kite up there in the sky

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.650
on the remote control.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.720
It's all a bit back to front from where I thought it was going to be.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.010
When I go that way, the kite goes the other way.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:40.720
A really big wide steer there.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:01:18.530
Centre The control and it's back in your view hopefully.
Quite an extreme response actually, which is a absolutely brilliant.  I’ll try and land a little later. Just to demonstrate again, I'll pull the other way. And that's the rig up, it's centred, that's fantastic.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.050
I'm very happy with that. It moves when I change the controller. We've got solid lifter kite ready to go.
