00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:02.827
It, uh...
Hmm.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.246
Oh, beautifully done! I can't
tell you how grateful I am to y'all.

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.251
&lt;i&gt;Now, for one last favor.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.254
&lt;i&gt;If the three ladies with collars&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;would kindly walk out of the ring,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:20.017
&lt;i&gt;I'd be very much obliged.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:10.677 --> 00:01:14.636
[Cheering]

00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:11.035
&lt;i&gt;[Narrator] And so it was that&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in all the celebration,&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:14.076
&lt;i&gt;in all the hubbub&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of noise and excitement,&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:17.238
&lt;i&gt;there were two figures&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;who stood silent and still...&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:20.408
&lt;i&gt;side by side.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:21.973
[Crowing]

00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:25.215
[Ferdinand Laughing]
The pig did it! The perfect score!

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:30.351
Yippee! Yippee!

00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:34.626
&lt;i&gt;[Narrator] And though&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;every single human in the stands&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;or in the commentary boxes...&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.260
&lt;i&gt;was at a complete loss for words,&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:41.897
&lt;i&gt;the man, who in his life had uttered&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;fewer words than any of them...&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:46.808
&lt;i&gt;knew exactly what to say.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:49.903
That'll do, Pig.

00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:54.275
That'll do.

00:02:56.555 --> 00:02:59.547
