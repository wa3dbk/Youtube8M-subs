00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Hi Alex here. How can we help people understand how important sustainability

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:02.915
is

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:06.435
in a good in useful way? Well one of the
things

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:11.095
I use is a funnel metaphor to illustrate
the fact that there is no better time

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:12.204
than now

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:15.235
to act on sustainability. So let's get
drawing!

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:18.695
In the previous video about our
ecological footprint

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:22.215
we found out that the Earth's capacity
to provide what we need

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:26.025
is declining. There are fewer forests and
fish today

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:30.304
that there were a hundred years ago and
this affects the ability of the planet

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:34.955
to supply what we call 'ecosystem
services' things that are necessary to

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:35.775
support life

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:39.455
and on which we rely like climate
regulation,

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:42.944
water filtration, soil generation and
so on.

00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:47.755
At the same time the race at which we
consume resources

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:51.575
and generate waste is going up

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:55.165
but that's not all this is not only
about offer and demand

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:58.775
growing consumer awareness makes
consumer

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:01.885
expect new behavior from corporations and
governments

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:05.175
governments are changing laws

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:09.285
there are getting stricter, trust between
people is declining

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:13.585
prices are going up, abuse of power

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:17.605
leads to growing inequality around the
world resulting in more social tension

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:21.544
the world's population is growing et
cetera

00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:26.085
et cetera all in all there's more and
more pressure

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:29.504
on individuals, communities and
businesses

00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:33.735
It looks like all these trends are
converging right?!

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:37.004
and we don't want to see what happens if

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:41.964
or when they meet. It is as if we were going
forward in the funnel

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:46.364
the pressure is increasing over time and
we have less and less margin to maneuver

00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:49.855
so everybody has their own pet issue

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:53.794
maybe it's an environmental one save the
forests,

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:58.345
save the whales, stop climate change or
maybe

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:02.644
the issue in the social one: deal with
the gap between rich and poor

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:06.214
get children off the streets, changing
public policy,

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:09.735
create more jobs et cetera. The fact is

00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:14.175
all these issues are related to the key
issue of sustainability

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.235
our capacity to survive and thrive as a
race

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:21.414
and they all impact our ability to live,
work and play on planet Earth

00:02:21.414 --> 00:02:25.245
There isn't one business or person I
know

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:29.265
doesn't feel these pressures one way or
another that's why the funnel metaphor

00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:33.625
is helpful in explaining why we should
act around sustainability

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:39.865
we need to relieve the pressure. There
are hundreds of examples of countries

00:02:39.865 --> 00:02:44.134
and businesses hitting the wall to the
funnel, some recovered

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:48.365
like Nike after core labour
practices in sweatshops were exposed by

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:49.194
Greenpeace

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:53.975
some did not like the Easter Island
civilization

00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:58.685
that collapsed after destroying their
own environment, some are still trying to

00:02:58.685 --> 00:02:59.345
recover

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.705
such as Greece or the city of Detroit

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:06.825
who are facing bankruptcy. The funnel metaphor

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:10.625
also suggests something else: there is no
better time to

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.024
act then now. Waiting only limits

00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:17.145
our options even more. So

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:21.175
when someone asks "how do I help people
understand how important sustainability

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:24.825
is in a good and useful way?" consider

00:03:24.825 --> 00:03:29.145
the funnel metaphor. What we we need to do
is stop the convergence

00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:32.895
all those pressures and find a way
through then ideally

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:37.194
begin to 'open the funnel' and to create a
resilient,

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:42.865
fulfilling society that can
thrive within nature's limits. As

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:44.355
usual here are the key points:

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:48.515
pressure on society, individuals,
businesses and communities

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:52.164
increases over time; there is no better
time to act

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:55.535
that now, the more we wait the less
margin to maneuver;

00:03:55.535 --> 00:04:00.274
and the funnel metaphor can be useful to
help people understand how important

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:01.825
sustainability is

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:06.895
and that we need to find a way through
and ideally 'open the funnel'

00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:10.865
So I will bring more videos about how to
make sustainability relevant for your

00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:11.535
audience

00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:13.715
so stay tuned and thank you for watching
