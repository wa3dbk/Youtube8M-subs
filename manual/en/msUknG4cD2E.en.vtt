00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:22.480
Generally, if a game has "Crazy" in the title,
you can be assured of two things: It's going

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.170
to be a bit on the cheap side, and it's going
to feature high-pitched sound effects, usually

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.190
of a cloyingly cute nature.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.269
(Though both of these seem to be nullified
if the second word of the title happens to

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.359
be "Taxi.")

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:38.649
But since it's Thursday, and this game has
Hamster in the title, I'm prepared to brave

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.500
the depths of the DSi shop and bring you Crazy
Hamster, which wholeheartedly subscribes to

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.340
both of the provisions listed earlier.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.969
Just for you, this Hamster Thursday, for being
such loyal friends and true.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.420
You're welcome.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.179
Awright, so apparently Gamelion have felt
it necessary to give this particularly unwell

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.469
Hamster some backstory.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.800
Being an admittedly Crazy Hamster and lacking
adequate supervision, he's got no stores of

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.560
food for the cold winter months.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.110
This, fair viewer, is why we take in hamsters
and wade through page after page after volume

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.400
after ream of Japanese text; to prevent exactly
this situation.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.520
So, since it's too late to just give him some
nourishment from the TJ's DS Municipal Food

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.460
Pantry, he's off on a valiant quest to obtain
food himself.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.730
Unfortunately, since he suffers from an undescribed
but apparently serious medical condition,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.180
he's powerless to not run headlong off of
cliffs or into blockades, walls, spiked barriers,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.390
fires, ravines, what have you.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.390
(Man.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.100
Someone should do something about these roads,
come to think of it.)

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.530
As the omnipotent being tasked with this Hamster's
well-being, your goal is to get him safely

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.730
from Point A to Point B, while collecting
all the fruit in each stage.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.530
And then he eats all of that, only to roll
on to the next stage, unstated and none the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.190
better for wear.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.660
Despite your omnipotence, though, the Crazy
Hamster Bureau of Arbitrary Things has determined

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.649
that you are limited to certain devices to
help guide Crazy Hamster through this terrain.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.099
You're equipped with chunks of bridge that
you can use to seal off small gaps, fire extinguishers

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.620
to deal with the wake of whatever serial arsonist
is apparently just offscreen, and boats to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.129
cross the small puddles that form in Crazy
Hamster's temperate spring.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.180
You've got ladders for climbing up short distances,
trampolines for clearing height variances

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.189
and bouncing over certain obstacles, and hairdryers
which can be used in tandem with the trampolines

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.279
to send this hamster flying in a blatant disregard
of physics.

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:44.040
There are skis for traversing appropriately
fun-looking slopes, ice skates for crossing

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.650
frozen patches, parachutes for safely falling
from a great height, and Radiohead lyrics

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.920
for embellishing the words "From a great height"
in the style of Thom Yorke.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.180
Unfortunately, despite these combinations
of tools holding the potential for a trampoline-and-parachute-powered

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.900
Hamster Slingshot, you're restricted to using
these tools in exactly the manner for which

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.769
they're recommended, with no real innovation
to be had.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.650
And while having "expected locations" for
each object is kinda... well, easy, for lack

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.810
of a better word... getting the game to recognize
that particular stylus poke can be a bit frustrating.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.430
Especially if what you're trying to poke at
happens to be immediately near your toolbox.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.889
S0 remember, friends: Adopt a digital hamster
today, else they'll be forced to wander the

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.489
countryside in search of food.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.060
And companionship.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.639
And blowdryers.
