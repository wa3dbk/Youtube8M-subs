00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:09.260
Alright, so this is the club, very straight
forward. In this clip we're going to be drawing

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.910
a cousin of the club but ones a little bit
more dangerous and deadly, I would say, it

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.971
takes a little bit more skill to use, it's
called the flail. I'm not sure what it is,

00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:24.109
you're going to find out. We're going to come
down here and draw it right here in this corner.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:31.429
The flail, in name, actually makes quite a
bit of sense, once you see the final product.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:38.430
It might be a little bit confusing at first
but believe me, once you see what it is we're

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.809
drawing here, you'll understand completely.
First you're going to draw a little staff

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.460
with a little bit of a loop at the end. Maybe
give it a nice leather strap thing winding

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.910
down and a little handle at the bottom, something
to hang on to. Then what we're going to do

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:09.310
is we're going to come out here and we're
going to draw some chain link. I think you

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:20.350
might be starting to see where this is going.
Incidentally, just on a side note, when you're

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.360
drawing chain link, try not to draw too much
detail to the inner portion of the chain link.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:33.329
Draw the lines thick on the outside then on
the inside. Now the fun part. It's a little

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:45.680
ball, not just a little ball, this ball comes
equipped with a variety of charming spikes

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:56.350
guaranteed to inflict a great deal of pain,
if it happens to hit you anywhere. That, my

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:06.700
friends, is called the flail. I'm sure you've
seen it many times, in many different situations

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.010
but these things are not to be fooled around
with, they are incredibly sharp and can do

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.129
a lot of damage if they hit you in the right
spot. So, there you go, that is the flail.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.819
Now we'll move onto some more weapons.
