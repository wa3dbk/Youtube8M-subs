00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:05.890
Hi, I'm James with JNC Home Repair, today
I'm going to show you how to repair a drawer

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.640
that has a problem opening or you could say
a problem sticking or something. It's a common

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.560
problem in the kitchen and it's usually a
real simple problem to fix. The basic idea

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.430
behind a drawer is usually it has a wheel
that's mounted on the back of it, it may be

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.150
mounted on the side, some of them have tracks
on either side. I believe the problem we have

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.460
today there's actually a little wheel that's
mounted on the back of it and it fits in a

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.050
track and that little bracket that the wheel's
attached to, needs to be fastened securely

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.950
so it won't be wobbling around. If it's wobbling
around and it's not staying where it's supposed

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.960
to be, then the wheel, that's going back and
forth in the track, when you try to open and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.920
close it, it's not going to work right, it's
going to get in bind or it's going to get

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.230
caught up and you're going to be yanking on
it. The more this keeps going on, the more

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.530
you keep fighting with it, the more struggling
with it, it's just going to cause more damage.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.140
You're going to either damage the track or
something else later so it's better off just

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.590
to go ahead pull your drawer out, take a look
at the bracket, take a look at the wheel,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.170
make sure that that's functioning properly.
If that's not the problem, then you need to

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.720
move further to the actual drawer slide or
the track. We're going to go ahead and pull

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.950
the drawer out and we're going to take a look.
First thing you want to do is you want to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.340
go ahead and remove the drawer. See, it's
already kind of in a bind now, it doesn't

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.460
want to come out. This particular model, right
here, you just go ahead and pull the drawer

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.240
out and you just lift it and the drawer comes
out. Go ahead and empty your contents out

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.240
of your drawer, we'll go ahead and take a
look at the back of the drawer and sure enough,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.049
this thing's loose. It's a very common problem,
all you're going to need is a Philip's head

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.890
screwdriver on this one, some of them may
be a flathead screw but this one, in particular,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.430
it a Philip's head screw and all you need
to do is just tighten these screws down, get

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.380
this thing secure, and that'll allow this
to stay still and the wheel will be able to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.450
operate freely on the track, back and forth.
So, we're going to go ahead and take a Philip's

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.540
head screwdriver and we're going to go ahead
and tighten these down, back in place. If

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.341
you'll notice, on the bracket itself, there's
some little tabs and you want those tabs just

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:27.249
right on the bottom face of the back of the
drawer. That's going to help keep it in line,

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.459
that's going to help keep it straight and
leveled because if it's cockeyed or turned

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.810
one way or the other, then the wheel is not
going to be perfectly straight and it's not

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.010
going to operate freely in the track. So,
you just make sure that those tabs are flushed

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:51.219
down, tighten down your screws, like so. And
this happens all the time, just a lot of wear

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.709
and tear, a lot of opening and closing and
then time, pulling on it, it actually just

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.260
works the screws free, works them lose and
you just need to go back in and just tighten

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.620
them up every now and then. It wouldn't even
hurt to just go through your whole kitchen

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.349
and do this. Once you've got them tight, that
bracket is secure, wheels functioning properly,

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:21.669
you go ahead, take your wheel, drop it back
down in your track, slide it in, and voila,

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:22.279
no sticking.
