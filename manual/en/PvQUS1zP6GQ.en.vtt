Hey, everyone! This is Rodrigo Silveira with http://www.easylearntutorial.com

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.580
And in his video i just wanted to quickly introduce you to the new series that

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.099
i'm working on;

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.839
a series of tutorials. And in a series of
I'll be showing you how to do 2D Game

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.200
Development.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.400
We'll be using Java,

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.239
but the goal is to be able to use the same
code base

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.449
to deploy games to

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.320
a browser like this

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.470
using HTML5,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.220
but developing in Java using Google Web
Toolkit.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.360
But also, using the same code base, and
with the same framework that we'll be

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.630
developing in the tutorials,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.890
we'll also be able to deploy the games to
Android, and also to regular Java.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.280
...which you can also deploy to a
browser using applets. So this is just a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.380
quick demo that I was just playing around

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.910
with the GWT version. I was working on

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.580
part of the 2D Renderer, and I was 
playing around with it.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.140
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.890
So hopefully this video, this little
demo

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
will piqued your interest and you will be
coming back for more.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.380
So if that's the case, i'll see you in
the tutorials to come.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.520
Just real quick, also,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.440
just to let you know, the goal of the
tutorials, or the target audience

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.700
rather,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.670
is everyone. I'll be taking the lessons slowly and progressively.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.430
So it you're a novice programmer, if you don't
even know Java that much,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.329
the serious should still be pretty
helpful. If you're more experienced, you

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.470
should also be able to learn

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.950
a thing or two about about Game Development.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.570
So post any questions or comments in the
section below, and hopefully you are

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.250
excited about this, and you'll be checking back in soon.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.310
Be sure to subscribe to my channel also,  and I'll talk to you soon. Thanks!
