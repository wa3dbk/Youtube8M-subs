Space Place... in a Snap!

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.340
GPS and the Quest for Pizza

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.740
It’s Friday night and you want some pizza.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.740
Fast.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.290
But somebody is going to have to pick that
pizza up, and that means they need to know

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.360
how to get to the closest pizzeria.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.730
In this modern world that is no problem!

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.680
Just plug ‘pizza’ into a smartphone and
it tells you exactly how to get there.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.840
But how exactly does the phone know where
you are?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.270
Something called a Global Positioning System,
or GPS, tells you, that’s how.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.270
When your phone tells you where you are, it
may actually be listening to signals from

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.410
satellites high up in space.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.630
There are over 30 satellites used for GPS,
orbiting over 16,000 miles above

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640
the Earth!

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.780
Your phone just needs to figure out how far
away you are from some of them.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.470
If your phone knows how far away it is from
four satellites, then there is only one place

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.800
on Earth you can be!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.860
Your phone, or any device with a GPS, is programmed
to know where all the satellites are at any

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590
given time.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.340
The phone uses that information—along with
the amount of time the signal took to reach

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.150
it—to figure out how far away the satellites
are.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.590
By doing that, it computes its location.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.140
So when you search for the nearest pizza place
in your smartphone, this is what your phone

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.140
is thinking:

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.500
“What satellites are talking to me right
now?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.660
Hey there, satellites!

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.450
I know you guys!

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.370
And I know where you are in the sky right
now, too!

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.610
Let me listen to your signal to figure out
how far away I am from each of you…

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.610
Oh!

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.930
I must be right here!

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.450
There’s no other place that is the right
distance away from each of you!

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.730
OK, let me check the internet to see what
pizza places are near me…”

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.140
And all that happens in an instant.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.950
Good thing, too.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.430
You’re only getting hungrier.
