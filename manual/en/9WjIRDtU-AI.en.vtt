00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.480
This small ferry sways back and forth

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.040
Near the shore are red spider lilies

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.140
Into the sparkling surface of the water

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.340
I feel drawn,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.720
By the beautiful afterlife

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.860
This small ferry moves along its way

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.460
And in its sleep inducing sway

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.760
I drift, the rudder going wherever it will

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.800
The other shore still yet ahead

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.120
This small ferry descends along in its sway

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.700
The other shore still far

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.880
On and on this journey will go

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.100
I hum a song and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.540
The river sings along

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.480
This small ferry moves along its way

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.080
Across gentle waves

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.380
I'm drifting, my eyes grow heavy

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.560
I want to take a nap

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.680
I'll be scolded,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.480
But I'm so sleepy....
