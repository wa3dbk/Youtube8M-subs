00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.160
[Woman?:] My baby!

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.630
*hoohoof*

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.910
[Director:] Cut!

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.890
*clap clap*

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.190
Bravo.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.640
Amazing!

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.800
Pure brilliance.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.940
I was on the edge of my seat 
the whole time.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.770
Please meet me in my office.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.420
[CM:] Sure okay.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.990
[Director:] Very impressive work today.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.150
[CM:] Oh. Thanks.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.320
No, really.
I mean it.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.610
[CM:] Why are you being so nice?

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.560
[Director:] Can't a director politely talk to his 
most talented actors without an ulterior motive?

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.400
... I need you to take Bernice on a date.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.550
[CM:] Who's Bernice?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.930
[Director:] My sister.
She won't stop nagging me lately.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.110
God help me. 
Y'know if she wasn't my sister

00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:10.630
I swear to god
I'd punch her in her dumb face.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.320
[CM:] Is that her, in the picture?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.240
[Director:] ... Yes.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.160
[CM:] I don't want to.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.850
Are you saying you think she is ugly?

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710
[CM:] No, she is  very pretty.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.330
I'm  just  busy that night.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.690
[Director:] I never said a night.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.870
[CM:] I don't want to.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.670
[Director:] I will fire you if you don't.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.730
[CM:] You can't do that.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.920
[Director:] Just take her on a date.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.590
[CM:] No.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.130
[Director:] Please just take her on a date.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.020
[CM:] I'll do it if you double my salary.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.649
[Director:] Oh, come on.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.740
I doubt even Tomato Man 
gets paid that much.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.570
[CM:] Don't even mention that dirty slut!

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.680
[Director:] Whoa.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.580
[CM:] Sorry. I don't know what came over me.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.760
[Director:] Dirty slut?

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.520
Really?

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.050
Just take Bernice on a date.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.960
[CM:] No.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.260
[Director:] I'll pay for the food.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.050
[Bernice:] Oh boy. I am so hungry.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.690
[CM:] Mmhm.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.570
[Bernice:] I've never been here before.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.000
Do you think they serve celery?

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.420
*Hee hee hee.*

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.810
You know,

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.130
because you're a celery man?

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.740
*Oheehee hee hee hee*

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.940
[CM:] Oh god.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.520
Excuse me for a moment.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.080
(flushing)

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.920
[TM:] Baby, by the time the night is over,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.870
you'll be seeing red.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.970
*kiss kiss*

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.910
[Bernice:] Oh.
(giggles)

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.180
*grr*

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.230
[Gentleman:] I say. This salad 
could use some more tomato.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.850
Well I never.
