00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.133
President Obama:
Well, it is a great pleasure to
welcome back Taoiseach Kenny to

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:09.900
the Oval Office, to the White
House and his entire delegation.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.533
Obviously, we cherish this
opportunity once a year to

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.166
reaffirm the incredible bond
between the United States

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.433
and Ireland.

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.400
This year, it also gives
us an excuse to stretch out

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.066
St. Patrick's Day for
a couple of extra days,

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:29.400
which is always good.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.400
This is now my fifth time to
welcome the Taoiseach to the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.567
Oval Office.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:36.734
I've had the occasion to
visit Ireland as well --

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:42.200
one of the truly wonderful trips
that I've taken as President of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800
the United States.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.500
And the reason that these
meetings go so well is because

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
of the incredible bond
and history between our

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.600
two countries.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.734
Obviously, the contributions of
Irish Americans to the United

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.667
States is legendary.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:04.333
But what is also true is that
we have an incredibly strong

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:09.433
partnership on economic
issues, on security issues.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:12.700
The Taoiseach has shown great
leadership during difficult

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.934
times in Ireland.

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:19.400
And we're seeing progress
in the Irish economy.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.700
That's good for the U.S. economy
because we have a lot of trade,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.433
a lot of investment in Ireland.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:31.333
There was a story this morning
about a deal between Ryanair and

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.633
Boeing in which we'll be selling
a whole lot of airplanes

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:35.900
to Ireland.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.667
And it's an example of how the
progress that's made in Ireland

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:44.567
benefits jobs and businesses
here in the United States.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.700
Obviously, the Taoiseach
is very interested,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.133
as well as in continuing to
attract direct investment from

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:52.300
the United States to Ireland.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.500
So this will be a major
topic of discussion.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.266
Ireland also punches above its
weight internationally when it

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:02.133
comes to humanitarian
assistance, peacekeeping.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:08.200
Irish troops are in many very
difficult places in the world

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.667
and provide the kinds of
stabilization and humanitarian

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.567
efforts that make all the
difference and save lives.

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:20.100
And so I am very much
looking forward to having a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.100
good conversation.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.800
I'm sure we will also touch on
the issue of Northern Ireland in

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.867
which we have continued to see
progress coming out of the Good

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:33.100
Friday agreements, but we also
have to recognize that there's a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.500
lot more work to be done before
there's true unity of effort in

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.500
that country.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.333
And I know that both in
discussions with the Taoiseach

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:46.166
as well as in talking to the
ministers who are here from

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.800
Northern Ireland, we'll have an
opportunity to find out how the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.767
United States can be helpful in
that overall effort as well.

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:57.266
So, again, Taoiseach,
I want to welcome you.

00:02:57.266 --> 00:03:00.433
Thank you for giving me
an excuse to break out

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:01.266
my green tie.

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.834
(laughter)

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:06.734
And I'm sure that we'll have a
wonderful lunch up on Capitol

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:11.300
Hill and once again be able
to reaffirm the incredible

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.367
friendship between our peoples.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.734
Prime Minister Kenny:
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:19.600
Could I to say that it's a
particular privilege to be able

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.834
to come here to the White House
to visit President Obama to

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:25.867
continue this wonderful
tradition that the American

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:29.200
government over the years has
shown to Ireland because of the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.133
particular and unique
relationship between our

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:35.400
countries covering
many centuries.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.800
I come here both as Taoiseach,
but also as the presidency of

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.033
the European Union.

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:43.934
I suppose I should say this
because I'll never get the

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:47.667
chance again, it's great to be
on presidential terms here.

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:48.867
(laughter)

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:50.433
The President of the United
States, an Irishman,

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:52.133
and the President of
Europe, an Irishman,

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:53.233
meeting in the Oval Office.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.500
(laughter)

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.834
But I would like
to say seriously,

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:59.467
it's an opportunity for me to
brief the President on the

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:02.066
progress being made in
challenging times for the Irish

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:05.533
government, following a very
clear and strategic plan.

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:09.367
It's also an opportunity to
brief the President on issues of

00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:13.367
the European Union and the
progress being made by the

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:16.467
European Council, with
particular reference to the

00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:21.400
EU-U.S. trade --
participation and free trade,

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.166
to which the President
referred in his State of the

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:24.200
Union address.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.734
I'd like to follow
that through with him.

00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:29.333
Also, to brief the President
on opportunities in respect of

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:33.100
Northern Ireland, immigration
-- undocumented Irish --

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.600
and, of course, the general
perspectives both for the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.867
world economy.

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:42.433
And as the President is moving
to the Middle East this evening,

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:45.233
I can give him an update on the
recent meeting and discussion

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:47.367
that the European
Council held there.

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:51.166
Besides, it's a real opportunity
to celebrate St. Patrick's Week.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.500
I have a second tie for the
President, if he so wishes.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.233
And, of course, there is a
standing open invitation to

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:02.333
President Obama to come back to
Ireland whenever is convenient

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.233
and appropriate and
when he so wishes.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:08.000
And maybe the next time, when
our economies are moving in a

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.500
more positive direction, we
might actually have time to take

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.667
out the sticks on
the golf course.

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:16.200
I'm looking forward to that
sometime in the future.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.867
So to First Lady Michelle, the
children, Malia and Sasha,

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:25.533
we wish the President continued
success and good fortune in the

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:29.266
very onerous responsibilities
that he lay up on his shoulders

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:31.900
as the leader of the free world.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.367
And it's a pleasure and a
privilege to be here in the

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:34.600
Oval Office.
