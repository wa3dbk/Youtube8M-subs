00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.758
OK, so one last example here of converting a complex number into polar form.

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.968
So here we've got 3 minus i squared (sorry - had a little ink run up there - a little dot).

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.939
So 3 minus i squared ... the first thing I'm going to do here is rewrite this as something a little more familiar.

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.899
So I'm actually going to just distribute everything out.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.460
So 3 times 3,  that's 9.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.830
We would get a negative 3i and a negative 3i, that would give us negative 6i.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.090
A negative and a negative makes a positive. i times i will be

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.440
i squared.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.399
Well, i squared is the same thing as negative 1, so really we have 9 minus 1...

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.059
9 minus 1 would give us 8 minus 6i. So this is our

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.329
complex number that I'm going to graph and think about.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.710
So, again, it says you basically go over to the real part. You go over 8 units. We would go down 6 units.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.580
And so there would be our complex number 8 - 6i.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.359
So we'll have to do a couple things again. We have to figure out the modulus,  which will be our r-value.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.099
So the modulus, in this case, will just be 8 squared plus negative 6 squared

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.009
Well, that'll be 64 plus 36.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.500
64 Plus 36 is 100. The square root of 100 is just 10.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.310
OK, so the other thing that we'll have to do is ... we're going to have to figure out our our angle theta.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.479
So we're interested in the angle.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.509
But what I'm going to do is... maybe I'll call this alpha. We'll figure out this angle first.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.879
So let's see here.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.649
So there's our angle alpha. This side would have a length of 8. This side of our triangle would have a length of 6.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.940
Well, we can get

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.669
alpha by using tangent. So tangent is going to be the opposite over the adjacent. So 6 over 8 or

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.500
3 over 4.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.069
Or, I guess, .75. So I'm going to take the inverse tangent of both sides.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.509
Just to get the angle, in this case, for alpha. So, let's see, .75... inverse tangent of that...

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.709
I'm getting alpha to be roughly 36.87 degrees.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.660
We could always round this off. I guess we'll round it off in this case to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.459
37 degrees.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.909
Well, so the true angle here for theta

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.739
would be

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.739
360 degrees minus

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.209
37 degrees. I believe that's going to give us

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.679
323 degrees. So it says, again, our complex number ... we can write our complex number

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.360
(here we go) as

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.048
r times cosine theta plus i sine theta.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.299
So we figured out our theta value's 323.  We said our r value was equal to 10, so

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.010
now, just filling in, again, this formula one more time. So you can get it all in here. (I don't think so...

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:48.679
...how about that.) So  z would equal r, which is 10, and then we'll have cosine of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.450
323 degrees

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.688
plus i times sine of 323 degrees.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.709
OK, so some of these can be a little more tedious simply because you've got to actually, you know, rewrite your complex number in the

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.799
first place.

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.438
But after that the modulus isn't bad. It's just, you know, really Pythagorean Theorem.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.010
Set up a little right triangle

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:26.119
using tangent.  You know, eventually you may have to use inverse tangent. And then, again, just based on what quadrant

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.000
you're in, you may have to add 180, subtract 180, or do whatever to get the correct angle.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.560
But then it's just a matter of just throwing everything into the formula, and you're finished.
