00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.480
Hello, everyone.
My name is Lucjan Igras.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.760
Get on board of my Black Pearl.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.880
When you get on a truck like this,
you know there is a destination.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.240
The pirate map outlined the way
to a hidden treasure.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.240
My goal is to deliver the cargo.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.760
And on board of my Black Pearl
I am the only captain.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.400
This is my bell. Not a ship's
bell but a car "bell".

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.360
Every driver's cab I've created
has its soul and its warmth

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.560
that comes from home.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.840
There's a fridge full of homeâ€“made
food prepared by my wife.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.720
It's really fantastic.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.600
My name is Igras Lucjan.
This is my logo.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.600
I watched the first part of
The Pirates of the Caribbean.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.320
I started thinking how
I could do it,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.640
How to make it work together?
You need to see the whole picture,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.320
so that it all makes sense,
and everything goes together.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.280
That is really important.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.640
After I started playing with trucks,
I was negatively perceived

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.320
in my home town, as a man
who wanted to do something,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
yet nobody knew
exactly what it was.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.320
Once newspapers started
covering it, everything changed.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160
Suddenly I'm from here
and I'm their man.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.360
I believe my way and the ideas
that were born in my crazy head

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.720
express what has been done here.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.960
It's kind of fun, I guess.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.600
Without such people
the world would be grey.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.000
See you on the trail!
Ahoy!
