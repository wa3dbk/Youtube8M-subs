00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.040
Have you ever looked at the wikipedia page
of a Gas giant and thought:

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.740
“Man, I wish I knew this much about my fictional
gas giant planet!”

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.740
Why am I even asking?

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.740
Of course you have, let's do this!

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.499
Youtube! Edgar here. And welcome to Artifexian.

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.490
Here you will learn everything you ever wanted
to know about worldbuilding...

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.480
And then some!

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.960
The mass range of gas giant is 10 earth masses
to 13 jupiter masses.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.689
Simple! Radius however is a little more nuanced.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.140
Between 2 and 13 jupiter masses a body will
always be 1 jupiter radius in size.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.340
Larger radii only occur below 2 jupiter masses.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.760
This is kinda counterintuitive; you can thank
electron degeneracy for that.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.690
All things considers let's build.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.400
First up let's construct a “Super Jupiter”

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.170
I.e a giant Planet more massive than jupiter.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:52.090
Again we use the planet maker equation. G
= M/R^2 = R(P).

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.730
Seeing as we are dealing with a super jupiter,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090
I'm going to pick, say, 3 jupiter masses.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.830
Now, given that its above the 2 jupiter mass
limit,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.510
It must have a radius of 1 jupiter radii.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.940
But for the sake of avoiding mathematical
mundanity,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.470
I'll allow myself to go plus or minus a few
percent.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.450
'Cause you know who likes boring maths; Nobody,
that's who!

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.820
1.03 jupiter radii should do the trick.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.760
Solving for gravity and density yields the
following stats.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.570
Remember all values here are relative to the
jupiter = 1,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.000
And to convert them to absolute values just
multiply by jupiter’s absolute values.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.730
Here's Jupiter and earth and here, to scale,
is our super jupiter.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.050
Same radius, seriously more massive.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.659
And now for something completely different.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.030
Lets build a puffy giant: i.e a planet below
2 jupiter masses but with a radius larger

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.030
Than jupiter.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.850
I'll set my mass at 0.48 and my radius at
1.9, say.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.640
Again plug the values into the planet maker,
solve for gravity and density and you get

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640
the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.640
Following results.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.190
Now these figures may seem a bit crazy

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.080
But they are in fact the stats of the exoplanet
WASP-17b,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.510
Proof that real life puffy giants are truly
bonkers in nature!

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.860
I mean if we multiply that density value by
Jupiter's absolute density we see that this

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.330
World has a density of 0.09 g/cm^3...

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.340
That's a whopping 7.5 times less dense that
saturn!!

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.180
If that doesn't initiate cranial mind blow
you should serious consider running a level

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.180
1

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.029
Diagnostic to see why you are not functioning
within established parameters.

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.129
Digression aside, it's worth noting that the
least dense exoplanet discovered to date has

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.530
a density of 0.03 g/cm^3

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.279
And the planet with the largest radius is
in fact WASP 17-b at 1.9 jupiter radii.

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.450
Consider these a couple of figures to bare
in mind when constructing your worlds.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.469
Again here's jupiter and earth and here is
our puffy planet.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.029
Finally let's build a gas dwarf

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.659
I.e a gaseous planet smaller that Uranus and
Neptune.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.769
These planets break all the above parameters
as they are transitional worlds blurring the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.049
Line between gas planet, ocean planet and
rocky planet.

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.809
Conservatively speaking a gas dwarf will be
no smaller than two earth radii and could

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:58.809
have

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.230
A mass anywhere between 1 – 20 earth masses.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.090
As explained in a previous video this means
the gas giant will likely follow a generic

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.559
Mass radius relationship so we can use this
graph to get realistic mass and radius values.

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.359
Here's the 2 radius line so everything below
that is out.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.909
Below 1 and above 20 earth mass range is also
out.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.779
And seeing as a gas dwarf will obviously be
composed of gas everything here: Gone!.

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.299
Links by the way in the dooblydoo.

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.970
Okay so let’s go with say 2 earth masses
and 4 earth radii.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.699
Plug the values in to the planet maker and
huzzah!

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:30.970
We get the these stats.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.469
Bare in mind we are now talking in terms of
the earth = 1.

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:35.469
For the final time.

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.590
We got jupiter and earth and here is our gas
dwarf.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.560
So thats how to build the various types of
giant planet.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.459
Remember you can help flesh out your world
by calculating escape velocity, surface area,

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.330
Circumference and volume just as we did in
the previous video.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.799
Finally, a warning!

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.230
Not all types of gaseous planet can be placed
wherever you want in your planetary system.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.790
In order of increasing distance from their
host star we are likely to find puffy planets

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.790
here,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.290
Gas giants and super jupiters here

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.079
And gas dwarves here.

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:22.169
But more on that when we discuss orbits in
a later video.
