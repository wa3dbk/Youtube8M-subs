00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.310
Forget candied apples.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.580
This Halloween, why don't you make some scary
skulls?

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.519
So, using pears instead of apples, I've rinsed
them off, and we are going to dip these in

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.690
white chocolate, which is even more delicious
than an apple in candy.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.490
So, you wash up your pear, and then I've got
some popsicle sticks that I'm just gonna jam

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.009
at right end to where the stem of the pear
would be.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.009
Got it.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.180
I kinda like that.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.020
And then, I've got some white chocolate here
that I've softened.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.490
This is white baking chocolate, so I'm just
gonna stir it a little bit, and I'm going

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:49.130
to just drizzle it over my pear like so, and
you just kinda drizzle it and spin at the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.040
same time just to kinda get like a real even
coat, and then I'm just gonna hold it there

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.510
for a little bit and jut get off all the excess.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.940
Let's make sure we got good coverage at the
bottom.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.850
Now, I've got some flow from here, which is
what I'm gonna use to stand it up in, and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.560
this is so great because you can stand this
up and let them dry, and now, we're ready

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.170
to decorate our scary skulls.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.499
So, I'm just gonna pull once of these right
out of the floral foam, and I've got these

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:18.869
custard dishes here.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.329
These are so perfect for laying down your
pear.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.979
And you can put it down in there and then
you can work on putting all the features on

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.299
without worrying about it sliding off.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.350
So, we've got our black [unk], and these are
so great to give it that real skeletal look

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.240
like putting on thickened eye cavities and
things like that, super creepy.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.499
So, to get these on, I'm gonna use the same
white chocolate that I already heated up.

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:47.679
So, I'm just gonna bring that over here, and
I'm just gonna take, start with the eyes,

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.159
and these little black [unk], I'm just gonna
put a little bit of white chocolate on the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.570
back.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.399
Just put enough to make sure that you've got
some to stick on, so I'm just gonna put it

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.859
on like that, and then I'm just gonna stick
it on to my skeleton.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.369
He's got 1 eye there.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.370
I'm gonna put another one on, and stick `em
on over here.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:25.470
So, now, I've got my skeletal pear there all
decorated, and I'm just setting `em back in

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.769
the foam, and so, like I said before, the
foam, it's got a couple different uses.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:30.980
It's really, really cool.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.040
So, what I did was, I cut a piece of the same
foam that I'm using here, and I'm putting

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.590
it inside of a little black container, and
this is so cool to be able to serve it in.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.090
You can put this down, and everyone gets their
own little skull in a little bag like this;

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.090
so cool.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.500
So, I'm just gonna take this one, this little
finished skull here, [unk], so creepy.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.720
I'm just gonna pop them in, and then, I've
got this really, really cool colorful green

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.510
jelly beans that I'm gonna use to fill up
the inside of my container to give it even

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.980
more of a candied effect.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.360
So, I got this one all filled in with my candy,
and he's got his scary skull in there, and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:25.480
this is such a cool way to present a really,
really fun and very scary dessert.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.690
[unk]
