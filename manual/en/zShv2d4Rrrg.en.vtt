How to Wash Your Face.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.730
Cleaning and moisturizing your face are the
cornerstones of good skin care.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.790
Here's a simple routine to help you always
put your best face forward.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.429
You will need A non-comedogenic facial cleanser
A sink or basin Warm water Hand soap Hair

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:32.890
clips or a headband A towel A natural, alcohol-free
toner Cotton balls or pad and a non-comedogenic

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.890
moisturizer.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.890
Step 1.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.370
Choose a non-comedogenic, or non-pore-blocking,
facial cleanser appropriate for your skin:

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.620
dry or sensitive skin needs something gentle,
fragrance-free, and dye-free; oily skin will

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.840
likely benefit from a product containing salicylic
acid, which helps clear out clogged pores.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.890
Avoid ingredients such as acids, botanicals,
and irritating preservatives such as ethanol

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.560
and propylene glycol.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.830
Step 2.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.259
Wash your hands with soap and water to rid
them of dirt and grease.

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.070
Be sure to pull your hair back so it does
not get in the way.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.070
Step 3.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.540
Wet your face by splashing it with warm water.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.840
Step 4.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.060
Following the product instructions, put an
amount of cleanser into your hands and work

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.530
it into a lather.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.270
Apply it gently to your face with your fingertips
using small circular motions.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.640
Don't forget to wash your hairline, eyebrows,
and beneath your jaw.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.850
Step 5.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.049
Rinse the cleanser off by splashing your face
with warm water.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.049
Step 6.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.810
Pat your face dry with a clean towel.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.810
Step 7.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.490
Apply a natural, alcohol-free toner, such
as one based on rose water or witch hazel,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.820
with a cotton ball or pad.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.920
Step 8.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.810
Apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer that has
an SPF of at least 15 and is appropriate for

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.400
your skin type: sensitive skin needs something
dye- and fragrance-free; dry skin needs a

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.869
rich product, and oily skin needs an oil-
and fragrance-free product that contains exfoliating

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.959
agents, like salicylic or fruit acids.

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.820
