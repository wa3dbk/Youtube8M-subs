00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.520
For Black Tent, I'm Jerry Teuschler.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.090
A glowing endorsement from a happy customer
is one of the most powerful marketing tools

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.570
available.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.510
Let's face it... everyone knows how hard it
is to sing your own praises.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.720
It's far better to let someone else do your
bragging—especially a satisfied customer.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.250
Customer testimonials can be a fantastic sales
&amp; marketing tool because they give your prospective

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.480
and current customers a firsthand account
of your value—and they go a long way in

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.450
building trust and encourage sales!

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.700
While testimonials come in many forms, there
is nothing better than a video of a customer

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.050
praising your products or services.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.070
It's simply the most credible and meaningful
ways to showcase the value of your company.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.550
While the advantages of customer testimonials
may seem obvious; there are a few other benefits

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.650
that are often overlooked:

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.670
First, testimonial videos provide powerful
digital marketing and social media content.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.040
In video format, testimonials can be used
on corporate websites, e-mail marketing campaigns,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.390
sales presentations, and social media sites
such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.371
A few short video testimonials on your social
media channels can allow you to share and

00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:17.729
engage with your prospects in ways that were
never before possible.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.499
Second, testimonial videos can boost your
search rankings.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.100
As most search engine optimization experts
will tell you, getting a first-page ranking

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.040
on Google is harder than ever.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.710
Not only do Google's search and indexing algorithms
continue to evolve in complexity, but Google

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.520
has recently given more of its real estate
to "blended" search results, displaying video

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.600
and images towards the top of the first page,
which push down traditional page results that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.399
would have otherwise competed for top rankings.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.939
But where problems arise, so do opportunities.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.329
Although Google's enthusiasm for video has
created more competition for traditional search

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.179
results, it has enabled sites with video assets—even
sites that would otherwise score poorly in

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.020
the Google index—to achieve first-page rankings.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.590
In fact, Forrester Research found that videos
were 53 times more likely than traditional

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.250
web pages to receive an organic first-page
ranking.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.690
Third, soliciting testimonial videos will
tell you a lot about your customers.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.480
You'll find out if you actually have customers
that are enthusiastic enough about your products/services

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.850
to go on camera.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.230
And, if you get rejected, that will open the
conversation as to what you can improve upon

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.550
to turn your customers into raving fans.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.670
Either way, you win!

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.740
If you are considering video testimonials,
there are several reasons why you may want

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.110
some help from a professional.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.970
Let's face it, it can be uncomfortable for
you to ask your customers to elaborate on

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.810
the reasons why your solutions are so great;
however, as a third party, Black Tent interviewers

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.290
can ask solution-oriented questions (pre approved
by you) that elicit the glowing responses

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.620
you want and need.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.594
We have videographers available to shoot in
HD format anywhere in the country, and our

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:07.830
team handles the entire project from start
to finish.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.670
There are many things to think about.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.430
We handle it all; including project management,
scheduling, release forms, interview questions,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.400
interviews, videography, lighting, and video
editing.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.190
All we need to get started is the name of
one of your satisfied customers.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.190
For Black Tent, I'm Jerry Teuschler.
