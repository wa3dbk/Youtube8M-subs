-- Ukrainian terrorists are killing Donbass residents every day

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.140
but even such violent times can't stand in the way of the most important human feeling -- love

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:34.415
I'm medic in the unit

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:36.224

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.080
Well...

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.594
That's nothing, everything's going to be great

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:44.994

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.920
-- Taking the situation in Donbass into account, most of the guests and the groom wore military uniforms

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.800
Militia weddings... maybe they're not as  
sumptuous as others', but instead they're really sincere

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.640
-- Sergei...

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.300
Arrived to help us from Belarus 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.740
And he has shown himself...

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.960
very positively 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.960
as a soldier and as a person

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.320
He's very brave

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:18.874
Has got several injuries

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.480
got all of them at the airport

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.920
during the fights for the terminals 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.380
So...

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.400
He's a good person

00:01:28.034 --> 00:01:29.854
-- What would you like to wish to newlyweds?

00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:31.506

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.854
let them live long and happy

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.280
-- Dasha is 18, Sergei is 23

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.560
but despite the young age, living through all the hardships and sorrows of current time they decided to take a serious step

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.749

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.420
