00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Hi I'm Marloes Coenen and welcome to Glory's technique of the week

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.100
Hello my name is Martijn de Jong this is Marloes Coenen three time worlds champion MMA

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820
today we are going to show you some clinching techniques

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.780
in Glory you are allowed to clinch three seconds

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.320
so first she's going to catch me and throw a right knee at the same time

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.020
turns me around, throw another knee to the body and follows up with a knee to the head

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.600
I'm here, we're very close, close counter fight especially in kickboxing
happens a lot from here

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.720
she can grab right away, if she starts grabbing me with the left hand first and then the right hand comes so she always has defense

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.760
the same time throw a right knee
boom

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.100
then she starts back, puts the knee all the way back
so I won't be able to sweep her

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:12.040
move, moves her leg to the outside of my body and now she turns, turns her hips first and then the rest comes

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.780
knee to the body and knee to the face

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.300
let's do this again, but this time a little faster

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.460
one more time

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
so guys train hard and see you next week for a new technique
