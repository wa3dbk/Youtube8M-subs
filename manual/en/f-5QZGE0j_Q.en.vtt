Hi, my name is Gannin Arnold.
Today I'm going to talk about...

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.030
...some of the effects I have on
the floor here, and the guitar.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.520
In my hand I have an Xotic Guitar.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.760
It was built especially for me by Hiro.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.150
This is a black Tele.
All black, mainly.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.290
It's the Xotic pickups.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.530
The one thing I really like about
this guitar, right off the bat...

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.180
...is that when you play it
acoustically, it resonates.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.260
If you just hit a note, you can
hear the sustain right away...

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.870
...without any of the effects on,
or any of the amplification.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.420
I like the way it resonates immediately
when you just play the guitar.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.980
I think good guitars should feel like
an acoustic guitar when you play them.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.980
They should be kind of loud.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.980
That's when you know
you have a good one.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.980
I took this on the road all summer...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.290
...with Taylor Hawkins
&amp; the Coattail Riders.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.260
And it just was
an amazing instrument.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.220
It never went out of tune,
and it played great every night.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.280
It just feels good in my hands,
just the way it plays.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.980
It's amazing for me.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.800
So that's the guitar, and I have
another Xotic guitar over there.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.980
This guitar is little different
from the Tele obviously.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.980
It's a Strat.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480
This one has a split coil
so I can have humbuckers.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.480
But I can also have
just a single coil pickup.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.480
Which I thought was pretty cool.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.930
These are also Xotic pickups.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.230
Let's see, anything else
special about this guitar...

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.540
This guitar is also really durable
on the road as well.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.780
Both these guitars were played a lot. 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.060
We did a lot of shows, and we went
all over the world, basically.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.040
They got knocked around a bit,
but they always played great.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.480
They always stayed in tune and
they sounded amazing.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.080
These are my go-to guitars for
everything, anything I do...

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.730
...sessions or DVD, you name it.
These are the guitars I play.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.180
For me, they just feel really
comfortable in my hands.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.980
They just sound great.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.280
This also has the same thing,
when you...

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.070
The acoustic resonance of the
guitar itself is a big factor...

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.040
...in the way the guitar's gonna sound
once you plug it into effects.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.730
I love both these guitars, and
I really like the locking tuners.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.180
That's a great bonus, because you
just throw your string in there...

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.180
...you lock it, and you're done.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.380
Just, well-crafted instruments.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.980
