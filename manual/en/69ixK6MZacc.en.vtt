Hi this is Jeff Isbell on behalf of ExpertVillage.com.
Well what is finger style guitar anyway? The

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.140
name finger style guitar refers mostly to
the right hand, where the strings are plucked

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.270
individually or in groups. It doesn’t refer
to the fingers of the left hand, after all,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.990
all guitar styles use the fingers of the left
hand. Anyway, it’s kind of ironic that finger

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:43.160
style guitars named that way since the original
use of the guitar classical was a finger style.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:01:01.309
And what about jazz, there are a lot of finger
style approaches to jazz. So what is this

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.930
style that dares to name itself after an approach
that lots of styles use? Modern finger style

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.930
guitar has broaden in its definition and actually
now includes some classical or at least nylon

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.540
string specialist. And many jazz players today
would feel fine if you called them finger

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.740
style players. For the most part, modern finger
style refers to metal string flat top guitars

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:41.420
being played with the fingers.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.160
Whichever style you are interested in, this
series of lessons is for you. It’s a basic

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.820
introduction to understanding, developing
the coordination and knowledge needed for

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.909
all these styles. So if this sounds like what
you’re looking for, keep watching and we’ll

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:56.880
see you on lesson two.
