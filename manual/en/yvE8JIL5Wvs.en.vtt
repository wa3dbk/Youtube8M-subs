00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:06.410
FriendCash for iPhone and iPad is an incredible 
and powerful assitant to manage group expenses

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.109
A problem we all face is that we often 
need to split expenses, share a bill,

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.869
or just keep track of what people have 
paid for others

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.869
the solution is to write down the expenses and 
let the app calculates what people owes to one another

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.130
let's say you're in Europe with some friends

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.639
create an event

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:30.919
name it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.530
pick a currency and tap done

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.540
the first thing to do when you create an event
is to add some friends from your address book

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.050
check Brad

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.050
search for Kate, and add you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.910
you are now ready to add expenses

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.810
to create a new expense, tap on the bill

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.940
select who paid

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.940
you can write a short note to remember
for what you paid

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.869
and set how much you've paid

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:12.860
now

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.310
adjust the shares to split the expense

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.980
and tap save

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.130
it is this so easy to split an expense using FriendCash

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.100
you can add as many expenses as you want

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.670
and now because of the iCloud support

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.759
you have your expenses on your iPhone 
and your iPad

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.810
synchronized at any time

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.280
when the event ended go to the 
payback section and FriendCash calculates

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.730
the quickest way to restore the financial balance.
you can send a sum up by email

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.290
or mark a transaction as done by tapping on it

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.950
it was FriendCash for iPhone and iPad

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.780
available on the App Store

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.320
to keep your friends

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.950
and keep your cash
