&gt;&gt; Professor Rosemary Ashton:

00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:16.106
The UCL Bloomsbury Project
is funded for three years

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:20.166
by the Leverhulme Trust, and
we're interested in showing

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.876
that during the 19th Century
Bloomsbury was the cradle

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:27.676
and became very fast the centre
of educational enterprises

00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:30.266
of all kinds which were in
some way forward looking,

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:34.556
many of which have rich
archives which we're exploring

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:37.826
and which we wish to pass on
to other researchers as well

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:40.386
as to the ordinary
interested person.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.086
This is the house on the
south side of Bedford Square

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.346
in the heart of Bloomsbury

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:49.996
where the lady's college
was first started up.

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:52.276
It later became Bedford College
and a part of the University

00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:54.706
of London, but it
was the first college

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.236
for higher education for women.

00:00:56.706 --> 00:01:00.276
Set up in 1849 by a woman
called Elizabeth Reid

00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:03.506
who had been widowed earlier
in life and was wealthy.

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.976
So she set up the college
here in this house,

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:08.916
and she got a number
of the professors

00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:11.776
from University College
London down the road to come

00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:13.166
and teach the women here.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.676
In 1878, it was University
College London

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.736
which first allowed
women to take degrees.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:21.736
But in 1849, you've got
this very first attempt

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:24.646
to allow women to think that
they're actually capable

00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:27.286
of studying hard
subjects at a high level.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.156
Having lived and worked here for
many years and having written

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:35.116
about a number of these people,
I find that it wasn't difficult

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:39.466
to come to the idea of actually
doing a huge study with help

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.256
and with a team of
19th Century Bloomsbury

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:44.086
with UCL at the heart of it.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:47.126
But also looking at a
number of other institutions

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:48.506
which are much less well known.

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:51.206
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Colville:
When I arrived at UCL,

00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:54.656
I was always fascinated by
walking around Bloomsbury

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.946
and discovering this
strange mixture

00:01:56.946 --> 00:02:01.606
of very grand residential
houses and so many institutions.

00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:03.886
And like Rosemary, I'd
always wondered why

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:05.806
that happened, how
that happened.

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:08.276
So I'm very glad to be able
to have the opportunity

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:09.626
to trace the development.

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:12.106
There are two things that
I'm in charge of really.

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:13.836
One is the website.

00:02:13.836 --> 00:02:14.986
I'm responsible for making sure

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:17.746
that everything we discover
gets edited in some form

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:19.416
and put on to our website.

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:23.616
And the other thing I do is
I'm the main person who goes

00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:24.976
around archives, looking

00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:30.746
at archival material
relating to our institutions.

00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:30.813
[ Music ]

00:02:30.813 --> 00:02:33.246
I've got medical records here
which are very interesting

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:36.786
and these are from
the early years

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:38.126
of University College Hospital.

00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:39.796
These are from the 1840s.

00:02:40.206 --> 00:02:43.666
And these are the medical
records relating to the patient

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:46.826
for whom those are
the Carswell drawings.

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:51.576
These are the diseased hands of
the patient, Catherine Holmes,

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:54.206
who came and was
treated but sadly died.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:58.576
&gt;&gt; Professor Rosemary
Ashton: The first kindergarten

00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:02.526
in Britain was set up in
Tavistock Place place in 1854

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:06.276
by a couple of German political
exiles, Yohannes Honger

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:09.736
and his wife Berta, who had
came over with other exiles

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:14.906
from the European revolutions
in 1848 to escape censorship

00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:16.476
and illiberality at home.

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:21.496
We need to remember that now
what we consider as mainstream,

00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:24.446
that is teaching young children
through play and leisure

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.886
and games was in the mid

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:30.746
and early Victorian period
completely revolutionary.

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:41.516
Bloomsbury, itself, grew
during the 19th Century

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:45.216
from a very small place
in 1800 to the place

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:48.366
that we know it now, and
Bloomsbury is really now

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:51.206
as it was by the middle
of the 19th Century.

00:03:57.316 --> 00:04:00.496
Here behind me is Mary Ward
House, which was first known

00:04:00.496 --> 00:04:02.386
as the Passmore Edwards
Settlement named

00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:05.656
after two people, Mary
Ward better known then

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:09.766
as the novelist Mrs. Humphry
Ward and John Passmore Edwards

00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:13.106
who had been a penniless
young man in Cornwall

00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:15.056
who had made his
fortune coming to London

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:16.426
in the newspaper business.

00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:22.396
And both of them were very keen
to extend education to the poor,

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:26.676
and in particular to offer
play and learning facilities

00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:27.856
for the children of the poor

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:30.296
in the days before
universal education.

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:35.046
And this was an innovative
thing in the 1890s to attempt

00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:39.676
to extend education and
leisure activities also

00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:41.826
for the poor of the area.

00:04:41.826 --> 00:04:42.846
[ Music ]

00:04:42.846 --> 00:04:53.406
Bloomsbury is still a very
cultural and intellectual place

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:58.496
with lots of institutions and
organisations and archives.

00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:00.496
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Colville: When
people talk about Bloomsbury,

00:05:00.576 --> 00:05:04.236
they think of it as this kind of
centre of progressive education

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:06.956
and medical research,
which is really interesting

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:19.386
because that's just a continuous
history right from the 1820s.
