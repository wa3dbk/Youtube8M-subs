So far in this tutorial series,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.140
I launched a free WordPress site on the CloudAccess.net platform,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.380
and I gave an overview of the WordPress Dashboard.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.920
We also discussed how to locate, install and customize themes.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.040
It's now time to start creating our own content for the site,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.860
but before we do it's important to understand that 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.860
WordPress has two basic types of content, which are Posts and Pages.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.260
By default, when we launch a WordPress site

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.300
our homepage is a stream of our current posts

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.240
and posts consist of blogs, news, or other types of

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.300
frequently updated content.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.220
They're organized by date, author, categories and tags

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.580
and these things we'll discuss in later tutorials.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.500
Posts are usually available through an index.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.660
Posts also typically contain a commenting area

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.000
and/or social sharing links.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.280
If we open up the "Hello World" post,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.880
which is part of the sample data that comes with our  WordPress installation,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.740
we can see that it's published with a publication date,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.680
and an author and there's also an area to provide

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.740
comments at the bottom of the post.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160
To contrast this, open up the "Sample Page",

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.600
which is also part of the sample data that comes

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.680
with your WordPress isntallation.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.620
Pages are usually permanent pieces of information

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.080
about the site like a contact for or an about us page.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.174
that you'd like to make available to your site visitors through a menu.

00:01:28.174 --> 00:01:32.354
Unlike Posts, which are organized using Categories and Tags,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.340
Pages are organized in parent/child relationships.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.880
For instance, we could make a child page of the sample page here

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.680
which would appear as a drop down menu item.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.320
Pages don't appear within the blog stream

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.520
and they usually don't feature comments or social options,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.780
although they may.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.640
When you're trying to decide between a Post and a Page,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.280
and you'd like the menu item to appear on the main menu

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.835
of the WordPress site, it's usually a Page.

00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:00.060
And if you'd like an item to appear within the stream

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.640
of continually updated items, it's usually a Post.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.760
Later tutorials in this series will show you how to create

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.180
both Posts and Pages.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.440
The next tutorial will show you how to create categories

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.420
for Posts to keep your Posts organized.
