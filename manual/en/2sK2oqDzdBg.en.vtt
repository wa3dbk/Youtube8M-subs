00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
"Fast Food: Do You Want
Fries with that Lipitor?"

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.160
Why go to the bother of changing one’s
diet, when you could just take a pill?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.480
In fact, they could just hand
them out at the drive-through.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.880
Ridiculous, you say?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.440
Published in a prestigious cardiology
journal last year: "The risk reduction

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.160
associated with the daily
consumption of most statins…

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.380
(the cholesterol-lowering drugs)
is more powerful than the risk

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.640
increase caused by the daily extra
fat intake associated with a…

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.940
Quarter Pounder® with cheese
and a small milkshake.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.460
In conclusion, statin therapy can
neutralize the cardiovascular risk

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.620
caused by harmful diet choices."

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.720
Look, you want to ride
a motorcycle, smoke, drive?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.080
We got helmets, filters,
seat belts, right?

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.580
If people are going to continue
to smoke cigarettes,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.220
might as well put
some filters on them.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.140
"Likewise, some individuals
eat unhealthily."

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.880
Hey, "Fast food outlets
already offer free

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.440
condiments to supplement meals."

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.440
So why not a "statin-containing
accompaniment?"

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.080
You’ve heard of ketchup packets?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.620
How about "complimentary
statin packets?"

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.679
What about statin safety,
side effects?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.420
They thought of that:
"Statins have a favorable

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.160
‘benefit-to-risk’ ratio,
with only rare adverse effects

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.980
reported in [liver], kidney,
and muscle tissue…

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.920
If statins are to be made
more readily available

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.020
by fast food outlets, statin toxicity
might become a greater concern…"

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.360
But, look, we’re talking
about people who eat

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.900
Quarter Pounders with
cheese and a milkshake.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.000
Surely: "We can conclude that
the documented safety record

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.560
of statins is substantially
better than that of fast foods!"

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.360
They conclude: "We envisage a future
in which fast food restaurants

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.060
encourage a holistic approach
to healthy living.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.320
On ordering an unhealthy meal,
the food will arrive labeled with

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.540
a warning message similar to those
found on cigarette packets

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.040
("This meal increases your risk for
heart disease and death"),

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.080
and on the tray, next to the ketchup,
will be a new and protective packet,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.920
"MacStatin", which could be
sprinkled onto a Quarter Pounder

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.500
or into a milkshake.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.860
This could easily be provided at no
extra charge, just as sugar and salt…"

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.160
That’s their holistic approach;
drugs in your Happy Meal, right?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.100
See Figure 4, it says.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.320
Are you ready?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.200
I couldn’t even make
this stuff up.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.520
Figure 4: New concept in
fast food risk reduction.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.060
"No tablet can completely neutralise
the harm to your individual health

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.540
from eating unhealthfully.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.060
Better ways to reduce your risk of
death from heart attack include:

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.540
eating healthily…

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.360
See your doctor for
complete advice."

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.500
Though, of course, your doctor may
very well be somewhere behind you,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.400
in the drive-through line.
