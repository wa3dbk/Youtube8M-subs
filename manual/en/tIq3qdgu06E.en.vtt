00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.100
Alright, now we're gonna look at Motion DSP. This
is a way of cleaning up your videos

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.670
using GPU technology. And we're 
here with Mike Sonders.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.970
Mike, thank you for spending some time with us.
- Oh, thanks for coming by.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.740
Explain a little bit about motion DSP
and what it does.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.830
Yeah sure. Well our history is actually in video
enhancement for military and intelligent apps.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.800
So you know, CSI type stuff like, 
we get the grady video,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.830
and we can actually resolve the details 
of he license plate sort of things.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.960
But what we realized, and realized is generous
because it's so obvious,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.800
is that a lot of junky consumer video can really
benefit from our technology.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.660
So we can do all the basic stuff like, fixing
lighting and sharpening,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.200
but that's really kind of rudimentary
fixes honestly.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.630
What we can do that's really neat is 
noise removal.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.330
So removing pixilation and jagged edges 
and all that kind of stuff.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.700
Increasing real resolution, and even doing really 
neat things with motion.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.140
So like doing best of class stabilization.
And I'd love to show you some examples.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.440
Awesome, let's see it.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.530
So, this isn't very typical of consumer video but 
it really gets into what,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.960
it really demonstrates, really well what we can
do with the technology.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.940
This is a self owned video, I've zoomed in a bit.
You can see some big problems with this video.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.900
Lot's of noise, awful detail. What we've tried to
do here is make this very powerful technology

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.530
very accessible to consumers. So, 
really to fix this up,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.340
I'm gonna hit exactly 1 button,
it's the clean button.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.370
And you are gonna see this go from noisy and junky
to, you can actually read the details

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.260
on the books there. So, junky and eligible,
to you can actually read those books.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.200
And this is super zoomed in. This is 450% 
by the way.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600
Wow, that is extremely impressive.
- Thank you very much.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.400
So, I'll show you a couple quick other videos.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.230
More typical of what consumers might
actually be taking.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.530
So for example, this was taken on a
Cannon PowerShot in video mode.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.660
And it was taken in a room with natural lighting.
So, unfortunately, 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.470
the video ended up being dark and you can see
a lot of noise in that picture as well.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.400
If you were to fix up this video with something
like, Adobe Premiere,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.230
which is a full fledge editing app, versus us, 
we're an enhancement app.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.440
You could fix the lights, in fact I'm gonna go in 
to fine tuning and just do that myself by hand.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.930
Bring up the lighting a little bit.
I'm gonna fix the color.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.970
You know that's fine but unfortunately, I've also
enhanced the noise that's in that video.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.400
You can see all that junk is still there. So 
I'm gonna turn on "Clean" again. Up to "High".

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.000
And you can see that noise just kinda disappear.
Again, that's "before" and "after".

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.170
And I'll zoom in a little bit so you can get 
a good shot of it.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.500
"Before", junky, "After"... And again that's
zoomed in 160%.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.100
Absolutely phenomenal. 
That looks really, really good.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.400
Thanks. So one last final quick example. I told
you we do really cool things with stabilization.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.060
Again, typical video, kid in the school play

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.570
and mom or dad is in the audience with the video
camera taking the shot.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.930
Ends up being really shaky and you've got a lot of
 noise and jagged edges and junk going on.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.730
So again, one button fixes. We can apply "Clean" 
and just remove all the junk

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.760
and all the jagged edges from those kids.
And we still got the shakiness.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.930
So, we're gonna apply stabilize as well, and that 
just gonna get to be rock solid right?

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.230
So here is your "before" and your "after". And
then I can even start sharpening that up.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.800
And the cool thing about running on a
Nvidia GPU is, 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.270
even though this is a Windows software that can
run on any computer that has a CPU on it,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.500
We can run up to 5 times faster on an Nvidia GPU. 
So right now, we've got 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.570
some of our enhancement setup
to high.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.630
In fact, I'm gonna increase the resolution as well
and really bring out the details 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.540
in the kids' faces. You can see running about
14 frames per second on the graphics card.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.830
I'm gonna turn off usage of the graphics card, and
 you're gonna see that drop down to

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.140
about 5 frames per second. 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.930
So, we're really get a lot of extra juice
on the graphics card.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.660
Yeah, I can really imagine that doing this type of
enhancement on your video takes a lot of power

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.940
and it's all parallel computing so, it would
really help to use the GPU vs. the CPU.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.400
There's almost no point.
- Indeed.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.630
This is all based on the CUTA platform?
- That's exactly right. 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.700
This has been portend with CUTA so you can use
your Nvidia graphics card to do this kinda stuff.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.440
And let me ask you a question, how long, or far
away, are we from seeing this on

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.630
the consumer market? Because this is something
that I can definitely use on my

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.730
crappy little IPhone videos, or my
flip Meno HD cams.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.100
Those are ideal scenarios. Although even with
the HD camera videos,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.730
If you're not using tripod or lights, 
you still get junky video.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.370
And the answer to your question is, this will be  
out in late February early March time frame.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.940
This year?   - This year.
- Alright.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.630
You're gonna see this very soon. And it will be an
introductory price of $40.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.900
So we've tried to make this very, very accessible.
- Did you say $40?

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.200
40 American dollars.
- That's like a gift.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.230
That's not even Canadian.
- fantastic! Wow! I'm so impressed.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.500
Hey Mike, this is very awesome. You've got a
little more to do but it still worked awesome.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.570
Thank you so much. I'm actually extremely,
extremely impressed.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.070
Thank you Bryan for actually bringing me over to
see motion DSP because...

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.640
You we're absolutely right. I would definitely
like it and us being in video,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.930
this is something that we could actually really
use, and I particularly will use.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.760
Because I'm always in my little flip Meno
 videotaping stuff.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.070
Hey, thanks again Mike. - Thanks for stopping by.
- Awesome.
