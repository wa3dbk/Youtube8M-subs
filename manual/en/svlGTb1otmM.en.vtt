00:00:03.082 --> 00:00:14.082
The twenty twelve race has officially begun and
President Obama launched his first ad and

00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:21.642
the reason he is doing this now he is officially
launching his campaign is so that he can start

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:26.592
collecting money he wants to collect up to
a billion dollars I mean look at how wrong

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:31.342
our system is how's the average guy going
to run for president when the incumbent raises

00:00:31.342 --> 00:00:36.922
a billion dollars I mean we used to think
Obama was an average guy his actions favoring

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:42.062
the establishment makes us think perhaps it
wasn't so and remember his top donor in the

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:47.772
last election was Goldman Sachs so anyway
he's going to go raise a billion dollars and

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:54.552
he's started out with an ad the ad is curious
in a lot of different ways first it hardly

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:59.792
has President Obama second as you're about
to see it lacks some degree of energy and

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:04.302
excitement because what are you supposed to
get excited about and then third of all he

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:09.732
basically pins it on you and says well you
know look it's up to you to get me elected

00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:15.082
it's I have a lot more to say about it afterwards
but also of course as usual with politics

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:18.802
check out the different races and states that
people are from gee I wonder if they'll be

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:25.802
swing states and I wonder if they'll be diverse
let's watch well it seems like the last couple

00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:51.222
of elections that we've had have been almost
kind of like turning point campaigns I"m kind

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:07.842
of nervous about it it's like it's coming
here it is two thousand twelve the election

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:19.871
I think it needs to reflect the changes that
we've seen in the last two and a half years

00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:36.452
then we had an underdog senator you know nobody
thought that he had a chance and now he's

00:02:36.452 --> 00:02:43.452
the President I just saw the energy and hope
that he had for this country even though I

00:02:51.812 --> 00:02:58.812
couldn't exactly vote at the time I knew that
someday I'd be able to help re-elect him and

00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:12.812
that's what I plan on doing we're not leaving
it up to chance we're not leaving it up to

00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:29.012
oh the incumbent that type of thing this is
an election that we have to win and unfortunately

00:03:29.012 --> 00:03:36.012
President Obama is one person he cannot go
plus he's got a job you know we're paying

00:03:37.612 --> 00:03:44.612
him to do a job so we can't say hey could
you just take some time off and come and get

00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:54.711
us all energized so we better figure it out
I can't not be involved there's just too much

00:03:55.851 --> 00:04:02.851
that is fundamentally important right now
that's going on as a community we all have

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:10.442
the same concerns we all want our kids to
go to school and learn and graduate we want

00:04:11.222 --> 00:04:17.592
jobs to be out there we want people to have
homes we want people to have opportunity I

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:22.701
don't agree with Obama on everything but I
respect him and I trust him there's so many

00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:27.321
things that are still on the table that need
to be addressed and we want them to be addressed

00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:31.541
by President Obama I had this perception that
politics was all show it was all soundbites

00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:32.182
but politics is how we govern ourselves that's
what politics is and at the grassroots level

00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:32.862
it's individuals talking to other individuals
and making a difference this commercial is

00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:35.242
you know politics cliche one oh one you got
the church in the background you got the waving

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:35.492
flag I almost expected Ronald Reagan to ride
in like a cowboy with his cowboy hat alright

00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:35.511
I got it dude second of all you know you got
the standard you got the black lady from Michigan

00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:35.631
a swing state you got the latino ah latina
lady from Arizona a swing state you got the

00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:35.701
white guy from North Carolina a swing state
and then but the thing that I was most amused

00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:35.781
by is how he's put it on us he's like you
know he had remember this is his campaign

00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:35.862
ad these are not accidents these are not random
people that are speaking out okay they choose

00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:36.001
these clips to put in the ad so they have
the black lady from Michigan saying oh he's

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:36.171
too busy he can't run for President no no
no he can't be bothered he's got his comfortable

00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:36.631
slippers on you gotta do it it's on you okay
so all this time he hasn't been fighting for

00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:36.881
us but now he can't be bothered to run his
own campaign by the way why did they put that

00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:36.881
in there because it seems like such a like
curious thing if you're just an outsider you

00:04:36.652 --> 00:04:36.902
don't know politics the reason they put that
in there it's because to deflect criticism

00:04:36.682 --> 00:04:36.932
from the Republicans who've been saying that
President Obama's too distracted he's doing

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:36.951
his brackets and he's golfing too much etc
as your about to see in an ad right and immediately

00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:39.781
the RNC came out in a statement and said oh
the President is launching his campaign in

00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:44.272
the middle of Libya blah blah blah blah blah
you it always whenever he launched his campaign

00:04:44.272 --> 00:04:47.061
he'd be in the middle of blah blah blah blah
blah he's the President is he supposed to

00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:52.071
go say to the whole world excuse me excuse
me I'm going to let you finish in a little

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:56.932
bit whether it's the Libyan war the Japan
nuclear reactors the economy or whatever but

00:04:56.932 --> 00:05:00.701
first I gotta announce my campaign and the
world stops they're like yeah okay okay now

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:04.441
we can resume no he's gotta do it in the middle
he's the President so the reason I bring that

00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:11.101
up is there's always unfair Republican criticism
don't bother responding to it with things

00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:17.171
like this and but that's probably the reason
Barack Obama isn't even in the ad it's because

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:21.381
they're like oh no no no the President didn't
have time to do an ad oh no no no he's not

00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:24.511
filling out his brackets you know what he
did he wouldn't throw out the first pitch

00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:29.121
because he was so scared of that criticism
stop being scarred of criticism you're going

00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:34.022
to lose the election this way the young guy
in the ad he says oh I couldn't vote for him

00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:37.451
before but now I'm so excited I can't wait
to vote for him really what are you excited

00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:42.981
about I read an article about how the youth
vote is incredibly disillusioned because they

00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:47.781
actually dared to believe in two thousand
eight that we were going to change the system

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:52.992
and they now look at it and go what have we
changed I mean even the good stuff you know

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:56.332
if you like healthcare reform and you know
I'm mixed on it but if you like it they're

00:05:56.332 --> 00:06:03.302
like okay it got a little better but I still
have to buy private insurance and I'm still

00:06:03.302 --> 00:06:08.561
what did we change the system did we change
the system do you remember he talked about

00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:12.302
changing the way washington works he announced
an ad a campaign where they're trying to raise

00:06:12.302 --> 00:06:17.311
a billion dollars to get elected what change
what changed so and look that's not me talking

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:23.862
I'll always base it on the facts look at a
recent poll from the Washington Post in February

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:28.951
of two thousand nine of course a little after
the President got into office youth approval

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:34.671
rating eighteen to twenty nine year olds had
him sky high at eighty four percent now he's

00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:38.661
down to sixty three percent now look sixty
three percent is still a pretty good number

00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:44.731
but he lost twenty one percent and a lot of
even the sixty three percent they said yeah

00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:49.381
that might if you ask them if they had to
vote for Obama or someone else they're going

00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:54.181
to vote for Obama but they don't have to vote
are you enthusiastic about it and the answer

00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:58.401
is no so you know you can put a young kid
in there with pimples and freckles and be

00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:03.561
like yeah I'm so excited what are you excited
about what happened okay and then again the

00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:08.161
conventional wisdom he has a white guy from
North Carolina saying in the ad I don't like

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:11.871
everything Obama's doing or I don't agree
with it but you know I guess I'm going to

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:15.212
have to vote for him because the other side
is a bunch of lunatics you know that's the

00:07:15.212 --> 00:07:21.052
essence of the message why are you admitting
you got white guys in North Carolina who don't

00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:23.721
agree with you why because Washington says
so oh you should acknowledge it you should

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:28.881
acknowledge white people don't like you and
then afterwards stop man stop can you just

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:34.721
stop responding to them for one minute and
actually do things you believe in if there

00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:41.721
are in face things you believe in so to say
that I'm not overly impressed with the first

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:49.311
ad is a wild understatement at least he recognizes
the importance of latino voters that's the

00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:56.821
best thing I can say about 

00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:07.651
the ad
