00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.066
All of these items can be used to make some 
low cost bobbins

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:22.033
like these

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.066
in this instance I am going to show you how to 
make

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.033
a beaded bobbin

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.000
the wrapped bobbin

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.033
and the whittled bobbin

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.066
The beaded bobbin first - 

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:40.000
to start off, you need some kebab sticks or 
skewers

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.066
these ones here I got from the grocery store. I 
got 150 of them for $2.00 Australian

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.066
You also need

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.000
beads

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.033
pencil

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:58.000
scissors, hacksaw or blade to cut the skewer.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a ruler, some contact glue or general purpose 
glue that sticks wood as well as plastic.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.000
To start with you take the skewer

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.033
from the flat end you measure 11 cm

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:20.000
11 cm is just under 4 1/2 inches.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.066
Measure again because you can get two 
bobbins out of this length 

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.033
Again at 11 cm

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:30.066
now the end tip 

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.000
is wastage.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.033
The easiest way I have found, to cut these 
lengths

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:37.066
is to use my blade
0:01:37.066,0:01:37.000

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
score at the mark, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.066
which just means run the blade around it.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:48.000
and snap

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.033
That gives me an 11 cm length to work with.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:02:08.033
Add the beads to check how it looks

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:13.066
using your contact glue
0:02:13.066,0:02:13.033

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:17.000
put a reasonably sized dollup on the end.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now you want this bead to stick so you put a 
reasonable amount there.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.033
As you bring your bead up, 

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:29.033
turn it slightly, so that glue goes inside the 
hole.

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:32.000
Turn it around,  and do the same at the other 
end.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.033
Again, the two end ones are the ones you want 
to make sure are stuck well and truly.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.066
so add a bit of glue here

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:44.000
Bring it up, turning as you go

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.066
we want that glue well and truly stuck

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.000
bring the next one down

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.066
this one again you want a fair amount of glue 
there.

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:08.066
For exactly same reason you don't want those 
to move

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:11.066
Sit it down allow it to dry.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.033
You can do exactly the same

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:16.033
with these square beads

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:20.000
Next I am going to talk about are these two.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.033
These are made up of a larger bead for the 
head, 

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:29.000
the neck area, a smaller bead for the start of 
the body, 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.066
wrapping for the bodies and a larger bead at the 
end

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:39.033
Now the wrapping for the body is measured 
from a sheet of paper.

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:43.066
Just plain, ordinary paper that you print from

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:53.066
Measure between your bead and where you 
want it to be. In this case I did 5 cm

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:57.066
I'm thinking I should have gone 5.5 but that is 
personal choice

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
using a sheet of paper, I cut off a strip 5.5cm 
wide

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.066
Picked up one of my skewers, 

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:14.066
added a bit of glue

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:45.033
Picked up the paper and rolled it around the 
stick.

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:59.000
again using the glue

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:05.066
some of this over it

00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:08.033
or a small piece of wrapping paper

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:24.033
add beads

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Last but not least, are the whittled bobbins

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.033
These are probably the easiest to do.

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:33.033
You start with a length of dowel.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:40.033
I bought a 1.2mt length of dowel from the local 
hardware store. It cost me a $1.50

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:43.066
I cut that using the hacksaw

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:48.033
I cut that into 11 cm lengths

00:05:48.033 --> 00:05:53.033
I have then taken my bladed knife 

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:57.066
Scored at the end here

00:05:57.066 --> 00:06:04.000
marked it all the way around and then cut it 
either side

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.066
to make the grove that you can see here

00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:12.000
Then again, using the bladed knife

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.033
Scored around 

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:19.000
and again here

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And then came the easy part.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.033
I got the bladed knife at an angle, and I cut like 
this 

00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:33.066
turned it around

00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:38.033
and cut from the other end

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:40.033
it's not pretty

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:41.066
but your thread's covering that anyway

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:46.000
and if you wanted to, you could run a bit of 
sandpaper over that to smooth it out a bit more.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.066
quick, easy, cheap ways of getting some 
bobbins

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:55.066
I probably would add spangles to these 
particular ones,  because the dowel is extremly 
lightweight.

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:59.000
Whereas the beads added some weight to the 
skewers.
