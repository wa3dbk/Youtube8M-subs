00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.459
Hello,

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.630
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.630
[pause]

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.800
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.179
My passion for exfoliation, especially facial
exfoliation,

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.320
is simply based on exfoliation’s global
benefits for facial rejuvenation,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.499
prevention and control of acne breakouts and
its potential

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.359
to reduce certain precancerous growths.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.399
While I believe that gentle chemical exfoliation
consistently produces

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.130
better results than physical exfoliation,
both are important,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.629
and today’s episode discusses three at home,
low tech, simple

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.870
and easy physical exfoliation alternatives
to chemical exfoliation.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.920
First and most basic is gentle facial message

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.710
with a loofah type sponge, or even just a
washcloth.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.039
Try circular motions with gentle pressure
for a few minutes.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.420
Lubrication with a gentle cleanser will help
avoid irritation.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.890
As with all types of physical exfoliation,
the degree of exfoliation

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.110
will be directly proportional to how long
you do it,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.250
how much pressure you apply and how abrasive

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.110
the exfoliating instrument is, so go easy
and don’t over do it.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.500
Please remember that if a little is good,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.360
more isn’t necessarily better.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.119
Next, try using a cleanser with exfoliating
granules,

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.689
but make sure you choose one with round or
smooth granules,

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.090
not one with sharp, hard or angular particles
like crushed nut shells,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.549
which can be too sharp and abrasive and actually
damage your skin.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.549
T

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.799
his product, the Garnier Expert Exfoliator
Exfoliating Gel,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.530
caught my eye as I was looking at granular
cleansers

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.090
because while the exfoliating granules are
from the jojoba plant,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.780
they’re round so they’re more apt to be
gentle

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.430
with less potential to irritate.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.799
Other products to look for

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.380
are granular cleansers with polyethylene beads

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.490
which are also round and smooth, such as in
this Neutrogena product,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.810
Acne Stress Control.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.299
And last, but not for the faint of heart,
let’s talk about...

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.090
...shaving.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.580
After you shave your legs don’t you just
love how soft

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.910
and smooth they feel?

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.900
It’s not just from removing the hair

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.120
that they feel that way.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.010
It’s also because the razor has exfoliated

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.520
your skin, making the skin surface smoother.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.850
These are such good friends for your legs.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.850
Why can't they be

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.470
a good friend for your face?

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.800
So on the same note,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.550
why not consider gently shaving the skin on
your face!

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.310
You can use the same razor and cream you use
for your legs

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.900
in the shower, and in fact, shaving in the
shower

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.730
is even more gentle.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.850
And, if you have any facial hair, not to worry,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.780
shaving doesn’t make the hair thicker, coarser
or grow any faster,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.120
and if you need some reassurance

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.470
there are a bunch of DermTV episodes explaining
it.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.400
So the next time you leave your regular glycolic
exfoliant

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400
at home when you’re traveling, to maintain
your lustrous,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:16.250
smooth facial skin, try one of these simple
techniques.
