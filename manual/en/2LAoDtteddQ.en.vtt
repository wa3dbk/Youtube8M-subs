00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.640
A few weeks ago Wolfire decided to host another
fan interview.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.140
Where we pledge to answer the most popular
questions people had.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.009
Fortunately, the most popular question this
time around did not involve dancing in a kilt.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.780
It was a request for a tour of where some
of the game development magic happens.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.510
Without further ado, welcome everyone to
my humble little space.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.140
Here's a handful of passes that I've collected
at various game development conferences.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.140
And the path all the way from my bed to my
chair, represents my typical epic daily commute.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.980
I always keep the bagpipes handy, 'cause you
never know when you might need them.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.079
That thing on the door, is a Scottish Claymore
that I got for christmas from my uncle and

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.899
cousins' families.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.269
The walls are covered in childhood memories.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.749
Can you recognize any of the faces in this
photograph?

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:14.800
The back fell off my chair recently, so it's
now more of a stool.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.530
But it ends up forcing me to have better posture,
which is good.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.280
And here's where most of the videos are made
and the Meebo support is given.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.180
Up on the wall is inspiration just so I don't
fall asleep on a long work day.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.690
And here I am playing with the awesome scripting
David just put in trying to cook up the next

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.150
hot tech demo for Overgrowth.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.620
Uh-oh, looks like there's a live chat visitor
in distress. John to the rescue!

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
Ah the release date question, that's one we
definitely get a lot.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.410
Uh-oh, they're on to the fact that the beard
might be fading, which it has been.

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.140
Uh-oh my temper is starting to flare up, fortunately
I have a secret weapon.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.749
No, not a swig from my Meebo flask, I don't
want to do that in the middle of the work

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:26.480
week.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.430
Ah that's a little bit better.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.150
Now I can come up with a friendly response.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.879
So that's a little snapshot of my typical
day.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.879
We will continue to answer questions from
the fan interview if we find time.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.209
Be sure to keep track of us on the Wolfire
Blog.
