Hello everyone! This is Rina Takahashi.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.940
I am a magazine and salon model.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.220
Today I'm going to introduce my skincare routine.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.700
Actually, I had skin troubles with spots 3 years ago.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.840
At that time I had dry and oily combination skin.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.820
Then I was told some advise from a friend, who also had trouble with sensitive skins.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:52.600
She recommended me to use Orbis, and I did start to use them.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.540
After a year, my skin got much better and had no breakouts.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.460
Now Orbis is certainly my favorite.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.120
Today I want to show my skincare to who has the same problem that I did.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.060
First of all, what I do for my face wash is

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.740
"Oil Cut Hot &amp; Cool Gel" by Orbis.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.240
I use this for T-zone and around nose.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.220
This exfoliates and fixes oily skin.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.220
It's like cool gel, when you apply on to your skin.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.920
Then it gets warm as you gently massage on your skin.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.500
After that it cools off again.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.860
Wash away with water, you'll get smooth skin.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.520
This one was for T-zone and nose,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.280
next one, "Aqua Peeling Gel" by Orbis, 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.460
this is just cool,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:21.080
is also an exfoliator but more gentle.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.800
I use this for cheeks, foreheads, and chins.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.220
So I use different gel for each part of my face.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.980
After these two,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.840
I use a little bit of "Oil Cut Powder Wash", for the whole.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.280
This is also my favorite face wash, effective for spots.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.740
Take out a little, and add water to make a lather.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.460
I always use only my hand to do that.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.200
Finished with all these washing,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.100
I apply "Orbis Clear Lotion".

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.780
This is my face toner, applying on to the whole.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.080
After waiting for a few minutes,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.320
I put on the next one, "Orbis Clear Moisture".

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.340
This is my moisturizer.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.260
I don't use cream, skincare is simply just these two.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:08.960
Before makeup, it is the same thing, I only use these.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.180
Especially when I started using these, I felt my skin getting really better.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.740
Though I don' t have spots anymore, I'm still into these spot care series,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.520
I'm thinking of using different line by Orbis next time.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.840
I really love these.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.920
For the last thing, I want to show this supplement,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.240
hyaluronic acid by Orbis.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.400
I started this in last summer.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.820
When I had dull skin before photo shoots,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:03.400
I got this and my skin got bright and moisturized, also felt my oil balance fixed.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.940
This is my favorite, too.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.180
I take 2 per day.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.980
It won't taste bad so please have a try.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.740
That's all for my skincare routine.
