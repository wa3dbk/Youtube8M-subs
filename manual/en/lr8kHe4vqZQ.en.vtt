00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.600
Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight, featuring Zac, the Secret Weapon.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.200
Zac is a slippery melee disruptive tank who excels in the jungle, or in a solo lane. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
As a health based caster, Zac expends a portion of his current health to cast abilities. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.300
His kit allows him to dive head-first into a fight to lock down priority targets while soaking up damage for his teammates.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.800
To counter Zac’s health costs, let’s take a look at his death-defying passive: Cell Division. 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.900
Each time Zac hits an enemy with an ability, a chunk of himself flies off from his body. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.800
He can reabsorb these bloblets to regain a percentage of his max health. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.800
Enemy champions can also step on them to crush them.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.200
Cell Division also causes Zac to break into four bloblets upon death. 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.400
If any of them survive by the time he recombines, he will revive with a percentage of his max health, depending on how much damage the bloblets have taken.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.000
Stretching Strike punches all enemies in a target direction, dealing damage and slowing everyone affected.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.000
Players looking for damage in lane, or extra slow should max it first.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.400
Unstable matter causes Zac’s body to erupt, dealing damage to all nearby enemies based on a percentage of their maximum health. 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.300
This ability is on a notably low cooldown and allows Zac to constantly benefit from Cell Division while fighting. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.300
Elastic Slingshot allows Zac to launch himself to a target location after charging in the direction of your cursor. 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.300
The landing impact damages and knocks enemies back a short distance. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.900
Although this can be a long-range jump, a quick cast at short range is great for spell interrupts and damage.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.000
Let’s Bounce! is Zac’s ultimate. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.000
When activated he hops four times, damaging, knocking up, and slowing enemies he lands on, while he receives an accelerating speed boost. 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.100
Damaging a single enemy on multiple bounces has diminishing returns, and enemies can only be knocked up once.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.900
Even if he’s stunned or rooted, Zac will keep bouncing.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.400
When playing Zac in the top lane, he should be careful not to overextend to pick up bloblets from Cell Division. 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.700
Here Riven dashes in and punishes him for being out of position. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.900
Stretching Strike and Elastic Slingshot are great escape tools. Here Zac slows Riven just enough to leap out of range.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.300
When starting in the jungle, Unstable Matter is Zac’s greatest asset. 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.200
This allows him to clear wolves quickly, while the sustain from Cell Division prevents him from needing to use his Health Potions.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.500
When looking to gank from the jungle, charge Elastic Slingshot from the brush or fog of war. 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.100
Here Zac flings himself straight onto Orianna and follows up with Stretching Strike for the slow and kill. 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.000
Cell Division is a really good baiting tool. 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.200
Because Zac’s abilities cost a percentage of his current health, while the bloblets heal for a percentage of his maximum health, he’s able to survive by spamming his abilities. 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.200
This buys enough time to give Ryze the kill on Amumu.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.900
Elastic Slingshot’s long range opens up some unique gank paths. 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.900
Here are a few examples of ways you can surprise an enemy by leaping over large sections of terrain.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.200
While Cell Division is off cooldown, Zac has a little more leeway to dive past turrets and play aggressively. 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.100
After a successful gank onto Miss Fortune, two of Zac’s bloblets land at a safe distance, and he’s able to survive a normally fatal turret dive.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.100
With all his abilities combined, Zac is incredibly persistent and almost impossible to escape from. 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.600
He slows Lux with Stretching Strike, which allows him to hit Elastic Slingshot despite being rooted. 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.700
He follows up with Stretching Strike, and then hits Let’s Bounce! 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.000
The knockup and slow help his teammates catch up and he finally takes her down despite Lux’s suite of crowd control and shields.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.200
In a teamfight, Zac’s primary focus should be on disruption. 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.300
He spots Skarner and Xin Zhao coming in from the side, slows them down with Stretching Strike and then hits Let's Bounce! 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.000
The knockup and slow prevents them from following up on Cassiopeia and Zac’s team takes 3 kills for nothing.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.800
Zac can also play a damage role in teamfights. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
He charges Elastic Slingshot from out of sight. Stretching Strike into Let’s Bounce! takes down two. 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.200
Then he turns back for Jax. Stretching Strike and Unstable Matter take him down and Zac gets a triple kill in a three versus five.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.300
When building Zac, focus on a mix of damage and durability.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.900
Try Magic Penetration Marks, Armor Seals, Magic Resist Glyphs, and Ability Power Quintessences.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:49.800
For Masteries, try 9/21/0 focusing on Magic Penetration in offense, and general durability in defense. On screen here is an example jungling page.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.300
Flash, Smite, and Exhaust are great choices when playing Zac. These quickly allow him to quickly reposition and disable enemy threats.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.800
