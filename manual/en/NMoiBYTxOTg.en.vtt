In this episode of Minute GarageBand we're
going to show you how to create an mp3 formatted

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.260
file if you're using GarageBand version 10

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.900
In version 6 of GarageBand it was a simple
matter of choosing mp3 as the compression

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.100
format when you shared a file.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.800
This is no longer an option in version 10
where you currently have a choice of either

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.579
a compressed AAC or uncompressed AIFF formatted
file.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:29.220
Fortunately, once you perform a little setup
work in iTunes, creating an mp3 file only

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.420
adds one additional step to the workflow.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.580
Open iTunes, and then open its preferences.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.750
Click on the Import Settings button, and select
mp3 from the Import Using popUp menu (note

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.150
that you could also choose Apple Lossless,
or even WAV format, if either of those were

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.350
what you wanted)

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.740
And choose the desired quality from the Setting
popUp menu.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.170
click the OK button, and close the prefs by
clicking its OK button.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.220
You're now finished with the prep work, which
you won't have to do again, unless you decide

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.489
you want a different format.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.090
Now when you want an mp3 formatted file from
your GarageBand project choose Song to iTunes

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.520
from the Share menu, enter what ever identifying
information you wish, set the quality to "Uncompressed

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.249
(AIFF)," and click the Share button.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:27.219
The song will get mixed down, or bounced,
to a 2-channel stereo file as usual, and will

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.009
be added to your iTunes library.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.520
This is where the extra step comes in to play:
Right-click on the song and choose create

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.579
mp3 version

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:49.290
Once the new file is created we can get Info
on it and see that it is indeed an mp3, and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:02:05.909
to get at the file itself, right-click on
the name and choose Show in Finder.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.849
That's all we have for this episode

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.390
we hope you found it useful

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.280

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.420
So long.
