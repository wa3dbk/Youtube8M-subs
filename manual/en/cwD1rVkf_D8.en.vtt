00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.329
(barking)

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:02.729
Hey, stop!

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:05.130
That's my dress!

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.130
(barking)

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.540
Stop it.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.140
Stop it.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.740
Let go.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.740
(barking)

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.490
Hey, hey, puppy, give that back.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.750
What's gotten into you?

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.199
(barking and whining)

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.510
Sorry puppy, I don't speak dog.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.510
(barking)

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.390
Hey do you need to go outside?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.230
Hey, it looks like you need to go potty.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.230
Go out the doggie door.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.230
Go out the doggie door.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.590
Go out the doggie door.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.800
Oh please don't pee on the floor again.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.730
Please go outside.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.480
(barking)

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.840
Why are you peeing on the floor?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840
Ugh.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.600
Every day this week you've peed on the floor.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.540
Now next time you have to, have to, have to
use the doggie door.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.540
Okay?

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.540
Here kitty kitty.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.540
Come here.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.310
Oh you look so cute in your new kitty wig
and hair bow I just put on you.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.310
(meowing)

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.030
Lizzard, what's this little white foam on
your mouth?

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.760
Boy my pets are falling apart!

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.450
I'd better call in an expert.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.460
Bring, bring.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.310
Hey Sofia, is that you?

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.420
Hey Elsa, how's it going?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.690
Sofia, my pets seem to hate me.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.580
They're all acting up and just acting crazy.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.910
Can you come over and talk to them?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.910
(barking)

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.910
I can't play now.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.910
Come on, I'm on the phone.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.910
Oh yeah.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.650
It sound like you're having a lot of trouble.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.490
Don't worry I'll be right over.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.140
(Knock knock knock)

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.250
Come in!

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.360
Oh Sofia!

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360
Thank goodness you're here.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.070
Can you talk to my animals using your amulet
and see what's wrong with them.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.900
Of course, Princess Elsa.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.310
Happy to help.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.670
Oh little puppy why did you take Elsa's dress?

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.420
She's worn the same dress all week.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.980
Seriously, seven days in a row.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.560
I just wanted to put it in the laundry for
her.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.040
Kitty, why won't you let Elsa pet you?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.840
I think this fake wig on my head is really
scratchy and itchy.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.310
Oh I can see that.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.940
Let me take that off for you.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.940
There you go.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.940
Much better.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.220
You even look cuter too.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.380
Little doggie, come here, come here.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.310
Hey why are you keep peeing on the floor?

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.790
You really need to go outside and use the
doggie door.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.920
Well, I can't use the doggie door.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.500
Every time I try to use it my ear gets stuck.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.580
See Sofia.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.660
Watch this.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.400
Oh, my ear's stuck.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.960
Hey little lizard.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.450
What's that white foamy stuff at your mouth?

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.240
I have rabies!

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240
Rabies?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.740
I don't know if I'm familiar with that term.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.420
Is it a princess term?

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.540
No, no, no.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.030
Rabies is really bad.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520
Here, I'll show you.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520
(bite)

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520
Ow, my hand!

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520
You just bit me.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520
You just bit me.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520
Sofia, what's wrong?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.140
Why do you have a foamy mouth?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.450
I have rabies.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.760
You have rabies?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.500
Your lizard bit me!
