00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.000
now 
check it out western conference

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
this series seems very exciting, i expect.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
San Antonio Spurs of the best head coach Gregg Popovich.
this team is STILL strong this year.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
they got the best record of NBA in this regular season.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Dallas Mavericks of Dirk Nowitzki and Monta Ellis faces Spurs in the first round.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
objectively,it seems that Spurs is stronger than Mavericks, but if Nowitzki had done his best play, nobody knows the result.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
i expect Nowitzki's new fraud!
(in korea, Nowitzki's nickname is "SWINDLER")

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Houston Rockets created powerful 1-2 punch with James Harden after signing with Dwight Howard.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but Portland Trail Blazers has many 3pointers Lilard,Batum,Mathew and leader of team " Lamarcus Aldridge".

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the key point is like this :
"who defend James Harden's explosion?"
"who defend Damian Lilard's explosion?"

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this is one of the most expecting match-up.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
pitifully, because of rib bone injury,Andrew Bogut is out of team rotation lately.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
this is the serious problem.
maybe Jordan and Griffin will dominate the low post, and crash the board.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the key point is match-up between Chris Paul and Stephen Curry.
but the success of Curry and Thompson's 3pointer explosion is REAL key point, 
cause Jordan and Griffin will dominate the basket.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Oklahoma City Thunder of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant, the most powerful nominee of the MVP of this regular season,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Oklahoma City Thunder is very good team.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
their match-up Memphis Grizzlies is a very tight defense team with Marc Gasol.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but  Oklahoma City Thunder is a very tight defense team too! as you know.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
key point is like this :
"who and how defend Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
every series of western conference are big matches!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
let's finish preview of the nba playoffs 2014.
