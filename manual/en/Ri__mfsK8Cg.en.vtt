00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.100
&gt;&gt; [Background Music] On a campus of 50,000
students, sometimes it's difficult to stand

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.100
out, to be unique.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.099
But if you look close enough, passed all the
commotion, the flurry of activity, the hordes

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.520
of students, sometimes, you see something
truly distinctive.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.460
Meet identical twins Allie and Gabby Byres,
UT freshman that are recognizable in any crowd.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.360
&gt;&gt; We're not just everyone else.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.790
We don't blend in with everyone else, we stand
out, we both wear the same thing, we're more

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.070
individualized with being two than one 'cause
we're so the same.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.010
&gt;&gt; We dress alike everyday because we like
it and we feel like it strengthens our connection.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.550
Everybody says like we share the same brain,
I think it's true.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.899
Like, we're individuals but it just works
better together, there's always someone to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.899
look to.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.079
[Background Music] There was a period probably
like in middle school, in high school, just

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.840
trying things out where we're like, "Well,
let's try not dressing alike," but we didn't

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.840
like.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
It just wasn't us.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.100
&gt;&gt; You always have that best friend, you always
have that connection, and you won't ever lose

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.100
that.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.439
It's like--it's their way to make their way
through instead of like they have to get through

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.460
the hardness of it instead of--
&gt;&gt; But what happens when the roommates and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.240
best friends disagree?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.990
Well, that's pretty rare.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.939
&gt;&gt; We just want to avoid disagreement like
arguments, like dating.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.750
If we like the same guy, we're not going to
fight over him because then that just ruins

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.109
our relationship with each other.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.189
&gt;&gt; So why ruin that?

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.203
&gt;&gt; Now, we're like bouncing around the idea
that we could marry twins, and that'd be ideal.

00:01:35.203 --> 00:01:41.399
&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of people don't get, they're
like, "Why would you do that?

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:42.759
You're two individual people."

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course we're individual people
but we just like being together.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.009
&gt;&gt; You're so similar to someone else, why
would you like try and get away from that?

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.090
Why would you push away a best friend?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.880
If everybody had a twin, the world would be
so much better.
