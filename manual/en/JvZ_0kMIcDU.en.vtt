This is a video on how to replace the bushing on patio door handles.

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:07.553
Remove the top and bottom screws to  remove the handle from the door.

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:15.976
Loosen the screw in the center of the bushing to remove the handle.

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:24.845
Use a small, flat-tipped screwdriver to carefully pry off the c-shaped retainer.

00:00:27.223 --> 00:00:32.031
Use the screwdriver again to carefully pry off the metal plate.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.488
Watch out for the metal spring that will 
 fly off when you remove the plate.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:42.890
With the retainer, plate and spring off, you can now remove the bushing.

00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:50.057
The replacement spring, plate and retainer will be the same, but 
 the new bushing will be metal instead of plastic.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.455
Let's get the old parts out of the way and install the 
 new metal bushing through the hole in the escutcheon plate.

00:01:05.568 --> 00:01:13.632
Next, we're going to take our spring and scrunch it on a screwdriver as tight as 
 we can, so that it will be easier to fit onto the escutcheon plate.

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:27.709
Carefully set the spring in place.

00:01:28.113 --> 00:01:36.096
This is easiest if you set both ends of the spring in 
 place and squeeze the rest of the spring in place next.

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:53.280
Hold the spring in place with one hand and with the other, line up 
 the tabs of the metal plate with the notches on the bushing.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:02:01.170
Make sure that the tab on the outside of the plate is 
 facing down and is lined up with the screw hole.

00:02:01.603 --> 00:02:06.050
Push the metal plate down until it sits 
 below the groove on the bushing. 

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:12.040
Take the retainer and push it into place over the plate.

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:14.130
It should fit into a groove on the bushing. 

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:21.020
Make sure the open side of the retainer faces to 
 the side, not to the top or the bottom.

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:27.140
Reinstall the handle by tightening the screw in the bushing.

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:33.070
When you're done, reinstall the handle on the 
 door the same way you removed it.

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:41.430
