Hey my Sweet V's, it is The Sweetest Vegan here. Welcome back. 

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:08.707
I'm back from my hiatus and guess what 
 else is back; Season 2 of Blue.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:13.380
It is one of my favorite shows here on YouTube from 
 a channel called WIGS and that whole channel 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.622
is amazing, but this show in particular will have you 
 like week to week to week.  

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:22.489
Oh my gosh, I can not wait for the new episode. 
 And they are coming out with so many more episodes.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.474
Like 20 something episodes.

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:29.596
And the character, even though you have nothing in common 
 with her, you have everything in common with her

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:33.878
at the same time. So in honor of Blue, 
 we will be making Blue Blueberry Cupcakes.

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:38.197
And they are going to be naturally dyed blue 
 with blueberries and this is just all amazing.

00:00:38.197 --> 00:00:42.910
I'm back. Blue is back. Blue cupcakes are awesome. Blueberries are awesome.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.601
All naturale is awesome. It is all amazing. Let's get started.

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:53.290
Vegan Blue Blueberry Cupcakes/ Muffins Recipe

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.494
So first we are going to start by making the blue dye itself. 

00:00:56.494 --> 00:01:02.880
Now this is a natural dye so to a saucepan, you are going to 
 add in blueberries, a little bit of sugar, and a little water.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.358
Over medium heat, bring that up to a high simmer slash 
 boil until the blueberries start to break open 

00:01:09.358 --> 00:01:12.957
and everything turns like this high violet, reddish color.

00:01:12.957 --> 00:01:16.045
Now I know you are thinking, "how is 
 red going to turn a cupcake blue?"

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:20.514
Don't worry about it, it's science. I don't know how 
 it works either. So let's keep it moving.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:24.384
Preheat the oven and then we are going to 
 start to whisk together our dry ingredients.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:31.959
I have unbleached all purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.920
Whisk that all together and then grab a second bowl, 
 so that we can whisk together our wet ingredients.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.050
We have raw sugar, almond milk, canola oil, 
 vanilla extract, and apple cider vinegar. 

00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:50.740
Add your wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and 
 use a spoon to stir it all together.

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:57.860
Mine was a little lumpy, but don't over stir it because we 
 still have to add in our blue dye/ blueberry syrup.

00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:01.350
I love how they are one. They come together as one. 

00:02:01.347 --> 00:02:08.920
I love that. At first I only added a 1/4 cup of blueberry syrup, 
 but just for insurance, I went ahead and added a whole 1/2 cup.

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:13.670
Use an ice cream scooper to evenly distribute 
 your cupcake batter throughout a cupcake tin.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:19.410
And then bake those in the oven that has been 
 preheated to 350 degrees F for about 20 minutes.

00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:23.940
Just looking at this cupcake, it is so fun. 
 It's the stuff dreams are made of. 

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:28.400
It's a blue cupcake with actual blueberries and blueberry juice inside of it.

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.820
It is infused with blueberry goodness. Who doesn't like berries.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.320
It is so awesome. I really love this cupcake. It take amazing. 

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:44.700
It has a little bit of vanilla. It has a little bit of blueberry. 
 A lot of sweetness and just that carbiness that we just crave.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:51.040
And it's a cupcake. It's a little personal cake just for 
 my desires. And the topping, tops it off perfectly.

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:56.560
Just like the name suggest. It is this wonderful last grasp at bliss.

00:02:56.565 --> 00:03:02.670
It captures it and it puts it in your mouth and 
 you enjoy it in your stomach. It's so so good.

00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:06.430
I am just excited. I am excited about this 
 cupcake. I am exited to be back. 

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:11.010
And most importantly, I am excited about Blue. Season 
 2, March 15. It's going down. 

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:15.880
We are going to see more layers of Blue-ness unfold. 
 Kinda like this cupcake, just blue, blue blue.

00:03:15.884 --> 00:03:19.970
All of her little qwerks in life. And I 
 want to see her pull it all together.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.870
I want to see what happened to her son. I want to see what 
 happens with that guy. I want to see what happens with her mother,

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:29.330
because she was off and I want to see 
 what happens with that lady at her job.

00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:34.080
So all of it will hopefully be answered in 
 season 2 and I can not wait.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:38.450
