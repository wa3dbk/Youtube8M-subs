00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.510
In this clip we're going to be talking about
controlling volume on a Hammond. The, the

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.360
very first thing, and the most obvious thing,
is the volume pedal. This pedal works just

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.589
like an accelerator, the farther down you
push it, the louder it gets. So, you just

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:30.979
use this for basic swells.
That's your first method of, of volume control.

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:35.690
Pretty simple. Now, the volume pedal is not
the only way to control volume, and really,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.610
if you want to be smart about making your
sounds blend, you'll use this second technique

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.120
as well, which is really, each one of these
draw bars is a volume for that particular

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:56.450
draw bar. Right? So, when you're, when you're
rocking the big low stuff, you know. But you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.579
want to also, we'll go back to this preset
so you can, you also want to have a high,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:11.620
kind of quiet sounding... Now, let's make
it a little bit. So you want to use those

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.540
two sounds together. Obviously, this is way
louder than this is right now, but you need

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.551
to, you know, to get the right blend you,
you have these guys further up. So, you know,

00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:31.680
you pull these guys up together, you're going
to get the same sound, just quieter, so. In

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.790
fact, then now, this guy's, these guys are
a little bit quiet, so. So those, those two

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.450
matches up together, so really the volume
control is just as much about the draw bars

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.630
that you're going to be using as it is the,
just using the volume pedal. The third way

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.960
to control volume is through this fancy switch,
called the "volume switch". It just toggles

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.141
you between the normal volume, which is what
I've been playing at, and soft volume. And

00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:02.250
really I would only use this for when you're
playing by yourself or just practicing or

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.500
anything like that, because you already have
the other control, it's just, that just keeps

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.610
it softer so, you know, so that neighbors
don't complain.
