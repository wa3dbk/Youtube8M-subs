00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.490
[Nancy Haug - BLM Northern California District Manager]
Hi, I'm standing in the Twins Peaks Herd Management Area in Northern California.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.120
This is the largest wild horse and burro management area in BLM California.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.840
This summer we're planning a gather to bring in excess horses and burros because we have too many on the range

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.970
right now and it's not healthy for either the horses, the burros, or the range that they live on.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.790
We manage for a lot of uses out here.  Horses and burros are one of them,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.520
as well as cattle and public recreation and so it's important to make sure that we balance

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.500
all of these uses and make sure that we're taking care of the land that we're in charge to manage.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.270
Today we're going to take you around and show you some of the herd management area.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.050
We'll show you some of the areas that wild horses and the burros like to live, where they range,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.660
what they eat.  We might even be able to see horses and burros today, that's our plan.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.390
[Male Voice with view of range and mountains in background]
Straddling the Nevada-California border,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:04.690
about 120 miles north of Reno, Nevada, this rugged, high desert landscape, provides important habitat for wild horses and burros and wildlife.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.740
It also provides forage for domestic livestock grazing that is an important part of local economies.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:22.590
The appropriate management level for the Twin Peaks herd management area is 448 to 758 wild horses and 72 to 116 wild burros.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.000
The current populations are estimated at 2,300 wild horses, about 5 times the appropriate management level

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.390
and 280 wild burros, about 2 times the appropriate management level.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.900
At almost 800,000 acres, the region is vast but its resources limited.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.950
In fact many parts of this rugged looking landscape are fragile and require careful management.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.260
[Jennifer Mata - BLM Ecologist]
We're standing here on the edge of Twin Peaks herd management area.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.490
Wanted to show you the perennial grasses that are out here and explain a little bit too why they're important.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.300
So before me is some crested wheat grass, and you'll see that it's critical, it's good forage for wild horses and burros.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.660
It also serves as thermal cover for a lot of the smaller species that we have; birds and lizards and things like that.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.060
 It serves also as a purpose of keeping the soil in place.  It helps to bind the soil particles

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.890
together for the root system and also shields the soil particles from rain drop impact.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.350
In this part of the HMA things are higher in elevation so we end up with more production.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.050
These perennial grasses that you see behind me are plentiful and can provide more forage per acre,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.400
whereas other parts of the HMA are lower elevation and end up with approximately 30 acres per one horse a month,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.040
and we'll show you that a little later when we get to one of those spots.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160
So here we are in a lower elevation area of the Twin Peaks HMA and while it certainly is beautiful,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.110
looks can be deceiving.  This area here would take about 30 football fields or 30 acres to support one horse per month.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.410
It comes out to be a lot of country when you consider we want about 500 horses in the HMA.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.880
There are other uses out here as well such as pronghorn, mule deer and permitted livestock grazing.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.840
[Male Voice with horses in the background]
The horses and burros are healthy, and much of the range appears to be healthy as well.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.070
A closer look however reveals that some areas are showing signs of stress,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.810
requiring management actions, including reducing the wild horse herds.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.710
Limited water and the needs to keep water sources healthy are the primary management concerns in Twin Peaks.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.030
[Jennifer Mata - standing in a creek]
So we're at Painters Creek now.  This is an area that we would call functioning at risk during our riparian assessments.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.790
Some of the indicators here as to why things are not properly functioning, you can see the sluff banks here -

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.930
this is due to trampling from livestock and horses when they come down in.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.240
If the right type of riparian vegetation isn't here, the root system isn't stable enough to hold the soil in place.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.880
You'll actually get it sluffing off, destabilizing the banks and also causing a decrease in water quality.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.000
So there are several reasons why we want to keep riparian areas from becoming this degraded,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.630
while we want to see them in proper functioning conditions and not functioning at risk.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.500
That includes for the health of the wildlife that uses the area, as well as the health of the twin peaks horse herds.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.270
It's important to keep this water system available and functioning year-round since water is such a limiting factor in these area environments.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.170
 So this is an example of a properly functioning riparian area.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.290
Some of the indicators that you would look for would be riparian species covering the banks,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.250
which is what you see here, aquatic vegetation throughout the stream channel.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.340
Clear water that can support wildlife such as the fish, the minnows, that you see in the creek behind us,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.600
as well as stabilized banks.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.090
[Male Voice - view of creek in background]
Visited during the spring, much of the Twin Peaks area

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.890
appears vibrant and green.  But this situation changes over the course of the summer.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.170
Hot weather and the lack of rain reduce the amount of forage available for range animals,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.390
including wild horses and burros.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.860
To keep ranges healthy, the BLM must balance uses at sustainable levels.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.980
Livestock are managed in specific areas and allowed on the range for designated grazing seasons.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.290
In response to resource conditions the BLM and ranchers have reduced

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.400
livestock numbers by about 50 percent compared to 30 years ago.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.940
Wild horses and burros use the range all year, therefore herd populations must be maintained at sustainable levels.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:36.780
Balancing uses is part of the BLM's multiple use mandate and responsibility on the public lands.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.500
[Jack Hanson - Lassen County Supervisor]
The wild horses are an integral part and an important part of

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.500
that diversity that's found out on the ranges.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.750
However if their numbers are allowed to increase without management then eventually

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.330
it will come to damage not only the resources and the other uses on the ranges but the wild horses themselves.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.050
[Frank Hall - Biologist, California Department of Fish and Wildlife-retired]
Twin Peaks has always

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.880
had the ability to carry some horses.  When numbers get very, very high, you can really run into problems.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.200
What in effect happens is more animals end up being at risk and there can be a setup for

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.980
catastrophic losses either from a long term drought or heavy snow.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.990
[Nancy Haug - BLM Northern California District Manager]
You know we're proud of the fact that we

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.950
have healthy wild horses and burros on the Twin Peaks herd management area.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.710
It's important to us to be proactive and make sure that we keep the horses and burros within an appropriate management level.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.080
Therefore we come out and every few years we have to remove the excess horses and burros

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.260
and that helps us ensure that the horses and burros remain healthy as well as the range lands that they like to roam on.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.100
The wild horse and burros that we remove off the Twin Peaks herd management area all go to good homes.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.420
Some of them are adopted out, they are very popular for their size and their health and

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.780
some of them go to long term pastures.  It's important to BLM that these wild horses and burros

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.900
do end up in good homes or in the long term pastures where they can spend the rest of their lives.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.280
As public land managers our job is to manage wild horses and burros on the range

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.250
to keep both the horses and burros healthy as well as the range lands and we welcome

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.540
and encourage your involvement in that work.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.650
It takes all of us together to make sure that we're doing the right thing by the horses and the burros and the land.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:31.220
