Okay, so in order to cut the glass you need
a glass cutter, but in order to break that

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.320
glass after you cut it, you need a, you are
probably going to want to get some pliers.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.070
So what I mean by that, is that all the glass
cutter does is score the glass, that is to

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.060
say it kind of provides a very shallow crack
along which the glass will break when you

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.110
break it but it doesn't you know, cut the
glass apart the way a razor blade does or

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.010
something. It just kind of scores the glass
with a thin crack and then you have to break

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.480
that glass in a controlled manner. There is
a few ways to do it, you can do it with your

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.399
hands, you can do it on the table, we will
go through some of those methods. One way

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.540
to do it is with pliers, now, so one of the
sets of pliers that you get should be a set

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.250
of breaking, glass breaking pliers and if
you go to a stained glass supply store you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.210
will be able to find some. What they, the
thing that makes them breaking pliers is if

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.769
you look at tip, see how the tip comes together
at an angle? Right, the tip is not, the two

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.740
sides of the pliers don't come together parallel,
or come together flat, they come together

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.560
at an angle. Furthermore, this particular
set of pliers I like has kind of this sort

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.070
of rubber kind of shoe, this kind of protective
rubber, kind of on top of the metal which

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.219
allows you to get a firm grip but it still
provides a little bit of kind of protection

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.810
of digging into that glass or maybe cracking
that glass even more. So you don't need to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.049
have those, that sort of rubber housing on
the tips but I like it. And in this particular

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.880
set of breaking pliers, it also has a stop
screw here where, depending on where you set

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.000
it you can, so if I have it in all the way,
you see it kind of goes kind of through there,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.670
now my pliers won't close any more than that,
so that can be helpful if you are working

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.189
with glass of different thickness, you just
sort of put your glass in there and then turn

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.840
this until it tightens up so no matter how
much you squeeze you are not going to be putting

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.390
any more pressure on the glass but you can
imagine if I have the glass scored and you

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.509
know I have it in like this, I don't need
a lot of pressure all I really need to do

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.530
is just kind of bend down and if there is
any kind of a score line there my glass will

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.230
break and we are going to go through that
technique so don't worry about it just yet.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.370
So that is your breaking pliers and in the
next clip I am going to talk about the other

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.530
pliers which are used for grozing.
