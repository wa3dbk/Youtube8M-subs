00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.130
Now I think you still, whether you are being
directive or not, I think you still got to

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.900
do step five.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.090
This is another one of those areas I touched
about earlier I have difficulty with because

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.210
this is a small step, this is not big.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.880
But when you think about a little bit, we
invest so much in this planning effort.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.810
But lot of managers fail to be as rigorous
in asking the representatives if they are

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.500
serious, if they will try it, if they are
committed.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
It isn't complicated.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.590
I think you just got to look at them in the
eyes and say," Maybe you can go easy at first.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470
You can start with fun later."

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.000
What do you think?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.940
Now that's not very specific commitment.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.340
What do you think- will it work?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.060
Is it worthwhile?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.820
Can you do it?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.750
One more question, we will let you do it.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.950
That's what you are trying to smoke out.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.530
That's what you are trying to get to is that
sense of obligation, that deep sense of commitment,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.570
and you have got to hear it.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.570
That's my mistake.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.450
I assume I get commitment or I listen to lots
of tapes I hear managers giving that commitment

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.880
rather than soliciting.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.140
You know this in sales, it's asking.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.470
It's asking for the business, it's asking
for the sales .That's practicing what we already

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.869
know in the field force and that is get the
damn close!

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.880
So I think in coaching we have to be the same
way.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.909
Now this doesn't take a lot of time, just
what do you think, can you do it?

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.880
Will you do it?

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880
Listen to the response.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.799
I have asked that question many many times
in my own organizations and it's funny sometimes

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.610
how hard it is to get a clear answer to those
three questions.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:04.250
Hard to get a clear answer so I just stick
with it, crystallize that commitment 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.979
a little bit
