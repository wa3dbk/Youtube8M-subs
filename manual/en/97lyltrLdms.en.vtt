00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:24.679
We were first introduced to Critical Illness at an agents' meeting in 2003. We all thought
that, "Wow, this product is really too good

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:33.589
to be true". In the event of a diagnosed illness
it would pay out the lump sum that you bought

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.940
and that lump sum could be used towards any
expense that you would incur while you were

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.160
ill. I started contacting some of my key clients
and the first one that came to mind was a

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.690
client by the name of Marie. Marie was a very
driven business owner, very focussed, and

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.620
took care of everything around her but she
felt that she was invincible. We applied for

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.470
the product and it came back with a rating.
She had a mother that had died of cancer.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.380
Her father was a diabetic. These illnesses
that are covered in the product are mostly

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.540
illnesses that are hereditary. So she was
at a higher risk because these illnesses were

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.540
contained in her family. So I convinced Marie,
you need to take this policy because of the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.860
rating. This just means that you're at higher
risk. So Marie purchased the policy. In May

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.829
2010, Marie called me to let me know that
she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.509
I explained to Marie that there would be a
claims rep from our Life department that would

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.509
give her a call and walk her through the things
that she need to provide our Life department

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.950
to get this claim paid out. When the claims
rep first contacted her, their first questions

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.510
were: "Marie, how are you feeling? How are
things going? Where are you at? Are you still

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.510
working?" That was very surprising to Marie
because she thought it would be straight business.

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.709
Marie shared with me her first day of her
first chemo treatment. She walked into the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.709
hospital room. There were about 15 chairs.
They were big Lazy Boy chairs and they were

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.610
all full but one. And Marie knew that that
was her chair. There was a couple sitting

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.870
next to her and the gentleman had left the
room on several occasions. He was leaving

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.870
the room to check the parking meter. He didn't
have the funds to pay for a parking ticket.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.010
Marie was thinking, if this couple would have
a Critical Illness policy, they could really

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.010
concentrate on getting better and on her health
and not on the financial burden that the illness

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.110
had brought on. Marie had decided to continue
working for just mental reasons, to keep her

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:37.799
focus on the right things or the more productive
things versus her illness. Marie knew that

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.340
she wasn't forced to stay home or she wasn't
forced to go to work. Having that policy gave

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.340
her the flexibility and the freedom to do
whatever she chose to do. A few months later

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.620
Marie gave me a call and it was a very happy
day for her as she had just gotten the news

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:08.849
that she was cancer free. She said, "Alicia,
you know, I got the best treatments, the best

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.459
physicians that looked at my file, I was diagnosed
with cancer, I didn't die and I received these

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.720
funds for the two policies that I bought.
She said, "Geez, it's almost too good to be

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.720
true." And I explained to her, "Marie, that's
the purpose of critical illness. You need

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.390
to survive your illness." And luckily, Marie
had a 92% cure rate, but having these funds

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.860
in her hands got her to focus on her recovery
and not the illness. As a Co-operators Financial

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.860
Advisor, I do not want to have it on my conscience
that I didn't do my job and offer this product

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.860
to my clients. People ask me why I hold this
product so close to my heart and I am so passionate

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.720
about it. Well the reason is, I am Alicia
Marie Leblanc and this is my story.
