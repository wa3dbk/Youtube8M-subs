00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:08.349
The Rokenbok Factory is open for action!
Because when the building is done, the fun has just begun. . . 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.989
My crew is pretty fast.

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.389
Faster than my crew?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.570
There's only one way to the find out.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.500
The first crew to pick-up, dump, load again,
and then deliver a payload to the tower wins.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Ready Crew?
Ready Crew??
Ready, Set, GO!

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Watch Out!

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Faster!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
Now to the tower, hurry!

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
It’s neck and neck!

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Yeah! Woohoo!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.080
Good job, everyone.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.430
Because both crews worked so hard, everyone 
can take the rest of the day off and just play.
Yay!

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.960
