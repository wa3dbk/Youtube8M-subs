00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.240
Yeah I could spend time thinking about a really cool nickname or I could just

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.190
enter something silly and then eventually

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.450
I just became Bunny and if I could go back in time and change it I probably would but, yeah.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.850
I'm Bunny.  What can you do?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.620
Winning to Gfinity, I guess, at the start of August against Hyun in the finals was so awesome.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.650
It was the first time I won a big tournament, and I got a trophy also.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.590
In second place would probably be 2012 right after I started playing full time.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.580
I qualified for IeSF in Korea and I won a trip to Korea

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.550
and I got to go through Korea.  I've always wanted to go.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.120
KT because it has Flash, would probably be pretty good.  (laughs)

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.500
It happens once in a while. Mostly it was because there was this really good GSO group in the middle of the day

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.000
that I really wanted to watch.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.140
I try not to regret things because it's a negative emotion and it's not really productive in any way.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.559
But working a bit harder at my StarCraft skills there has been a period where I'ev been pretty lazy.

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:10.890
Now I do video games, not sports

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.930
No broken bones for me.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.180
I think eSports is sSports. It is what it is.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.659
When I was younger I really wanted to play the guitar

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.000
but I never really got started. I was really good at Guitar Hero, though.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.240
One thing in my entire life. Maybe pizza I guess?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.440
I guess you can put different toppings on the pizza so it could be pretty different, right? 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.000
Koreans don't really party that much but I guess a few.  Jaedong can get pretty hyped.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.920
And StarDust sometimes is always really nice.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.520
I would definitely have an easier time if I was a pro at something like DOTA2 it League of Legends

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.560
especially because everyone plays that.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.380
StarCraft 2, there is not that many Danish people who know about it.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.000
So it would give me an easier time but I couldn't enjoy anything as much as I enjoy Starcraft.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.400
Well I have something in-game related stuff. 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.500
Like, usually, in StarCraft when I'm ahead I tent to lose my head and do some really stupid stuff.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.680
Just today against TaeJa, loaded up all my stuff in my medivacs when I was ahead and flew into his marines and his main.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.200
It wasn't so smart.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.280
He's gota siege - all of his tanks right now, stemming the marines!

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.240
TaeJa runs straight into tanks, not able to siege in time. 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.060
The monitor? No. The keyboard might have gotten a few punches.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.870
Occasionally there were times where I have been on a losing streak wrapped in a losing streak

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.049
but never the monitor. That's too cracked out.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.330
Probably the smartest thing would be to take an STV so I could build my own base on an island.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.250
I could build my own civilization from one STV.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.819
Well, I go jogging from time to time, so there is still that but apart from that

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.000
but apart from that I don't know what I would spent my time on.
(laughs)

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.110
If I were to have a pet myself I would probably have a dog. 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.000
They seem more happy, more loyal.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.550
Maybe anime show openings.  I listen to those a lot.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.000
Specifically the one to "No Game No Life." I listen to the opening almost every time I have

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
an important match to pump myself up.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So if I could choose one song that would probably be it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Chocolate cake.  Not even close.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Probably play video games as sad as it sounds.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.690
Yeah, thatâ€™s probably what I did.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.430
No, not that I can remember.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.740
Maybe I did once steal some small things when I was a little kid but not that I can remember.
