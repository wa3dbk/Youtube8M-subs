00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.109
Hi Everyone! It's Katie! I hope having a wonderful day.

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.259
Today I am beginning a new series, and it will be ongoing,

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.490
and that is an exercise, workout, ballet, barre,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.509
strengthening, everything type series.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.630
This is something you've all been asking for, so I'm thrilled to be able to share

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.820
it with you, and I really hope it helps. So today's video

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.630
is fee and pointe work strengthening. I know all of you are preparing for your summer courses

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.090
and are panicked to get in shape. I know. I had been there, trust me!

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.850
So I really hope that this works for you.
But I do need

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.690
your input. After you watch this video,  let me know if you like the format because I'm considering

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.040
one of two options. The first option is

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.010
as the video is, where I sit down and show
you all the exercises and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.380
how to do them in a voiceover. And then you just go and do them

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.860
on your own time. The second option is as if you were doing a workout DVD.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.920
So you play the video, I sit down with you
in real time, and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.399
you follow along with me and come back to it as a workout

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.720
each and every time. So just let me know which one you like. Again, this is about making this work for you,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.360
and I hope you enjoy.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.460
The first thing you want to do is to
release the muscles in your feet.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.980
Like any other muscle you'll be able to
tone and strengthen the more if they are looser.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.870
So roll out your feet with a little
ball- mine's from a pet store.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.600
Make sure you get your arch, under your metatarsals and even at the base of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.210
your heel

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.180
to release your Achilles. You will need a theraband for the next set of

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.360
exercises. Place the theraband around your toes

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.510
and simply point and flex your feet ten times.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.910
Really roll through the balls your feet
to strengthen your metatarsals.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.490
Keeping the foot pointed, lift the toes ten times.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.119
Bending your knee, keeping the theraband
where it is,

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.530
just bend the ankle, leaving the toes flexed upward

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.050
15 times. Now repeat the same motion with the toes curled.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.640
Keeping the knee bent, roll through the foot.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.530
Again, try and only move from the ankle.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.459
Repeat this ten times. Now reverse the motion, scooping down

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.839
out, and up.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.980
Keeping the theraband over the toes, straighten the knee and lean forward to stretch the foot.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.620
You'll need some equipment for the next few exercises but I'll provide

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.260
Amazon links below. Standing on a
balance disc on one foot,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.239
find your balance for 30 to 60 seconds.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.260
This will really give your ankle
stability so during long Adagios, you won't

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.190
wobble around.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.410
If you don't have this balance disc,
you can use yoga mat with a folded up towel.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.700
While not quite as challenging, it will still
give you the same benefits.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.299
Next with a rock-board, stand in the
middle on one leg

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.380
and just find your balance. Then start
to rock back and forth

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.420
from the ball of the foot to heel. This 
will really give you calf strength as well as ankle strength

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.080
for pointe work and jumps.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.430
Now stand turned out and the rock-board.
These exercises you can do as much as you like

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.900
so there's no set reps.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.620
Begin with one leg in coupé and plié.
Hold the plié for a second and then just

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.220
keep bending and straightening.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.860
Bring the foot to the front in coupé

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.760
and do the same. Then alternate: back coupé

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.940
and change to the front. This is building
strength and stability

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.450
through balance. Now petit battement with a straight standing leg

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.359
and then hold a plié.

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.819
Now straighten the bottom leg and just
turn in and turn out

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.530
the working leg. You really want to have supporting leg

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.989
be very very still. The free leg should be moving entirely on it's own.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.190
Now for the tricky part. Balance on half-toe right in the center of the rock-board.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.730
Just hold as long as you can with correct form.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.069
This might be self-explanatory but make
sure you do every exercise

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.739
on both legs. And now for some pointe work. I would do each

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.540
exercises eight times. Beginning in first position,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.390
just plié and relevé. While this is
very simple

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.730
make sure your rolling through your feet- every single bone

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.130
because that is going to build the strength for pointe work.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.130
Now relevé with straight legs.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.720
Make sure you're really rolling through the whole foot. Try not to cheat!

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.229
Adjust a bit and now you're just going
to relevé with the toes-

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.489
down to the metatarsal and back up.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.610
And now for a classic: plié, roll up through the feet, straighten the knees

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.690
and roll down. Repeat this, as every other
exercise

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.820
eight times, and then reverse it: roll up
on straight legs

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.020
plié over your shoes, and then really roll through your feet coming down.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.100
Now repeat just the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.410
plié relevé and the straight-leg
relevé on both feet.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.770
8 times. I know it's hard but try not to
cheat by using your arms.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.690
The more you do this exercise correctly,
the faster you improve.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.350
Standing 5th position, now wrap your foot

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.100
around the ankle like sur le cou-de-pied.
But really lead

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.620
with the little toes back. This is going
to train your foot to come off the floor correctly

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.979
every single time. Make sure when you're doing this exercise that you don't pronate

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.430
when you put the foot back down the
floor. As you can see my fifth

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.800
isn't exactly perfect, but I'm not rolling on
that front foot.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.389
To train your feet to be in a beautiful
shape, tendu front

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.520
and lean over the foot like a stretch. Come back to tendu and repeat,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.960
and dégagé your foot off the floor, and see if you can hold

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.400
that position. This exercise is about
muscle memory.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.860
The more your feet remember these
beautiful shapes, the more they will do

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.800
them automatically.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.860
Repeat this exercise side and back.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.860
And when doing the back, make sure your
heel stays down.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.320
For another muscle memory exercise,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.499
tendu front and only come halfway back to fifth.

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.550
Repeat this about 8 times front,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.430
side, and back. Again this is about
training your foot

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.330
to always come in and go out beautifully.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.780
And now for my favorite foot stretch that you can do every day: cross one foot over the other.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.550
Put all your weight on the toe. This completely stretches the arch

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.930
as well as the shin.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.240
So there you have it! Those are all my favorite exercises to do for pointe work and my feet.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.430
So I really hope this helps you out.
Again, I do need your input.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.419
If you liked this option with a
voiceover or if you'd rather have it in

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:05.449
workout style where sit down with me and
follow along, please let me know in the

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:06.599
comments below.

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:09.610
Also if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.520
So I hope you all have a wonderful day,
and I'll see you soon!
