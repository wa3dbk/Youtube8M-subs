00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.040
Welcome back guardians. With the release of
the House of Wolves comes a massive 86 new

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.320
grimoire cards, with an insane amount of lore.
Today we are going to cover how Skolas, the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.309
wolf kell, escaped from the Prison of Elders
to form an uprising, that we battle in the

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.820
new DLC.
Our starting point is grimoire card “Prison of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.019
Elders, The Reef- The Asteroid Belt”, where
the Hunter vanguard Cayde-6 tells a snippet

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.099
of the Reef wars, he mentions a battle known
as Eos Clash, where Skolas defeated one of

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.030
his fallen rivals. Even so, Skolas’s forces
took heavy damage from the assault and were

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.670
weakend. A civil war amongst the Fallen pursued
and the Queen sense the weakness of the fallen

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.899
houses and took the opportunity to seize control.
She now controlled the reef and had a number

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.610
of Fallen Nobility (including Skolas) and
servitors frozen in the prison, The Prison

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.260
of Elders. That is an extremely superficial
and brief recap of how the Queen came to power

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.469
and my next video will talk in greater detail
about the reef wars.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.500
So how did Skolas free himself from the prison,
well he didn’t, the Queen unknowingly freed

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.310
him. So if we look at the “ Ghost Fragment:
The Queen” an original grimoire card, the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.140
Queen sends Skolas to The Nine as a gift,
as gesture, as an apology. Because her brother,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.090
the Crow, master of spies, had his agents
digging around the Cauldrons of Rhea, Rhea

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.570
is Saturn’s icy moon. And quote “the nine
do not approve.” To say sorry for sending

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.890
spies to the Nine’s territory, she sends
Skolas as a gift. She also claims that winning

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.979
the reef was a “mutual victory”, and hence
a gesture was in order. Now up to this point,

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.970
we did not know how Skolas escaped, and it
was initially thought that he escaped in transit

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.509
to the Nine, but we now know that he in fact
reached the Nine.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.119
The “Mystery: fate of Skolas” grimoire
card says “The cell cracks open, Wolf Kell,

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.110
stumbles out and crashes to his knees. He
tries to leap at the creature before him,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.940
the shape in the fog, to show it why it should
be afraid. He looks up. At the tiny hood shape

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.360
before him. From beneath its hood, tiny fingers
of shadow probe the air” … who do we know

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.379
that wears a hood and has tiny fingers probing
the air? That’s right, it is Xur, Agent

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.239
of the Nine. This confirms that Skolas made
it to the Nine and did not escape in transit.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.519
“The ship will be yours” the creature
says. It hunches over itself as if burdened

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:47.939
by its own shape. If you speak, you will be
heard. I will go now. You are free.” Skolas

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.619
is freed by the Agent of Nine or by the Nine. He

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.930
tries to follow Xur but he mysteriously disappears,
he then makes his way to the Throne room of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.750
his newly acquired ship and plots a course,
now a free Wolf Kell.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.680
WOW! The Nine set Skolas free! There is more
