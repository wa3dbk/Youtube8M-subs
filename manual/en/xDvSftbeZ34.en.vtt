00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.710
Joe Camp

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.310
as an animal coordinator for film and
television in los angeles

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.920
Lauren Williams and Brian Hill

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.260
a professional dog trainers with eight
years experience .

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.570
teaching dogs to guard against intruders
and attack.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.250
 just how does the
physiology

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.450
a predator determine the manner and
power its attack ?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.809
the four varieties dogs in the show

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.809
answer that question.
 the Bulldogs mixes bite used his body

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.829
not only to wrestle the animal for the
ground to twisting his body

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.350
to cause more pain.
 the mastiff ...

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.609
not uses nothing, but its way

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.750
its attack was hit on slam into with his
body

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.040
get a group in down you go.
the Belgian Shepherd and Dutch Shepherd are very similar

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.750
in shape .

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.430
they draw the comparison between the
ancient gray wolf

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.060
and its larger cousin the direwolf

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.509
while being a lighter use the momentum or its speed and coordination

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.910
to down prey

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.270
I think the Dutch Shepherd combined all
the best rates

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.450
of all the different styles he hurled
himself

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.260
therefore getting momentum he opened his
mouth as wide as a good 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.440
got that good solid by his weight into

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.440
the prey just like the bigger dogs very
similar to modern wolf and probably the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.630
direwolf too .

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.880
after the more vigorous attack on the
Dutch Shepherd

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.030
hints at the advantage the direwolf had
over its lighter

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.610
great cousin it may have used its more
massive body

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.480
to take down larger prey the signs his
superior signs

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.930
the direwolves only other weapon which
is massive head

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.200
jock to determine how the size of an
animal's job affects the strength of his

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.670
bite

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.260
especially designed meter can be used it
will measure just how much power the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.480
bite

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.520
what we have here is a digital bite
meter and the sensor has a gap in it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.080
with the dog bites its close the gap

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.550
in the readout over her toes you hammer
how many pounds of force

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.550
the dog is applying each dog is lowered
into biting the meter

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.860
in a foursome that bite this measure
quickly a relationship between bites

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.840
strength and head size emerges.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.930
for example the Dutch shepherds head

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.050
is only slightly larger and the mound
yet it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.420
is much stronger but I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.190
with 195 of force

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.190
into maximo 224 right now it was
up to about 230 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.850
and as for the mastiff that's the best

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.990
wow! 556 that has

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.340
that's amazing. little more relaxed up

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.210
the numbers demonstrate that a slight
increase in the size of a dog's head

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.200
can yield a significantly stronger bite
this was undoubtedly true for the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.520
prehistoric wolfs

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.450
it's impossible to assign specific
numbers to the dire will smite but it

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.180
appears the direwolves larger head and
jaws

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.530
would have created a much stronger bite in
his great cousin

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.730
its powerful bite together with its
robust attack style

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.640
probably allowed I am to bring down much
larger prey
