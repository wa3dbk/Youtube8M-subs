was great to be here I really enjoyed
the course thanks  to mike

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.120
and the people around, it opened up my eyes

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.519
and the way actually I look at photography, I'd definitely come again

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.730
and i'd recommend anyone who's been watching his youtube videos 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.010
to come his workshops, and you might be lucky,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.650
he might buy you a cup of tea.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.020
does that make whats a block of focus smaller, 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.960
so we've got to be careful not to come too far forward

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.390
I

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.340
came on mikes workshop because I wanted to learn more about light and composition

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
and I've had a fantastic day and i'd thoroughly recommend it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.760
to anybody. what you see is what you get in his youtube videos.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.890
I think what mike has taught me today is 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.000
 how to think about the picture before I take it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.160
and how to move around and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.310
find an angle

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.429
to make good picture instead of taking
10 rubbish ones.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.739
It's been a splendid day, mikes got a good mix 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.159
of guiding you when you need it 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.899

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.020

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.730
