Hi! This is Elise McMahon for Expert Village.com
and in this video series, we are talking about

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.240
puppy care. If you would like to find out
more about my services, you can visit my website

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.500
at www.canineheadstart.com.com. So in this
video clip, we are going to be talking about

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.510
puppy food. What to feed your dog, what kind
of food you are going to feed your dog. Typically

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.130
people will start off with a base kibble;
this is what I mean by kibble. It is a hard,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.620
crunchy, baked or extruded, typically a fairly
complete diet. If you are going to be feeding

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.810
your dog kibble, you want to make sure that
you are feeding them an appropriate type of

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.320
kibble for the breed of dog or the mixed breed
of dog that you have. They make different

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.260
types of kibble. This bag just happens to
be for large breed puppies. If you have a

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.870
small breed puppy you can probably just feed
the regular puppy chow, for large breed puppies

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.650
you want to make sure to feed a large breed
puppy food, because we do not want the puppies

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.960
to grow too fast too quickly. So as I say
we start off with your base kibble and for

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.340
a four and a half-month-old puppy, I have
just put in a half cup of kibble. I am also

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.540
going to add to her food some grated carrots;
carrots are excellent for puppies and for

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.880
all dogs really but you want to make sure
that your puppies got some vegetables; actually

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.780
fruit and vegetables in general are good.
I could put some blueberries in; I donâ€™t

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.410
have any right now but blueberries are excellent.
We are also going to put some fresh meat in

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.479
here. I have some ground turkey meat here
and I am going to put some fresh ground turkey

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:51.460
in with the kibble and then I am going to
use some whole milk yogurt. I am using plain

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:02.950
yogurt, big dollop of the yogurt, yogurt is
excellent source of calcium and I mix all

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:12.700
this of together, make sure you have got everything
thoroughly mixed in. If you are going to put

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.360
in any extra supplements that you might happen
to be giving your puppy, you can just put

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:29.030
it right into the meal. Once you get it thoroughly
mixed up, it is ready to be fed to your puppy.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.200
Now puppies until they are about six months
old, should be fed three times a day, again

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.450
depending on what size your puppy is, what
size your puppy is going to be as an adult

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.450
you want to know whether you should feed that
amount, which is approximately probably a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.731
cup and a half of food or if you will be feeding
just half a cup if it is a small breed puppy,

00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:54.780
you are obviously going to be feeding them
less, but puppies should be fed three times

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.880
a day until they are about six months old
and then you can cut the meals down to twice

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.350
a day.
