00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.100
I'm gonna show you how to turn off the red
flashing lights in your GoPro HERO3 and HERO3+

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.420
cameras
and I'm going to give you some good reasons

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.000
why.
That's coming up.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.800
Hi Everyone, this is Bryn.
The GoPro HERO3 and HERO3+ cameras have 4

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.840
Red LED indicator lights that in the default
mode, will flash while recording.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.840
There's one on the front, one on the back,
one on the bottom and one on the top.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.510
Sometimes it may be beneficial to turn OFF
the flashing lights.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.440
Here's how to do that.
First I'll stop these from recording.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.440
Now I'm going to show you in the HERO3+ but
the process is the same for both cameras.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.480
Go to the settings menu by pressing the power
mode button 4 times

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.060
use the select button to enter
Then continue on until you get to the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.219
Set Up menu
Enter there

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.960
then keep going until you get to the LED icon
which is this one here

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.659
the choices are the default 4 LED's
2 LED'S or OFF.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.659
With 2 LED's selected only the front and back
LED's will flash.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.700
Or you may want to turn the flashing lights
off completely for a number of reasons.

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.179
Firstly - to extend the battery life for as
long as possible.

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.799
Secondly - it's possible that the flashing
red LED lights might be reflected in a window

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.209
or mirrored surface and that's not the look
that you want for your video.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.490
Thirdly - the flashing red lights may draw
attention to your camera and advertise the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.520
fact that you're recording.
At times it may be a benefit to record in

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.530
"Stealth" mode.
Now I already turn the BEEP sound off in the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.530
camera but turning the flashing lights off
means that no-one really knows if you are

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.030
recording or not, unless they get really close
to the camera.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.360
You can see for yourself that the camera has
commenced recording, as the recording time

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.260
counter is visible in the front LCD screen.
Of course you'll need to resist the urge to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.040
continually check to see that the camera is
still recording, as your big head will appear

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.040
in shot and ruin the whole thing (ha ha).

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.210
