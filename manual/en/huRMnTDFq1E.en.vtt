[Michael Wolfson - Sr. Advisor, Food and Beverage. Economic Development and Culture Division] The community's food skills program came out of an interest

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.460
of Toronto Public Health to teach
people in the priority neighbourhoods

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.289
who are on low incomes

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.380
how to cook more nutritiously for their families

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.160
and prepare food in a safe manner.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.360
[Camera shows people working at an industrial kitchen] What we discovered when we put the people

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.540
through the program was that some of the skills that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.479
[Camera shows Michael Wolfson] they learned were able to provide skills that they could use for

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.279
getting jobs within the industry.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.319
[Text lists the supporters of the program that is being mentioned by Michael Wolfson]: We convened a meeting of Toronto Public Health,

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.989
Economic Development, Toronto District
School Board,

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.010
couple the college representatives, Toronto Employment Social Services,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.030
as well as the HR Counsel of Canada

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.199
[Camera shows Michael Wolfson] and in that meeting we talked about how do we develop a curriculum

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:06.259
that we can teach individuals that will
help them get into the food and beverage

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.320
industry. That's what prompted

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.480
the entry level to food processing.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.620

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.939
[Camera shows Michael Wolfson] Of the  the 39 individuals that have gone through the program so far

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.619
28 have found permanent employment.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.840
[Rose Reisman - President and CEO of Rose Reisman Catering] This program has been phenomenal for Rose

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.679
Reisman Catering. Part of it is that,

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.579
you know, if we advertise and someone
doesn't have the skills or hasn't been

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.850
taught properly we never sure what we're
getting.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.380
[Camera shows people working at an industrial kitchen] This[ ???? ] we were getting people that have been trained for a few weeks in food handling

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.579
[Camera shows Rose Reisman] the basics of what we need and then we look at their skills

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.259
when they come in and say, you know,
they've good

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.200
knife skills, do they have good
organizational skills, and we place in

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.549
the departments that we think

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.659
will benefit their experience. And what's
wonderful is after 4 weeks,

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.639
we know whether or not they might work
out

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.639
[Camera shows the exterior part of Rose Reisman Catering] for our organization if they want we usually will offer them a position

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.280
[Camera shows Rose Reisman] so it's really an enhancement to our company

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.580
to somebody that first of all wants to be here,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.550
[Camera shows people working at an industrial kitchen] knows what they're getting into and has

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.620
[Camera shows Rose Reisman] some back education, which is important.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.880
[Chris Chitty - Executive Chef at Rose Reisman] The majority of the placements that we've had, all the students have

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.070
brought different [????] strenght to the
kitchen

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.060
[Camera shows Chris Chitty instructing a student] and it's given us the opportunity to work hand in hand

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.900
and give back to the community that basically drives our business.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.140
[Bairon Sisavanna - Production Worker at Rose Reisnman Catering. Graduate of Program.] The Training program help me to refresh my memory

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.180
and [????] learn more about the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.220
sanitizing [??????????] when I went to the program and we

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.010
get to go out and placement and then

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.350
the Chef likes me and asked me to stay. I've been here since...I think September...

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.440
of last year. Well, I started out

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.450
doing snacks, packing stuff, so now I'm

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.380
on lunch. Pretty much they put you around everywhere. so you

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.280
know all the stations. The Program will help me in the long run.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.380
Just stay in the industry, maybe move on to other things.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.250
[Michael Wolfson] The cost to the city of Toronto for the
program

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.890
was approximately a hundred thousand
dollars to put 39 people through the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.670
program.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.000
The return on the investment today for 28
people

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.810
who have found employment is well in
excess of one point two million dollars

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.269
which turned out to be a very

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.109
successful program.
