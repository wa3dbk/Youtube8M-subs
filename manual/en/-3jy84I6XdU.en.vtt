Hi this is Karen for Expert Village. Now I
would show you how to make a geometric pop

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.881
up card. You want to use a heavy part or card
stock. You would need a ruler, a little bit

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:19.900
of tape, or a dab of glue, and a pencil. We
are going to start by quarter folding the

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:29.089
paper. You want to bring your ends together.
Just hold those corners exactly together.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:36.091
Pull them firmly together and just sort of
rub back to get the crease. Crease the paper

00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:46.940
well and then quarter fold it again, match
your corners as closely as possible. Then

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:56.250
just rub that back together to the crease.
Now we are going to open up the card and fold

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:06.110
it in half the long way.
I want to use the back of the paper. The front

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.930
of my paper is textured so I'm going to turn
that over the other way. Okay! I'm going to

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:21.860
start by measuring in two inches and just
mark that a little bit. Then somewhere a little

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:34.170
further up and mark two inches. Then draw
a line across to two dots.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.439
My first cut is going to be right here right
to the line. As straight as you can. If you

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:52.750
are not a straight cutter you could take a
ruler and draw that line before you cut it.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:03.030
Cut right to the line exactly. Then we are
going to fold up on to the line. You can if

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:12.440
you have a hard card stock you can take the
blunt part of the scissors and run it along

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:22.270
your line. That would help you make your fold.
See how nice that big fold and we fold that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.090
out like that.
