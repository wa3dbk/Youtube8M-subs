Hi, I'm Greg B. from expert village. today
we're going to talk about model cars. Ok,

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.809
we're going to talk a little about a bit about
preparing our car for paint and actually painting

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.970
the car. Remember, safety is the most important
thing when youâ€™'e using chemicals. You take

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:31.100
your model car and you get like 500 grip wet
and dry automotive sandpaper, you can pick

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.620
that up in your local hardware stores. You
want to scuff the body down and you want to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.219
sand it, scuff it down, so you get rid of
that shiny finish. Then using warm water and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.210
dish detergent you want to wash your car.
You want to wet it, rinse it off very well

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.769
while you want to let it air dry. If you have
a compressor you could blow it off but you

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.500
want your car to be dry, and what I like to
do is I like to be in a well vented lighted

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.360
space for safety. I like to use a cardboard
box for paint booth. Right now we're out in

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.020
a garage. when you use your cardboard box,
when you spray any over spray will stay in

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.140
the box and it wont fly all over the room
or garage your doing it in. never use your

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.290
spray paints inside the house, it'll smell
for days. I like to take a coat hanger and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.510
fabricate me a little bracket for holding
the body so I don't have to touch it with

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:45.600
my hands. Here's a handy little item you can
get in Home Depot or Lowes it simply attaches

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.290
to your spray can and you're ready to start
spraying. Naturally you want to shake your

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:59.110
paint up. Your model car is clean and dry,
it's scuffed. Here's a handy little thing,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.750
you can buy a box of masks they have all different
kind and this is better then just breathing

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:16.170
straight in and it gives you that feeling
like your in a real body shop. There's many

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.200
different types of paint you can use from
your automotive dupli-color touch up paints

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.340
which you can get in many, many different
automotive colors to your Rustoleum. I like

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.200
to use a gloss black or semi flat black for
my chassis, sometimes my interiors. Many different

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.670
colors of household type paints you can buy.
In your hobby stores they do have regular

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.250
model car paint your medal flicks and what
ever fancy candy colors you can think of,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.810
but right now we have some American tradition
Valspar primer and we're going to shoot a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.329
little bit on the car. I like to start from
the bottom and work my way over. If you start

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:18.609
from the top and work your way down you could
get some running in there. Doesn't take much,

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.689
you don't want to get no runs. I don't know
if you can see that paint flying but she is

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:46.219
flying around,

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:52.620
and there's your car primed out we'll wait
about a hour, we'll be able to put some color

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.229
on there.
