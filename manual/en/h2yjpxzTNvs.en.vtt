00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.259
Hello everybody, welcome to the Champion Spotlight
featuring Pantheon presented by Riot Games.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.110
In this video I'll demonstrate the items,
runes and masteries that I use as well as

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.340
some fun tricks that Pantheon can pull off.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.470
Let's start with your pre-game build.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.970
Pantheon is actually quite frail and does
not have strong escaping abilities, so I plan

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.430
my runes, masteries and summoner spells around
this fact.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.490
I take Cleanse and Ghost as my summoner spells
so that I get in and out of battles fairly painlessly.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.799
My focus is built on doing as much damage
with Heartseeker Strike as possible thus I

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:48.070
focus on physical damage and armor penetration
and max Heartseeker as soon as possible.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.080
I use armor penetration marks, dodge seals
and magic resist per-level glyphs and health

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.580
quintessences.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.170
This allows me to deal more damage with my
abilities while also being able to take a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.650
bit more punishment than my opponents expect.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.530
For masteries I have 21 points in defense
and 9 in offense.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.900
I take every damage reduction mastery I can
in the defense tree and then push down the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.070
offense tree with 1 point in armor penetration.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.650
With the Meki Pendant and two health potions
I have a pretty strong lane even against Tristana.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.150
I use Spear Shot to last hit minions for now.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.030
Even though she's tried her hardest to harass
me I'm able to get the first four minion kills

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.080
with minimal damage taken.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.960
If your opponent is playing aggressively it
is best to try to stay right next to your

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.020
ranged minions.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.360
If you get attacked, they'll switch focus
onto the enemy champion.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.340
At level 3 I have learned all of my abilities and
am able to start harassing my opponent.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.840
As our minions start thinning out, I use Pantheon's
standard 3 hit-combo, Aegis of Zeonia, Heartseeker

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.420
Strike and Spear Shot.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.100
Because I haven't been casting anything but
Spear Shot in lane, I have more than enough

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.490
mana to run this combo twice.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.210
I harass her with Spear Shot until a leap
comes back up again and then force her to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.690
ghost and run away.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.409
I grab Chalice of Harmony and Mercury's Treads
with the interest of remaining durable.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.569
I cast my ultimate against Anivia who isn't
likely to move because she's defending her turret.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.090
My combo of spells not only gets Anivia very
low but also charges my passive shield twice

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.959
allowing me to take the turret quite effectively.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.459
I disengage to let Singed finish her off.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.700
When I return to the lane, Evelynn initiates.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.239
I try to waste time and stun her as I wait
for my team to show up.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.120
I whiff Heartseeker Strike due to Fling, but
I'm still able to finish her off with a point

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.400
blank Spear Shot and automatic crit on a basic
attack.

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:02.189
I start buying damage items and get ganked
as soon as I pull back from pushing the tower.

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.519
The most crucial thing here is that I actually
save cleanse for Nasus' Wither.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.590
Dark Binding naturally timed out by the time
the other champions showed up, so cleansing

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.629
it would have been fairly useless.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.969
I end up using Ghost as well as I start getting
afraid of Evelynn.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.209
I stay with the tower to help defend it and
just kill time for my team.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.840
As soon as Evelynn leaves her friends, I leap
to stun Morgana and then hit both her and

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.880
Nasus with Heartseeker Strike.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.440
Evelynn comes back in late and you can see
just why I love my defensive masteries and runes.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.460
After grabbing Brutalizer I farm some minions
and manage to tag Nasus with the Heartseeker Strike.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.889
As Evelynn shows up I have to play this battle
extremely smart.

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.799
Once Nasus casts his ultimate I stun him and
then position myself so that I can hit both

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.629
Evelynn and Nasus with Heartseeker.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.309
I play defensively as I wait for my cooldowns.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.100
Evelynn stealths and initiates on me again.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.279
By maxing Heartseeker and grabbing Brutalizer,
my spells cool quickly though I may make a

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:11.189
mistake in trying to cleanse the stun as opposed
to the ignite.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.150
I do kill her and level up just in time to
survive everything thanks to my defensive

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.390
build pre-game.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.949
Now I have Last Whisper and my team and I
spot Morgana out of place.

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.590
Realizing that my team will probably not be
able to catch her, I use Ghost to get me into

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.620
range with Aegis of Zeonia and an automatic
critical strike for the kill.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.340
Yes, it's a kill steal, but my team should
probably get on my level.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.289
Now I've got an Elixir of Fortitude.

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.650
As we saw earlier with Anivia, Pantheon is
an extremely potent tower diver.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.400
I barely catch up to Tristana and follow up
with my standard Aegis/Heartseeker combo.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.759
I do so much damage now that I can kill someone
from over 700 health instantly.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.190
One of the best traits of Pantheon's leap
is that I can get an automatic shield to block

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.210
one of those tower shots every time.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.110
I purchase Phage on my way to Frozen Mallet.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.610
As I'm about to fight Tristana in mid Evelyn
comes for me again.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.740
I cleanse at the wrong time again but now
my damage is so high that combining aegis

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.340
and the Heartseeker gets her extremely low.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.810
The shield I get from my bash blocks one attack
and the Spear Shot I throw at the very end

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.590
blocks another.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.430
She gets dropped by an automatic crit again
and I survive with 6 health.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.580
The defense towers are extremely useful but
the real hero here is the Elixir of Fortitude

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.919
that I drank during the Tristana kill.

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.770
This is the final most intricate battle.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.599
If you're going to take notes do it here.

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.460
I keep myself behind the tank and when Evelynn
wakes up unsigned I blow her up with Aegis

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.189
Heartseeker, also damaging Morgana severely.

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:50.990
However, I can't chase down Morgana just yet
cause my important spells are on cooldown now.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.259
I see an opening on Nasus and dive right in to
crit and the death as well.

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.959
Now the other team doesn't have enough damage
to actually kill me so I'm free to dive on Anivia.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.719
I could have Ghosted after her once she Flashed
but they surrender anyway.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.840
Victory!

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.260
Thanks for tuning in to the Pantheon spotlight.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.510
I'll see you next time.
