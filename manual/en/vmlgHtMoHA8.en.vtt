[Music]

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.900
GURNON: What you're looking at are some steel
sculptures that we collaborated on.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.630
We built these structures as
representations of 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.800
data from Klaus Schulten's lab
at the Beckman Institute.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.860
The data was the folding of 
a protein called Villin.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.160
And the protein folds in seven
microseconds.  So, I mean, it's thousands

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.269
and thousands of times faster than the
blink of an eye.

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.080
And what we did was we took five
snapshots along that trajectory

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.860
and with those coordinates

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.760
fed it into a program that would give
us cutting diagrams for steel.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.500
And then, really over the course of a month,
students got to learn about protein folding,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.930
some pretty difficult biochemical research 
problems, while at the same time 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.890
welding and grinding and creating the art.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.200
SCHULTEN: The sculptures show wonderfully 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
how this protein is at first very elongated, 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.080
artificially elongated actually, and how

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:28.430
it then coils up into the characteristic shape
that the protein assumes. 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.180
VOSS-ANDREAE: Proteins are amazingly beautiful 
structures.  They make us run and they 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.590
are everything.  They are the basic 
blocks of what we call 'being alive'.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.010
They have a beauty of alien technology to me. 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.780
It is a world that is perfect and I just
am amazed by how little we know visually

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.790
about that kind of world. 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.470
SCHULTEN: In the domain of living cells,
which is at the molecular domain,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:07.690
in this size scale, it is just difficult for 
microscopes to visualize things.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.889
With light microscopes, you don't have 
the resolution.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.349
And electron-microscopes are not really 
well-suited

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.359
for studying the processes in living cells. 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.040
GURNON: When a protein is produced, 
you can kind of think of it

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.130
as starting out as this floppy 
string of beads.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.799
And then it folds into a final structure. 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.569
The string of beads, each bead is an
amino acid, there are twenty of these things.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.669
And the amazing thing about proteins is
that they perform all kinds of different tasks

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:41.150
And the task that they perform is dependent on 
the shape that they take.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.230
And the shape that they take is dependent on
this sequence of beads.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.999
SCHULTEN: The proteins in the cell 
have a remarkable ability

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.439
to find their proper form. 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.869
This is very essential for them carrying out 
their proper function.

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:59.349
And it is also very essential for avoiding 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.479
pathological circumstances like
alzheimer's and other central nervous

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:08.799
system diseases which often come about
from the proteins actually  

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.729
misfolding and not assuming their proper form.

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:17.889
GURNON: Really one of the great unsolved 
problems in the area of biochemistry

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.889
is the protein folding problem. 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.649
That is one of the things that the Schulten
lab is working on. 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:27.749
Can we, with a computer, watch a protein fold, 
trillionth of a second by trillionth of a second.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.829
And from that get a movie of what it might 
look like as that structure forms?

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:40.449
SCHULTEN: I built over the years what I like 
to call a computational microscope. 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:49.199
That is a microscope not made of glass lenses
and metal tubes, but rather made of concepts

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:54.949
and ideas from physics and chemistry and
mathematics, and made of software 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:01.209
and computers that put those ideas and 
concepts together to simulate 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.949
what is happening in the cell. 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.219
Villin Headpiece is a particularly small 
protein that folds also fast 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.829
enough that the computer can
just manage to follow its birth

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.899
from being a stretched out,
completely nascent protein, 

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:26.229
to a protein that is then functional after 
the villin has folded itself into the proper form.

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.009
GURNON: It is one of the proteins, one of the
few proteins, that, with the state of our

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.689
computers today, we can accurately predict its
folding trajectory from unfolded

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.369
to folded -- all the way.

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:43.680
For proteins that are slower than villin, 
we do not have the computer power to do it.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.830
And I wanted the whole story. 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.520
SCHULTEN: So I published the work and I 
told the world about it in many lectures. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:00.270
And so it happened that some artists and 
scientists became aware of it. 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.939
VOSS-ANDREAE: Klaus Schulten's work, I know it really
well because I am always interested in

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.759
seeing what is beyond the static
aspect of a protein structure. 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.120
For the last decades, people saw only the 
static aspect. 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.719
They see only a protein as
something unmovable.  But it turns out

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.029
that the moving aspect of it --
the dynamics of the protein -- 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.499
is absolutely crucial.

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.850
And his group does an amazing job 
in visualizing that.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.320
GURNON: I was out there looking for resources that
would

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.160
help me teach concepts of protein folding.
In particular, I was looking for something

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.539
that showed motion.

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.620
And these supplementary videos that they
published really struck me as being very

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.109
powerful for communicating the idea that there 
are multiple paths to a single native state.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:47.779
You could see these proteins getting stuck
in local minima and getting out of it and

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:54.000
you could visually watch they things go through 
different paths to the same final structure. 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.099
SCHULTEN: Many people who see, for the first time,
what we actually offer scientifically...

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:08.669
they think, 'Oh, they are just using
beautiful colors and Disney-type movies.'

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:14.669
That is true in a way.  But it is also 
much more than that because this is the

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.990
only way of grasping with the human mind the kind
of complexity that is natural

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.550
to the living cell. 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.039
GURNON: What I really love to do is to walk around
these things up there.

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:32.449
You look at them from one direction and you
see a timeline -- you see that protein folding.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.330
You go to the other end, you see it unfolding.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.330
And as you walk around, you get a better sense, 
I think, then you would from a two-dimensional

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:49.059
still of the space that helices take up, of
the proximity of one backbone to the next. 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.449
You get a better picture of a protein. 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.750
VOSS-ANDREAE: It certainly provokes
people to ask. 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.600
And if they hear the answer --

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.590
that this is actually representing something 
and it is not a modernist abstract sculpture --

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.249
most people are actually quite intrigued by 
that and start asking more questions 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:06.249
and wonder about their own bodies. 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:12.459
GURNON: It is way beyond making pretty sculptures 
for the public and getting people to think 

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.770
that science is cool. It is way beyond that.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:23.639
You can see things through art that 
maybe you would have let slip past.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.639
SCHULTEN: When you see dead objects 
under the microscope,

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.199
you are impressed with their static beauty.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.529
But, when you see a cell,

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:36.560
you are impressed with the liveliness of it. 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.530
You see it streaming and moving and bubbling 
and sculpting. 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.530
And so that is life. 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.690
And that is what we want to show the world.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.909
And art is an absolutely natural way of

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.249
bringing about the message. 

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:12.000
