00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.520
Hello folks.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.670
in this video, I want to investigate this question
that, how does the efficiency of a solar cell

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.200
how does the efficiency of a solar cell,
change with the intensity of the light.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.180
For example, if I have a solar cell and

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.030
I'm applying light with the intensity of
one sun,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.970
what if I increase the intensity of light
to that to be of 10 suns or 100 suns?

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.300
What would that do to the efficiency of
this solar cell?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.940
So let me start with the basics over here.
So i know that my J-V relationship for

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.580
my solar cell can be expressed as this,
and I can express the condition

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.800
of open circuit voltage by equating the
total current equal to 0.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.250
So at open circuit condition, my J or my
current density in the cell is equal to 0.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.360
So I can plug

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.510
for V applied to be Voc and I'll plug
the total current to be 0.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.630
So, I'll have have this, condition at, open
circuit, voltage

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:13.960
and, basically I can then express my open
circuit voltage in terms of this short

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.820
circuit current and other parameters.
and then I get a formula for, for

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.390
open circuit voltage to be equal to
equal to kT

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.025
by q, natural log of Jsc plus

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:36.810
J0 divided by Jsc.
Divided by J0, sorry.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.410
So this Jsc this short circuit current, is
more typically much larger than J0.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.940
So i can simplify

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.430
this and write it that, approximately equal
to kT by

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.890
q natural log of Jsc divided by J0.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.440
So now what would happen when I increase
the concentration of my light?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.080
So let me think, consider the case, where I
increase the concentration and make it 2x.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.229
So if increase

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.672
the concentration by 2x, I can expect that

00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:17.350
my short circuit current will become 2x as
well.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.380
So my short circuit current will become
2 Jc as well.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.480
But what would happen to the open circuit
voltage?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.610
So that is a interesting relationship
which

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.840
is, emerges from this formula that I
derived.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.390
So what I see is that, if I increase

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.450
my open circuit, if I increase my short
circuit current, if I

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.160
increase my short circuit current and make it twice, so I make it twice,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.440
so what I see is that my open circuit
board will also increase, but not linearly

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.100
but much slowly with the logarithmic
dependence on the short circuit current.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.360
So what I see is not only is my short
circuit current

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.500
improving,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.770
but there's also an increase in the open
circuit voltage,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.160
which comes from this from this JV
relationship.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.650
So what I see is that instead of having 
Voc, I'll see a Voc

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.810
plus delta as my, plus delta, as my
open circuit voltage.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.320
So my new IV relationship will essentially
look something like this,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.130
where I have a slight increase in my Voc as
well.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.880
And I can assume you know, I'll make
the approximation that my fill factor remains

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.910
the same.
So i can write my efficiency as

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.910
essentially my Jsc times my Voc,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.910
divided by the incident power.
So when I increase my concentration to 2X,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.980
I'll get essentially twice increase in
my short circuit current.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.680
I get a twice increase in my incident power.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.370
But I've seen my Voc is also now slightly
increased, as given by this relationship.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.208
So I'll get Voc plus this delta increase
in the Voc.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:16.325
So my efficiency, if I compare it as a
concentration of 1 sun, versus if I

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.450
compare the efficiency, at the
concentration of 2 sun,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.090
I see that I see increase in my
efficiency.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.450
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.090
I see that i see increase in my
efficiency.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.570
So what this analysis is suggesting is
that my

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.480
efficiency increases as I increase the
concentration of the light.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.120
But there are some caveats to this.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.250
So what I've assumed in this analysis is
that my temperature of the cell did not vary.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.420
Typically, if you have a very large current
flowing or if you have a very large

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.420
Typically, if you have very large current
flowing or if you have a larger

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.280
intensity of, of, light, which is,
incident on your cell,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.890
your temperature can increase.
And, that results in a

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.560
temperature can increase.
And, that

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.940
decrease in efficiency that will be a
subject of another video, but if the

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.460
temperature rises, then this efficiency
increase might

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.140
not hold true.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.100
Similarly, when I increase my concentration
I get

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.630
a proportional increase in the current, so
if I

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.290
increase my concentration from 1x to 2x
I'll

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.250
get you know, corresponding 2 times or x
time

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.000
increase in my in my current.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.800
And my resistive losses in my circuit are,
as

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.690
you know, proportional to the square of
the current.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.560
So if I have a large resistance such

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.360
as serial resistance, or some other
resistance is

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.370
present in my circuit, that would
essentially also

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.290
increase these that would lead to
increasing these losses.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.690
And that can decrease my overall
efficiency of the light.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.250
So typically

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.290
due to these considerations, the
concentration

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.490
of light, the maximum concentration of
light

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.960
that is used is, is limited to around
500x, or at maximum, around 1000x.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:03.590
And the most highest efficiencies of
multijunction or III-V based solar cells,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.690
they use, they make use of this fact that
your efficiency increases

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.820
as you increases your concentration, and
they use these very high

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.970
concentrations to boost up the
efficiencies in these solar sets.
