Hello everyone!

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.170
This is Joao from Kenhub.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.280
Welcome to another tutorial where, this time,
I'm going to be talking about the deep flexors

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.709
of the forearm.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.270
As you can see on the title, "deep flexors,"
you have to have also a superficial group,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.270
right?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.180
And we did talk about them on a different
tutorial here at Kenhub, so you can also check

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.570
it out if you want to have a little bit more
knowledge on the superficial flexors.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.210
And you can also see here on this image the
superficial flexors, but today, we're going

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.370
to be focusing on the deep flexors, which
is, there, found under the superficial flexors.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.059
Now, all of these muscles, these superficial
and deep flexors, they're found on the ventral

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.059
forearm.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.990
That's very important to know.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.630
And the other thing that you need to know
is that they run under the flexor digitorum

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.400
superficialis, very closely to the radius
and ulna, and for that reason, they are difficult

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.570
to palpate.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.920
You can palpate the superficial...

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.920
