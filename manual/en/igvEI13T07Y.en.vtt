00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.549
so this is the pulserpump nano idea

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.179
so you would have a trompe section

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.810
with a 7 cm to 15 cm diameter pipe

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.000
that will have half a meter head or less

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.900
It could be thirty five centimeters to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.960
half a meter 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.079
you will have about 1 meter

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.129
of depth to your trompe

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.970
trompe  and that's why i'm calling to
pulser pump  nano

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.050
The trompe produces air under pressure

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.310
comes up this pipe here

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.640
and goes to your 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.200
airlift section

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.570
and this pipe here could be a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.290
garden hose, you know something

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.840
10 or 12  milimeter

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.020
 diameter pipe

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.180
and the it splits up and you will have

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.300
a bundle of

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.490
quarter inch or 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.970
6 mm or  5mm pipe

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.450
that will

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.970
do the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810
pumping with slug flow to  

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.159
the height that you need

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.720
and you will have your t-joints here

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.860
t joints

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.910
taking a water from the reservoir

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.560
the bundle of pipes 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.560
going to height

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.380
I cannot do this myself so if anyone

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.170
wants to try it

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.340
It would be

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.960
really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.700
totally new research

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.780
I have done some trials that suggest 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.460
that six five  or 4 mm pipes would be
ideal

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.060
for pumping

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.230
with this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.360
this idea i guess

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.680
and certainly can be done

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.370
and uh... eileen in Texas has done her little models too

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.720
and and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.179
and she thinks it can be done too, so

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.659
go ahead and try its hand and

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.769
basically you'll be

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.500
its new research that big science
is never ever going to do

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.090
i waited twenty years for didn't even to
look at this

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.399
so

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.619
its not going to happen unless

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:31.719
you and i and others get down to it and get some work done
and then

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.479
have produced some working models hand

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.169
basically jours

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.299
show that what is possible
