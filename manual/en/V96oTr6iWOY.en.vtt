00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.670
According to the American Council on Exercise,
you may burn about 400 calories an hour from

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.070
shivering.
The range of temperatures in humans over the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:14.070
age of 10 years is 97.6-99.6. The average,
of course, being 98.6. But why such a specific

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.789
temperature for all human life on the planet?
Even more so the range of body temperatures

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.960
across all warm blooded animals is 97-105
with birds being the highest.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.339
Most bacterial and fungal species that like
to infest our body and use it as a breeding

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.340
ground enjoy temperatures around 95-96. That's
why when you're outside in the cold for a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.860
long time you can get sick easily. Your body
temperature has been lowered by the outside

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.300
air! And with a low body temperature, you
are inviting more and more ravenous fungal

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.170
infections to spread in your body. In order
to get rid of any invading infections, your

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.280
Hypothalamus (located in the brain) will raise
your body temperature to kill the spreading

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.780
infection. AKA a fever.
Albert Einstein College of Medicine researchers

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.260
showed that every one degree Celsius rise
in body temperature wards off about 6 percent

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.009
more fungal species. So tens of thousands
of fungi can infect reptiles and amphibians:

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.420
the cold blooded creatures, but us warm-blooded
folk can only be invaded by a few hundred

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.200
fungi. Since this is true, why don't we have
an even higher body temperature to ward off

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.650
ALL fungal infections?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.640
Well, the same researches at the same university
continued to experiment with metabolism and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.640
fungal infections to find out why 98 is such
a great temperature. Keep in mind, In order

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.300
to keep a high body temperature; we have to
burn calories every minute.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.140
A calorie is a unit of energy, it measures
heat -- specifically it's a measurement of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.130
the amount of energy required to raise the
temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.130
C. This calorie is equal to 4.2 Joules, whereas
a food calorie is equal to 4.2 kilojoules.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.620
That's 1000 times bigger than a normal gram
or 'small' calorie.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.820
The food calorie is what you will find on
the back of food labels and when your trainer

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.619
talks about 'burning calories'. These are
the calories I'll be talking about for the

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.110
rest of this article.
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.270
notes that a woman needs a minimum of 1,200
calories and a man needs at least 1,500 calories

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.920
each day to maintain basic metabolic function.
This involves your body temperature, circulation

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.579
of blood, beating heart, and the many other
involuntary chemical processes that happen

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.389
in your body every second.
However, 20% of those calories are used for

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:22.709
activities such as walking, talking, and breathing.
If you exercise or expend even more energy,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.650
you will obviously need more calories for
your body to burn. This is why the typical

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.239
FDA approved calorie intake is around 2,000
per day. But what do calories and metabolism

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.849
have to do with 98.6? Like I already said,
In order to keep a high body temperature,

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.779
we have to burn calories every minute. And
the more calories you burn, the more calories

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:46.290
you have to eat. There is an optimal point
where the number of calories burned to maintain

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.069
a certain temperature and the number of possible
fungal infections are both low. That is, a

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.099
point where we won't have to eat constantly
just to ward of infections. That point, discovered

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.099
by the researchers at Albert Einstein College
of Medicine is 98.1 F or 36.7 C. This lines

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.840
up nearly perfectly with what the typical
human body temperature is!
