00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.600
Hi my name is Dr. Jack Gruber.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.540
As a periodontist who practiced for more than
forty years, I've had an enormous number of

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.400
patients come in to me with gum recession.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.750
Gum recession is where the gums are eroded,
the bone underneath is exposed and destroyed,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.150
the roots of the teeth are then exposed and
the enamel is worn out.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.740
Gum recession can lead to pain, decay, loss
of the teeth and expensive and invasive gum

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.900
surgery.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.900
Now to give you a little bit of an anatomy
lesson, if you look at this tooth right here,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.520
the gum is as thin as paper, it is the skin
of your teeth.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.990
If i push my finger across here and push the
blood out, you're actually looking at the

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.360
bone that's holding the tooth in place.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.590
Underneath there, that bone is as thin as
an eggshell, so is the enamel.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.700
If you're using a conventional brush and over-brushing
that gum will disappear, the bone that's underneath

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.320
there will disappear, the enamel will wear
out and the interior of the tooth is actually

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.900
yellow so your tooth will actually become
darker and more sensitive to especially cold.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.790
And this an epidemic, over 24 million people
in the US alone have gum recession according

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.200
to a major university.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.790
In fact they called it toothbrush disease,
people are actually brushing away their gums

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.799
and their bone and their teeth with conventional
toothbrushes.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.689
Many of my patients have come to me asking
for help, so I decided I had to do something

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.280
and I created the Periclean toothbrush.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.689
*Toothbrush Image*

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.240
The Periclean is a specialty toothbrush, that
I designed to help people with receding gums

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.590
to prevent it from getting worse and to actually
reverse it in some cases.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.970
Periclean works by effectively cleaning the
gums and teeth and removing the plaque as

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.019
well as, and in some cases even better than
a conventional toothbrush.

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.360
In my practice and in the practices of some
of the dentists that I work with, we have

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.500
actually seen the gums stop receding and in
some cases regenerate.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.480
If you had told me this two years ago, I would
have said that cannot happen, gums cannot

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.040
grow back and yet my patients have been pointing
out to me that they believe that their gums

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.910
are growing back and indeed when I looked
at them, they have grown back.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.130
The experience of using the Periclean feels
very different from the conventional toothbrush.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.080
Some people tell me that they hardly feel
it when they're brushing and that's actually

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.650
a good thing.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.370
We don't want you to brush the way you do
with a conventional brush.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.850
Periclean is very simple to use but it has
to be used properly to maximize it's effectiveness.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.330
How to use the Periclean:

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:09.420
Step One, Wet The Periclean.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.470
Step Two, Apply a small amount of toothpaste
to the Periclean.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.560
Step Three, place the head of the Periclean
flat against your teeth at the gum line.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.480
Begin to brush in a back and forth manner
firmly, doing two teeth at a time with moderate

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.200
pressure counting to ten for each two teeth.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.940
Continue all the way around your mouth inside
and out and across the chewing surfaces also.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.960
For the inside of the top and bottom teeth,
hold the brush vertically and use a back and

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.989
forth motion and again count to ten for every
two teeth, the upper and the lower on the

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.080
inside.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.230
And don't forget to clean the biting surfaces
of your teeth.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:07.750
Step Four, Rinse your mouth out with clean
tap water.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.659
Step Five, Rinse the Periclean with hot water.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.019
Some of my patients have asked me if it's
a good idea to put the Periclean into the

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.709
dishwasher and the answer is no.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.819
It will stay clean by putting it under hot
tap water for one minute.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:33.270
Step Six, Place your Periclean into your favorite
toothbrush holder and allow it to air dry.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.569
So now you know how to use the Periclean for
the best results.

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.120
Many of my patients ask me, How does the Periclean
clean in between the teeth?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.069
The fact is there is no toothbrush that cleans
in between the teeth, so the use of dental

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.939
floss is extremely important for optimal health
in conjunction with the Periclean.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.830
So if you're concerned about receding gums,
I highly encourage you to use the Periclean.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.969
