00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.490
president of the physical side of a
relationship

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.790

in recent shorter i've acted or not

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.860
on physical part relationship can only
lead to get things and i think it's a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.599
matter of asking me

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.999

months roles reassured by carbon dioxide
and let you know like

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.119
unevenly and a state that's that can
ruin everything

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.229

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.389
expander not the apertures

an organization stands out as you can

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.950
show ninety five percent were ordered

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.150

thus establishing but it really just

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.760
