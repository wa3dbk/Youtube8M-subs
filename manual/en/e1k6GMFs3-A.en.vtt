00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:09.020
Greetings pilots! Today we will discuss with you Germany’s tier 6 fighter—the Focke-Wulf 190A-5,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.610
a high-speed aircraft with good weapons that excels at vertical engagements.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.160
Its precursor in the Tech Tree is the Focke-Wulf 190V.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.460
The A-5 inherited the wing-mounted MG/FF autocannons, as well as their modification.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.600
Generally speaking, the A-5 is an improved version of its precursor.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.990
It flies higher, faster, and has a better rate of climb and more powerful weapons.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.620
The A-5 loses to the 190V only in maneuverability.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.310
However, with such weapons and speed characteristics, this is not so important.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.430
Let's take a look at other aircraft and compare the A-5 with its tier 6 counterparts.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.090
The A-5’s durability is one of the best on its tier.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.560
Only the American Corsair with its top airframe has more hit points.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.360
The next point of discussion is armament.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.200
Weapons directly affect the A-5’s speed characteristics and effective flying style.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:13.200
In a heavily armed configuration with four autocannons, the A-5 has the greatest firepower in its tier, but its speed is only average.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.720
However, if the A-5 is equipped with 13 mm machineguns and standard synchronized autocannons,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.020
it will be outmatched in speed only by the American P-51A Mustang.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.890
Its firepower will still remain decent, though.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.040
Yet it does have some disadvantages. The A-5 doesn't excel in horizontal engagements.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.890
Even in its lightest configuration, the A-5 is one of the slowest fighters to turn 360 degrees.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.080
Also, this German fighter is one of two aircraft in this branch capable of carrying rockets. However, we don’t recommend mounting them.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.140
With outboard weapons equipped, the A-5 becomes even less maneuverable.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.060
Enough for comparing the numbers. Let's test this aircraft in battle.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.360
And we are at the top of the list. Great!

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.160
At the start of the battle, you should climb to an altitude of about two kilometers.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.630
Then wait for the enemy team to attack.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.430
The A-5’s high dive speed will allow you to catch up and bring down any enemy aircraft.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.080
Keep in mind that speed and altitude are the ingredients for your advantage.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.350
That's why you must ensure that no one will prevent you from flying at your optimum altitude.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.570
So, high-speed and high-altitude enemy aircraft should be taken down first.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.360
Since the A-5 lacks maneuverability, you should attack enemy aircraft when passing them by or at converging courses.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.320
You can attack fast but less armed enemy aircraft head-on. Be careful, though!

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.770
Once you manage to destroy high-altitude adversaries, continuing the battle will become easier.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.960
After the first engagement, when the first waves are destroyed and the main dogfight is closer to the ground,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.960
you should climb to an altitude of 1.5 km or higher.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.680
From this altitude, you can dive at your targets effectively, while enemy fighters won't be able to keep up with you.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.120
Avoid engaging in maneuvering dogfight by all means.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:20.440
If a more maneuverable enemy aircraft has clung to your tail, use boosting to break away, zoom up, and then dive back at a new target.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.640
Attack aircraft are quite simple to deal with. Don't follow them for too long, though, or you'll get destroyed.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.320
You can also attack them passing by. And, of course, avoid head-on attacks with them.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.700
If you are at the bottom list, don't lose hope.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.000
High altitude and speed capacity together with powerful weapons will allow you effectively support your higher-tier allied fighters

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.120
or cover allied attack aircraft from a medium altitude.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.600
Attacking ground targets is a controversial issue.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.460
On one hand, the A-5 is a fighter, and its main task is to destroy enemy aircraft.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.040
On the other hand, if the enemy team is gaining superiority and you are about to lose,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.010
you can finish off already damaged ground targets and deprive the enemy team of their advantage.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:24.800
Let’s summarize: unlike its precursor, the Focke-Wulf 190A-5 is more flexible in combat regardless of its configuration.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:33.180
Whatever style of playing you prefer, be it rapid attacks with short and accurate bursts or hailing bullets at enemy aircraft,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.400
the A-5 can employ both tactics.
