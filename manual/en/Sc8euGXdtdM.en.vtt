00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
If you're watching this video, then you're probably in search of a local roofing company in Houston…

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.966
…as a result I've  shown up on the 1st page of Google™ for the search term you typed

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.132
Which is great for us!!!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.700
But if you're actually looking for a roofing contractor in Houston…

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.732
…then I sincerely apologize, as this video is not really for you.

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:24.433
Please press the back button and contact one of the companies on the 1st Page of Google™.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.366
However if you are a roofing company…

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.966
…then that's great as this video is JUST FOR YOU!!!

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:33.999
Because this video is going to bring you more business than you can handle.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.299
Your video should be here instead of ours.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:41.933
When your potential customers are searching for a roofing company in Houston…

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:46.132
…your business should be on the first page Google™ for your industry rather than ours.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:52.366
In fact if you're not on the 1st page of Google™, then technically you don't exist.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.666
Worse still, is if your competitor is on the 1st page of Google™. You lose the race to the top &amp; it costs you new business.

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:06.299
you're probably throwing darts in the dark with advertising and marketing that sucks your bank 
account dry.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.099
Sounds all to familiar right?

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:13.399
Could your business do with 5 – 10 or more new leads every day?

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:21.733
Smart consumers are web savvy. They search and review companies like yours on Google™ before making a decision to contact or buy. 

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:25.999
Here is what happens when your potential customer is searching for you on the web…

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.100
Consumers type a relevant keyword and typically review the results on the 1st or 2nd page of Google™

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:37.366
If they don't find what they are looking for, then they search again using a different keyword or phrase…

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:41.199
Consumers rarely ever search beyond the 2nd page of any search engine…

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.533
…by not being on the 1st page of Google™ your competitors are robbing you of new customers that should rightfully be yours.

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:54.099
There are probably dozens of keywords or phrases for which your business does not appear on the 1st page of Google™

00:01:54.166 --> 00:02:03.132
As a result, your business fails to grow and continues to struggle in attracting new business.

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:05.599
It does not have to be this way at all…

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:09.799
…If your looking at attracting new customers and growing your business…

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.900
…you need to be on the 1st PAGE of Google™ PERIOD

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.066
We can help change that.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.900
However If you're still not convinced we can help you…

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.933
…we understand.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.800
