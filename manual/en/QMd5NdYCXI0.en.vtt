Hi I'm Bill Elzey with Showplace Lawns. Let's
discuss caring for outdoor wood furniture.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:16.770
A chair like this is very comfortable, and
has a really functional place in the garden

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.289
area. What you would do with something like
this, first thing you want to do is make sure

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.199
your surface areas are clean. A nice clean
rag to wipe it off, in some cases maybe you

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.051
want to wash it off with a little soap and
water and get it nice and clean, let it dry

00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:47.920
a little bit, wipe it down, follow that with
a good piece of sandpaper, you do not want

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:57.300
to use a wire brush, because it will scratch
and leave marks in your wood. A good piece

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.270
of finer grade, a nice fine to medium fine
type sandpaper is what you want to use; because

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.780
again, the coarser paper will leave marks
in the wood for you. Just rub it nice and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.409
easy cover all the spots with it, you can
also use a it's like a sponge type of sandpaper,

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.509
it's flexible, comes in a little block, that
would be good for maybe hitting some heavier

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:38.040
spots and follow that with the medium grade
sandpaper. Come back wipe the surface down,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.729
make sure it is free of all the debris that
the sandpaper has knocked loose. Then depending

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:53.979
on what kind of finish you have you would
either then begin to paint, vanish or what

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.380
we do with these chairs we put a sealer on
them. A clear coat sealer protecting that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:10.450
coat and more or less keeping that wood similar
to its natural color. Use a nice clean flexible

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.150
brush and just paint it on. And be very careful
so that you don't have any runs keep your

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:28.849
runs cleaned up and then let it dry. After
that leave it set for a good day maybe 2 days

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.010
just to be sure that the piece of furniture
is ready to use again. So that's how that

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.050
we can care and revive our outdoor wooden
furniture.
