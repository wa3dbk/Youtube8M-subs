00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.410
Today on this 2007 Saturn Ion we are going
to be installing wiring harness part number

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.920
119175KIT.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.294
We are in the trunk area of the Ion and we
want to locate the wires that we are going

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:13.390
to be tapping into.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.890
Starting over on the driver side we have got
the wires going into the tail light assembly

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.119
from the inside and these are going to be
the wires we are going to tap into.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.490
We can count for four of the wires for the
harness over on the driver side.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.390
We are going to have to route one wire over
to the passenger side to activate the right

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.390
turn signal.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.429
I am going to pull back the carpeting a little
bit so that when I tap into the wires they

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.429
are somewhat hidden.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.750
I am going to cut back some of the tape here
that is covering the wires.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.860
Be careful not to slice any of the wires inside
when doing this.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.280
00:38
With the wires exposed we want to test them

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.030
to find the functions that we are looking
for over on the driver side.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.850
If we take our converter box you can see that
we have got four wires connected together.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.530
These are the four we are going to tap into
over on the driver side.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.089
We have got the green wire with the longer
lead.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.660
That is the one we are going to route over
to the passenger side.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.280
What we are looking for on the red wire is
the brake signal.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.580
The yellow wire is our left turn signal.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.460
The brown wire is our running lights and the
white is our ground.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.290
The first thing I want to do is ground the
ground stud.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.320
This will be taking a self tapping screw and
I am actually going to tap right into this

00:01:17.320 --> 00:02:18.599
overlapping 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:03:02.819
piece 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:33.860
of metal.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:04:04.800
