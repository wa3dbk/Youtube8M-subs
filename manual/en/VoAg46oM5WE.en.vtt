00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.410
I'm Lillian with expertvillage.com and I have
completed applying the toenail polish on each

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:17.980
of my toes and as I was allowing to dry I
applied on my heels some heel softener and

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:28.800
that makes them really soft after scraping
them. Now we are ready to apply the decals

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.640
on the big toe and I will show you how that
is done. As you could see I chose a red tone

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.910
nail color rather then the French pedicure
today this would be a easier visual on how

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:56.420
to apply these decals. What you want to do
first is you want to put a coat of top coat

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:05.269
or top sealer on the toe that you are going
to put the decals and then you would get the

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:18.670
tweezers and remove one of the decals I chose
a little dolphin and while the toenail is

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:28.790
still wet you are just going to put it right
at the edge here. Just place it right where

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:37.450
you want it on the nail. Then with the decal
came this little roller and what you want

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.479
to do is just smooth it on there and that
is why you have to make sure the nail is completely

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:53.119
dry so you won't smear the nail color on there.
The decal is placed secularly on there but

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:01.630
just for added security you'll will get some
more clear top coat and apply it over the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.830
entire nail once again and covering the decal
and that keeps it in place. I will do the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.770
same thing on the other foot. Normally I only
like the decals on the two big toes and I

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.200
will just put the top coat on the rest of
the other nails.
