00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:06.390
Welcome Brothers and Sisters, Douglas MacKrell
here, and today I’ll be opening the Mabel

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.390
Pines and Waddles two figures pack, which
I’m sure is correct English, but it just

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.560
sounds really weird coming out of my mouth.
This is one of the first sets of officially

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.560
licenced figures for the hit Disney TV show,
Gravity Falls, and as you can see it features

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.509
Mabel Pines and her adorable pet pig Waddles.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.390
These figures are created by a company called
Jazware, who has also created action figures

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.390
for other cartoon shows like Adventure Time,
and for sports companies like the NBA. The

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.690
two pack is designed for children 4 and up
because it is a terrible choking hazard for

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.160
kids who like to eat action figures.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.989
If we turn the packaging around, we can see
the other two sets of action figures currently

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.909
available, which feature Dipper Pines and
Grunkle Stan. There’s also a bit of text,

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.579
which reads:

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.229
Twins Dipper and Mabel Pines see their summer
plans ruined when they’re sent off to their

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.229
crusty Great-Uncle Stan’s (Grunkle Stan)
in hum-drum Gravity Falls, Oregon. Yet strangeness

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:29.549
lurks in this seemingly run-of-the-mill tourist
trap, and the twins quickly realize they must

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.349
rely on one another if they’re to survive
a summer filled with all manner of supernatural

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:42.349
phenomena from lost time travelers to villainous
gnomes to haunted wax sculptures!

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.520
The rear of this package also has a secret
message, which (after being decoded with the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.369
Caesar Cipher set three letters back) reads:
Oink! Oink! Oink!

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.369
Now, let’s see what’s inside this package!

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.440
As you can see, Mabel is in
her shooting star sweater, and the level of detail

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.450
is impressive - as you can see, her headband
is molded into the figure instead of just being painted

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.590
being painted on. She has articulation at the
shoulder,  and she can turn her head.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.420
and that's about it.

00:03:10.714 --> 00:03:12.794
Down here, nothing else turns.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.140
And the level of detail in Waddles is also very impressive. but as you can see, he's not articulated at all.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.100
He's just a hard plastic figure roughly about as heavy as Mabel's head!

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:34.329
The final item included is the secret scroll
which is just a printing of the Journal page on the Undead.

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.329
from the Journals. There’s not much else
on this small piece of paper, and it is unresponsive

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.480
to black light. What you see is what you get. It's just a printing of that page from the journal.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.879
Now, let’s run some tests!

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:59.879
Though gummy worms don’t fit up her nose,
she can wear them as a fashionable gummy boa!

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.029
[TOO COOL!]

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:09.760
Waddles may not come with any accessories,
but he does make an adorable chef! Save a

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.760
burger for me, cutie! [TOTALLY RADICAL]
Mabel has no accessories, but with some string

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.819
she can swing in on her GRAPPLING HOOK! [OFF
DA CHAIN]

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:28.259
You can stick upwards of 7 gummy bears
in her hair! [OHHH YEAH!]

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.140
The Pines Family is in trouble?! Better call, Waddles! The Hambarian!! [ACTION
PIG!]

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:48.520
And when you submerge Mabel in icy cold water...
she seems to like it. What a weirdo! [UNCOMFORTABLE!]

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:58.389
Well, on a scale of 10, I give the Mabel Pines
and Waddles Two Figures Pack - Seven shooting

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.610
stars. Though the sculpt and paint job is
good, it seems like she was sculpted to hold

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.139
something in her right hand. It was probably
cut for budget reasons, but I would have liked

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.860
at least one accessory for Mabel's figure.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.860
Another point was dropped because I can not get her to stand all by herself.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.160
There's no peg hole on the bottom of her feet, 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.640
Her head is too back heavy, and she can't stand by herself.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.590
I have to prop her up against Waddles. I'm sure that they need to be connected to the hip... but not that literally!

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.920
