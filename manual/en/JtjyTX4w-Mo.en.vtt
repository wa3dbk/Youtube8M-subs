00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.880
Hello and welcome to Caseking TV. Today we present another brand, EVGA.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.320
Many of you will know EVGA already mainly from the hardware sector.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:26.800
As you can already see we have mainboards and graphics cards 
 right at our side. These are focus products of EVGA.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:45.640
You get any chipset on EVGA mainboards, starting from P45, X58 
 up to the brand new X79 chipset for socket 2011.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:01:01.280
EVGA mainboards are known for their setting options and overclocking potential.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:14.960
A mainboard withoud the option of changing front side bus, latencies and 
 other stuff is not an option if you want to overclock.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.200
WIth an EVGA mainboard you have none of these problems at all.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.840
EVGA also offers graphics cards with Nvidia chipset.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:42.840
You get all Nvidia cards starting from office use graphics cards 
 up to GTX580, GTX590 and the upcoming high end chipsets.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.720
What else did we put on the table ? 
 First of all this little black box.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.760
This is an external USB graphics card. You can easily connect to another monitor.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:10.320
With doing so you simply add another monitor to 
 your workspace and use a Multiscreen configuration.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:21.360
Not usable for high end gaming graphics of course, but for office and internet.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:37.000
Small games might also run on it. But mainly intended for multi monitor 
 use if you don´t own a graphics card with this feature.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.320
The last product we present you today ist the EVBot.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.520
Simply the tool for overclocking if you don´t wanna go with the bios.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.160
If you don´t want to go into bios everytime, reboot , shut 
 down and so on, this is the tool for you.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:08.480
On the bottom you can connect any compatible 
 EVGA product like mainboards and graphics cards.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.440
These two products here e.g. are compatible.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:22.640
After connecting it, you can change the desired settings with the buttons.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.640
This means you can change the CPU clock on 
 the fly while actually running your computer.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:39.440
You can check the changes with monitoring tools on 
 your desktop. It changes in real time.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:49.720
Very nice product for everyone who likes to 
 have a hardware solution and not software.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.600
For those who like Bios overclocking it does not really make sense.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.360
But the EVBot is completing the nice line of products EVGA is offering.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:14.720
It will also be updated for future releases, so 
 the EVBot supports the upcoming boards and cards.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.880
So we see us again, when we show 
 you the next series of graphics cards.
