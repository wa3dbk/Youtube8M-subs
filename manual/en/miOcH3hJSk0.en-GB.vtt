00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:05.593
Let me show a new take on the traditional granny square that creates triangle shapes.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.700
We will be following the tradition granny square pattern 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.060
with the key difference being the change of color within a round

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.460
rather than at the beginning of a round.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.240
Starting with the first color, by making a slip knot.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.460
then 4 crochet chains.  

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.600
we join each end of the chains to form a ring. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.780
And, as with the traditional granny square

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.700
we chain 3 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.740
and then make 2 trebles into the centre of the ring.  

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:36.727
Treble stitch is known as double crochet in North America.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960
After making the two trebles, 

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.646
chain 2 and then treble three into the ring.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.733
The piece will look like this. 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.460
We are almost ready to change color.  

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.860
First, make one more chain. 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.080
Then, take the end of the new color 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.020
and leaving a tail of about 10 cm

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.200
make one chain with the new color. 

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:03.259
Next, wind the new color around the hook from back to front

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.060
and make a treble crochet stitch into the ring.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.480
Making sure your don't pull to hard on the new color.  

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.040
Then pull the thread from the old color to tension slightly.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.620
Make one more treble into the ring,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.920
then chain 2 and then treble three into the ring.

00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:23.157
The piece will look like this.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.780
Next we chain 2 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.020
and join with a slip stitch 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.100
to the top of the chain three made at the beginning of the round.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.140
Then, continuing with the same color 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.840
turn the piece around so that the back of the work is facing you

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.000
and make a slip stitch into the space to the left of the hook.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.560
You have completed the first round.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.060
Start the next round with three chains, 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.720
and treble 2, into the same space.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.760
and then chain one.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.100
Then, into the next chain space,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.340
three trebles, 2 chains and three trebles.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.900
This makes the corner.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.000
Next, chain 1 and treble three into the next space 

00:02:09.413 --> 00:02:11.653
so that the piece looks like this. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.920
Chain one more 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.320
and then draw up the yarn from the first color 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.120
and chain one. 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.800
Make a treble into the same chain space 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.900
and then pull the threads to tension.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.600
Continue in the granny square pattern for half a round

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.720
until the piece looks like this. 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.240
Then as for the first round,

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:39.633
Chain two and slip stitch to the top of the third chain.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.560
Turn the work around again 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.540
and slip stitch into the chain space. 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.480
Then begin the round with a chain three. 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.680
You will get into a pattern of turning at the end of a round 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.639
and picking up the thread in the middle of a round.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.020
