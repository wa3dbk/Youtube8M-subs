00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:03.073
(light jazz piano music)

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.741
- [Voiceover] Just a few years

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:08.647
after the Medici Palace was completed,

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:10.262
and only a few blocks away,

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:11.747
one of the other wealthiest families

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:13.709
in Florence, built a palace.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.880
- [Voiceover] Well there was a
whole boom in palace building

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.982
after the Medici built their palace.

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:20.501
And so we're looking at
the Palazzo Rucellai,

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.461
whose architect was the famous Alberti.

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.447
Now Alberti was a brilliant humanist.

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:27.664
He wrote an important
book on architecture,

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:29.707
in addition to his
famous book on painting.

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:30.903
- [Voiceover] Alberti's "On Architecture"

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:32.759
is probably the most important treatise

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.325
on architecture after the
10 books of architecture

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.358
by the ancient Roman Vitruvius.

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:38.821
- [Voiceover] Right, which
it had only been discovered

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.098
a few decades earlier.

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:41.745
So, there's this whole revival

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.406
of ancient Roman architecture.

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:46.401
And we see that a little
bit in the Medici Palace,

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.163
but we see it really here in
the Rucellai Palace by Alberti.

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:51.301
- [Voiceover] What's fascinating is that

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.621
Alberti is looking back to
Vitruvius's ancient work,

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.978
seeing this standardized vocabulary,

00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:00.159
and employing it in a self-conscious way,

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.481
that is announcing its historicism.

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:03.839
- [Voiceover] Announcing its looking back

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.545
to ancient Roman architecture.

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:07.438
Alberti had been in Rome,

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:09.760
he had studied ancient Roman architecture.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.617
- [Voiceover] And the
classicism is not coming through

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:13.440
only in the individual elements,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.004
but also in the emphasis
on measure and harmony.

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:20.336
Giovanni Rucellai came from
a wealthy Florentine family,

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.903
of wool manufacturers.

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:23.343
- [Voiceover] Like most
wealthy Florentines,

00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:24.584
that's how they made their money.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.757
- [Voiceover] At this particular moment

00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:26.895
in Florentine history,

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:28.381
it was important that Rucellai

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.539
express his loyalty to the Medici family.

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.280
Alberti was clearly referencing

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.243
the Medici Palace,

00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:36.902
and you can see that in the
organization of the facade,

00:01:36.902 --> 00:01:38.783
into three primary stories.

00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:40.874
But there are also really
important differences,

00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:42.812
and you can see that
especially in the masonry.

00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:45.576
For example, this building
is much more delicate,

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:48.315
gone is that heavy,
dark, rusticated masonry

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.219
that we saw in the earlier building.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.797
- [Voiceover] Right,
that gave the impression

00:01:51.797 --> 00:01:54.758
of the Medici Palace as
being almost like a fortress,

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:56.593
and recalling the Palazzo Vecchio.

00:01:56.593 --> 00:01:58.357
- [Voiceover] This building
feels much more intellectual

00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:02.188
in its geometry, its lightness,
it's sense of the cerebral.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.336
- [Voiceover] So we see
more classical elements here

00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:06.437
than we saw in the Medici Palace.

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:09.014
We have pilasters, rounded arches,

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:11.278
although we did see that
also in the Medici Palace.

00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:15.017
But in-between the stories,
instead of just a string course,

00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:17.710
we have more classical entablature,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.195
which gives us a sense of horizontality

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:23.038
and which is filled with
decorative patterns,

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.570
between the ground floor
and the first floor.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.091
We see a Medici device,

00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:29.795
of a diamond ring with three
feathers coming out of it,

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.270
and between the second
floor and the third floor,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.776
we see a device of the Rucellai family,

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:37.249
of a sail that appears to
be blowing in the wind.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.376
- [Voiceover] If you start at the bottom,

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:39.571
just like the Medici Palace,

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.196
there are benches on the ground floor,

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:44.052
which is an invitation for
the citizens of the city

00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:45.132
to come and rest.

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:46.315
- [Voiceover] So the ground floor,

00:02:46.315 --> 00:02:48.011
very much feels like the ground floor.

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:49.532
It has a sense of weightiness,

00:02:49.532 --> 00:02:52.028
that comes from that diamond pattern.

00:02:52.028 --> 00:02:53.677
- [Voiceover] And as
you move up the facade,

00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:56.137
there are three sets of pilasters.

00:02:56.137 --> 00:02:57.612
Each with different capitals.

00:02:57.612 --> 00:03:00.549
At the bottom you see variations
of the Tuscan traditions,

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.314
or of the simplest heaviest.

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:04.334
Above that a form of the Ionic,

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.052
and then at the top, Corinthian.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.793
- [Voiceover] And we see that
differentiation of orders,

00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:11.288
also if we go to the Colosseum in Rome,

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:13.274
where at the bottom we have the Tuscan.

00:03:13.274 --> 00:03:16.049
The middle story is decorated
with the Ionic order,

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.185
and at the top with the Corinthian.

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:18.812
So, Alberti is clearly looking at

00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:20.228
ancient Rome and architecture.

00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:22.654
- [Voiceover] But the building's
emphasis is not vertical,

00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:24.454
even though you've got the pilasters

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.812
moving from top to bottom.

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:27.494
Because those pilasters are interrupted

00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:29.376
by these very elaborate entablatures

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.605
that really emphasize the horizontality,

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:33.729
the grounded quality of the building.

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.528
- [Voiceover] Now the
building was never finished.

00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:38.269
About 2/3rds of what
Alberti intended is there.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.509
And you can see it's
unfinished on the right side,

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.215
and so there would have
been a third entrance.

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:44.270
- [Voiceover] Alberti did
more than simply the facade.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.906
The structure was remodeled on the inside,

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:49.832
joining a number of pre-existing
independent structures.

00:03:49.832 --> 00:03:53.385
- [Voiceover] Now Alberti may
also have designed the Loggia,

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:56.390
that is caddy-cornered to
the Palazzo, the palace.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.444
This is an open space, with round arches,

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:01.986
beautiful columns with Corinthian capitals

00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:03.948
and pilasters on the interior wall,

00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:05.690
also very classicizing.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.452
And this loggia may in
fact have been built

00:04:08.452 --> 00:04:10.403
to commemorate a wedding between

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:12.725
a member of the Medici family
and the Rucellai family.

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:15.952
So a joining of these two
powerful Florentine families.

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:17.345
- [Voiceover] Actually
it's important to note,

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:19.341
that it's no longer an open loggia,

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:20.747
it's now got a glass covering,

00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:21.988
and it's actually a shoe store.

00:04:21.988 --> 00:04:23.603
But originally it would
have been an open space

00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:26.110
that would have protected
people as they walked through.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.048
And reminds us, that even the palace,

00:04:29.048 --> 00:04:31.184
is seen a a kind of civic good.

00:04:31.184 --> 00:04:34.271
That this was adding to the
beauty and harmony of the city.

00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:36.629
- [Voiceover] Well we can see
the building of the Palazzo,

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.044
of the loggia, of this piazza in front,

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:41.482
as part of the beautification of the city.

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:43.443
that happened in the 15th century.

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:46.009
That civic pride that led
the people of Florence

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.170
to be interested in
beautifying their city,

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.211
with great works of
sculpture and architecture.

00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:52.150
- [Voiceover] So, here in the
middle of the 15th century,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.347
in the center of Florence,

00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:56.284
we have this invention of
what humanism looks like,

00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:57.920
applied to domestic architecture.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.185
(light jazz piano music)
