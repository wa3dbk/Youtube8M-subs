00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.060
REPORTER 
There are those that say that you won the
Kayak Tour this year simply because...

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.260
REPORTER
...Trip Deacon was a "no-show".
NATASHA
That guy retired. Can we keep the focus on me.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.850
REPORTER
He's changing the sport isn't he?
NATASHA
I just won the Pro Tour. Next question.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.470
FEMALE REPORTER
Natasha, do you think you're good enough to kayak without a kayak like Trip Deacon?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.619
NATASHA
This is over.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.619
(awesome music)

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.450
 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.170
He's reinventing the sport of kayaking.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.870
 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.730
Who's done this before, really?

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.280
Noone. In this day and age I mean who
can really say that they're a pioneer.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.739
I mean he's an innovator!

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.149
The dude's cutting edge, you know what I mean?

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.109
His sport is all about how there is "no" kayak.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.940
It's just a man and his paddle.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.580
Who's saying you need a kayak to go kayaking?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.580
(music)

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.850
So this is...

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.360
...my backyard this is where I keep all my
Toys...

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.619
...Which unfortunately have been getting neglected since I started...

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.000
...kayaking without a kayak. The concept is
simple. All I did was...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.330
...take the kayak out of the equation. So
it's just the paddler our there with the paddle.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.350
Nothing else.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.650
Once I found the right paddle...

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.360
... all I had to do was forget everything I knew
about kayaking in water.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.630
I can go anywhere.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.000
And it was all by just by removing that one
element, the kayak.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.409
There's nobody else that's doing what
he's doing.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.409
The world is my playground.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.230
(music)

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.230
(music)

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.660
REPORTERS
Natasha! Natasha!
FEMALE REPORTER
Natasha, Trip is gonna do Lombard Street in San Francisco. Did you know that?

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.550
No. Nobody's that good. Nobody.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.060
There's a rumor out there on the street...
...He's gonna do Lombard.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.220
Noone's done Lombard Street. It's suicide.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.230
It's the windiest street in the world, a Class 5...

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.629
...and the second you don't respect that,
you're dead.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.110
I think I have been searching for
something all my life I didn't know what

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.190
it was until now.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.360
RADIO ANNOUNCER
It's 70 degrees in the bay area
this morning.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.860
RADIO ANNOUNCER
And that's right today is that day we've
been waiting for.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.209
RADIO ANNOUNCER
Trip Deacon is gonna take on Lombard Street!
SKYLAR
He could die. He could die.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.470
I don't see people.
I don't see obstacles

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.900
I see potential.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.260
No fear. Let's do this.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.750
Once you drop in, there's no turning back.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.010
WALKIE VOICE
Cut it hard! Dig in! Dig in!

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.010
There is only one thing you need to do, and that is stay alive.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.420
If you miss one turn...
...you're gone.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.990
WALKIE VOICE
Okay Trip? Trip?!!

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.390
WALKIE VOICE
Can you hear me?!!

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.849
WALKIE VOICE
Stay with me! Stay with me!!!

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:55.849
(crowd cheers)

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.470
Thank you!

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.300
(hero music)

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.999
Whoo! This is what it's all about!

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.939
Welcome to my world. Lombard Street
was...

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:16.440
...the holy grail for me and I conquered
that. And all I gotta say is what's next?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.900
There's gonna be something next.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.970
I'm gonna eventually lose the paddle.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.840
 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.080
 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.479
