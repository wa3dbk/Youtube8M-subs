00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.000
[music]

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:13.504
As global climates
continue to change,

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:16.172
there are daily indicators
that planet Earth

00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:19.138
is falling further and
further out of balance.

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:22.004
Nowhere are these global
problems more true

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:25.218
than in the most remote
island chain in the world. 

00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:28.783
With nearly everything
consumed in the 50th state

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:30.838
brought from elsewhere,

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:33.689
fresh water in limited supply,

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:36.965
energy demands at
an all-time high,

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:39.645
and a population of
over a million people

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.951
increased by thousands
of visitors arriving daily,

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:45.131
Hawai‘i has a unique challenge

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:47.523
in a world searching
for sustainable solutions

00:00:47.523 --> 00:00:48.705
for the future.

00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:52.000
[music]

00:00:57.864 --> 00:00:59.973
Aloha. I’m Keahi Tucker. 

00:00:59.973 --> 00:01:01.763
We hear the term
“sustainability”

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:03.458
used everywhere these days.

00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:04.808
For many of us it’s a term

00:01:04.808 --> 00:01:07.374
that’s hard to apply
to our everyday lives.

00:01:07.374 --> 00:01:09.644
In a modern world,
sustainability

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:11.441
means having enough
money to pay bills

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:12.920
and put a roof over our heads.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.240
But imagine a world

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.255
where there was nowhere to go

00:01:15.255 --> 00:01:16.580
to buy what we need.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.475
This was the world
the first settlers

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:20.146
to Hawai‘i encountered.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.401
For them, sustainability meant

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:23.406
surviving in the
most remote spot

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:24.070
on the planet.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.343
If they didn’t manage
their resources properly,

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:28.049
their culture would perish.  

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.713
In the next hour we’ll discover

00:01:29.713 --> 00:01:31.551
how pre-contact
Hawaiians created

00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.829
a sustainable balance
with these lands.

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.883
We’ll also learn how
Kamehameha Schools

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:37.977
integrates values of environment,

00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:42.103
education, economics,
culture and community

00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:43.971
to create balance
for the future,

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.362
while using principles
and techniques

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:47.089
it’s learned from the past.

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:51.000
[music]

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.954
Nature ruled these islands

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:11.319
long before man ever did.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.936
The balance of life
was regulated

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:14.584
through the natural
ebb and flow

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:15.973
of the elements.

00:02:15.973 --> 00:02:18.058
These elements
constantly changed

00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:21.310
the face of Hawai‘i’s landscape,
which, in turn,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.000
affected relationships among
all living creatures

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.584
on and around the islands. 

00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:30.237
When man finally discovered
this remote paradise,

00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:34.209
they learned to adapt to
what nature had to offer.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.000
They came only with what
they carried in a canoe,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.315
and from that humble
beginning, created a culture

00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:42.728
that thrived for
hundreds of years. 

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:46.000
[man chanting]

00:02:51.182 --> 00:02:53.603
Based on archeological
finds, historians estimate

00:02:53.603 --> 00:02:54.850
that a few hundred years ago

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.095
there were as many as
one million people

00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:58.940
living in the Hawaiian Islands,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.490
yet there was an
abundance of wild life,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.224
ample resources,

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.215
plus, needs for
shelter, clothing, 

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:06.870
and most impressively food

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.437
were all handily met.

00:03:09.437 --> 00:03:10.921
All these feats were
achieved through

00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:13.905
a system that was as
ingenious as it was imperative—

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:16.000
the ahupua‘a.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
[music]

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:24.324
Ahupua‘a were divided
into unique sections,

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:26.013
and each played
a specific role

00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:27.973
for the community
as a whole.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:29.456
Some windward side ahupua‘a

00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:30.952
had certain similarities.

00:03:30.952 --> 00:03:33.718
A forest, predominately
Koa, might inhabit

00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:35.076
the mauka lands.

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:37.552
A fresh water stream
making its way to the ocean

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:39.682
might be diverted
to a lowland area

00:03:39.682 --> 00:03:42.069
to supply water for
crops such as taro,

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.774
and a coastal region

00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:44.946
would offer access for fishing

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:46.678
and aquaculture—

00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:48.022
all the things the community

00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:51.225
in that ahupua‘a
needed to survive.

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:54.841
[Ramsay Taum:]
If you abused the resources—
misused the resources,

00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:56.378
at some point in
time you’d find that

00:03:56.378 --> 00:03:58.362
you didn’t have
those resources.

00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:01.152
So, the relationship
between my behavior

00:04:01.152 --> 00:04:03.105
and the ability
of the ahupua‘a

00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:04.883
to feed me and
my community

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:06.743
was an intimate one.

00:04:06.743 --> 00:04:08.250
[music]

00:04:10.613 --> 00:04:12.376
[Keahi Tucker:]
One organization
looking at that

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:14.444
ahupua‘a system of the past

00:04:14.444 --> 00:04:16.945
to find a way to manage
lands for the future

00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:19.136
is Kamehameha Schools.

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:21.458
With sustainability
becoming a key component

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.049
to their land management,

00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:25.347
Hawai‘i’s largest
private land owner

00:04:25.347 --> 00:04:27.008
has recognized stewardship

00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:29.750
as a key focal point
in their mission.

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:32.899
It was the last
direct descendent

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.598
of Kamehameha the First,

00:04:34.598 --> 00:04:36.470
Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.775
whose legacy lands placed
Kamehameha Schools

00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:42.515
at the forefront of responsible
land management in Hawai‘i.

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.649
Her lands were left to
sustain the mission

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:47.079
of educating children of
Hawaiian ancestry

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.829
in perpetuity.

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:52.032
So with 367,000 acres

00:04:52.032 --> 00:04:54.537
stretched over the state’s
five main islands, 

00:04:54.537 --> 00:04:56.375
Kamehameha Schools has become

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:59.014
a fully privately
funded entity.

00:04:59.014 --> 00:05:02.184
But the ongoing question
for this perpetual trust

00:05:02.184 --> 00:05:04.965
has been how to best
utilize its resources

00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:07.108
to fulfill the
princess’s wishes

00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:09.440
while preserving its
Hawaiian heritage

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.536
and preparing for the future.

00:05:12.536 --> 00:05:15.639
[Neil Hannahs:]
We have no exit strategy for
Hawai‘i—we’re here to stay.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.841
We don’t want to
harvest value

00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:19.928
and then leave the
place depleted,

00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:22.342
and move on to another place.

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:25.000
We want to enrich this place.

00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:30.073
[Keahi Tucker:]
It’s this desire to
enrich the islands

00:05:30.073 --> 00:05:31.725
that has led
Kamehameha Schools

00:05:31.725 --> 00:05:34.193
to work with a variety of groups
from around the islands 

00:05:34.193 --> 00:05:36.512
to restore sections
of ahupua‘a

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:37.798
on its lands,

00:05:37.798 --> 00:05:40.007
and a natural place to start

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:42.266
was the mauka forests.
