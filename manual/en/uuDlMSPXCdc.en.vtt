Hi! I am Debbie with Expert Village.com and
I am here today to show you some really fun

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.139
ways to work on not only fine motor skills,
you can work on maths skills, counting, patterning,

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.779
anything you can think of and you can tie
this in with your Thanksgiving learning with

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.940
your young learner on the types of jewelery
that the Native Americans wore and what they

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.850
might wear to their first thanksgiving. This
happens to be a thanksgiving activity that

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.610
they were working on today, but again it can
be anytime, anywhere a great fine motor eye-hand

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.091
coordination activity. What you will need
at your local craft store you can buy, this

00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:49.510
one happens to be made with the plastic type
string, which works great. This is the leather,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.530
more authentic looking type of string. I like
this one a little bit better because when

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.990
you are talking about the Native Americans
they used animal skin, they used the different

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.300
parts of the animals to make their clothing
and make their jewelery, and so this one looks

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.851
just a little more authentic. Not to mention
the slick string is a little hard for the

00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:12.630
little ones, they will get all their beads
on and then let go of it and they will all

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.190
fly off. This one they stay on a little bit
better so it is a little less frustrating

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.200
for the little ones. First of all, you are
going to need also some beads from your local

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.590
craft store. First I talked to my kids that
Native American didnâ€™t have plastic beads

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.830
from the craft store. They used shells and
they used animal bones and things like that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.420
to make their jewelery, they dyed it different
colors to make it colorful. We are pretending

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.479
and we are using our beads. As part of your
math instruction for the day, if you are so

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.010
inclined, we talk about making a patten and
making a plan before they make their necklace.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.870
So what I have my children do, first of all,
put their beads in a divided dish, they are

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.380
not going to get mixed up and they are not
going to spill, ask your child, how they want

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.930
to design their necklace and it is completely
up to them. You can talk about the kind of

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:13.519
pattern you want to make, so we can first
make our pattern, I am going to do three reds,

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:22.010
two blacks, three yellows and there is my
pattern. Now I ask my child to repeat that

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.909
pattern, so what would come next; three reds,
two blacks, and three yellows, so that pattern

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:38.060
would repeat itself, and I would have my child
to make the pattern probably about the length

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.510
of this mat, you donâ€™t want it too long,
and we would continuing repeating the pattern.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.544
Then when we get our string and the beauty
of this string is that your beads are not

00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:57.220
going to fall off and again those fine motor
skills are working, working, working. Their

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.540
eye-hand coordination getting the bead on
the string is such a great activity for young

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.590
kids. So they would continue beading until
they got all their beads on, and we would

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:21.010
tie it up, and they would have a beautiful
necklace for girls or boys because we know

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.549
the Native American men wear lots of jewelery
as well, and you could end up in something

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:28.999
like this.
