Hi! I’m Cherie Terry of Cherie Terry’s
Permanent Cosmetics in Sedona, Arizona and

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.320
on behalf of expertvillage.com. I'm here to
show you a birthmark not a birthmark but a

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.380
beauty mark. We have decided to put a beauty
mark on this side of the face right up in

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.650
here. Joyce has requested it to be in brown
you really don't want that to be in black.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.090
If you are thinking of having on done don't
let them convince you to it in black. Black

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.110
is made with blue as it fades it turns to
blue. The brown has a more of a red base to

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.530
so as it fades it will look more natural on
her. She would come back in probably in 3

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.720
weeks to have it checked, to have enough color
put in. Color builds with color so when you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.170
put two on two it would actually last longer.
She would also do the same with the brows.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.750
I'm going to lay her back. You don't need
any anesthetic or anything for this. This

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.480
is a two second procedure. So you just go
in there you add the color and you come out

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.931
and she is done. She would keep it clean and
keep it moisturize for the next week. If it

00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:48.039
scabs color could pull scab so she would keep
it moist with Vaseline as it is healing. Okay

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.670
and we are done.
