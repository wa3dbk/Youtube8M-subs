We all know that NOAA satellites help

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.100
us forecast weather on Earth. But did you know that some weather satellites

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.140
also forecast weather in space? 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.230

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.270
So why is

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.300
forecasting space weather important? The changing environmental conditions

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.320
from the Sun's atmosphere are known as space weather. Space weather is caused by

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.330
electromagnetic radiation and charged particles being released from solar storms.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.390
Changes in the magnetic fields and a continuous flow of solar particles during a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.410
powerful storm headed to Earth could cause disruption to communications and result

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.410
in exposure to dangerous radiation. Space weather

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.420
can disrupt high-frequency radio communications used by pilots. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.450
During geomagnetic storms, airplanes flying over the poles are diverted or rerouted 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.460
so they don't lose critical positioning and communication with air traffic

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.470
control. Nowadays, farmers rely strongly on

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.490
high-precision GPS satellites to determine what to plant and where to plant it.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.510
If GPS technology is affected by space weather, it could produce faulty coordinates,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.520
resulting in losses for farmers.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.530
During a solar storm, satellite TV, satellite radio, and other

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.560
satellite-based communications are at risk. Satellite operators have to avoid

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.640
certain operations, like uploading new software or executing complicated

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.660
maneuvers, because the data could be corrupted, or the entire satellite could even

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.690
be damaged. Electric power workers are also 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.720
affected by space weather, because large storms can induce currents in the electrical grid.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.730
overloading transformers, and causing massive blackouts.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.740
Space weather can also bring damaging radiation to 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.740
astronauts in space. Astronauts need to know when they should avoid space-walks,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.840
and stay in better-shielded areas of the International Space Station.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.930
Early warning for these users is absolutely critical, which is

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.950
why scientists and forecasters monitor GOES and other satellite data

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.990
around the clock. The next generation of GOES

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.040
weather satellites will provide the improved the data that space weather forecasters need

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.070
to detect initial solar flare eruptions and issue critical early warnings.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.170
GOES-R data will also help forecasters measure radiation from the storm,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.190
and determine the final impact.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.380
Loaded with improved space weather instruments, the GOES-R series of satellites will provide 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.380
continuous delivery of crucial information to all users impacted by weather, not only

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.570
here on Earth, but also in space.
