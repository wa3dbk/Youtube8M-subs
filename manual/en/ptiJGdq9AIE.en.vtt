00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.324
(rock music)

00:00:02.893 --> 00:00:05.201
- Mallory, what are we making?

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:06.219
- Actually I don't know.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:06.980
(both laugh)

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.676
- We showing people how to
smuggle booze on a cruise ship.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.086
The thing with cruise ships is

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:12.641
they don't like you to
bring on your own alcohol,

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:14.718
okay you show up there
with your bottle of rum

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:16.405
they can take it from
you and put it in storage

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:17.779
or something and give
it to you at the end,

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.523
because they make their
money on alcohol sales, okay?

00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:21.498
- That makes sense.

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:22.564
- But their drinks expensive.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:23.429
- Yeah.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.637
- So here's how you beat the system.

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:25.486
- Ooh!

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:26.917
- [Man] First thing's first
you want to get yourself

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:28.765
one of these green
Listerine bottles, right,

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:32.684
and you want to gently
cut right along edges,

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:34.324
you see what I'm saying?

00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:36.406
Get right in there.

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:39.157
- What?

00:00:39.157 --> 00:00:41.493
- [Man] Yeah, I told you the
smuggling operation okay,

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:44.877
if you're already, you know, (unclear)

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.941
then you don't want to
step in on this one.

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:47.785
I got it.

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:48.698
- [Mallory] Okay.

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.563
- [Man] Bingo.

00:00:50.563 --> 00:00:51.722
(both laugh)

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.583
- So now we empty out the Listerine.

00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.011
- And save it because we all
know it's very expensive.

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:02.235
- Exactly because I
need to use this again.

00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:03.251
- Yeah you will.

00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:04.875
- Girls love my fresh breath.

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:06.315
- (laughs)

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:07.995
- Smell that? Sexy.
- Gross.

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:09.689
- So once empty you have to wash it out,

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.212
you don't want any
Listerine residue, homeboy.

00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:13.246
- No no no.

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:15.524
- This here bottle's
clean, put in our funnel,

00:01:15.524 --> 00:01:17.020
go ahead pour in a bottle of vodka.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.076
- Okay.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.691
I have a question, why
are we using this funnel?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.451
- [Man] You don't have to but I like

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.982
to use the funnel to keep everything neat.

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:26.998
- Oh.

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.501
- So now we gotta make this
look like that green Listerine.

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.863
So I need you to put
in three drops of blue,

00:01:33.863 --> 00:01:35.269
one drop of green, okay?

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:36.115
- [Mallory] Okay.

00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:37.581
- We're using food coloring.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:39.173
- Oh my gosh.

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:41.539
- This will not destroy the
integrity of your water.

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:42.940
- Your water?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.940
- I mean of your booze- one, two, three.

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:49.947
- [Mallory] And then one drop of green.

00:01:49.947 --> 00:01:53.059
- [Man] And one drop of green, perfect!

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:57.558
Now we'll cover this up and
give it a nice little shaking.

00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:04.635
- Oh my God! That looks like
the blue Listerine mouthwash!

00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:08.291
That is genius.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.624
- [Mallory] Okay, how much?

00:02:10.624 --> 00:02:11.961
- [Man] Just like a shot, uh-

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.553
- [Mallory] Oh! (laughs)

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.276
This is going to be a strong drink!

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:20.204
- [Man] Hit that with some
orange juice. (laughs)

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:21.740
Okay.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.015
- I have to pee.

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:25.177
- (laughs) I'm not cutting that, okay?

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:26.750
I have to peeâ€¦&nbsp;how old are you, 12?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.934
- (laughs)

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:31.732
- And there you have it, a
Listerine smuggling operation.

00:02:31.732 --> 00:02:33.604
- Oh my God I didn't
know you were filming.

00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:35.879
(laughs) Cheers!

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.540
- Tastes just like vodka.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.644
Now be advised cruise ships might be

00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:41.300
slightly hip to this because there are

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.156
a couple of videos online about this,

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:45.444
and you could play with
this color to change it up,

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:47.492
go a little bit easier on
the blue maybe a little bit

00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:50.122
more green to bring the color
out even a little bit more.

00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:52.000
So cruise ships might be a
little hip to this, okay?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.712
So what you want to do is
if you go with your girl,

00:02:54.712 --> 00:02:57.024
wrap your Listerine in her underwear

00:02:57.024 --> 00:02:58.929
and when my boy touches it you go, "Hey!

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.720
"That's my woman's underwear!

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.832
"I want to see the admiral right now!

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:04.904
"Bring me the freakin' admiral homeboy,

00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:06.160
"what kind of pervert are you?"

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.144
That's right get upset,
you know what I mean?

00:03:08.144 --> 00:03:10.238
You go with the family
wrap it in granny's drawers

00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:11.510
because even if my boy sees it,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.160
he could be like, "Ain't
no way I'm touching that,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.360
"go ahead, go ahead homeboy,
go ahead, you deserve a drink,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.208
"after wrapping it in
grandma's underwear," alright?

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:19.068
