00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:03.183
Let it rain!

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.219
So I did a lot of thinking last night,
and there's something
I'm pretty excited about.

00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:09.663
What's up? Nice.

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:14.364
Let it rain!
I feel like I might be ready to move on.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.532
You know, get my life back on track.

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:19.975
So, I am going to ask
Polly Prince on a date.

00:00:20.044 --> 00:00:23.377
Oh, that's a mistake!
She's not right for you, dude.

00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:25.781
Rain dance!

00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:28.445
Hey, you guys
want to play some twos?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.251
Actually, we're kind of
in the middle of a conversation, so...
You douche bags bring your "A" game?

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:34.258
What was that?

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:37.888
I'm just messing with you,
sasquatch. Let's get it on.

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:42.731
Pick and roll! Pick and roll!
Outlet! Outlet!

00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:46.203
Rain dance!
Sandy, come on.

00:00:46.273 --> 00:00:48.241
Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!

00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:50.071
[Yells]
Sandy!

00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:51.771
Sandy!
White chocolate!

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:55.477
Raindrop!

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.779
Old school!

00:00:57.852 --> 00:00:59.945
"T." "T."

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:03.286
Time-out. I'm burning.
My lungs are burning.

00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:07.522
Time-out. Time-out.
So why do you think
Polly's so wrong for me?

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:09.928
[Panting]

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:11.966
You don't even know
this girl, Reuben.

00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:13.968
You haven't seen her
since seventh grade.

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:17.598
How different could she be?
I mean, she was a senior delegate
at the Model U.N.

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:20.199
She was in the chess club.
She was a "mathlete."

00:01:20.276 --> 00:01:23.177
Her yearbook stats are really impressive.
Did you see the tattoo on her back?

00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:25.043
Yeah. So what?

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:28.277
Mathletes don't wear body art
like that. 'Nuff said. Ball in!

00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:32.083
I really feel like
I ran into Polly for a reason.

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:34.681
Really. I mean, I'm sorry
if you don't agree, Sandy,

00:01:34.758 --> 00:01:37.283
but I happen to believe
in a little thing called destiny.

00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:42.532
You guys ready?

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:46.500
You know what? You think maybe
you could put your shirt back on?

00:01:47.772 --> 00:01:49.706
You guys ready to play?

00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:58.875
Good shot. Good shot.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.476
Could I have the ball for a second?
Could I have the ball?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.287
Hey, you know what?
Could we switch?

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:13.993
I'd rather not, dude. I just found out
how to cover this man right here, okay?

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.001
Come on, let's play.

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:30.317
[Groans]

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.725
Ohh!
