Tech Laboratories presents:
How to Cut a Calcite Polarizing Prism

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.710
In 25 Easy Steps.  Step 1. Locate the
optical axis of the crystal by finding

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.409
the two vertices with obtuse

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.589
angles. The perpendicular bisector of these
vertices is the optical axis

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.439
Step Two. Fold flattened aluminum foil into a
workspace to a affix your shapping

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.359
sandpaper

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.489
Step Three. Cut and tape a quarter sheet
over 150 grit sandpaper to the aluminum

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.210
foil.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.720
Step 4. Coat the sandpaper in petroleum jelly.
This reduces the build up of heat

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.430
and contains the scouring dust as a
paste so that it can easily be wiped

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.790
away

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.440
Step Five. Grind the crystal against the
sandpaper to shape the crystal. The plan

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.080
is to create

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.840
a Glan-Thompson prism, which requires
cutting two identical right triangular

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.440
prisms

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.100
and joining them at their hypotenuses 
with optical glue.  The e- and o-rays will

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.160
strike the separation surface at
different angles, one which will be

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.720
reflected

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.660
out a different face of the prism while
the other is transmitted nearly

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450
unchanged.  Step Six.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.970
Repeat steps 2-5, replacing the
sandpaper as it wears out and the

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.159
aluminum foil when it gets too messy to
work with.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.420
Continue shaping the crystal until you
achieve the rough shape needed for the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.310
prism.  Step Seven. When the perpendicular
edges begin to chip that 150 grit, stop

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.920
and repeat steps 2 through 6

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
using 220 grit paper until the near- 
perfect prism shape is achieved.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.990
Step Eight. Repeat steps one through seven
for the second piece of crystal to make

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.740
the other half of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.560
the prism. Step 9. Cut small pieces of
320 grit sandpaper

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.979
Step Ten.  Using a cotton swab apply
petroleum jelly to one surface of the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.149
crystal. Step 11. Sand the surface with 320
grit sandpaper until all the scoring

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.490
marks from the 220 grit

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.459
are ground away.  Step 12.  Repeat steps nine
to 11 for each surface of the crystal.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:44.149
Step thirteen. Repeat steps 9 to 12 using 600
to 1000 and 3000 grit sandpaper. Step 14

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.869
Put on gloves and eye protection - it gets
really messy from here on out

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.090
and we want to protect the crystal from
your fingerprints. Step 15.  Using a cotton

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.409
swab apply a small amount of polishing
compound to one of the crystal faces

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.200
Step 16. Use the polishing tool attachment
of a rotary tool to rub the face of the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.719
crystal

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.329
Step 17. Repeat steps 15 and 16 until the face 
no longer appears cloudy under a hand lens.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.659
Step 18. Repeat steps 15 through 17 for
each crystal face. Step nineteen apply a

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.120
small amount at Norland optical adhesive
61 to the desired crystal face Step 20.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.940
Align the second prism fragment on the first.
Step 21 expose the glue to a small

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.490
amount of ultraviolet light to begin the
curing process.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.290
Step 22. Once the two pieces are holding
together placed them under UV lamp to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.810
cure the adhesive. Step 23.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.960
Move the finished prism to a makeshift
optical bench for testing.  Step 24. Watch how it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.910
properly separates the perpendicular and
polarized laser beams.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.510
Step 25. Curse the fact that you got the
angle partially wrong so the beams are not

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.190
exiting to the different crystal faces
and are getting a doubled

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.190
image and have no additional material or time
to try it again.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.120

In 1828,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.200
William Nicol cut calcite crystal for
the first time

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.270
in a way that they could create the first
transmissive polarizer. Calcite and crystals

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.510
like that still play an important
role in polarization today, specifically

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.940
with high-powered lasers - you can't use a
polarizing filter

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.840
because I wouldn't burn through the
filter and melt it. The same thing would

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.580
use whenever..

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.610
the same ~burp~ the same

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.100
Blech.
