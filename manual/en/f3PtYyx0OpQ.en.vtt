00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.599
The idea behind the photo shoot is to get
athlete Rachel Morris in a location with a

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.599
lot of motion, a lot of movement, something
just quite stunning.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.340
We have got 4-5 different shots to do this evening. Rachel is in makeup.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.320
But we have got some challenges to overcome.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.600
Welcome to the world of British weather. 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.339
Alright mate, what I'll probably do, is, I'll send

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.079
Sam in, and we will get everyone together.
And we will get them out here and we will

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.959
cover everyone up. Okay, cheers. 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.620
You would think we are building a reflector, but we are not. 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.740
We are actually building a weather
proof cover for Rachel.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.100
With this weather we will try and do,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.580
is, that Rachel will be in her chair in an evening outfit, and we will try 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.860
and get some reflections in the foreground,
we will have water spraying everywhere.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.860
A bit later we will get light trails. Rachel
is a really fast, world beater in hand-cycling.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.479
What we might do, the idea really for the
last shot, is her being faster than the AMG Mercedes. 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.740
Today, I'm using the Phase One IQ250
on a 645DF+ with the Schneider 28mm leaf shutter lens

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.100
allowing me to use the flash sync speeds,
and we are using the radio for the Profoto lights.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.760
We have got one final shot. Sun has
gone down. We are really hitting this now,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.560
we are going to put a generator in with continuous
lights. So we are going to run up about 4

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.700
or 5 seconds, change exposure, on the shutter
speed alone we are are running about an f16

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.290
on the flash lights, so we are going to change
it so that we can get some movement in the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.750
shot. We are going to have the water sprays
going and it started to rain again.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.340
So we have come here. We nailed it. Didn't really
think we would get it actually, in the English

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.480
weather. We are still here. The sun has gone
down. We have some fantastic photos.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.760
Really looking forward to seeing this in the new
Capture One Pro 8. 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.700
We are back in the office.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.569
The shoot with Rachel went really well. We
imported the files and we are ready now to

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.569
process in Capture One Pro 8. Now everything
is in Capture One, we star rated, and the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.320
major ones are that we really want to use
are five star rated which we can see here

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.910
as our final images.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.020
This is one of my favourite images of Rachel. It has got great sky, great face

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.400
on Rachel, she is looking fantastic.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.940
My normal workflow is to make sure that we have got the colour balance absolutely bang on,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.980
got the exposure correct and the levels and everything. 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.160
However, with the new software
there are some tools we would like to have

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.880
a look at. Just to make sure 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.379
that we are getting the best out of our images.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.999
We will have a look at the new and improved HDR tool.

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.839
What I have noticed with the new HDR tool is that

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.379
it is much more natural than the one we had
before. It just gives us that slightly less

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.599
overcooked look. 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.779
One of the things that we have noticed here is that we would like to get rid of this moving plane,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.159
which looks like a little bit of hair. What I'll do is

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.699
use the new clone repair layer. 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:19.419
Using the local brush, we are going to paint it out just very roughly going over the airplane.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.420
And you can see that it has got an area it is cloning from. 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.900
We can move that area and
then we can see how it is going.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.660
One of the fabulous tools on this is that you can change
in the adjustment layer here to heal or clone

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.940
after you have done the work. You can then
work out which one is best for you.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.020
I'm happy with the way the image is now looking in
the software. We are going to make a new clone variant

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.820
To show Rachel some different options
I'll use some of the new styles.

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.189
It gives us a really quick way of getting some new
looks instantly.

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.500
I have gone through quite a few of the style options. 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.480
This is one of my favourites they put in which is the black and white tone blue 1.
