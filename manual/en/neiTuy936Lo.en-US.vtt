00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.830
Hey guys so I wanted to show you a project

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.220
That I just finished up a little while ago

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.349
It's a bottle opener as you can see and

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.420
I've goy my favorite NFL team there

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.410
But whats different about this is that

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.500
it has is this rare earth magnet in the back

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.380
And what you do is you have your bottle right

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.369
And when you open it it just kind of drops
the cap

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.970
And it catches it right there So its pretty
cool

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.449
I've seen these in some craft fairs and I've
seen these on line

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.010
I've always kind of wondered how people made
these

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.090
So it's a very simple project and I've got
more

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.800
Detailed pictures as well as some links of
where

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.360
I got the hardware at on my website at woodlogger.com

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.760
And of course here comes the video of what
I did to make this

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.470
So it's just a simple board and I decided
to just

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.900
Use my Miter Saw for the cut on that and

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.150
I took that over to the router table and

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.280
Just did a simple chamfer all around the whole
sides of it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.900
Next up I wanted to drill a key hole slot
into the back of it

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.400
For mounting and I've this sort of drill guide
from

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.110
Rockler that I like to use and it does a pretty
good job

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.180
It helps kind of keep everything centered
and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.970
It helps you line things up a little bit easier

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:31.700
When your making your cuts

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.990
Next up I head over to the drill press and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.490
I used a 2 inch forstner bit to drill the
hole that

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.380
I need for my magnet and I probably could
have got

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.840
Away with a smaller size magnet maybe a 1
inch or

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.420
A 1 and a half inch since this is really the
first

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.549
Time I've ever used anything like this I kind
of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.170
Wanted to go big so I drilled about a half
an inch

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.330
In and it worked pretty well

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.710
So after I finished with the drill press I
moved on to sanding

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.110
The whole board front and back and then

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.790
I decided to use a golden oak finish its

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.590
Just a min-wax finish and the stain on it
looks

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.090
Really great it's an oak board so the oak
finish on it

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.140
Really just makes it look that classic look

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.340
But I like it and I think it turned out really
well

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.120
And after I finished staining it I did go
back

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.190
And put a glossy sealer on top of it just
to protect it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.890
And I think I actually did two coats to that
as I recall

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:56.470
So after the finish finished drying I inserted

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.240
The magnet that I had for it and it really
was

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.900
A perfect fit and it worked just great and
later

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.849
I did do some epoxy to help hold that in there

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.050
Although I don't know that I really needed
to do that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.730
And then the last piece really is just to
attach

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.130
The bottle opener itself and I did pre-drill
holes

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:30.810
For that you don't see it in the video it's
Pretty straight forward

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.489
So thats pretty much it Thats the bottle opener
with

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.000
The magnetic catch at the bottom it's a pretty
straight forward fun

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.780
easy project to do and as always you check
out
