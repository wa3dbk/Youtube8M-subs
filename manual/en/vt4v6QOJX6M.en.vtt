Hi, do you have pericoronitis? Well, my name
is Michelle, and I'm a Dental Assistant with

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.639
Solutionz, and I'm going to explain to you
on how you can treat pericoronitis. Fir first

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.799
of all, one of the ways that you can prevent
pericoronitis is actually by brushing your

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.430
teeth; really focusing back in that area.
How pericoronitis starts is when your wisdom

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.340
teeth are starting to erupt they don't erupt
fully. They are like what we call as partial

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.340
eruption, where half of the tooth is showing
and the other half is still buried below the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.790
gum, and that gum tissue flap is actually
over your tooth, so it allows bacteria and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.000
debris to kind of seep up underneath the tissue,
and it also start, it causes an infection.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
So what you would need to do is you would
need to see your general dentist, so therefore;

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.250
he could maybe clean out that area for you
better than what you are able to do. And then,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.790
he would also be able to maybe prescribe something;
as far as like rinsing your mouth out with

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.140
warm salt water rinses, and really focusing
in that area in swishing out the rinse in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.260
between the teeth to really flush out all
the bacteria and debris that you might have.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.470
Also too, taking the bristles and really,
with your toothbrush, and really focusing

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.540
on getting up and under the gum to clean out
the bacteria, which would prevent further

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.630
infection. Placing some Orajel, which is what
you can buy over the counter. It's it's like

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.740
a medicated numbing agent that you can place
on the gum tissue that would help with any

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.619
pain or discomfort that you might having.
It'll actually numb the area for a good thirty

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.659
to forty five minutes, and you can continuously
repeat that, and place the gel on there to

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.240
prevent with any pain, but definitely you
want to see your general dentist. He would

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.560
be able to treat it better for you, and help
you keep it cleaned out until your wisdom

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.780
tooth fully erupts and then you're able to
have the tooth extracted. Once again, my name

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.439
is Michelle, and I'm a Dental Assistant, and
I just explained to you on how you can treat

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.100
pericoronitis.
