00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:09.485
This test method is for testing
painted wood and metal surfaces
for the presence of lead.

00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:14.180
This method is described in
detail in the instructions that
are in your kit.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.078
For this test you will need
one or more 3M LeadCheck
Swabs.

00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:24.707
3M LeadCheck Swabs can detect
lead at the level of 600
parts per million.

00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:30.422
Note you will need a separate 3M
LeadCheck Swab for each area to
be directly tested.

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:33.922
You will also need a
sharp utility knife.

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:36.512
You should also have some
alcohol wipes on hand to

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:40.892
clean the blade of the knife
before and after testing each
area.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.380
This is done to
prevent cross contamination.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.060
It is important that each test
be conducted in exactly the same
manner.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.280
Do not squeeze the 3M LeadCheck
Swab until the area to be tested
has been prepared.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.241
Once the chemicals inside have
been mixed and activated,

00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.760
they remain effective for
approximately 90 seconds.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.820
Before testing the painted
surface, use the clean
utility knife to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.620
cut through the paint layers
to the bare substrate.

00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:14.216
Now you may prepare to
activate the 3M LeadCheck Swab.

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:19.388
Note that there are two separate
glass ampoules inside each 3M
LeadCheck Swab.

00:01:19.388 --> 00:01:23.183
And that both must be crushed
to activate the reagent liquid.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:27.203
Do not crush these ampoules
unless the cardboard cover is in
place,

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:31.100
completely covering both
of the glass ampoules.

00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:38.948
Now activate the 3M LeadCheck
Swab by firmly squeezing each
end at the points marked A and B

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:44.205
on the cardboard cover until you
can feel and hear the ampoules
inside being crushed.

00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:49.585
Shake the tube vigorously for a
few moments to be sure that the
chemicals inside have mixed.

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:55.757
The 3M LeadCheck Swab is now
activated and ready for use.

00:01:55.757 --> 00:01:59.219
Squeeze the tube until you see a
bit of the reagent liquid
soaking down through the fibers

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.432
of the swab and appearing
at the end of the swab tip.

00:02:03.432 --> 00:02:06.893
Firmly rub the wet tip of the
swab across the

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.604
surface at the point where you
cut through the paint layers.

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:12.191
Continue to gently
squeeze the sides of the tube.

00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:16.362
Apply only enough pressure to
keep the tip wet with the
reagent liquid.

00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:22.701
If lead is present in any of the
paint layers, you may see a pink
to red reaction on contact.

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:25.454
Red means lead.

00:02:25.454 --> 00:02:30.376
If not, rub the area until color
develops, but not longer than 30
seconds.

00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:37.716
If the swab and surface remain
unchanged after 30 seconds, lead
has not been detected.

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:43.305
If the test is negative, confirm
the reactivity of the 3M
LeadCheck reagent by squeezing a

00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:47.925
drop of the reagent liquid onto
one of the test confirmation
cards.

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:50.260
The circle should
instantly turn red.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.233
Don't forget, red means lead.

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:58.445
Testing some industrial paints
requires longer development
time.

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:01.823
Read the instructions regarding
chromate paint

00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:03.908
in your instruction sheet for
more information.

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:08.080
Pigments containing lead
chromate are rarely found in
household paints.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.666
3M LeadCheck
Swabs do not expire.

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:14.003
So when filling out the EPA
form, use the lot number

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:17.923
shown on the swab in the
expiration date field.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.060
   The lot number can be found on
the cardboard cover or on the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.500
plastic tube underneath the
cardboard cover.
