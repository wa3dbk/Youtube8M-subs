00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.859
If we wanted to make a cloud entirely from
scratch, we’d first need a fleet of jumbo

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.650
jets or several hundred hot-air balloons to
haul hundreds of tons of water up to the sky.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.860
And then, somehow, we’d need to disperse
all that liquid into a mist of droplets small

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.330
enough to float.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.070
In short, it wouldn’t be easy.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.010
And yet, our atmosphere manages to pump out
one cloud after another all over the world

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.650
at altitudes of up to 20 kilometers above
sea level, using water and fuel carried all

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.230
the way from Earth’s surface.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.649
Cumulus clouds, for example get their start
when solar energy evaporates water from oceans,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.000
plants, and soil by breaking the bonds that
hold water molecules together.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.829
As the patch of air above collects moisture
and heat cooler, heavier air sinks around

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.250
it pinching it off and pushing it aloft like
an invisible hot-air balloon.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.000
Surprisingly, this balloon’s cargo doesn’t
weigh it down – in fact, the more water

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.550
vapor it collects before lift-off, the lighter
it gets.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.041
As weird as that sounds, it’s because water
vapor is a gas just like the nitrogen and

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.309
oxygen that make up most of the atmosphere.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.360
Basic physics dictates that a given volume
of gas has the same number of molecules regardless

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.190
of what those molecules are.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.400
And water is made of H plus H plus O, which
is lighter than both two Ns and two Os.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.299
So warm, humid air is even more buoyant than
warm, dry air.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.670
As the invisible balloon goes up, the falling
pressure outside allows it to keep ballooning,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.690
which spreads out its internal heat and lowers
its temperature.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.820
Eventually, the air at the top cools enough
for the water vapor there to condense into

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.770
droplets, which look from afar like a thin
wisp of cloud.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.670
And as the rest of the balloon rises, water
vapor continues to cool and condense at the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.759
same altitude, creating a flat-bottomed cloud
that appears to grow upward out of nothing.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.780
What’s more, as the condensing water vapor
molecules bond together into liquid droplets,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.950
they release the energy they absorbed from
Earth’s surface when they evaporated.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.190
This heats the surrounding pocket of air,
giving it lift and sucking more moist air

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.770
up behind it [updraft], which cools and condenses
and releases heat, which fuels lift and strengthens

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.220
the updraft.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.019
Even in a small cumulus cloud , the total
energy released from condensation is huge

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.159
– equivalent to about 270 tons of TNT.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.180
And if the supply of water vapor is much larger,
the energy released can produce stratosphere-high

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.900
pillars of cloud with violent updrafts, fierce
electrical storms, and grapefruit-sized hailstones.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:03:08.310
Not good weather for hot air ballooning.
