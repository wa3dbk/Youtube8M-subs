00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.269
hello my name is Jurgen Reusswig
games distillery

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.309
with the second part of our Citadels
video series

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.529
in the first part I introduced the
construction and economy components

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.020
today were mainly going to deal with the
construction of defenses

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:30.020
in particular castle building have fun
watching Citadels making of part two

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.950
after building my first
settlement and getting a flourishing

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.630
economy

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.720
up and running it's time to start
thinking about

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.500
defenses Citadels is a strategy game
as I've said

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.640
it's clear that at some point in the
game I'm either going to be attacked

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.070
or will have to attack an opponent
myself

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.180
when it comes to defenses we have an
elaborate system of various defensive

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.800
works

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.089
which I can piece together like a set of
building blocks

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.700
and turn my little settlement into a
sizable castle

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.509
so now let's start constructing our
first defenses

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.550
I need to find a strategic place to
build my first tower

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.670
towers are the strategic points that I
set where I want my defenses to start

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.210
from

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.310
these can be connected
by walls

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.820
or large gates so that my workers can
still get in and out

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.590
while my tower is still being built I
can carry on planning my defenses

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.360
I can now attach a gate

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.360
to the placeholder for my tower and plan
my defensive line

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.110
in this way I can even build
a defensive ring using walls

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.179
which can also be manned by defensive units or
using outlying towers

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.519
which automatically attack invaders

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.709
here we can see the first gate
has already been built

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.709
and I can now start connecting it with
walls towers need to be assigned

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.050
entrances

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.640
so that I can dispatch units to the
walls later on I can simply position

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.040
them

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.280
as I see fit the biggest and
most important defensive

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.650
buildings is the castle itself the
castle building

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.790
this consists a building with four
towers

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.530
which automatically shoot in all
directions to defend the castle

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.430
this is the actual castle

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.720
the strongest defensive building in
citadels

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.489
so my first
defensive ring

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.290
is now complete and I can also attach my
defensive works

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.329
to any tower

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.730
that means they behave
like

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.639
any normal tower for example I can now
attach a stretch of wall to

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.670
any of these towers and in turn attach a
tower to this wall

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.579
so now I can see that my defenses are
connected to my castle

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.819
and now one very important feature

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.400
is that I can of course send units up
onto the walls

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.530
in this instance I'm going to use

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.150
two workers of course this is really
useful later on with

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.819
archers who with the benefit of the
height advantage are able to fend off

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.519
attacking enemies nicely

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.319
as with production buildings defensive
structures can also be upgraded

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.430
in three stages the basic defenses are
made completely

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.019
love wooden palisade
at level two

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.389
it's a combination of wood and stone and
the highest level 3

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.419
has defense is made completely of stone

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.090
another important aspect of my defenses

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.260
is that I can build moats and spear
walls in front of my walls

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.260
this allows me to stave off enemies
before they even reach my walls

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.789
moats are especially
effective at holding of siege weaponry

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.659
this means that if the enemy tries to
gain entry to my castle using heavy

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.240
weaponry

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.890
I can stop them with the walls the spear
walls mainly hold of human soldiers

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.390
who cannot penetrate these walls my
defensive wall has now been completely

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.020
upgraded

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.640
to level 2 I can see here everything is
made of wood and stone

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.320
and even the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.669
outlying defenses with spear walls and
moats are ready

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.210
so the enemy is going to have a hard
time conquering my castle well

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.909
additionally I can equip towers

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.930
with offensive weaponry I can place a
ballista

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.240
or catapult on every tower which
then increases the attack range

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.070
and also the amount of damage the tower
can deal

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.250
now I'm going to upgrade these walls
and the castle again

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.630
to the highest level so that we can see
how it looks

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.010
when we reached the highest level

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.550
so now my defenses have also been
upgraded to the highest level

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.880
level 3 everything is made of stone

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.409
I have blisters and catapults on my
towers

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.060
I have moats and spear walls outside my
walls

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.450
and have created an almost impenetrable
fortress

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.219
that was the second part have our Citadels video series

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.770
and you've now learned how to defend
your settlement from enemy attacks

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.190
in the next part will be going to war
ourselves

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.320
I'll show you which unit you can
build and will assemble an army to send

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.000
into battle

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.729
against the enemy it would be great if
you tuned in again

00:05:58.729 --> 00:05:59.950
see you next time
