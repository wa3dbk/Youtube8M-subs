00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.560
So its day three at Ironbound Outfitters and
today is Sunday so as I told you yesterday

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.460
there is no hunting in Newfoundland on Sunday

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.230
We've been just kind of chilling out

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.439
I spent the day kind of reflecting

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.189
going over the kit

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.770
going over what we've done so far

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.620
and trying to get a handle on where I've gone
wrong

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.960
for sure I haven't brought everything that
I need

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.720
that's very unusual, normally I'm pretty well
prepared

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.610
for international hunting trips

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.570
and it isn't like we haven't had time to get
ready for this one.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.789
One of the things that I think is very basic
that I haven't brought with me

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.870
that I'm feeling at the moment is kind of
the creature comfort sort of stuff.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.379
because of the weight on the plane with all
the gear I'm bringing over

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.920
i left things like my pyjamas &amp; Crocs at home

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.020
I know that sounds kind of trivial

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.869
but when you are staying in a camp with four
other hunters

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:06.950
one of which is a lady

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.979
then walking around in my underpants is not
all that attractive at the best of times

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.640
but for sure I don't I've made any friends
here.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.390
So I'm walking around in boots in the kitchen
when everybody else is in there when they

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.000
have slippers on

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.049
which is also something which would not make
too popular either.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.680
I think it's the functional things that I'm
missing a little bit.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.869
I didn't bring a rucksack, which is just completely
crazy

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.920
a backpack, with additional clothing, food,
water,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.310
is absolutely essential, something I normally
have with me.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.000
My Markhor backpacks, whether it be the Eterlou
45 litre, Monterior 28 litre or my favourite

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.869
which is the Savanne 18 litre

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840
pretty much come with me everywhere I go

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.549
not bringing one of those has been a bit of
a problem

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.380
I've had to borrow one.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.590
If you're going anywhere you're going to be
stalking for more than an hour, two hours

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.159
you have to take a backpack to take all your
stuff with you.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.549
Just small things, particularly here, because
of the type of terrain because you're out

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.140
all day

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.209
you must take some kind of water filtration
system, you're just not going to be able to

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.709
take the 2,3,4 litres of water you're going
to need to consume over the day.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.720
We've been drinking out the streams and the
brooks. Here the water is pretty clear

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.780
but if you haven't got a strong constitution,
your stomach is not up for it then it's just

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.340
not going to work for you.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.079
Katadyn make a filtration system like a water
bottle

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.150
scoop up the water, screw on the top then
you can drink fresh clean water through there

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.090
through the carbon filter

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.680
so definitely bringing one of those with me
next time.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.889
Base layers, now I have been sweating like
a pig constantly since I arrived here,

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.590
everything is up or down

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.370
the ground is very hard going

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.139
so definitely bring additional layers.

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.449
The Apex base layers have got Merino wool
base layers from Rivers West are outstanding

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.859
I had to do some laundry after the second
day of being here, so I should have some clean

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:57.519
kit for tomorrow

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.570
But ideally you want to take something you
can wear on the way up to the high point

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.900
have a change of clothes, it doesn't matter
if you need to get changed quickly

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.329
nobody up there is looking.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.859
Put some clean gear on to settle down, you
are not cold all day.

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.070
Being wet means you are going to be cold at
some point in time,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.169
water is going to cool down, sweat is going
to cool down

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.709
it's going to touch your skin, it's going
to drain heat.

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:19.840
So you need to stay warm, need to stay dry,
need to stay comfortable.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.449
I'm definitely only bringing one rifle next
time.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:30.449
Now I'm desperately trying to get my AYA No.
1 9.3x74 double rifle out for a play

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.250
but here the country is open, it's so long,
the distances you are shooting are so long

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.699
that I've not really been confident to take
it out

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:43.220
and my guide is like 'No way we're going to
get within 100 yards of these moose'

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.199
mainly because they're not responding to calls
at the moment

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.329
as the season moves on and as they get more
and more

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.400
how do you say, interested in responding to
female moose calls

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.760
then obviously you should be able to get them
much closer

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.669
particularly for bow hunting or double rifle
range.

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.169
This time of the year though you can expect
shots upwards of 250 yards.

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:10.169
As it happens my shot on the day before yesterday
was only 120, 130 yards I believe.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.500
So that would have been well within double
rifle territory

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.500
but for now I have been content to stick with
my Blaser R8 Professional with 300 WinMag

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:21.989
one shot, one kill.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.229
And this incredible Zeiss Diarange through
12x56.

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:31.770
If I had to take one rifle it would either
be this one here or my

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.010
Sauer 202 Outback 7x64

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.020
that one has the Zeiss 4-16x50 that I introduced
to you in an earlier video.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.290
I'm going to have another couple of days playing
with this Diarange

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.060
just to see how I get on with it, it has got
a 56 mil objective lunge,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.740
normally a little bit bigger than I'm used
to.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.730
It is a little bit heavier but I think that
makes up for it

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.220
because the Blaser rifle itself is so lightweight.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.490
It felt I was shooting at 243 when I shot
that 300 the other day when I shot the moose,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.790
it's a great rifle, it seems to be growing
on me,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.050
but I think I'm only going to bring one next
time.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.520
Lugging around three rifles, three lots of
ammunition, two scopes

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.560
and all the paraphernaila that goes with it

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.770
has probably cost me some of the weight

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.900
that I could've used on some of my lifestyle
type accessories,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.640
particularly my pyjamas, which I do miss.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.630
So tomorrow we're heading back to Ironbound
as it happens

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.150
the terrain around here is great for Moose

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.450
but it hasn't been so great for Caribou,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.930
we didn't see many yesterday, so we're going
to head over to Ironbound

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.700
where it is much more open, it is a Caribou
camp

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.000
that's what it's famous for

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.670
The guys previously have seen groups of up
to nine or ten

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.140
very, very recently Caribou and a couple of
good decent sized bulls.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.880
So we're going to walk over there tomorrow,
it's about four and a half kilometres, it

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.650
should takes us most of the day to get there.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.300
We should be able to spot along the way and
see if there are any Caribou, any small herds,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.860
also last week they killed four Bull Moose,
the gut piles are still there

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.220
so we've got a very good chance of attracting
a bear in there.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.390
They tend to like to leave them here, apparently,
until they are a couple of weeks old, or at

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.410
least a week old

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.110
until they are full of maggots, apparently
they like the maggots better than the guts.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.980
But because the hills here are so covered
with berries they prefer eating fresh as you

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.230
would

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.260
fresh, sweet berries than they do rancid gut
piles from Bull Moose.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.520
So I'm looking forward to that.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.430
It wasn't my sort of hunting yesterday, sitting
on a hill and spotting.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.000
I didn't have a spotting scope so I couldn't
see too far

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.210
and what I did see we couldn't have stalked
into anyway because of the ground.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.290
So getting out there and walking up and trying
to spot new areas along the way

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.920
making way to a different camp is the sort
of thing that

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.320
ticks my box.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.860
I think that tomorrow after I'm absolutely
exhausted I'll let you know

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.430
but I'm quite excited to do that.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.910
What I'm going to do know, pack my bags ready
for tomorrow

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.670
get everything in order

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.710
wish I had my Crocs and my PJs

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.210
and then I'll be talking to you again

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.520
this time hopefully tomorrow with either

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.850
a Caribou in the bag or at least a herd been spotted.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.350
So, I'll see you tomorrow.
