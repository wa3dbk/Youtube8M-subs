00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
“Christmas” is a simple word: it is “Christ-mass”,

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.920
literally the mass celebrated
to honour the birth of Christ.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.400
And Catholic Germans do use the word
“Christmesse” or “Christmette”

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.920
to refer to the Christmas Eve church service.

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.720
But what of the German word “Weihnachten”?

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.480
Surprisingly, it’s a very interesting word.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.520
It doesn’t even have “Christ” in it,

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.240
and there’s even a theory that says
that this goes back to a pre-Christian festival,

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.880
but that’s by no means certain.

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.880
At any rate, it appears in the 12th century as:
“ze den wīhen nahten”.

11
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.680
That’s Middle High German, which looks
very different from modern German;

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.880
and it means: “in the holy nights”.

13
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, this is a plural form because
the festival does last several days...

14
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.400
...and nights.

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.240
And this is why the modern German “Weihnachten”
behaves so oddly.

16
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.880
It can be singular, as in the phrase
“Weihnachten steht vor der Tür”,

17
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.520
which means: “Christmas is upon us”,
“Christmas is nearly here”.

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.120
But it can also be plural, as in the
traditional greeting: “Frohe Weihnachten!”

19
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.400
The “Weih-” part also appears
in words like “Weihrauch”,

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.440
literally “holy smoke”,
the word for frankincense.

21
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800
And it also appears in the verb “weihen”:

22
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.800
to consecrate, to sanctify,
to make something holy.

23
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.240
And in the word “Weihwasser”: holy water.

24
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.880
If you trace this word back far enough,

25
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.600
you find that it is in fact
related to the Latin word “victima”,

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.760
the word for a sacrificial animal,

27
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.520
an animal that has been killed
to sanctify something, to make it holy.

28
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.560
And thats where we get our word “victim”.

29
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.280
I’ll leave you to draw
your own conclusions from that.

30
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.880
Frohe Weihnachten!
