00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hello, I wish to welcome the viewers of Oldtimer magazine

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in today's program we'll discuss a Skoda 1000MB oldtimer model

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the variant shown here is actually not a 1000MB model, but an 1100MB, which means 1100 ccms.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
this is a so called Deluxe version, the first representative of models with an outboard motor

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which were manufactured in Bohemia.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Its performance is 52 horsepower, 36 kilowatts

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
at the front it has independent suspension, drum brakes; 4-gears, fully synchronized gear shift

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
with dry clutch, outboard motor and rear wheel propulsion.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Furthermore the radiator was placed at back, as well.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Considering its age, this car is surpisingly nimble, fast accelerating, with great cruise properties,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so it's not a surprise that in the West ten thousands of these models were sold.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The specific example shown here is more rare than the basic variant (1000MB)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In the history, just 23 000 1100MB Deluxe cars were manufactured.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This car is in particularly good condition, it's a Slovakian reimport

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
in the moment, it's prepared to be an oldtimer.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
practically it's fully in its original state, the trim, the seats, the dashboard as well

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the Deluxe version is more decorated than the basic variant in all aspects.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Furthermore its body was never welded

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
this car is under renewal. The brake system,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
all of the spinning parts, wheel bearings, the tires, the brake tubes, suspension, the king-pins

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and soon this car will go through an oldtimer exam

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
this car will pass it surely, thus winning the official oldtimer certificate

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and for the greatest contentment of its owner, it will continue to go ahead.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
As mentioned previously, it has an outboard motor, which is tilted to the right side by 30 degrees

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it's got so-called OHV valve controlling mechanism, two valves per cylinder

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The original version contains a carburetor with an automatically operated cold cranking device

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the radiator is placed at the back, the cooling fan is driven by the cone belt, thus it's alwaxs spinning.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Beside the car's electrical network is supplied by an direct-current dynamo.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
it has traditional battery ignition, a simple exhaust system, top-placed air filter

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
it is indeed a very reliable construction. Its lifetime is about 100-120 thousand kilometers.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Afterwards it needs reconditioning.
