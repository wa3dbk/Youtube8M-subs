00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.560
Hi, I'm Clara from Online Fabric Store.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.780
There are many different styles of curtains that are easy to sew.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.020
Today I'm making tab top curtains which have a nice casual feel.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.720
So let's get started.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.080
The materials you'll need are:

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.800
drapery fabric, this is Premier Prints Suzani Summerland Natural,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.060
thread, scissors or a rotary cutter and mat, pins,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.740
a fabric marker or pencil, a measuring tape, a ruler, and an iron.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.960
To determine the size to cut your fabric, take the dimensions you want your curtain panel to be,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.080
and add 4 inches to the width and 9 inches to the height to account for the hems.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.260
This curtain will be 3 feet wide and 4 feet tall when finished,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.860
so I'm cutting the fabric to 40 inches by 57 inches.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.260
Next, measure and cut pieces for the tabs.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.600
To make tabs that are 2 inches wide and 4 inches tall, I'm cutting 5 by 9 inch pieces.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.040
The number of tabs you'll need depends on the width of your curtain.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.120
Account for about 5 to 8 inches of space between the tabs.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.300
Finally, cut a piece that is 2 inches wider than your finished curtain width and 3 to 5 inches high.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.960
This facing piece will go on the back of the curtain

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.240
to cover the unfinished edges where the tabs are sewn on.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.400
For my curtain panel, I'm cutting a 38 by 5 inch strip.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.320
First, I'm going to hem the two sides of the panel.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.900
Fold the edges over 1 inch and press.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.020
Then fold it over another inch and iron again.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.300
Sew down the length of the panel 3/4 and inch from the edge of the fabric.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.040
Back stitch at the beginning and end to secure the stitches.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.600
Repeat this for the other side of the panel.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.920
Fold the tab pieces in half lengthwise with right sides facing.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.940
Sew down the side with a 1/2 inch seam allowance.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.060
Turn the fabric right side out.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.240
Then iron the tab so that the seam is in the middle.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.280
Repeat for the rest of the tabs.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.460
Space the tabs out evenly at the top of the panel

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.300
so the edges of the tabs line up with the top edge of the fabric.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.260
Pin in place.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.040
Sew the tabs to the top of the panel with a 1/2 inch seam allowance.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.020
Fold in the ends of the facing piece 1 inch so that it matches the width of your curtain and iron.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.460
Then fold the bottom edge over 1/2 inch and press again.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.840
With the right sides facing, place the strip of fabric at the top of the panel and pin.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.920
Sew across the top with a 1/2 inch seam allowance.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.640
Open the fabric and iron the tabs so that they face upward.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.760
Then fold under the facing piece and press again.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.520
Pin in place.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.500
Sew the bottom edge of the facing piece to the panel.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
Then sew up the side, across the top, and down the other side.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.520
Finally, sew the bottom hem.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.120
To make the bottom of the curtain fall exactly where you want,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.700
hang the panel first to better judge how much to hem.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.040
To create a double fold hem, fold over the bottom 4 inches and iron.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.860
Fold it over another 4 inches and press again.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.700
Then, sew across the bottom.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.500
And that's it, your curtain is ready to hang.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.240
By making your own tab top curtains,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.760
you can really customize your space with drapes that perfectly fit your windows and your style.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.320
Thanks for watching this OFS project.
