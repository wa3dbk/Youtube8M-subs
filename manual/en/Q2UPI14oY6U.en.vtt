00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When it comes
to opossum and raccoon

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.600
you can be sure that if you
have a food attractant outside,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.400
like this trash can,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.900
you’re going to have problems
with those two animals.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.500
Your first course of action

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.300
should be to remove
the food attractant,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.900
placing the trash can
inside if at all possible.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If that’s not possible,
you want to make sure

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.900
that you’ve got
a tight-fitting lid

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that raccoons can’t pry open

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.400
or a lid with a heavy weight
on top, like a cinderblock,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.800
to keep raccoons
and opossum out of it.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000
When it comes to raccoon
and opossum you want to make sure

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.600
that you’re placing the trap

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.200
in the immediate area
where you’re having the problem.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.200
One of the best baits
to use is a can of sardines.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.900
Sardines work well because they
have such a strong, fishy smell

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.300
that raccoon and opossum can smell
from a long way away

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.900
and in the wild they like
to eat a lot of fish.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.400
But one thing to keep in mind
is that sardines are attractive

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
to a variety of other animals
as well, particularly house cats.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.900
If you’ve got house cats in your area
that you want to avoid catching,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.500
you might want to switch to
a more sweet-smelling bait

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.300
like marshmallows.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.400
Marshmallows, especially dipped
in something sweet like molasses,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.000
maple syrup, or honey is going
to be attractive to raccoon

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.600
and opossum, but not attractive
to house cats.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.300
Another bait
that you might want to try

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.400
that’s not attractive 
to house cats is peanut butter.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.000
Peanut butter spread on a cracker,
piece of bread, or even on a twig

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.600
will be attractive to raccoon 
and opossum, but not to house cats.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
When trapping for raccoon
and opossum,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.100
it’s important to remember

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.500
that raccoons are notorious
for stealing the bait out of traps.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600
So when you’re baiting
the raccoon trap,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.600
you want to be sure to secure 
the can of sardines

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.200
or whatever bait
you’re using to the trap,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.900
with a piece of wire preferably.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.900
You want it actually affixed to
the trap so the raccoon

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
has to spend
a lot of time inside the trap

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100
and you’ll improve your odds
of catching him.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If you decide to release your
raccoon, you want to make sure

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100
you take it
at least five miles away

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
so he doesn’t return to the area
and continue to be a nuisance.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.700
And as you’re transporting
the raccoon, just remember

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800
to keep it away from your body
and keep your hands away because

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.100
he can reach through the trap
and grab you or scratch you.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.900
When you release your raccoon

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300
be sure to refer to the owner’s
manual of the cage trap.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.800
Each trap functions
slightly differently.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.400
This one we’re actually going
to roll upside down

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000
and the door will fall open
and the raccoon will be released.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.600
Some folks choose to use
a piece of wire

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.900
to wire the door to the open
position to release the animal,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but again, just be sure to refer
to your owner’s manual.
