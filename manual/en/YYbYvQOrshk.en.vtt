00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.460
ISIS accepts literally everyone. But after her...

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.660
they will think about it.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.560
You have such bad weather conditions.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.420
I thought here would be summer the whole year.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.000
I brought completely wrong clothes with me, ey

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.140
So, first of all...

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.080
I'm Rebecca. I'm from Porz aaaand...

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.860
Yeah and why I came here, well...

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.100
Doreen, who is my very very 
best friend, said

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.680
Let's go to ISIS, yeah

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.400
Because everyone goes there: Justin, the Desu, Aladdin

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.280
Everyone goes there, so let's go there too. This will be great and yeah..

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.200
Earn some money and stuff

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.260
But do you know, what'd happened? Doreen the b**ch..

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.020
She has spent all the money at Primark..

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.260
I swear, I hate her!...She's my very best friend

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.500
But I hate her so much, I swear she's dead!

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.540
Yeah, thank you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.660
So I'm here on my own, totally boring huh?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.380
But I've prepared a song

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.040
From Jason Derulo: "Talk Dirty to me"

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.880
Should I start or...? Ok..

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:31.140
[sings wrong and bad]

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.300
You didn't like it?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.800
After 15000 miles in the air and a lot of sand in the pants...

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.420
...Rebecca knew, something must be wrong!

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.100
I couldn't know..IS IS, I thought it was a talent show, man..

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.720
I was already wondering, why the journey took so long

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.640
I ran away and as I woke up, everywhere sand and destroyed buildings

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.360
Burning cars and stuff

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.160
We even could have filmed the casting at home

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.980
 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.340
Bombs instead of Bohlen

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.940
Rebecca makes the best out of it

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.680
Oooh guys, is this necessary, man?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.540
I look so fat!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I'm hungry. When do we go to McDonalds?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.720
Hello?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.140
 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.620
WHAT?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.060
THROW AWAY NOW OR WHAT?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
Great, I can't throw stuff, man..

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.780
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.040
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.740
What?

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.040
Doreen, I have no service over here

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.600
No, only one bar and E

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.360
What? Yes I'm in the Recall but it's more like a training..

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.960
What 'When is it shown on TV?'

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.560
It isn't shown on TV!

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.240
Only on the internet

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.880
Yes, but very professional with an intro. A lot of views, really a lot!

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.740
Not only the mobile service has reached it's limits, the ISIS warriors' ears too

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.440
So, back from the start:

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:03.320
Orkan is Dave's son and Dave is Doreen's boyfriend but he has f**ked Sandy, who is now pregnant.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.380
You know, why she became pregnant?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.680
Because we've changed her Anti-Baby-Pill with sweetener.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.480
But she's such a whore, ain't she?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.320
What?

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.700
Even a startup like ISIS has an controlling sector and needs to save bullets

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.200
So they sent Rebecca into the wildnis

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.420
And I was like: Doreen, he is 50. He won't leave his wife for you. Hello? Are you stupid?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.700
And she was like: No, he is such a great guy

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.140
He is really amazing. He runs a supermarket. He can buy, what he wants.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.320
And she was like: No, he loves me. We went to Bonners Passa Movieworld and then to a restaurant.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.320
On the next day a romantic brunch..Ey, do you know brunching? It is incredible. You need to try it!

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.420
Do you know, when you say a word so often that you  forget it's meaning?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.800
Brunching, brunching, brunching, brunching,..

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.920
Sounds kinda arabic, doesn't it?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.760
Ey, is this the way to the airport? Is the airport over there?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.600
No, we must be wrong. This isn't the way to the airport, is it?

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.520
This can't be right.We've never been here before

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.800
This is a strange path!

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.140
Ey, can you turn on the radio?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.120
Do you have CD's?

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.000
 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.300
Do you need to go to the toilet?
