00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:11.116
My name is Rachel and I'm a third year
apprentice diesel fuel injection fitter.

00:00:11.757 --> 00:00:16.484
It's not just a dead-end job where you're
doing the same thing day in day out, really.

00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:18.104
It makes you think
at the same time.

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:22.214
I like diagnosing what's gone
wrong in a certain situation.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:24.833
There's no pump that I've seen
that is exactly the same.

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:27.979
They're all ... they could be similar
but every pump is different.

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:37.030
This is a pump that's come in for a service.
It's a six-cylinder, in-line pump.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:40.196
You can see the six cylinders up here.
As you can see, they're all in line.

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:43.729
That's where you get the name in-line pump from.
We're going to be stripping this down.

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:49.355
Usually it takes one to two hours to strip
it and coat it, a couple more hours to clean

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:53.557
it and fix anything and in that time while
you're cleaning it, your parts are coming in.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.345
When it's all assembled, it goes on the
test bench to calibrate it and do the

00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:03.790
phasing and set up the governor. And
then it's all ready for the customer.

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:12.488
I started doing some work experience for my
friend and he does a lot of engine rebuilds

00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:16.705
and stuff like that and I learnt a lot
about internals and different components.

00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:29.381
My brother actually was friends with his
friend's dad who is my boss now said, well

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:32.852
'Get your sister to put her résumé
in and we'll give her an interview.'

00:01:32.948 --> 00:01:39.074
I actually started off here as a light remove?
mechanic but once I saw

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:42.786
all the pumps and stuff and watched
the other boys working on them,

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:46.749
 I kind of felt like I want to
do the same thing so I changed

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.820
my apprenticeship over and
that's what I'm doing now.

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:58.201
What I'm about to do here is run up this
DPA pump to test it and calibrate it.

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:03.818
The test fluid comes through here.
As the pump goes around, it

00:02:03.827 --> 00:02:06.517
injects the fuel through these
pipes into the injectors up here.

00:02:06.547 --> 00:02:11.674
This is our supply pressure. This
will be for boost pressure because we

00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:17.987
actually use compressed air on the test
bench to simulate turbo charger boost.

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.564
I mean there are so many different
types of things that you're looking

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.654
at and some of the times you don't
quite get what you're looking at

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:34.088
and you really do have to think
in your head to work out

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:36.811
what's going on, especially on
the governor side of things.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.281
But it's the challenge
that makes you want to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.867
overcome that challenge really.
You want to beat it.

00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:50.589
I'm taking the governor off,
the governor housing off.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.450
Inside here you can see the governor weights
and the levers which it operates on.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.498
And I just need to take this start spring
off and we'll be able to get it off.

00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:07.653
These are the governor weights which is what
controls the engine speed from running out.

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.813
As the shaft spins faster,
it causes the governor

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:13.703
weights to come out from the
centrifugal force which

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.525
tries to pull back on the
rack and stop it from

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.547
giving as much fuel so it
doesn't over-rev itself.

00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:23.362
You're responsible for buying your own
apprentice kit to start off with.

00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:27.400
And then, as you go, you just ...
as you need tools, you buy them.

00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:29.078
As you can afford
tools, you buy them.

00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:35.119
This big one cost me about 800 bucks and this
small three/eight cost me about 600 bucks.

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:39.299
The way I see it - girls always
walk past the shoe shops

00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:41.610
and go, ooh, I like these
shoes but for me, it's tools.

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:46.104
Yeah, I can't stop buying them.
It's kind of an addiction.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:04:00.146
I like to think that I'm a pretty
ambitious person. I don't know. Maybe

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:04.296
I'd like to work my way up in the
company or have my own business.

00:04:04.374 --> 00:04:06.749
I mean, apprentices are always
going to be bottom rung

00:04:06.756 --> 00:04:11.229
while they're apprentices
but if you learn different

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:13.206
aspects of the job then
obviously you're going to

00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:15.150
be more valuable and be
able to get paid more.

00:04:15.252 --> 00:04:20.422
There's a lot of mining opportunities
that pay very well for diesel fitters.

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:27.513
There are some mechanics out
there that will just, you know,

00:04:27.532 --> 00:04:30.680
do services all day and do the
same thing day in day out.

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:37.358
Then your just in this workplace there's
the rotary pump section and there's the

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:44.373
turbo section and there's the heavy duty
section and the light commercial section.

00:04:44.413 --> 00:04:50.331
There's so many different things that you can
learn and do within this one fuel gear.

00:04:53.455 --> 00:04:57.067
I suppose it was a bit different
for the guys working here to have

00:04:57.075 --> 00:05:01.498
a female working here but, lucky
for me, they've been pretty good.

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:05.463
They've been very accepting of
me and they've seen how keen I

00:05:05.477 --> 00:05:07.829
am to learn and how keen I am
to learn what they're doing.

00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:11.214
If people notice me for anything, I'd
like to think it would be because

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:17.355
I've done my job right, rather
than being of a different gender. Yeah.
