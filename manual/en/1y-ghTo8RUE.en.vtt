SNEAKER FREAKER PRESENTS

00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:04.828
TWENTY YEARS OF PUMP FURY

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:20.538
FU LUH FACTORY
FUZHOU, CHINA

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.344
Hi I'm Paul Litchfield. I'm the Vice President

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:24.084
of Advanced Concepts here at Reebok

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.928
So I've been here about 30 years and 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.988
I've filled a lot of different positions here at Reebok

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.995
and I was lucky enough to get involved with Reebok 

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.494
when it was a really tiny part of 

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.586
creation department. Just a couple of developers

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:37.225
a couple of designers.

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:41.743
I'm Steven Smith and I was design director

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:44.668
for the Reebok Advanced Concepts

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:49.155
team and I was there for nine years.

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:52.449
I started The Pump in 1988. That redefined

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.641
the basketball marketplace. And what The Pump

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:57.015
did for us was it allowed us to customise

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:58.513
the fitness of basketball shoes.

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.630
This is the original notebook page 

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.561
and we were trying to figure out

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:07.861
what to do with The Pump and when 

00:01:07.862 --> 00:01:08.796
Litch and I were looking at it, we had 

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:11.350
The Pump One and we were like

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:13.147
"What the hell? We're building this 

00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:15.981
thing and then putting it inside of all

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:17.658
of this other stuff. What if we just got

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.656
rid of all the stuff and made this the shoe?"

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:23.781
Steven came up with a little tiny sketch

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:27.474
on this product that was a lace less running shoe

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:29.532
that incorporated all of our technologies, 

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.860
all of our innovations at the time. 

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.654
It had the graphlite bridge for lightweight

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.564
support in the arch. It had hexalite for

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:39.027
cushioning and it had an air blatter that was

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:40.760
essentially the entire upper of the shoe. 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.410
We wanted to build something that would 

00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:48.306
blow people's minds. We showed it to 

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.601
Paul Fireman, he was like, "That's what I'm 

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:52.435
talking about. That's the stuff you guys

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.228
should be working on. So start building it

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.315
and don't let anybody see it, especially

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.422
me." It was pretty radical then and you've 

00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:01.227
got a younger generation now, who 

00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:03.770
don't remember when... at that time

00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:06.931
it was a no holds barred street fight

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:08.573
between the companies on who could come up

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:13.631
with the most radical product and push the envelope.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.532
It's really funny because right now, The Pump

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:19.279
Fury is enjoying a renaissance; it's 20 years old

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.512
and we're still making it, which is really 

00:02:21.513 --> 00:02:24.129
remarkable, but when we first launched

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.364
it, there were two distinct camps

00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:28.049
in the world, both at Reebok and outside

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.100
in one camp were people who looked at the shoe

00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:34.201
and said, "What is this?" They were just 

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:35.450
intrigued by it and they thought it was very cool.

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.570
And then there was a bigger audience 

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:39.410
a much bigger audience, who looked at the shoe

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.807
and thought it was an affront to everything 

00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:42.975
that stood for running, everything

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:44.119
that stood for performance and all of 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.379
that, because it was that different and 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.683
it was that unique.

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:51.068
So we showed it and the marketing guys

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.061
who were very conservative were like,

00:02:53.062 --> 00:02:54.573
"Yeah, they're going to be great. We could sell it

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.332
if you did it in blue, grey or black".

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.847
So I went home that night and I took a pair

00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:00.974
into my basement and I sprayed painted

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:03.439
it with grey primer, the entire shoe.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.182
And I brought them in the next day and 

00:03:06.183 --> 00:03:07.986
threw them on his desk and was like, 

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.992
"is this what you want?"

00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:11.872
He went, "Oh perfect, I can sell that" 

00:03:11.873 --> 00:03:13.426
I'm like, "You don't get it do you?

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:15.214
You don't get it. You don't understand it."

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:17.501
We actually had to go to Paul Fireman

00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:22.546
and plead for his support to launch this colour.

00:03:22.547 --> 00:03:24.925
I think what's super important is that 

00:03:24.926 --> 00:03:26.912
having that conviction and keeping 

00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:29.952
yourself true to the project and the project 

00:03:29.953 --> 00:03:32.830
objective, that's where you can create a product 

00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:34.698
that people really get intrigued by. 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.146
I never set out to create this truly 

00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:41.990
iconic product, it was just, "I want to do a 

00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:44.549
radical, cool running shoe, that works 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.986
and that's lightweight" and at the time 

00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:47.880
it was one of the lightest weight training shoes

00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:50.838
on the market. So it's like, check that box

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.837
and it just happened to be really radical

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:58.652
and it took off and even to this day

00:03:58.653 --> 00:04:02.141
it's very polarizing.

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:03.286
It's really interesting, 20 years later we're 

00:04:03.287 --> 00:04:06.421
celebrating The Pump Fury, we're doing a bunch of

00:04:06.422 --> 00:04:07.312
cool apps with a bunch of the boutiques and 

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:09.279
what these guys have done through their 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.908
creativity, is that they've changed the entire...

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.300
they've customised The Pump Fury for themselves

00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:16.958
which is going to make it extremely desirable 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.884
for people that collect and it's your signature

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.106
it's kind of cool, right?

00:04:22.107 --> 00:04:24.945
What's also interesting is what they've done 

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:26.996
they've actually challenged us on how to make it

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:30.335
and this is the part of the job that we're super 

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.940
lucky to have because their challenges

00:04:32.941 --> 00:04:36.049
to how to make certain constructions of The Pump

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.891
Fury is forcing us to evaluate how 

00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:41.055
we make them and forcing us to evaluate how to

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:43.832
solve some of these challenges, which is going to

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.922
pay dividends down the road for expanding on 

00:04:45.923 --> 00:04:47.871
The Pump Fury even more so.

00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:49.643
The thought that we can walk the line here and 

00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:51.925
see literally thousands or tens of thousands

00:04:51.926 --> 00:04:54.648
of these being made a month is absolutely

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:57.470
one of the most flattering and unexpected 

00:04:57.471 --> 00:05:02.862
proud moments for me and for the team.
