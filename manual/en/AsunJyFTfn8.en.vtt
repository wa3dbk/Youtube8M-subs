[4] Hi, I'm A. Scott Weber and I serve as the Dean of Undergraduate Education at the University at Buffalo. 
 As a prospective UB student I want you to know about our rich array of exceptional academic programs. 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.259
that we offer to undergraduate students here at the University at Buffalo. In addition, I also want 
 you to know about a new program that we just launched called Finish in Four. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:30.050
It is the University's strong commitment to you as a student to provide all the resources that you need to have 
 a timely graduation. The conventional period for graduation has historically been 4 years and yet we know across the nation

00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:40.777
that many students take 5 and 6 years. However, most of our degree programs can be completed in 4 years 
 and we want to help you achieve that degree in the most efficient and economic way possible. 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:55.330
[4] [Arlene Kaukus speaking] UB Career Services will be a key partner in the Finish in Four program because of 
 the importance of career exploration and career planning for our students. It is really an essential element. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
of a students ultimate success is to have a career plan. [4] [Lia Hallett speaking] The Finish in Four program 
 will require that there be more ongoing regular advising which can only be a positive thing for the students

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:19.315
The idea would be that with some intentional planning that students would follow more of a four year track.[4] UB Career 
 Services is really a department that you want to use each of your four years here at the university. 

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:29.014
to choose your academic major and then begin to use our department for 
 the career search, interviewing, resume building, those kinds of skills [4]

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:40.860
One of the greatest benefits of the program will be having the campus start to make that shift to thinking 
 of college as the best four years of your life and we hope that all of our incoming freshmen

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:49.240
 will join us in this effort to take the pledge to finish in four [4]. Successful 
 outcomes for our students is something we're really committed too, so finish in four! [4] 

00:01:50.573 --> 00:02:00.570
I hope you'll consider our program. I hope you will look at our Finish in Four website and should you have 
 any questions about it. I hope you'll contact us at your earliest convenience. Thank you so much. [4]
