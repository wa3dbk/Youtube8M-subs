00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:35.160
bjbj Male Speaker 1: LA Boxing has actually
a huge support system, if you look at the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.071
amount of open franchisers versus employees;
currently there is one LA Boxing franchise

00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:46.430
corporate play for every five open units which
is pretty substantial. Male Speaker 2: Beginning

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.260
process, they definitely introduce you the
right way. Male Speaker 1: And my real estate

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.329
department originally will help you get set
up with a broker in your area that knows your

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.550
exact city and demographic, finding LA Boxing
location that works for you, that will help

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.009
negotiate your letter of intent and your lease.
Then after that our build out services team

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.210
will come to your town and build out the LA
Boxing Gym for you entirely which it comes

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.710
as a ring, bags, cage, countertop, cardio
strength, pre-weight, dumbbells, it do allow

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.750
amazingly not to take somebody day and half
to build out the interior guts of your gym

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.880
and our sales staff will source train to maintain
a sales staff for you, our instructor department

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.420
will source train and maintain instructors
for you. Our marketing department will put

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.430
your marketing campaign together and so it
s really a ton of support getting you off

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.350
the ground and then maintaining your gym and
increasing its levels of. Male Speaker 3:

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.159
We have staffed the club right off the batch,
so we will find a General Manger and an Assistant

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.710
Manager for them, we put a presale plan together
for them, a soft opening plan, a grand opening

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.960
plan would really hands on with our franchisees.
Male Speaker 1: So, whatever question you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.250
have depending on what department of the nature
of your question, there is an LA Boxing Support

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.979
version here for you to answer that question.
They give you the training from an owner perspective

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.040
like what you have to do to own and operate
your facility, so you come out to California

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.539
to the headquarters and go through week on
training, you also receive some sales training

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.230
which is what your general managers would
receive. Male Speaker 3: And if you have any

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.819
questions in regards to sales or generating
more membership sales or personal training

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.609
sales or merchandise sales in their clubs
help them game plan out of their clubs for

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.409
them from sales standpoint to make sure that
they are following out the sales systems properly

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.879
I mean, if there is any areas to improve in
that. Male Speaker 4: This isn t a Mom and

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.019
Pop store that s going to cut all corners
and a filthy gym, you know, you re walking
