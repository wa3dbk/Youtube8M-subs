Hi! I’m Janie Yasko-Mangum with Successful
Style and Image. Today on Expert Village I

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.830
am going to talk to you about long sleeved
shirts. Now when I’m talking about long

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.080
sleeved shirts, I am not going to concentrate
on the shirts that you wear at work because

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.240
those sometimes are different kinds of shirts.
What I am going to talk about is your social

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.330
dress for men, those types of shirts and the
long sleeved ones. When we are talking about

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:36.160
long sleeved shirts, we don’t need to dictate
always having a white long sleeved shirt.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.390
That’s not what I am talking about when
you are in a social atmosphere, not white.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.239
What you need to look for is something that
has design, some character to it. This is

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.190
a nice long sleeved shirt. See it has a stay
collar. You put stays. Oh, this is a button

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.190
down. Excuse me. Button down collar where
you can button it down but you can also have

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.649
stay collars too. This type of shirt you can
wear with this type of collar. This is a pointed

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.659
collar. You can either wear this with the
buttons or without the buttons. You can see

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.100
that it has not only stripes to it, beautiful
caramel and light tan stripes. It also has

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:27.369
interwoven in it, a blue weave to it. You
can probably see that. Very nice long sleeved

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:35.490
shirts. We also have this beautiful inlay
long sleeved shirt. You can tell it fits.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.749
You don’t have too much material down here.
It is a nice fit on him. Good shoulders. This

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:48.310
is a pointed collar. It has buttons up it.
Very nice long sleeved shirts. Remember we

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.869
look at the tag to see what kind of fabric
is in it. There is also something you need

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.270
to wear with your long sleeved shirt and this
will pop out even more character. Put an undershirt

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.959
on with it. I’m not talking about a white
undershirt but I am talking about a colored

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:11.220
undershirt. For instance, up here we have
a black undershirt that goes with the black

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.280
slacks. Wonderful to put an undershirt with
your long sleeved shirt. Now you want an undershirt

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.409
that maybe has a blend with it. It’s cotton.
Maybe that kind of blend, maybe nylon or something

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.890
with it to give it stretch ability but also
give it a little bit of a shine but it is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.650
always nice and it looks spectacular to put
an undershirt with your long sleeved shirts.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.060
Make sure that it blends with the outfit.
You don’t want to be wearing this beautiful

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.019
silk shirt with a black pair of pants and
a white undershirt with it. You want it all

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.340
to blend and go together. So when you are
wearing long sleeves shirts, don’t just

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.239
look for the plaids, look for different designs,
look for different colors, look for different

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.719
inlays. You can either have the button down
collar; you can have the stay collars but

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:03.510
always make sure you pair it up with an undershirt
because it will make you look dabber. Thank

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.709
you.
