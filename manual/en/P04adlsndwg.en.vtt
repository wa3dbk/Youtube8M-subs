00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.140
This MVTQCP 14

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.400
quad chime is the best chime movement
on the market today.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.650
We're proud to offer it. The

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.289
industry-leading three-inch speaker
produces the best sound quality

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.619
available. The quad chime movement  has
four

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.010
different chime patterns.  Two different
variations of the Westminster chime.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.179
Ave Maria and the traditional "Bim-Bam"

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.410
half hour strike pattern. It has a volume
control

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.210
as well as a 24 hour or night
strike shut off options.  All the bells and

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.930
whistles.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.789
it works with materials up to 1/2" thick

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.289
remember that if a hand shaft is too long

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.309
you can normally shim it back with a few
washers

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.789
just can't make it longer.  The quad chime
movement uses the American "I" shaft for

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.520
installing the clock hands.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.300
A small nut is used to hold the minute hand on 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.970
and it gives you a much more secure fit.
 Because these mounting hole sizes for

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.430
the clock hands are not well standardized.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.750
iI's always best to play safe and choose a
free pair

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.590
hands when buying one of these movements.
There are 45 pairs of hour and minute

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.759
hands to pick from

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.759
in brass or black. We only sell this quad chime
movement in a pendulum version.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.409
If you don't need a pendulum then simply
leave the movement in its shipping

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.000
position. This will keep the pendulum arm 
inactive and

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.060
out of the way. No effect on the
timekeeping. If you need a pendulum then

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.149
the quad chime movement is available with an 
16-inch

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.500
adjustable pendulum with three different
pendulum bob sizes.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.700
The pendulum bob is the disk at the bottom

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.340
of the pendulum. You decide on the clock
hands and the bob size and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.420
what's best for your clock design. For
