00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.580
The top nut, just a few turns left

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:10.580
And a wiggle and a slide the plate mount

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.150
And you’re off.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.210
Hey guys what’s up, it’s Sean with Pedal
Haus here.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.590
This is our installation guide and we’re
going to explain the quick-release function

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.590
of our Quick Release No-Holes License Plate
Mount.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.520
When you open the box, you’re going to look
for a few things–

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.820
You’re going to find a post, with hardware
attached 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.700
An extra bag of hardware

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.149
And our license plate mount.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.389
Keep the screws in the post attached. You’re
going to want that 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.000
when you put it on the license plate mount   

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.420
It’ll lock into the groove.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.140
The first step of the install is to put the
license plate on the mount

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.260
but keep the nuts loose on the back.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.189
Allow the license plate to slide.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.520
Then you got to put the post in

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.080
and so you
got to take off the cover of the tow hook on the front of your bumper

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.980
insert the post

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.950
and tighten it down with a 10mm wrench.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.400
Next with the license plate still loose, choose
your height selection out of the four available.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.400
Now when you mount the mount you're going to press,
and it’ll slide onto the groove.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.549
Adjust your angle, use a 10mm wrench again,
and tighten it down.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.120
[music]

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.200
With that done you’re at the last step.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.819
Adjust the lateral left and right motion of
your license plate on the license plate mount

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.400
and tighten it down with your 8mm.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.640
That’s it! You’re done.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.620
Now to explain our Quick-Release.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.140
This is the easy part.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.040
You got a 10mm wrench in hand

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.760
you walk up and you loosen it left a few turns.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.520
Once it’s loose, you’re going to slide
it left and off.

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:54.549
That’s it!

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.340
