Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of the book the natural hair Bible and founder

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.870
of howtoblackhair.com and for the special
videos I love to answer the questions you

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.520
all send me via email so any of you have any
questions you like for me to answer be sure

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.360
to check out the description box below for
additional information so without further

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.410
that you would to get right on into the video
in this video today is in response to email

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.780
I received from Alida, Alida emailed me because
she wants to know if re twisting her hair

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.020
every night is a good idea she's noticing
that the more manipulation and more handling

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.210
she puts on her hair the more likely she seems
to experience breakage so Alida I'm going

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.530
to answer that question for you and also that
omission that you also said I see other naturals

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.879
do it too so you want to build a good idea
number and also talk about that as well some

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.050
going to give you some tips and advice pointers
things to consider look out for everything

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.130
that would be concerned as far as re twisting
your hair every night so the first thing I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.840
want to say is that you already know that
the less manipulation or less handling you're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.659
putting on your hair the better because you
emailed me and told me that the more you do

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.280
mess around or manipulate your hair the more
you notice that you lean more towards experiencing

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.229
breakage so already it obvious that it's not
best for you specifically to re-twist your

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.170
hair every night now most cases this works
for other naturals for some women it's not

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.710
something that they struggle with experiencing
breakage for a and they can be variety of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.180
reasons it could be the type of hair that
they have it could be the way that they handle

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.899
their hair it could be how well the hair is
being kept moisturizing protein balanced there

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.409
can be so many different factors that will
allow one person to re-twist her hair every

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.190
night versus another being able to resist
the hair every night the second thing I'm

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.760
going to say is that what I want you to do
is make sure that when you are wearing styles

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.099
that the life of your style can extend all
the way up to the point that you have to touch

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.000
or manipulate your hair again what I mean
by this is you should only be manipulating

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.760
your hair when you're washing or conditioning
your hair and then to set your hair and hairstyle

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.700
know what will be best for your hair since
your hair thrives with at least less manipulation

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.519
as possible also a styles that could last
into your next washday so if you co wash weekly

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.700
or you even co-ops two times a week style
your hair leave it in that style until you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.180
wash her hair and then put your hair into
another hairstyle the less manipulation the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.550
better and I can speak from this personally
from experience because with my hair the less

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.379
manipulation I do to with the more I see it
drive in the more I can actually keep it moisturize

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.310
some only washing my hair when I have to which
can be anywhere between shampoo washing every

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.541
two weeks and co washing at least weekly and
that is what works for me at this point in

00:03:15.541 --> 00:03:21.560
time so the less I am combing my hair detangling
my hair, washing my hair the more my hair

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.560
is actually showing length so to each his
own in the situation with your hair you already

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.129
notice that we twisting every night is not
ideal for you so keep those tips in mind what

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.420
I want you to do is just make sure your style
is lasting until your next washday are until

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.939
you need to detangle your hair or co wash
however ever your regimen already is in another

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:51.739
thing that also want to add is I'm not 100%
sure if your hair is being properly moisturized

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.730
or are properly balanced with protein so to
help your hair out for situations I'll suggest

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.930
that you make sure to just pump up the volume
a little bit more with your deep conditioning

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.030
sessions and your protein treatment sessions
so if your noticing that your hair is not

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.140
operating well in style this could be a lack
and one of the areas in the best way to test

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.100
whether or not your hair's balance with moisture
or protein is to test the strength of your

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.290
hair when it is wet and product free so the
perfect time to do that is after you rinse

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.760
the conditioner out of your hair when co washing
or after shampoo washing your hair while want

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.039
you to do is grab a very small section of
hair embrace the hair in between your fingers

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.580
so that way you're not pulling at your roots
so grab a small section slide your fingers

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.060
down and then grab the end of the hair and
I want you to slightly tug and stretch the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.900
hair if it feels extremely stretchy to the
point where itâ€™s kind of gummy even in the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.530
way that it feels most likely you need to
start implementing some protein treatment

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.690
or product that already have protein in itself
your hair stronger and then when you're feeling

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.300
your hair if you noticing it doesn't give
much elasticity you need to have more moisture

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.550
so you need to do more deep conditioning treatments
to keep your hair more balance so the reason

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.000
I suggest that is because if you really want
to retwist your hair every night make sure

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.270
that your hair is properly balanced with moisture
and protein to give you more results that

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.500
you would desire to do so thank you for sending
me the email I'm glad using it because not

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.020
a lot of people ask whether or not okay retwist
their hair every night because I know that

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.569
so many people do it that I though Iwonder
if this would work for everyone but of course

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.460
in your situation it doesn't work best for
your specific head of hair so thank you for

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.110
