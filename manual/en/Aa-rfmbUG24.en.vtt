00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.059
Once upon a time, Johnny Depp was the most
intriguing actor in Hollywood

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.360
Now, one hit franchise will usher in the end
of his creative choices, turning him into

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.270
a boring parody of himself...

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.830
But who cares? Now he owns a f**king island.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.460
Pirates of the Caribbean.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.009
Witness the Disneyfication of pirates, history’s
most notorious foul-mouthed rapists and murderers

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.509
where the cursing is PG,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.720
"Pestilent, traitorous, cow-hearted, yeasty
codpiece."

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.720
"Ruthless, soulless, cross-grained cur."

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.449
'rape' becomes 'raid,'

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.210
"Raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer
my weasely black guts out."

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.269
and murder is physically impossible.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.100
"You're not dead!"

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.660
"No!"

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.810
Buckle your swashes for Curse of the Black
Pearl, a straightforward adventure romp that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.170
everyone loved

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.979
then Dead Man’s Chest, that everyone was
sort of on-board for, where they all betray

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.590
each other to find a
teleporting squid monster’s heart

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.070
At World’s End that everyone was totally
fed up with, where they all betray each other

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.090
while the squid monster teams up with the
British East India company

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.500
causing the pirate U.N. to release a sea goddess
who’s in love with the squid monster, except

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.869
for when she
isn’t,

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.049
and On Stranger Tides, that finally --

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.280
wait, what? They made a 4th one?

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.799
Ugh.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.700
How many of these things can they do? They're
based on a f**king theme park ride for god's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.259
sake!

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.329
Johnny Depp shines as Jack Sparrow

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.479
"Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please."

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.140
the legendary pirate made out of dreadlocks
and guyliner.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.420
Watch this Oscar-worthy match between actor
and role as he hams it up with a trademark

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.049
barrage of

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:54.950
catchphrases,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.770
"I'm Captain Jack Sparrow, savvy?"

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.380
"Savvy."

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.990
"Savvy."

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.600
"Savvy."

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.210
"Savvy."

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.820
"Savvy."

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.430
"Savvy."

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.039
"Savvy."

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.649
"Savvy."

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:03.259
"Savvy."

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:03.869
"Savvy."

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.789
impractical escapes,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.360
and silly walks

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.110
in this half-drunk Keith Richards impression
that really should be dead by now

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.190
kind of like Keith Richards.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.940
"Does this face look like it's been to the
fountain of youth?"

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.550
Spend the rest of your time in the pale embrace
of the boring lovers Orlando Bloom and Keira

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.350
Knightley,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.470
two perfect faces in the middle of a scurvy
ridden hellhole

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.940
whose will-they-won’t-they relationship
will have everyone

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.320
saying:

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.990
“Where did Jack Sparrow go?"

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.470
until they're replaced in the 4th one by their
cheaper, but just as pale, equivalents.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.590
Baton down the hatches for nearly 10 overstuffed
maritime hours of

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.590
impossible sword fights,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.360
stupid wigs,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.600
terrible teeth,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.330
alcoholism,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.850
"Why is the rum gone?!"

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.510
"Why is the rum always gone?"

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.790
"Rum's gone too..."

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.060
"Hide the rum."

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.800
that song from the ride,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.820
"Drink up, me hearties."

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.320
"Yo ho."

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.880
"Yo ho."

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.040
"Yo ho, a pirate's life for me."

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.260
"I love this song!"

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.120
and women dressed in cinema's least-convincing
boy disguises.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.220
Mustache or not, I would totally pork that
dude.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.150
Starring...

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.800
Captain Jack Spare Us From Any More of These
Movies,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.410
Keira Daily,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.560
Barnacle Bill,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.870
Why Not Zoidberg?,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.640
Finnicky,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.840
Deadwoodmen Tell No Tales,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.860
Captain Morgan,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.300
Miss Cleo,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.630
A Japanese Pornstar,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.540
and Orlando Florida.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.730
Jack Sparrow of the Caribbean (And Some Other
Pirates).

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.780
You used to be cool, man!

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.040
What the hell happened to you?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.200
"Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad
dream. That's how I get by."
