Interviewer: We're here with Mike from T-Rex
grills.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.460
He's gonna
show off some of their products.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.980
Mike: Yes, how you doing?

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.320
How's the show for you guys?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.320
Interviewer: Great so far.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.320
Mike: Good.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
The new product we have it's hot new release
which is our Graphic Series.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.820
This one right here is
actually what we call our KW1 Camo Print.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.650
It's great for
the guys who are going duck hunting or like

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.750
the Wetland foul.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.040
We also have our whole series up here, the
Graphics, which

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.960
include several of the camouflage prints that
we're

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.031
offering and also a skull graphic we've decided
to

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.390
come out with.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.530
Down below is the new hot thing for the industry,
is the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.829
new lighted grill series.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.670
We call it our Torch Series,
specifically this is for 1500 Dodge Ram 2013,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.940
2014.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.870
The great thing with these is, we're answering
two questions.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.130
One is, where
do you mount the light, and now we're offering

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.110
security
protection for light theft.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.710
Everything's needed to
mount that light on the back side, keeps it

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.540
all protected,
nobody can get their hands on it.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.660
We also have our traditional Bill it Series
with our

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.660
logos.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.940
This is just a quick snip out of our catalog
showing the

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.400
different accessories that we offer.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.460
Interviewer: Okay great and you've got another
grill to show us

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.460
on the other side?

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.460
Mike: Definitely

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.460
Interviewer: All right, lets go take a look.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.440
Mike: Now I want to show you our new XR1 Series
grill.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.850
This is actually something we have exclusivity
with, with

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.850
Rigid Industries.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.340
We're gonna be running their light-
bar that if you notice is actually contoured

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.350
with the radius to fit our
grills.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.340
This is form, and function.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.840
You get the light, the
functionality of the light and the form that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.369
actually
fits the grill perfectly so it has a nice

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.369
show quality look.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.150
This is
something that is exclusive with T-Rex running

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.530
our X-Metal
grill and we are running the Rigid Industries

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.530
lights.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.189
These should be on the market, ready to go
within 60 to

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.189
90 days.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.010
Interviewer: Awesome, again that's the Torch
XRI series grill

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:52.939
from T-Rex.
