[THE PATH TO MARS]

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.900
[DEEP SPACE MISSION]

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.870
Today, somewhere out there
in the world in a classroom,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.900
somewhere between
the age of 10 and 20

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.750
the person who’s going to be the first person
to set foot on Mars is out there,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.550
probably studying math or science.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
And it’s really exciting to think about
what that person’s life will be like

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.770
and how they will live
after this big mission.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.920
Mars is probably in the mid-2030s.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.370
And so what we need to do now
are proving ground missions

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.450
that will get us ready for Mars.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.210
And it takes six pieces
to get to Mars.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.990
And Boeing is building
the SLS right now [SLS - Space Launch System].

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.560
NASA’s current plan for Mars
starts with SLS and Orion,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.920
the two pieces that get you in and out
of the Earth’s gravity well.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.650
If you’re going to go to the moon or farther,
you need a really big rocked to do that.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.740
And that’s what the SLS
is all about,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.450
to get you into a high orbit.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.760
And it’s going to take us
probably five or six SLS launches

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760
to be able to do the Mars mission.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.970
So, we want to make sure
that we’ve checked everything out

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.220
and that we know that it’s good to go
before we actually leave for Mars,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.930
because once we leave we can’t
come back for over two years.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.870
And the reason for this is because
it's the alignment of the planets.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.330
The way the planets
revolve around the sun,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.500
it allows a window of opportunity

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.520
to go from Earth to Mars,
basically every two years.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.800
Just to get to Mars,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.390
before you even land or anything, it’s going to take seven or eight months.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.560
The reality is you’re going
to be there for a year

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.580
waiting until that window
opens up to come back.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.790
And then it’s going to take
seven or eight months to come home.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.600
Two more pieces are needed
to go between Earth and Mars—

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
a deep space tug of some kind
and we’ll need a habitat.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.090
The deep space transportation
is a solar electric tug,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.330
with very large solar arrays,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.170
and it uses the power from the sun
to drive the propulsion system.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.700
So they look like large sailing ships.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.040
And attached to the sailing ship
will be a habitat

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.040
where the crew will live.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.070
They’ll ride in that habitat
on the way to Mars

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.240
and then we’ll leave
the habitat in orbit

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.400
when the crew goes down
to the surface.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.790
And then the last two pieces
that we’ll need are the lander.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.520
And this lander will have
an inflatable heat shield

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.260
that will take the crew
through the atmosphere and down.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.920
It will drop that heat shield and then
the lander will land on the surface,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.110
much like the lunar lander did
on the moon.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.520
And then we need a little rocket
for them to get back up

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.610
out of the Mars gravity well again.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.730
I think we’ll be able
to colonize Mars someday.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.360
It will take time.
It may take hundreds of years,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.770
but that’s not unusual for humans.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.920
It’s really about establishing
a human foothold on the planet.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.820
It’s a natural evolution of humanity
to take this challenge on.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.500
[Two of the six pieces needed for Mars travel, NASA's SLS and Orion, are in production now.]

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000
[The production of the other four will be announced at a later date.]
