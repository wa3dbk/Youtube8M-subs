Hey Vsauce I'm Jake and if you've played Injustice:
Gods Among Us, you know how awesome it is

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.240
to be Superman and punch people into space. But what if he were to hit you in real life?

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.590
What would happen if someone who is able to
lift 200 quintillion tons with one hand, power

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.590
the sun or, my favorite, punch dimensions
apart...were to punch you?

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.369
And this brings up an interesting idea: Superman
-- and really any fictional character -- is

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.030
only as powerful as the person writing them.
He has gone from being able to leap tall buildings

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.780
in a single bound to moving faster than the
speed of light. In this theory, no matter

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.899
how strong Superman is, there is one universal
law of physics he can't break--that nothing

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.949
with mass can achieve--travelling the speed
of light. So we will put him 1% below that

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.949
299,792,458 m/s limit at 99% the speed of
light.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.070
So you're, unfortunately, in a fight with
the Man of Steel who, in this case, will not

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.170
restrain himself when hitting you. If his
fist has an average mass of 300 grams and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.560
it's moving at 99% the speed of light, it
would have a total energy of about 190,000,000,000,000,000

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.560
joules. Which is equivalent to 45 Megatons
of TNT or over 2,800 times more powerful than

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.040
the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Throwing just one punch at near the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.740
speed of light with that much energy would
burn around 45,400,000,000,000 calories or

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.210
almost 82 billion Big Macs.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.060
Now you have one of the largest bombs ever, condensed
into a fist, and aimed at your face. What

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.610
happens when Superman releases that punch?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.400
This is when it gets incredibly cool...or
incredibly hot since the energy being released

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.550
by Superman's fist would be around 80,000,000,000,000
Kelvin, which is 5 million times hotter than

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.240
the core of our sun.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.350
It takes about 1 centisecond for the light
that hits your retina to then be processed

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.590
by the brain, so since the punch is travelling
at near the speed of light, it would only

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.810
take 3.4 Nanoseconds for the fist to get to
you. So you literally wouldn't see it coming.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.760
But what we can see is that from the fist's
perspective, since it is moving at an amazing

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.990
296 million meters a second, all of time is
practically frozen. The particles in the air,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.280
the oxygen and nitrogen, are just suspended
in time. And Superman's hand hits them with

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.280
such energy that it creates nuclear fusion.
Gamma rays explode from every collision and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.430
create an explosion unlike any the Earth has
ever seen. A giant fireball engulfs the surrounding

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.000
area and a blast wave shoots out, shattering
windows, structures and rips trees out of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.590
the ground. There might be fictional characters
with more powerful punches, but at this point,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.200
when it comes to you still existing, it doesn't
matter...

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.490
Superman wouldn't only knock the wind out
of you, he would knock the atoms out of you.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.960
His fist has pretty much become a particle
beam. At 7,000,000,000 electron volts it is

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.620
more powerful than the Jefferson Labs Particle
Accelerator in Virginia. The atoms that made

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.750
up you would be completely disintegrated,
liquified at the atomic level. You'd turn

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.069
into fundamental particles and quark-gluon
plasma which is what was created right after

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.850
the Big Bang. And from all of this energy,
new particles and anti-particles would form.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.010
So out of your unfortunate destruction, something
new, something we might not have ever seen

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.650
before, could be created.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.670
To visualize the explosion we can use Nuke
Map to see what a 45 megaton bomb would look

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.590
like in terms of sheer damage, but what we
can't really show is that the damage from Superman's

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.680
punch would look more like a traffic cone
with a beam shooting out from where his fist

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.040
landed, destroying everything in its path
and creating an explosion all around him.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.680
It would leave a crater almost 1km in diameter
and 221 meters deep.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.069
So how close could you or I come to having
'Superman's strength'? My friends at AsapSCIENCE

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.880
breakdown strength muscle growth and how superhuman
strength may be more attainable than ever

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.900
before.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.590
Don't piss of Superman and as always, thanks
for watching.
