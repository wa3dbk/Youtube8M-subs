00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.509
This next images is a shot of one of
my favorite musicians of all time her name is

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.749
Imogen Heap.

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.289
She's a very experimental kind of
ethereal musician and

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.640
her music just really inspires me.
And so I just emailed her and we set up our

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.330
own personal shoot.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.029
When she came to Nashville, where I lived,
well this is really quick shoot

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.810
probably just fifteen minutes of her time
and i came in with a few ideas.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.230
And this image came out of the
very quick photoshoot.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.959
This is my first year being a
professional photographer and so I was

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:44.270
shooting quite simply back then. This is
just lit with a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.510
three foot by two foot softbox.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.340
You know, straight over my head up forty
five degree angle

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.740
on the subject. Pretty simple but

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.060
that soft light on her face, her skin 
just lit up and 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.080
there's nothing more to it, very simple.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.120
And i come from a background in painting and
illustration

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.710
and so this image was really all about
post-production.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.300
Something about her pose was still
really magic and kind of matched her music.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.430
And so i went into Photoshop

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.279
and took her,

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.670
removed her from the background entirely.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.120
Brought her back in, we retuched her skin a
little bit

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.410
and i just started out bringing
different backgrounds in and

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.950
brought a landscape in that I'd shoot. I shoot a lot of
stock images, on my down time,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.610
so I'm always building that library of personal
work

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.580
and so that at times like this i can use
those images.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.340
So I brought in a landscape,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.330
brought in some clowds

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.740
and just start building.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.170
Building at the image one layer at the
time.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.640
I do this really crazy effects, to where
I reshoot images on my

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.130
cinema display,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.380
through various glass and old cameras
and so.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.610
I've shot this image again

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.100
through my various techniques

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.610
and brought those images,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.859
of the image, back into photoshop and
layered them

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.910
on top of the original. And so started
creating this really

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.509
bizarre effect.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.120
And started bringing this weird noice and
grain and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.209
dust and all kinds of weird textures that
really made

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.519
image come to life. And i just
kept building until i was a

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.350
satisfied. You know they say that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.599
half of art is knowing when to start
and the other half is knowing when to stop.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.349
And this is, I just finally got to that place
where I knew

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.559
that I had my final image.

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.769
Sometimes I now going into a shoot, 
I know what my vision is going to be 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.649
in some times I really don't. 
Sometimes it's just about

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.109
discovering

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.120
where it's headed. And even when I open it
up

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.590
the first in Photoshop

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.929
i still didn't know exactly what is
going to be

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.209
so i just started painting

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.319
through photoshop and adding layers
and it landed in place I was really excited about
