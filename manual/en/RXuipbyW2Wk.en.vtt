00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.580
We are asked what
number's represented

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.260
by the blocks shown.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.930
So we could sit and
count all of these,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.730
but let's think about this a
little bit more constructively.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.754
So how many blocks do we have
in one of these squares here?

00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:13.420
Well, let's see.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.320
It's a 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.300
by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, so this is a 10

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.250
by 10 square.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.890
It's going to have 100 blocks.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.070
So this is 100.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.640
This is another 100,
so we have two 100's.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.540
So 200 blocks from these two.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.650
And then let's count
these right over here.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.500
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10 in each of these rows.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.750
And we have four of these rows.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.310
So 4 times 10, that's 40.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.820
So we have 200 and
then 40-- 240 blocks.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.250
Let's check our answer.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.580
Now, you might be saying,
what's the whole point

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.430
of this exercise?

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.800
Isn't this just an exercise
in counting blocks?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.620
But you might notice something
interesting happening here.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.280
When I wrote this
2 here, it's making

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.090
you appreciate that that 2
doesn't just represent 2.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.080
It's in the hundreds place,
so that 2 is actually

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.760
representing 200.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.250
It's representing both of
these squares of blocks

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.310
right over here.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.570
This 4 doesn't just represent 4.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.770
It's in the tens place, so
it actually represents 40.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.450
It's representing these
four groups of 10.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.080
This is these two groups of 100.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.250
This is these four groups of 10.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.250
Let's do another one.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.250
Oh, this is interesting.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.600
So let's do the hundreds first.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.940
So we have one group of
100 right over there,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.000
so it's going to be 100.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.890
And then let's see, we have
five groups of 10, so 150.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.900
And then we just have 4 blocks,
so we just have that 4 there.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.740
So let's check, make
sure we got it right.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.460
And you see that this 4--
that's in the ones place.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.190
So it literally
represents 4 blocks.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.730
This 5, that's in
the tens place.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.650
So it's literally representing
five groups of 10-- 1,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.810
2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.870
And this 1 is in
the hundreds place.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.020
It literally
represents one group

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.640
of 100, this big
square right over here.
