Hey guys Oli here and today we’re back with
Rare month, our month long celebration of

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.070
all things Rareware, we’ll be looking at
many of the legendary developers games all

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.721
through the month leading up to the release
of Rare Replay on August 4th so be sure to

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:29.050
subscribe and check back for all our reviews
over the coming month.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.940
Today we’re taking a look at what I consider
to be perhaps Rare’s most underrated title.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:50.440
This is Kameo: Elements of Power

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.310
Originally conceptualized as a gamecube title
before the sale to Microsoft in 2002 Kameo

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.280
was moved to the original Xbox and then subsequently
to the 360 late in it’s development.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.439
Kameo launched alongside the 360 on November
22nd 2005 and was for whatever reason forgotten

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.439
fairly quickly.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.250
This is something I’ve never really understood
as this title has all the hallmarks of a great

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.990
Rare game, it’s got an expansive world,
great character designs, and a fantastic soundtrack.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.140
Yet despite this the game never really caught
on and had its planned sequel subsequently

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.510
canceled.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.280
Which really is a shame as there’s so many
great things about this game.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.450
In any case 10 years on does Kameo Elements
of Power still have the element of fun?

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.680
Or should you steer clear of this fabled fairy
tale?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.680
Let’s find out

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:50.729
Kameo begins with the titular character storming
the castle of the troll king thorn to save

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.830
her family only to discover her sister Klus
has betrayed the kingdom and sided with the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.090
green menace.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.630
She is promptly defeated and stripped of her
powers.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.400
From here you are woken by the mystic.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.300
She gives you the lowdown on the kingdom and
you are gifted, a magical book called the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.470
wotnot with the task of returning the elemental
sprites to the book and restoring Kameo’s

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.979
elemental powers.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.140
From here it’s a very average fantasy tale,
there’s not really any major plot twists

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.870
or anything but I’d argue it’s not really
necessary and in typical Rare fare the tale

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.560
is very lighthearted and genuinely fun to
go through.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:37.860
Just don’t go in expecting anything Tolkien
calibur and you’ll be fine, promise.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:46.950
Kameo while sharing some similarities with
many of Rare’s platforms is more of an action

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.510
game in my own opinion.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.980
The game is based around the idea of transforming
into different creatures to complete your

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.130
objectives, sometimes switching on the fly.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.780
For example a technique you use throughout
the game is launching from a wall as the armadillo

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.770
like major ruin and then quickly switching
to the ape-like chilla to grab onto an ice

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.879
wall and pull yourself up.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.400
The game has many such maneuvers and they’re
generally a lot of fun to pull off.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.440
Granted not every transformation is a winner,
for instance the underwater combat with Deep

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.830
Blue can be very frustrating, you see when
I’m underwater I expect the character to

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.730
control more like a plane, essentially inverted,
where to pull up you push down on the analogue

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.000
stick but, Deep Blue moves in whatever direction
you point which is terribly confusing when

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.569
most games, including Rare’s own do the
opposite.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.879
Though you can get used to it.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.710
Luckily the game is never terribly difficult,
which is good for frustrations sake but also

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.659
part of the games biggest problem.

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.769
You see Kameo is incredibly short and can
easily be run through in about 6 hours, there

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.760
is a second difficulty and co-op multiplayer
but these do little to extend the replay value

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.030
of the game, especially since only certain
sections of the game are playable in co-op

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.330
and only after you’ve already completed
them in singleplayer.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.120
Apart from that there also side missions Kameo
can complete but if you’ve already beaten

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.480
the game there's little reason to do them
so I’d recommend playing as many of these

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.330
as you can while you’re actively playing
the story for maximum playtime.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.380
Overall Kameo’s gameplay foundations are
very solid and she controls as well as any

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.629
of Rare’s best protagonists, whether you’re
hopping around as flex, or going all mumbo

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:22.349
jumbo with pummel-weed.

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.539
Oh did I mention there’s a Mumbo skin? it’s
really great!

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:42.939
In short Kameo is a fun but regrettably short
adventure.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:47.550
though the game shows much of its sixth generation
origins in the visual department, Kameo nonetheless

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.849
remains a very nice looking title.

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.840
All the character and environment designs
are classic Rare.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.460
Which is to say the game from the adorable
elemental sprites to the vast environments

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.970
looks great.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.460
About the only flaw on the visual end is the
framerate in basically all the battle sections

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.249
has regular hitches and many times teeters
on the verge of a slideshow.

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.139
Moving onto the music which was composed by
Steve Burke the tracks in Kameo are some of

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.020
the most catchy stuff in any or Rare’s releases,
it’s much bigger and more epic sounding

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.229
than the more playful stuff you tend to see
from Rare’s other composers, the main theme

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.199
where you’re storming the castle has been
regularly playing in my head for years now

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:31.960
and if that doesn’t say it all I don’t
know what will.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.629
Kameo for all it’s flaws is easily one of
Rare’s most memorable releases since being

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:43.330
bought by microsoft and if you haven’t given
it a shot it is a game I’d highly recommend

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.060
. It’s has all the trademarks of a great
rare game, witty dialogue, vast worlds, wonderful

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.319
art, and incredible music.

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.509
Just don’t expect to get more than a weekend
out of it.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.699
Kameo: Elements of Power gets a 4 out of 5
