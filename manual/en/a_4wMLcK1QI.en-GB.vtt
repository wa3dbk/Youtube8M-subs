00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.240
Hi everyone! Welcome to Amanda's Taste

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.700
Today I'm going to teach you how to make this

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.700
Very popular cheese pork ribs in Korea

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.800
This dish combines cheese and pork ribs together

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.140
Put two tempting things together to make it a better one

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.680
Let's see how to cook the pork ribs

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.420
We need 1kg of spare ribs

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.060
And some Korean seasonings

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.040
Honey, Korean hot pepper paste, ginger, sesame oil

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.900
Soy sauce, garlic, onion, and apple

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.160
First, peel the onion, garlic, ginger, and apple

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.980
The aroma of the apple matches perfectly with the pork

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.360
And it can also help soften the meat

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.000
Use a microplane to mash the onion, apple, and ginger

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.640
You can also use this kind of special dish

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.896
To mash the vegetables

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.780
Or food processor or mixer will work as well

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.820
Just use anything you have

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.960
To mash the onion, apple, and ginger

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.080
And mix them altogether

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.840
Use a garlic press to make the garlic into mashed garlic

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.020
After you mix everything

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.160
Pour the hot pepper paste into it

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.840
And sesame oil

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.960
Honey

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.020
And soy sauce

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.880
Mix everything well together

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.420
This is the sauce to marinate the pork ribs

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440
If you want it to taste spicier

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.540
You can add some Korean hot pepper powder in

00:02:14.954 --> 00:02:16.214
Let's check the pork ribs out

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.740
This pork ribs have a natural curve

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.510
The concave side has a white membrane

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.960
Better remove it so the pork ribs can absorb more taste

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.860
Brush the sauce we just made evenly on the pork ribs

00:02:32.697 --> 00:02:34.697
Brush both sides

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.540
And also all the edges and corners

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.980
Cover it with plastic wrap and cool it in the fridge

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.900
Cool it for at least 3 hours

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.900
Better if you can put it overnight

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780
The second day when the ribs are ready

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.700
Preheat the oven to 150º

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.220
Take an aluminum foil

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.780
Place the pork ribs on it and wrap it up

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.540
And the second layer

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.780
Don't throw the sauce away

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.697
Save it for later

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.040
Place the wrapped pork ribs on the tray

00:03:23.262 --> 00:03:25.262
The convex side should face down

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.220
Put into the 150º middle oven for about 80 minutes

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.000
Let's prepare the side dishes and cheese while waiting

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.580
I used two kinds of cheese

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.060
Mozzarella &amp; red-leicester

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.380
Just buy this kind of shredded cheese

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.560
I use kimchi, jalapeño, sweet corn

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.340
And gherkins for the side dishes

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.360
And the parsley for decoration

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.320
Take out the pork ribs after baking for 80 minutes

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.800
Raise the temperature of the oven to 180º

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.460
Unwrapped the aluminum foil

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.620
Directly cover the tray with the outer layer aluminum foil

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.280
And unwrapped the inner layer aluminum foil

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.220
You can see the juice runs from the pork ribs

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.720
We are going to throw these juice out

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.700
Just place the pork ribs on the tray

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.260
And brush the sauce we just made on the pork ribs

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.480
Brush both sides

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.680
Place the convex side upward

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.820
And put it into the 180º oven for 10 minutes

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.060
Take it out after 10 minutes

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.440
And brush the sauce again

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.480
Put it back, still 180º for 10 minutes

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.320
The pork ribs with two layers of sauce

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.320
Came out in this beautiful color

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.740
Use a pan that would fit in the oven

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.023
Place the pork ribs on it

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.160
Because it is too long

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.780
Cut it half from the center

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.320
Don't turn off the oven

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.540
Raise it to 200º for later use

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.300
Spread the shredded cheese next to the pork ribs

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.880
Place some sliced chili pepper and jalapeños on top

00:05:50.608 --> 00:05:52.448
And the corn kernels

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.560
Back into the oven

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.900
Use 200º to bake for the last 10 minutes

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:03.465
Until the cheese is slightly melted

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.180
You can prepare an induction oven

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.000
When bringing it on to the table

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.620
Place the pan on it

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.020
Turn on the lowest heat

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.980
To keep the cheese nice and gooey

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.420
Use a pair of scissors to separate the pork ribs

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.680
Cut it into pieces like this

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.300
And enjoy it by dipping it into the cheese

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.640
This popular cheese pork ribs is done

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.600
After marinated in the sauce for a long period of time

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.160
The pork ribs taste sweet and spicy

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.840
And also after a long period time of baking

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.980
The surface is very cripsy

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.260
The meat tastes very soft and has a firm texture

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.720
The rib works just fine with itself

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.060
Dipping it in

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.640
And the gherkins and other side dishes we just prepared

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.860
Put the whole pan on the table is just like having hot pot

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.420
This is the dish to share with friends

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.900
