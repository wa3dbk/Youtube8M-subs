00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.189
I want to try to unite a lot of these disparate
parts of the Bible, the many small books clustered

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.679
here at the end that we'll be considering.
I'm going to try to unite them by elaborating

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.309
certain themes as we move through them. First,
let's begin with the Book of Ruth. The Book

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.080
of Ruth is set in the days of the Judges;
that's the opening line of the book. It tells

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.550
you that this happened in the days of Judges,
but it was certainly written later, and whether

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.460
it was post-exilic or pre-exilic is not certain,
so we're going to be asking the questions

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.640
of a canonical critic. Whatever its origin,
how did this book function for Second Temple

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.410
Jews? As the story of a foreign woman, whose
foreign status is continually emphasized throughout

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.840
the book, (Ruth the Moabite, Ruth the Moabitess)--
as a foreign woman who acts nobly and enters

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.460
the community of Israel by choice, this story
would have stood in opposition to the negative

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.620
view of foreigners, the ban on intermarriage
and the purely genealogical definition of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.760
Israelite identity that was promulgated by
Ezra and Nehemiah in the post-exilic period.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.929
So in the story you have a famine in Judah
and that causes a Bethlehemite man, Elimelech

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.240
and his wife Naomi, and their two children
to leave Judah. They're going to reside in

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.950
the country of Moab, where the Moabites live,
and their two sons marry Moabite women, Orpah

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.389
and Ruth. You have to consider the effect
that these opening verses would have had on

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:33.539
an ancient Israelite listener or reader. Moab
was a hostile neighbor on Israel's southeastern

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.060
border. And the Moabites were hated for their
ill-treatment of the Israelites when they

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.189
were traveling to the Promised Land. Their
lack of hospitality had already led to a prohibition

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.369
of intermarriage in the Torah itself. So the
Moabites and Ammonites are two foreign groups

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.459
that are explicitly prohibited from entering
the congregation in Deuteronomy 23. The Israelites'

00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:00.789
low opinion of the Moabites is also expressed
in Genesis in the very degrading story of

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.319
Moab's descent from the incestuous relationship
between Lot and one of his daughters, after

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.879
the fall of Sodom. And yet here we read, in
the opening lines of this story [of] a man

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.170
from Bethlehem, who travels to Moab, and his
two sons marry Moabite women! Then in short

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.360
order Elimelech and his two sons (who are
appropriately named Sickness and Death, by

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.180
the way, in Hebrew) they die. And the Israelite
widow, Naomi, is left now with no blood relation,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.790
no blood male relation, only her two Moabite
daughters-in-law. And Naomi weepily tells

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.959
the girls that they should return to their
father's home. She's poor, she'll never be

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.099
able to support them as a poor widow, she
has no further sons to give to them, and clearly

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.659
they have no legal or moral obligation or
tie to Naomi. And we'll pick up the story

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.580
then in chapter 1:11:
But Naomi replied, "Turn back, my daughters!

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.709
Why should you go with me? Have I any more
sons in my body who might be husbands for

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.730
you? Turn back, my daughters, for I am too
old to be married. Even if I thought there

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.909
was hope for me, even if I married tonight
and I also bore sons, should you wait for

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.510
them to grow up? Should you on their account
debar yourselves from marriage? Oh no, my

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.220
daughters! My lot is far more bitter than
yours, for the hand of the Lord has struck

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.220
out against me."

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.990
They broke into weeping again, and Orpah kissed
her mother-in-law farewell. But Ruth clung

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.780
to her. So she said, "See, your sister-in-law
has returned to her people and her gods. Go

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.549
follow your sister-in-law." But Ruth replied,
"Do not urge me to leave you, to turn back

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.430
and not follow you. For wherever you go, I
will go; wherever you lodge, I will lodge;

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.379
your people shall be my people, and your God
my God. Where you die, I will die, and there

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.659
I will be buried. Thus and more may the Lord
do to me if even death parts me from you."

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.780
When [Naomi] saw how determined she was to
go with her, she ceased to argue with her;

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.499
and the two went on until they reached Bethlehem.
