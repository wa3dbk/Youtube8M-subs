00:00:08.807 --> 00:00:11.845
I m an engineer by training, from INSA Toulouse    

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:16.224
and I work since 30 years in the automobile competition. 

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:20.270
In October 2007, the company Mac Burnie Classic Cars was created

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:25.567
with the objective of restoration English vehicles from 1950 to 1970

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:34.492
but we also developed another activity of retail accessory for historical vehicles.

00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:55.889
More than only the restoration of historical vehicles, we provide our experience of the modern mechanics

00:00:56.097 --> 00:01:01.728
especially in two fields: reliability and security.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:22.123
I had a car which was a FORD Mustang imported from the States that we put in the container when we came back

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:27.128
It needed a lot of repairs and a full restoration.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.679
So with Mr Mac Burnie we restored completely the car from a mechanics point of view

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.809
we changed a lot of part but also from an aesthetics point of view

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:46.398
we polished the car, changed some part of the car body, redone the tailpipe...

00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:52.779
This car was restored from A to Z with a fully respected budget

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:57.007
the planning was also respected and the quality irreproachable

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:19.973
In 2009 we started to talk again with Chrysler Group for a return in the competition by the intermediary of SRT Street Racing Technology

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:24.811
which developed a VIPER GT SR in the GTE category

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:29.274
to participate to the ALMS American Le Mans Serie Championship

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:33.742
in the 24 hours of Le Mans starting in the middle of 2012 season. 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:39.784
This activity was the purpose of a second company SRT Motors Sports Europe,

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.203
with the approval of Chrysler.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:47.876
The target of this company is the distribution of the brand new VIPER GT3-R,

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:55.383
distribution of spare parts, technical assistance on the tracks,

00:02:55.383 --> 00:03:00.847
and a daily relation technical and commercial with our clientsâ€¦.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.964
We gave an appointment with great pleasure on the European tracks and in the different historical vehicles salons,

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:38.464
to all our clients and our sympathizers.
