00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.020
So this is a very, very, very nice sample
of very fine copper

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.660
wire. So the copper wire here is…what width
is this? This is

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.199
0.0. I’m not even going to… that is just
too small.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.380
Copper is unusual among the metals in that
it is coloured. It

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.430
is only copper and gold that are coloured.
So you can see

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.070
here we have copper coins. In fact, you can
see that this one

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.440
looks brighter that that one, that is a modern
one that’s been

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.820
plated and you can see it is a slight cheat
because modern UK

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.230
coins although they have copper inside they
have iron inside

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.960
so with a magnet you can just pick them up
but the proper

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.500
copper coins are not magnetic at all.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.559
So it is 0.1 of a millimetre. So the copper
wire here is very,

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.610
very high grade, this is grade 1 copper wire
and it is 0.1 of a

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.340
millimetre in diameter and you can see the
wonderful

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.780
copperous lustre.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.179
Copper compounds are not very reactive, in
fact if you put

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:11.649
iron filings into copper sulphate or some
other copper salt,

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.579
the copper coats out on the iron filings and
which are gray

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.380
and then they go a nice sort of rosy colour
almost like gold.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.640
It’s often one of the first experiments
that people do as

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.950
chemists.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.450
What do you mean by ‘Grade 1 copper’?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.880
So this very high purity, this is like 99.99%
copper, used for

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.960
electronics fabrications and high quality
research samples. It

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.709
is a very beautiful sample.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:43.249
On the other hand, quite surprisingly, that
copper chloride is

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.329
quite reactive. I did an experiment once in
which I took a

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.099
cupcake container which was made of aluminium
and put

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.739
copper chloride in it, the solution, and it
boiled. I was trying

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.009
to demonstrate how reactive it was to my children.
I didn’t

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.259
notice that the copper chloride had burnt
through the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.579
aluminium and made a hole in our sitting room
carpet.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.770
Most organisms, you and me, use iron in our
blood to

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.580
transport oxygen, that’s what makes our
blood red, but in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.080
some sorts of crustaceans crabs and lobsters
they are

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.200
different: they use copper. They use a copper
called

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.610
hemocyanin. It is a blue compound of copper.
Cyan is some

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.420
classical word for blue, so they really had
blue blood. And

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.810
these hemocyanin uses two atoms of copper
in each molecule

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.220
to transport the oxygen around the body of
the crab or

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.800
lobster but it is not nearly as good as haemoglobin.
So if you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.870
start running after a crab or lobster, it
quickly gets tired

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.940
compared to running after a rabbit or something
like that

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.260
which can keep going faster than you can.
