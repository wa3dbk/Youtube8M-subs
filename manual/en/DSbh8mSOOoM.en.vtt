00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.300
 Hi girls, this is Deedee from DeedeePolish Channel.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.800
Today's video will be about a Nail Art design that I made by using Stamping Technic.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.520
I have couple of stamping plates

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.320
And to do this design, I have chosen this stamping plate with this design.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.540
You can find these Stamping Plates on BornPrettyStore.com 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.960
And they have different shapes of stamping plates with very decent prices.   

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.540
You will find a link to the store and to the stamping plate I'm using in the description box down below.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.960
As usual, start off with the base coat to protect your natural nails.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.320
After it dries off, take some french tips and apply them on your nails.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.220
Apply the black nailpolish now

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.800
Remove immediately the french tips.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.380
After the nailpolish dries off, apply the same french tip you used to put back to it's previous place on your nail.

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:22.094
And put a piece of tape on top of it to protect your nails from the excess nailpolish.

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:29.154
Apply some nailpolish on the plate and drag the the nailpolish to the side by using a credit card.

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:42.075
Use the stamper now to print the image immediately on your nails as shown.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.320
Remove immediately the tape.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.500
Use a thin brush to create a line on the edge on the tips with silver nailpolish

00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:07.551
End up with a base coat

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.640
Use a small brush with nailpolish remover to remove the excess nailpolish on your nails. 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.460
And this is the end results

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:33.920
