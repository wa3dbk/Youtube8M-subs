00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:15.760
The sanctity in Nazareth's alley,
the special festive atmosphere,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.895
the hospitable and welcoming people.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.878
History at every corner.
We cannot describe in words.

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:28.179
We should just listen to the voices
and enjoy the pictures.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.755
Christmas in Nazareth,
the city where it all began.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:38.936
When we say that it is
the beginning of everything

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:42.315
that beginning started in Nazareth.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.358
Everything started, 
I mean the new times,

00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:54.384
the new mankind, 
the new message,

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:57.896
and what we call the New Testament.

00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:00.149
Here in Nazareth
in the north of Israel

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.820
lived Holy Mary
and her husband Joseph.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.614
Here the angel Gabriel
was revealed to Mary

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:08.244
and announced her
that she was pregnant.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.376
Here Jesus grew
from childhood to adulthood.

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:19.192
I think it touches your heart
to stay here where it all began.

00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:23.813
Here you have so much different
types of people, and we like it.

00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:29.335
It's the first time we see
that the small Jesus Christ is not frozen

00:01:29.447 --> 00:01:32.250
like we say In Germany.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.202
We have to see the old things
that we've been reading in the Bible

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.936
and touch it by ourselves

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:42.420
and have the spiritual aspect of it,
and that is why we are here.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.989
Merry Christmas. -Happy new year.
-We are from Philipines.

00:01:53.989 --> 00:02:00.275
Not only as tourists, but they are
called to come here to experience

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:05.450
what I describe as
a spiritual pilgrimage in their life.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.474
The tranditional procession
on Christmas Eve

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:46.110
and the mass of the
Basilica of the Annunciation

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.106
are the main most exciting
Christmas events in the city.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.518
We are celebrating in this event.
It's a great joy.

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:21.275
and all of us are really happy.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.121
The holiday festivities.

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:28.856
Together with the prayers
at one of the holiest places in Christianity

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.233
in a city where it all began.
