00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.240
and last but not least we always link to a
great article actually in this case Iím linking

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.240
to Carol Davis.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.660
So you can go to her website and you can look
at the product you may say okay this is how

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.370
Antonio described it and this is good for
me or if not well then you can do whatever

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.600
you want.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.750
Okay so this is the webfoot sock and itís
made ñ the key with all of Carol Davisí

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.390
products is made from the Malden Mills of
power stretch polar tech fabric.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.209
This is super high tech fabric that wicks
away moisture from the body.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.159
Itís got a four way stretch to it.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.310
Itís bacteria resistant and it has excellent
loathe.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.079
And loath is the insulation property of being
able to keep in air and be able to prevent

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.079
heat loss.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.241
So why do you ñ I donít know about you guys
when Iím out and Iím moving about Iím actually

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:30.079
running outside a lot when itís cold or Iím
doing an active sport perhaps snowboarding.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.450
Actually I donít snowboard, my brother does.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.420
Heís really good by the way but no I just
happen to live in a very cold area.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.070
Iím in Wisconsin.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.209
It gets so cold here.

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.930
I had to ñ my oil froze in my truck.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.030
I mean what kind of ñ well I need to get
back to test anyway.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.979
But in Wisconsin I have learned to appreciate
this socks and itís funny my wife has probably

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.679
hijacked this and is taken away.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.349
So Carol if youíre watching this please send
a pair to my wife so I can get my socks back.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.509
But we washed this and theyíre very clean
and I can tell you in having owned this for

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.810
probably five years now.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.829
This is a great product.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.740
There are no holes.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.879
My wife actually wears this as slippers around
the house.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.340
And they are very good quality.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.489
So the fabric does not ñ I mean you can just
tell by the stitching and the fabric make

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.579
up that we have not worn holes on this because
we are rough on this things.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.040
But the key I think if youíre wearing this
out and when I notice when Iím wearing this

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.319
out and itís really cold.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.959
Letís say Iím running or I may have boots
on and Iím going to be tracking through the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.299
snow, it wicks away the sweat from your feet.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.500
Which is really important because if youíre
feet get wet and if youíre wearing cub socks,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.020
youíre done because youíre going to get
all that moisture in there and itís going

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.370
to basically get your boots wet.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.159
And you need something that can wick away
the moisture and allow it to escape.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.560
So one you probably need to have the right
type of boots on which allow the moisture

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560
to escape.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.549
But the other part is you donít want that
moisture next to your feet because your boots

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.549
can get a little bit what they can absorb
a certain amount of moisture.

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.489
But if your feet get wet and you start getting
cool air in there, thatís a bad recipe.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.330
You can all ñ I mean youíre going to get
an extreme you know.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.379
Well wonít get in the damage that can cause
but if youíre out, youíre out hunting.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.540
Youíre out in doing any type of place where
your feet need to stay warm for long periods

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.540
of time.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.010
You donít want bacteria growth.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.750
You need to go with something like this.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.849
The only other alternative I could say are
going to be high tech wool socks that are

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.540
specifically made for this.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.370
And in that case youíre going to spend a
lot more than you are with Carol Davis because

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.769
this power stretch polar tech is a synthetic
fabric.

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.680
And I donít know the exact make up, itís
usually going to be polyester and a few other

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680
woods.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.469
But itís woven in a way thatís designed
to pull that moisture away and actually trap

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.049
in the air and keep you warm.

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.879
So itís not going to have the same bulk as
wool, thatís another thing I love about it.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.180
But the great thing is you could actually
wear this and you could layer up with wools

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.180
underneath.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.890
So take a pair of wool socks with you if youíre
going to be out hunting.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.590
And letís say you got to hike two miles,
three miles to your shooting spot.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.099
Pull on the wool socks after you get to your
location and then youíre great just sitting

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.060
there all day, youíre going to be fine.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.480
So I think Iíve covered it.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.590
They wick.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.710
They loathe the insulating properties.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:22.870
They stretch ñ this has got that four way
stretch which is really important.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.569
Cotton a lot of times, it will stretch and
then it will not return back until you throw

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:27.750
in to the dryer.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.030
This stuff is going to stretch right back
to where it was at.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.160
So they actually ñ they look a little bit
like theyíre not you know to me when I first

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160
saw them.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.449
Itís like wow thereís a lot of excess room
down here but the great part is that they

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.240
stretch and they come right back.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.680
So they actually hug your legs pretty well.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.009
canít really ñ all I can say is that this
is really a great product and I highly recommend

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.009
it.

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.820
Sheís got multiple size go to her website.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.970
Make her purchasing decision for yourself.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.750
But again Iíve owned this for five years.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.979
My wife probably has want them more than me
which I ñ guess I should have her do the

00:04:58.979 --> 00:04:59.979
review here.

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:00.979
But I can tell you guysÖ

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.460
Öa great product highly recommend it especially
if youíre going to be outdoors and youíre

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.900
going to be in an extreme cold weather.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.840
This has been Antonio Centeno with ìReal
Men, Real Styleî.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.840
Take care.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840
Iíll see you later.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.842
Ba bye.
