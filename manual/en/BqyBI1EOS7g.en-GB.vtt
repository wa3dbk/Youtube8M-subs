00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.960
Hi guys. It is Binky from Made in Chelsea
and welcome back to my series of Binky's Boutique

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.160
on Videojug. I am going to show you how to
do a colourful summer look, perfect for the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.160
beach.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.370
I am going to be using the Clarins Skin Illusion
Foundation. I am not going to use too much.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.380
I am going to put it on my fingers because
when you're on the beach, you just whack it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.610
on. It has got SPF10, so it is protecting
you from the sun for a little bit.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.020
Also, it is really light, quite moisturizing.
It is not bad for your skin because it is

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.640
not too heavy. Put it down under your eyes,
wherever, anywhere you feel needs be.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.240
The next step I am going to be using the Bare
Minerals that is called Chic Nude. You want

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.550
to get all the products into the top bit of
the lid. Give it a bit of a shake, then, again

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.870
with my finger, I am just going to apply it
to the whole of my eyelid. Just dab it on

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.960
with my finger.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.520
It is a really pretty, bright colour.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.430
I am going right up to the eyebrow with this,
as well. It is a really shimmery and pretty

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.760
colour.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.170
Next up, I am going to be using the waterproof
eye pencil by Clarins and it is called turquoise.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.889
This is a really great colour for the summer.
It has been all over the catwalks. And, so,

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:23.920
I am going to use it in the lashline.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:34.679
Smudge it up with your finger. I am also going
to be putting it on in the waterline, as well.

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.619
Next up, I am going to be using the Guerlain
Terracotta Bronzer. This is a really, really

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.670
brilliant product. I think it is one of the
best in the country. And, I am going to be

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.310
using it on my cheeks, forehead, nose. I am
going to put it here, as well, under my chin.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.479
Then, I am going to be finishing off with
this really pretty pink blusher from Guerlain

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.859
again. This is called rose. Again, apply it
from the brush. Smile. Just get the apple

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.109
of your cheeks and just apply it, like that.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.681
Again, I am using this really pretty shimmer
that I used on my eyelid. I am going to use

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:20.420
it in the corner of my eyes. It makes you
look more awake.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.099
Just using your finger, pop on your cheekbones.

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.000
This is the petal pink Clarins lipstick. This
is going to be a really good contrast with

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.870
my turquoise eyes and it gives the lips a
bit of a pop, a bit more colour to the face.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.790
I am going to roughly apply it. It is a really
pretty pink colour. I am going to be using

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.410
this little gloss, which is Daniel Sandler.
Just give it a really extra bit of a shimmer

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.180
to your lips.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.770
