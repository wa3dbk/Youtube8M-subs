00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.270
When it comes to painting, we all want to
jump in and just start rolling that beautiful

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.120
new color on the wall.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.679
But spending a few extra minutes on prep work
will give you much better results and help

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.139
you avoid problems along the way.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.160
Start by clearing the room, OR moving furniture
to the center and covering with plastic.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.780
For the floor, use canvas drop cloths since
plastic can get slippery.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.700
Shut off the circuit breakers to the room
you're painting.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.250
Then remove cover plates from switches and
outlets, and protect with tape.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.429
If you're painting the ceiling, pop off the
blades of your ceiling fan, slide the cover

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.949
plate down, and wrap with plastic.

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.350
Doorknobs can be wrapped with a plastic bag.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.469
Once you've got the place covered you can
start making repairs.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.239
Strip old wallpaper with a paper remover and
removal tools.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.379
For flaking paint, use a putty knife to scrape
it off.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.140
No need for elbow grease, just remove the
loose stuff.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.780
Now if you're like the rest of us, you probably
have a few dings in your walls.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.319
But no worries, they're an easy fix.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:09.010
First clean the hole with a brush, then apply
some spackle—or wood filler for trimwork.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.910
Let it dry, sand smooth, and prime.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.930
A patch kit works great for large holes.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.160
To fix serious damage, watch our How to Repair
Drywall video.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.030
A clean wall is essential for a quality paint
job.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.550
Vacuum dust and do a quick wipe down with
a damp rag.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.130
If your walls have oil or other residue on
them, wash with trisodium phosphate—TSP

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.760
for short—for a more thorough cleaning.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.030
Then rinse with water and let dry.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.050
The next step is priming.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.030
Priming is needed when painting over bare
drywall, stained or repaired areas, high-gloss

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.930
finishes, and drastic color changes.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.930
There are many paint-and-primer-in-one products
available that can save time on this step.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.610
One more thing.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.860
Some surfaces, like trimwork, might've been
painted with oil-based paint, which can't

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.350
be painted over with latex.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.090
Here's how to check.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.250
Wet a cotton swab with alcohol and rub the
surface.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.680
If the paint comes off, it's latex.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.070
If not, it's oil.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.190
In that case, lightly sand the surface and
cover with a bonding primer.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.730
And that's a wrap on the prep.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.940
