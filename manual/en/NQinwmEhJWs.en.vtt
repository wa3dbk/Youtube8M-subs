Hey guys, welcome back to another restore
my sneakers dot com video.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.350
In this episode, I’m going to attempt to
remove midsoles creases from the Air Jordan

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.350
11.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.210
I actually had a couple people ask if there
was a way to remove the creases from the midsole

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.740
of Air Jordan 11.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.470
And apparently, someone on Sole Collector
forums figured out that steam could actually

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.289
remove creases from the midsoles.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.730
So that’s why I’m doing this video.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.300
Personally, I don’t really mind the creases.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.810
There going to happen when you wear them

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.480
However, for those of you looking for a solution,
this video may help.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.470
Just to let you know, this possible solution
may be temporary.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.490
If you wear these shoes again, they may crease
again.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.190
What I’m going to try use is a fabric steamer
to try and remove the creases on the midsole.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.070
The first shoe that I’m going to test it
on is the Air Jordan 11 low.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.640
So I’m going to put a piece of cloth on
the patent leather, to protect it from any

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640
damage.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.080
So here is this fabric steamer.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:02:35.300
As you just saw, the fabric steamer was able
to remove the creases from the midsoles.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.930
It did take a few tries, but you can actually
see noticeable results.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.370
Just to test out if this process works on
other shoe that use the same midsole type

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.439
as the 11’s, which is phylon,

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.519
I’m going to remove the creases from the
Nike Sharkalaid.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.140
So this is the Nike Sharkalaid.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:04:35.810
As you just saw, the fabric steamer was able
to remove most of the creases on the phylon

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.810
midsole.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.030
Especially the area where the swoosh was at.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:46.060
A few precaution, since steam is really hot,
it can actually melt the glue and cause separation.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.310
So be sure to take breaks when necessary.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.360
If you happen to attempt this process, be
sure to leave us a video response or comment

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.539
letting us know how it all went for you.

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.020
did you get minimal results, did you get great
results

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.620
Also, if you have questions about this process,
be sure to leave one below.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.430
So there you have it, that’s how you remove
the creases from a phylon midsole.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.430
Hope you guys enjoyed this video, make sure
