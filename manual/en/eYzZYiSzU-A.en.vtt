00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.330
Add the Rightline Gear Car Clips to the standard
straps of any Rightline

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.840
Gear carrier to attach it to a vehicle without
a roof rack.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.610
The Car Clips
come standard with the Sport Jr. and Car Top

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.880
Duffle Bag.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.289
To add the Car Clip to the standard strap,
place the strap buckle side down

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.079
and then run the strap through the back side
of the Car Clip until the loop

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.320
shows through like this.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:45.030
Then bring the opposite end of the strap through
that loop and feed it through.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.220
Pull it tight around the clip until it looks
like this.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.500
When you've added a clip to each end of the
strap, they should end up

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.250
facing each other when the strap is laid over
the carrier.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.809
Each standard
strap has a long strap piece and a short strap

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.290
piece connected through a
center buckle.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.230
To attach a carrier to the vehicle, first
connect the long

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.680
strap piece to the other side of the vehicle.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.820
Then disconnect the short
strap piece from the buckle.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.270
In most cases, the Car Clip will attach behind
the rubber weather molding

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.860
in the open door frame of your vehicle.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.990
Once it's secure, run the strap up
through the D-ring of the carrier and then

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.380
loop it through the center
buckle.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.960
Once the strap makes its way through the buckle,
you can pull tight

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.520
and get some tension.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.360
You'll see the strap is holding the bag in
place by

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.180
pulling on the Car Clips in the open door
frame.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.400
Once I'm at this point, I'm going to close
the door over the clip and strap

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.240
to secure it in place.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.910
I'm going to tie off the extra length of strap
that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.930
I have here.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.750
Once that's done, check the straps one more
time and you're

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.250
ready to go.
