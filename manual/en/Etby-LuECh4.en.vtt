00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.100
Samsung Omnia PRO (B7610).

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.010
Another addition to the Omnia family, the
Samsung Omnia PRO B7610 is a Windows Mobile

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.289
smartphone with a 3.5" 480 x 800 pixel display,
a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, a 5 megapixel

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.310
camera, 3.5G support, WiFi and GPS.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.910
We don't see this format of phone from Samsung
very often, the last one we can remember is

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.809
the F700.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.629
It looks very much more like an HTC handset
than a Samsung.

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.079
Confusingly for a smartphone, this Omnia PRO
comes with a "B-series" model number rather

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.100
than the more usual "I-series" that Samsung
smartphones tend to use.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.340
Are Samsung making this up as they go along?

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.289
Samsung have put their 800 MHz processor at
the heart of the Omnia PRO B7610.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.220
Although the actual speed of the processor
is not strictly dependent on the clock rate,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.270
we're pretty sure that this will be faster
than the 528 MHz one in the rival HTC Touch

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.630
Pro2.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.370
The large display will be ideal for web browsing,
and combine this with the large QWERTY keyboard

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.050
and you have an impressive looking ultra-mobile
computing device.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.100
The anticipated launch date of the Omnia PRO
B7610 is October 2009, and although Samsung

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.399
have indicated that this phone will ship with
Windows Mobile 6.1, there should be an upgrade

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.300
available to Windows Mobile 6.5 at about the
time of launch.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.220
The camera is good for a Windows Mobile device,
the B7610 has a 5 megapixel unit with autofocus

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.459
and dual LED flash, multishot and panoramic
stitching, and video recording resolution

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.940
is 720 x 480 pixels (we guess at 30 frames
per second).

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.100
The Omnia PRO B7610 can play back most major
media files including MP3, Windows Media and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.030
DivX formats.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.770
There's a standard 3.5mm audio socket, and
media can be stored on the 1GB of internal

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.440
memory or on microSD cards (up to 32GB).

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.180
The B7610 also has an FM radio.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.870
GPS is built in, and it comes with the Route
66 personal navigation package in certain

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.280
regions.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.460
If you want a different SatNav package, then
there is plenty of choice available for this

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.790
platform.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.540
The large touch-sensitive display is ideal
for use in this respect.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.270
This is an HSDPA capable device, but Samsung
are not clear about the maximum download speed,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.940
quoting it as either 3.6 Mbps or 7.2 Mbps.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.850
HSUPA doesn't seem to be supported, but WiFi
is included as you might expect.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.460
Windows Mobile comes with all the usual features,
including integration with Microsoft Exchange,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.540
a choice of either Internet Explorer or Opera
web browsers, and a good set of personal information

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.750
management tools.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.030
Samsung say that the B7610 will ship with
the TouchWiz interface, although the press

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.950
photos appear to show a plain Windows Mobile
6.5 interface.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.620
We don't know how much the Samsung Omnia PRO
B7610 will cost, our guess is that it will

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.130
retail SIM-free for something in the region
of €600 to €700 when it hits the streets

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.930
sometime in Q4 2009.
