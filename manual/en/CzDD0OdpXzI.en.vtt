00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.010
How we doing everybody?

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.010
I'm here at Crutchfield today doing training
for Sol Republic headphones.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.840
I'm going to start off with our Amps, our
in-ear solution that is going to appeal to

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.490
pretty much anybody that's into fitness or
if you just like a smaller headphone.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.350
A solution that's not going to cost a lot
of money that's going to give you amazing

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.580
sound.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.190
One of the things I like most about it is
the fact that you have the curvature on the

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.000
left and the right earphone.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.230
What Sol Republic has done is make a curved
design to help that earbud stay into your

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260
ear longer for added comfort.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.699
Another thing we do is we have a program called
'Eartips for Life,' so if you have Amps or

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.050
our Amps HD, if you happen to loose your eartips
we will replace those eartips as long as you

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.510
have the product.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.309
You also have an M5 connector that allows
you switch back and forth from listening to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.569
music on your phone or device and having phone
conversations.

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.280
If you have music on your phone and are listening
to it and your phone rings, you press one

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.429
button, now your music pauses, have your conversation
with the built-in microphone directly on the

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.429
back.

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:08.990
When that's all said and done, press that
button again, now the music picks up right

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.650
where it left off, so it's designed for simplicity.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.000
The iPhone users can use this as well as those
Android users.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.930
Now for a step up piece, these are the Amps
we're going to introduce now, the Amps HD.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.420
One of the biggest features about the Amps
HD is the flat ribbon design.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.880
What that results in is a tangle-free cord.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.200
Anybody who has had earbuds before, has had
tangled earbuds.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.230
That's no fun.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.480
So for that reason, we've included the flat
ribbon design on the Amps HD.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.280
And also a different sound engine, which is
going to give you different dynamic range,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.710
difference performance.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.409
Depending upon your preference in music or
your preference in sound, you may prefer the

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.840
Amps, you may prefer the Amps HD.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.120
Either way, with Sol Republic you're gonna
get a whole lot more than what you paid for

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.240
with our products.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.210

headphones, feel free to contact Crutchfield
