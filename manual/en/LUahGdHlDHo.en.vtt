Sony Ericssons Commitment to the Java ME platfor

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.030
We are a member of the JCP or Java ME executive committee,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.230
and we are a member of the different JSR community as well.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.070
We also won the 2006 JCP member of the year award.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.270
So our commitment to Java is quite tight and really high in Sony Ericsson.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.050
It is in the top focus of Sony Ericsson.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.270
The history of Java ME at Sony Ericsson

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.060
Looking at what happened in 2003 when we launched our first Java device which was T610,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.100
then Java was quite bad in Sony Ericsson, we receive the worst results with

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.130
all different manufacturers in our own Java.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.200
Then we thought OK what is wrong here,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.270
because the first game I ever saw in device was a very simple game.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.160
It was drag-raising game where you can only see the steering wheel.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.290
You have two buttons to press in order to hit the different gears.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.150
I was supposed to shift, so then we saw Java was this kind of platform,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.100
but no form was to gain in that platform by that time for us Sony Ericsson.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.170
But when we then thought Nokia device coming out with games that were

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.270
as good as the Mofungame, even better than we thought,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.190
we have probably done something wrong here without Java platform in that phone,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.080
because it was the lack of performance in this kind of thing that was really bad in our devices.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.150
And, then we start looking more and more into what Nokia have done that really good,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.270
and what they have done, they had implemented something called Nokia UIAPI.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.100
That we did not find out until we started buying out,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.220
I don’t know how many games we bought, we bought tons of games.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.290
We had cooperation with gaming developers.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.130
They are sending a lot of games to us as well.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.090
When we analyzed all these games, we found out it had this Nokia UIAPI.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.090
I think it was I did a survey on that.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.210
I think it was almost 80% or even 90%,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.220
all the games use Nokia UIAPI in the early days of 2003,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.230
and because they use this API they could not draw all out devices either,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.170
so that became a big focus on Sony Ericsson.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.220
It was not that we need to compliant with the TCK and MIDP any more,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.170
we need to be compliant with which was out there on the market.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.220
And all know Nokia is a big player around about this.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.150
So we add the Nokia UIAPI,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.220
and in 2004, in the K700, we thought that we were going from the worst

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.050
to be actually on the top of the manufacturers around Java here.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.220
We also added Max 3D API, MaxCapture 3D API,

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.060
which we were the first then to know to have

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.230
then a really great 3D development platform as well.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.180
So we saw France’s tennis game that we preloaded on our K700,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.010
received excellent previews,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.250
and the performance was great, and by that time, for 3D games as well.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.190
So we have done quite a lot around java since 2003, then come out in 2004,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.040
and that history then continued over time.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.060
So in 2005 thought now we have really big momentum around java and games.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.220
So then we continued with a device called W550,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.090
this W550 was a gaming device with A and B buttons,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.150
I don’t know if you all remember that one, but it had A and B buttons

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.120
since you played horo santa molding instead of having inportray notewhile gaming.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.250
So then we were on the top of gaming developers as well,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.140
when we received excellence reviews around our performance and our device system,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.180
because that was a big shift for us when we went from T610 to the K700,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.250
we have build up this big bank of content.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.060
We continue building this over time.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.170
We still collect a lot of content.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.130
From beginning it was mostly games,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.040
but the shift we saw in 2006 when one of differences was K800 device,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.060
then we became more on application platform where we saw a lot of applications

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.180
being developed from some, for 3rd

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.090
party that had good connections with our customers operators,

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.100
we thought this had been a very important step,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.190
that we added mult-task VEM for instance, to run several applications at the same time.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.200
So from 2005 we were on gaming platform,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.130
then 2006, we become more on application platform as well,

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.060
still continuing with the strong platform around gaming here.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.220
So then looking at ahead there what happened in 2007,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.110
we continue building on that application storey,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.210
and we became in the same compliant in 2007. 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:26.090
So that was also a huge step for us, I mentioned that we have 19 or shipdoor

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.250
announced devices in 2008, now with them I say compliance.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.060
So I am saying it has been really important to us as well to say we are in the same compliant,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.170
and looking at what happened now in 2008,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.060
instead java has become a first class citizen within Sony Ericsson,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.010
even our native applications has been developed with java as well.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.040
So we have seen this as a big shift, where we started off in early days

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.060
with a gaming platform that evolved being more focus on gaming.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.150
And then in 2008, we see that has become our first class citizen of Sony Ericsson.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.080
Developer Resources available at Sony Ericsson Developer World

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.120
Different develop resources we have of course is the SDK, that you can download for free.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.280
And also you have a lot of developer guidelines, there are lots of examples, as I mentioned, 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.240
please read forums, and reply to things in the forums or ask new question in the forums, 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.020
because that’s how we have seen, we can involve,

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.100
and get better relationship with developers outside.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.230
We have understood that the 3rd parties are really important, they are key to us,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:44.190
they are the ones that are building our proposition around our devices with games, or applications.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.100
I mean that is both are important for us.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.010
So looking at the different relationship we have had,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.060
and who has been really active in developer forums.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.120
We can see that once they are being activated, they are really important to us as well.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.120
So quite often when I receive questions from 3rd parties as well, because that I do quite a lot.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.250
I can very easily direct them to developer world as well.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.240
I means looking at the question I get, 80% of them, I can also with

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.140
“please have a look at the developer guideline at the page…,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.080
I don’t know, 79 or something like that for certain information.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.200
So the information is there.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.120
We see that a lot of people visit the sites often, but continue make it more often.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.270
And continue go to our developer world to find the information, because it is there.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.140
Last words to the Sony Ericsson developer community 

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:48.080
If you have any additional questions, I will be at the java forum at developer world.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.020
Thank you.
