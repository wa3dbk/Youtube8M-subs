00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.430
OK, we're almost done with this little bag,
what we need to do now before we totally finish

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.770
it is put these little draw string stops on
there. And there's a couple of different ways

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.700
to make it. I'm going to make it the most
simple way on one and then the other one I'm

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.340
going to do a trick. So, before I even get
started on making it, putting it together,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:30.619
I'm going to turn these under half an inch
and make seam. And that's going to be on all

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:39.290
side, on this side and this side and along
side here, along side there. OK. I'm just

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.470
going to, there we go. And I'm just eying
this side and the next one I'm actually going

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.690
to measure for you, because I want them to
be the same length. But I'm just running,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.450
turning one under at this point, but this
side I want to make sure, see one inch, I'm

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.110
going to mark an inch. When things are this
small I like to get it exact because it's

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.640
not easy to hide flaws in real small things.
There you go. So now I'm going turn this one

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:22.440
over right there where I have my chalk mark.
Let's run that seam all the way to the end.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:30.850
OK. There's one and I'm going to do the same
thing here. So I'm going to have two identical

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:43.750
pieces with the sides turned under. OK, there's
that. OK. And now I think I'm going to save

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.450
this one for the trick that I'm going to do
to show you how to do it the quick way and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.160
this one I'm going to go ahead and mark it
and then I'm going to show you how to sew

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.010
it and run the drawstring through. But, what
I want you to do first is mark it directly

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:05.210
in half, right there, so one and a half right
in the middle. OK. And then from there you

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.170
need a half an inch on both sides of that
middle mark and that's for that, the drawstring

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.750
to run through and it's going to wrap around
the backside another half an inch for the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.190
backside. I'll just make one simple little
one. OK, so now that we have these marked

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.310
all it is, is cutting it in half and then
making half inch marks on each side of the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.310
middle half and another half inch mark. And
just do that then I'll show you how to make

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.660
this little, this little stop and then we'll
attach it to the drawstring.
