Welcome to twominuteenglish.com. Teaching you English through two-minute lessons.

00:00:07.225 --> 00:00:10.924
In this lesson, we will learn what to say when discussing TV shows.

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:17.604
Hello, Paula. How are you?

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:20.441
I’m good, Jack. And you?

00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:27.087
I’m doing great. Hey, did you watch So 
 You Think You Can Dance last night?

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:32.364
No, I couldn't. I was busy. Was it interesting?

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:39.559
It was fantastic! The Brazilian couple gave quite a performance. You should've seen it!

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.041
Sounds like I should! Which style did they choose this time?

00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:48.797
Contemporary. They were flawless and smooth. 

00:00:49.668 --> 00:00:53.320
The judges and the audience gave them a standing ovation when they were done.

00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:58.318
I’m such a big fan of this show. I don't believe I missed it.

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:06.110
Hey, Eric. Good to see you. Please, come in.

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:11.874
Thanks, man. I was nearby so I thought about dropping by. Were you busy?

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:18.191
Nah! I was looking for something to watch 
 on TV but nothing caught my attention.

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:23.262
I see. Do you have a favorite show? 

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:29.094
Yes, nowadays it’s So You Think You Can Dance. Do you watch it?

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:32.003
No, not really.

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:34.966
You should. It’s awesome.

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:38.997
I like American Idol. I’m a huge fan. 

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.960
I like it too. But sometimes the judges are too mean!

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.320
That’s what it makes even more interesting in my opinion.

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:54.910
What are you watching, Paula?

00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:59.720
Right now nothing important but my favorite show is about to start.

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:02.320
Which one is it? Friends?

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.440
No! It’s How I Met Your Mother! Have you heard about it?

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:11.160
Who hasn't? It’s my favorite sitcom too.

00:02:12.607 --> 00:02:17.520
Yeah. It’s the coolest one these days. I never miss a single episode.

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:26.880
I can’t say the same. But I watch it every time I can. 
 Do you know that it’s been nominated for 24 Emmy Awards?

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:30.040
I did not! Did they win any?

00:02:31.272 --> 00:02:38.030
They won 06! I may miss some episodes but 
 I never miss an Emmy Awards Ceremony!

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.880
Come on Joane, hurry up or we'll be late.

00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:50.840
Just a sec, Paula. I’m getting my car keys. What's the hurry anyway?

00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:53.790
What do you mean, what's the hurry?

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.360
Do you know what day it is?

00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:59.120
Err...Thursday?

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:03.880
Wrong! It’s Once Upon a Time season finale!

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:06.440
It is what?!

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.410
A season finale is the final episode of the season! 
 If we don’t hurry, I’ll  miss it! 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.560
Please, please, let’s go!

00:03:17.883 --> 00:03:19.510
Alrite, alrite. Just get in the car.

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:27.070
Did you watch So You Think You Can Dance last night?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.080
It was fantastic! You should’ve seen it!

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:43.800
Do you have a favorite show?

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:49.800
Do you watch it?

00:03:54.148 --> 00:03:56.250
I like American Idol. I’m a huge fan.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.220
My favorite show is about to start.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.640
It’s my favorite sitcom too.

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.370
It’s Once Upon A Time season finale day!
