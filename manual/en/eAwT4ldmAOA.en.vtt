00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:38.122
We're making crisps enough for two people today.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:40.045
Let's go over the ingredients for the potato crisps!

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:46.388
Two potatoes, peeled and sliced large

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:49.459
Next, 1 large bowl channa powder/ besan (chickpeas ground to flour)  

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250
A bowl of Coriander 

00:00:51.992 --> 00:00:53.467
1 large onion, chopped  

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:54.787
Salt, to taste

00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:59.935
Dry kasoori methi, 1-2 tsp

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.924
Ginger, garlic, green chilli coarsely ground in the mixer. 1 tsp red chilli powder &amp; 3/4 tsp hing (asafoetida). Finally, oil enough to fry

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:16.655
Let's start making potato crisps. The first thing we do is to heat the oil. Let's put the wok on flame. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.895
As the oil heats, let's prepare the batter with the chickpea flour (besan)

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.950
Take as much chickpea flour (besan) as you need (Archana has used about half a bowl full)

00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:54.590
We're adding about 1/2 tsp red chilli powder, 3/4 tsp hing (asafoetida), salt and coriander to taste. 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:15.290
Now we'll mix all the ingredients well. Slowly add water to the mix to make the batter. 

00:02:15.294 --> 00:02:26.400
The consistency of the batter needs to be just right- not too thick, nor too liquid! Add water gently to control the consistency. 

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:28.400
So, I'm adding some more water and being careful to leave no lumps in the batter. It should turn to this smooth paste.

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:44.120
The batter is ready now. Let's dip the potatoes 
 in it and get to frying! 

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:52.100
Remember, when you chop the potatoes, let them soak in water. Left outside, potatoes turn black! 

00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:13.180
Gently splash the oil over each potato crisp so they fry properly.

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:33.050
Our Potato crisps are now ready! But there is more! 
 You remember all the extra ingredients we have? 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:44.820
We have fenugreek (methi), ginger-garlic paste and onions. Now we take the left over batter &amp; there is always some in the bowl...  

00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:50.680
So, instead of throwing the batter or making thin chapathi-like things with them or making plain crisps, today let's innovate!

00:03:52.291 --> 00:04:01.240
 Kids don't usually like to eat fenugreek (methi). If we add fenugreek (methi) to the batter and make small crisps, it'll be perfect! Let's add the other ingredients.

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:21.370
We're now adding onions to the batter, about 2 tsp methi and one tsp ginger-garlic-green chilli paste, coarsely ground in the mixer.

00:04:21.842 --> 00:04:27.310
Now add a pinch of salt to the mix, specifically for the onions

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:39.550
Next, a spoonful red chilli powder and lots of coriander. 

00:04:42.354 --> 00:04:47.310
Now we mix everything well.

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:57.780
Do pay attention to the way the batter looks now. We've used the chickpea batter &amp; mixed everything in. It's not very thick, a paste loose enough for us to make small balls. 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.230
Now, we'll start to deep fry the balls. 

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:26.900
There you have another set of very innovative crisps. 

00:05:29.388 --> 00:05:41.520
Pipping hot, spicy, crispy potato pakoras and bite sized methi balls! Kids won't know they are eating methi! Let's call them 'magic balls'! You now have a fantastic, healthy treat up your sleeve!
