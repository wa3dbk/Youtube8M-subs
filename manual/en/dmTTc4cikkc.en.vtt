00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.200
Hello everyone!

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.633
If you watched our previous episode,

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.700
you probably already know how to load your gun and who to shoot at.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.600
However, we want you to strive for even greater skills.

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:23.933
So, we decided to make a series of videos telling you

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:25.467
about gameplay in more detail.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:29.000
Today’s topic is armour penetration.

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.800
So, you see an enemy vehicle in your gunsight.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.567
You need to decide where to shoot.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:37.400
To do so, you need to consider the type

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.067
and armour penetration of your shell,

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:42.267
as well as the thickness and angle of the enemy vehicle’s armour.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.433
You don’t need to memorise these parameters for every vehicle model;

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.533
the dynamic system of highlighting the spots

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.100
that are hard to penetrate will help you in the battle.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.000
It’s quite simple.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.600
If armour is highlighted in red,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.167
you won’t be able to penetrate it,

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:57.000
even if you aim at small vulnerable details.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.400
Most vehicles are better protected at the front.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.667
The turret is usually armoured better than the hull,

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:05.333
so you need to get to the enemy vehicle's side or rear.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.033
It’s easier to hit a moving target using Auto Aim,

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.033
which sticks to the spot you’ve aimed at.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.067
If you prefer to adjust your aim manually,

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:16.467
you can just turn off Auto Aim in the Settings menu.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.500
There are four types of shells: Armor-Piercing,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.033
High-Explosive Anti-Tank,

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.633
Armor-Piercing Composite Rigid, and High Explosive.

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.800
Armor-piercing shells usually have average

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.833
armour penetration and damage values.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.167
High-Explosive Anti-Tank

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:32.433
and Armor-Piercing Composite Rigid shells

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.867
cause the same amount of damage

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:35.467
but they penetrate armour much better.

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:37.667
High-Explosive shells cause the highest damage,

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:39.267
but their armour penetration is low,

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:41.267
so they often explode outside the vehicle,

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.600
causing only a fraction of their potential damage.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.033
Let's have a closer look at a shot.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.300
When a shell hits an enemy vehicle, calculations begin.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.333
If the armour penetration value is higher

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.400
than the thickness of armour a shell needs to go

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.600
through at a certain angle,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.033
then penetration occurs, a vehicle receives damage,

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.033
and the shell flies inside the hull,

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.233
where it can also damage vehicle modules.

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:08.467
If the armour is too thick, there will be no penetration.

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:10.767
Armor-Piercing, High-Explosive Anti-Tank,

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:14.333
and Armor-Piercing Composite Rigid shells just disappear in this case.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.667
High-Explosive shells explode on the armour

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:19.733
and still have a chance to cause damage to the vehicle and its modules,

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:21.300
though the damage will be lower.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.267
Sometimes, a shell can hit the armour at a very flat angle.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.967
In this case, it will ricochet

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:28.033
and may hit another part of the same vehicle

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:31.700
and armour penetration will be calculated once again in the ordinary way.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.167
After the second ricochet, a shell disappears.

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.433
A shell can’t ricochet and hit another vehicle,

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.133
nor can a shell go through the several vehicles at once.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:41.867
High-Explosive shells don’t ricochet at all.

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:43.133
This is all for now.

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:44.733
We will tell you about other interesting

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.267
and important gameplay features in future episodes.
