00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:25.319
Clean the chicken by rubbing it with salt 
 and a lemon cut in half. 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:41.450
Then rinse the chicken well with water.

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:56.960
 Pad the chicken with paper towel until dry. 

00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:04.830
Truss the chicken with a thread to make sure 
 it's compact so that it cooks evenly. 

00:02:48.237 --> 00:03:10.750
In a bowl mix the spices (ground ginger, turmeric, pepper, salt, pinch of 
 saffron), the lemon juice, olive oil, crushed garlic, and cilantro. 

00:03:12.243 --> 00:03:16.430
Mix until well combined. 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.780
This is called a "yellow charmoula" because of it's color.

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:33.070
In Morocco, we have "red charmoula" used usually for 
 fish and "yellow charmoula" used for poultry. 

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:48.180
Stuff the chicken with a small bouquet of cilantro and lemon 
 halves (the lemon you used to get the fresh juice).

00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:59.780
Gently rub the chicken with the marinade. 

00:04:14.192 --> 00:04:20.030
Place the chicken in a bowl, cover, then let the chicken marinade in 
 the fridge for at least 2 hours (overnight if possible!). 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.620
I am using a couscous pot to steam the chicken but if 
 you dont have one, just use your regular steamer. 

00:04:37.482 --> 00:04:45.100
In the bottom part of the couscous pot we are adding 
 hot water, this way we minimize the boiling time. 

00:04:47.898 --> 00:04:51.720
Also, add a lemon cut in half, 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.580
1) to avoid that the couscous pot turns brown because 
 we are boiling water in it without actual ingredients,

00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:05.480
 2) the lemons add flavor to the chicken. 

00:05:07.732 --> 00:05:13.790
Turn the heat to high and place the 
 top part of the couscous pot. 

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:17.720
Let it sit for a few minutes while the water is boiling.

00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:28.330
Once the steam starts coming out from the upper part of the couscous 
 pot, it's time to place the chicken in there (breast down). 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.350
Cover the pot and let the chicken cook for 
 around 30 minutes on medium-high heat. 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.990
After 30 minutes, flip the chicken to the other side, 

00:05:44.987 --> 00:05:50.680
cover, and continue steaming it for another 15 minutes. 

00:05:54.394 --> 00:05:58.900
Place the chicken in a baking pan (breast up) and brush it with 
 a little bit of dijon mustard mixed with olive oil. 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.410
Broil the top of the chicken in the oven for a 
 few minutes until it becomes deep golden brown. 

00:06:14.405 --> 00:06:22.030
Serve the chicken immediately on a bed or rice, lettuce, vegetables, or 
 vermicelli (check my video on how to make it).
