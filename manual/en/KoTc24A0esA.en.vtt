00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.990
So thanks to Comic Con we've finally gotten
our second look at the upcoming Batman v Superman.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.370
And of course I wanted to get my thoughts
out on this trailer.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.139
And also, in case you can't tell from my voice,
I'm pretty happy right now.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.180
Because this trailer, frankly, is amazing.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.449
I haven't watched any other trailer reaction
videos, so I don't know what other people

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.490
think of this, but for me personally, I'm
just gonna say, I love it.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:32.560
Alright, let's break it down.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.819
*clip* So in the beginning, you get the same
gist that you got in the first trailer, Superman

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.540
is being held accountable for what he did
in Man of Steel.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.540
AKA wipe out Metropolis.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.949
But then we see a really cool twist on it.

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.339
We see Bruce Wayne there in the crowd while
Superman is wrecking the city.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.100
And he clearly is not very happy about it.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.199
Then as far as the plot goes, we don't get
much new.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.280
We pretty much just see that Superman is considered
a threat and he and Batman fight.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.609
So now just for what I liked.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:56.949
Firstly, just some small things.

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.409
Jeremy Irons looks great as Alfred.

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.460
I know it's a weird thing to say, but just
to see him on screen, he might not look like

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.429
the Alfred that I'm used to, but I think he'll
kill it.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.890
And Lex Luthor doesn't look as bad as I thought
he would.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.800
Because when I saw this picture, I was mad.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.060
Because this, to put it bluntly, just looks
stupid to me.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.340
After we saw that pretty awesome bald picture,
why does he have this weird wig?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.759
But seeing it in action, it wasn't as bad
as I thought it'd be.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.620
There are also hints at the Joker, which is
awesome.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.009
We're also gonna get another Bruce Wayne origin
story, but I guess that's a given with this

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.009
kind of movie.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.030
There's Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, she looked
pretty cool for the two seconds we saw her,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.859
we get to see Kryptonite, which ehhhh I'm
kinda tired of Kryptonite, but hopefully this

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.079
movie will put a different twist on it.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.659
We get to see a bit more of the battle, which
was awesome.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.009
Then the last shot comes, and of course it's
super cool.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.829
Superman opens up the Batmobile and Batman
just stands up to him.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.400
That is a Batman hell yeah moment if I've
ever seen one.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.430
Last thing I just wanna say (and this is something
I also liked a lot about Age of Ultron), a

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.200
lot of the shots in this trailer look like
they're straight out of a comic book.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.390
Like this one or this one.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.110
It's just, as someone who reads comics, that
was just cool to me.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.450
So those are my thoughts on the new Batman
v Superman trailer.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.940
Obviously, as you can tell, I'm a lot more
excited for this movie now.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.940
What did you think of it?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.049
