00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.500
My name's Gareth, I run a company called Woodmatters,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.300
and we're based down in the South Lakes, 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.300
and what we try to do is work in woodlands,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.800
alongside people, so that they can get involved in their local woodlands.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.660
So we're out in the woods, all winter, and we're doing mainly coppicing,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.800
so we're bringing back redundant coppice woodlands into cycle,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.230
so that brings loads of biodiversity benefits,
landscape benefits,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.600
and it supplies firewood, and charcoal.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.130
We also get people involved through running courses, green wood courses,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.300
so, there are things like spoon carving, bowl carving,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.400
bench making, shrink pot making, charcoal making,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.980
and we do work with schools, do work with groups,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.400
out in the woods, kind of more about the
actual woodland environment.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.000
If you've made something which is beautiful,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.290
and well-formed, and you've got the lines right,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.000
it could be really elegant, but strong,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and this idea of function and form is really
interesting.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.850
When you get those two things balanced,
in something that you've made out of wood,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.000
it's just, it's brilliant.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.299
It feels to me vital, that we do whatever we can, really,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.000
to connect people back into the natural world,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
because then, if they feel that connection,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.300
and they kind of know, in their heart, and their head,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.900
that, you know, we're a part of it, and it's a part of us,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.400
in every sense, then the choices they make in their day-to-day lives,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.000
will just be better choices for the planet.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.800
Finished.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.000
Finished, yum yum.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.920
Can I have some more?
