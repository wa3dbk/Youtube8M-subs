Hello everyone and welcome to another video
in our HOW MCW series. My name is Matt Bauer

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.559
and this week I’ll be showing you a few
Windows keyboard shortcuts. You can use keyboard

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.050
shortcuts to do a lot of things quickly in
Windows, such as copying and pasting, minimizing

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.820
all windows at once, and even getting help
immediately. There are lots of keyboard shortcuts,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.890
but here are the most popular:

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.570
Ctrl+A – Using this keyboard shortcut will
allow you to Select All of the content in

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.210
the current window, such as all text on a
page or all files in a folder.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.489
Ctrl+C – You can use Ctrl+C to COPY files,
folders, and most commonly, text to the computer’s

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.940
clipboard, or temporary storage location.
After using this command, you can then PASTE

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:07.979
the files, folders, or text to another location
with the next keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+V.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.490
Ctrl+D – Using this shortcut is a quick
way to add a bookmark or favorite website

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.220
in Firefox or Internet Explorer.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.049
Windows+M – This keyboard shortcut can be
used to minimize all windows you may have

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:42.080
on your screen. This is helpful if you have
a lot of windows open and you need to access

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.020
an item on your desktop.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.940
Ctrl+Z – This shortcut is used to UNDO the
last action performed on your computer. It’s

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.930
commonly used in word processing programs,
such as Microsoft Word, to “undo” recent

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:09.429
typing or font changes. There are usually
several levels of undo, which can vary with

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:20.060
any given program. You can also REDO the last
action by pressing Ctrl+Y.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.389
There are many more keyboard shortcuts, and
I may cover them in a future video. If you

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:33.379
