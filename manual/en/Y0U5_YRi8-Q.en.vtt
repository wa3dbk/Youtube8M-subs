00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.520
Jhall Moodi is a very popular dish in Bihar &amp; Bengal

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.309
It is actually a famous street food as in every street is gets served

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.460
Jhaal means spiciness

00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:25.777
And Moodi Means Puffed Rice that's called Moodi

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.910
So will made the spiciness preparation of the puffed rice where we will use green chillies

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.017
and one different ingredient we will use that is mustard seed oil

00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:38.586
Rai ka Tel or Sarson Ka Tel which is called

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.940

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.967
so, let us start preparing jhaal moodi

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:49.777
I have taken the Moodi and as soon as i will be taking the other ingredients will let you know

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.660
so, first of all we have to take puffed rice in a bowl

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:07.560
and after this first of all add jhaal that means spiciness and spiciness means Green Chillies

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.920
give it a mix

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.440
after that add roasted grams

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.980
after adding roasted grams, mix it again

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.100
and then add boiled potatoes

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:39.705
although some of people like to add potatoes and some not. But you do it your way

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.160
Now add some salt to taste

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.960
give it a mix

00:01:56.554 --> 00:01:58.234
the add red chilli powder

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.400

00:02:12.503 --> 00:02:14.103
add some black salt also

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:28.184
and then add some Chaat Masala

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.720
and mix it also

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.180
and now we will add fried gram daal which is easily available in the market, add some of it

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.460
and then give it a mix

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:02.793
now add some onions

00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.231
raw onions taste good in this dish

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:17.395
some chopped coriander leaves

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.000
now add some Nylon Sev to the dish

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:45.957
and now its most important ingredient of Jhaal Moodi that is Mustard Seed Oil.. so put it in

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.180
nicely

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.760
add almost 2-3 spoon of it

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.460
because it has the main flavor only and now we have to mix it

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.440
Oil should coat all the moodi

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.340
after this you may add... Puries 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.180
now take this out in a plate

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.860
after taking out in a plate just sprinkle some chopped coriander leaves

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.260
and then add some onions

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.540
apart form this crush the puri and put it from over the top

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:30.320
along with some Fried Bengal Gram and some Nylon Sev

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.340
So, your Jhaal Moodi is ready to eat
