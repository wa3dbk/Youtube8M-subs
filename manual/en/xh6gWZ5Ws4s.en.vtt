00:00:01.052 --> 00:00:04.135
(instrumental music)

00:00:05.154 --> 00:00:07.608
- We horned frogs live out
the TCU mission statement

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:08.566
every day.

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.043
From classes and
extracurricular opportunities,

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:13.258
to study abroad and volunteer experiences.

00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:15.669
- TCU offers students the
experience of a lifetime.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.063
Students are given the
opportunity to discover themselves

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:20.404
and to discover the world
in a matter of four years.

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:22.743
- At TCU, we believe
in and are committed to

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:24.825
the personal success of every individual.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.166
We believe that every
student has the opportunity

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.444
to experience a world-class
learning environment

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:32.054
where their values and strengths
are not only tolerated,

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:33.415
but also embraced.

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:36.319
- TCU students have an opportunity
to learn to think and act

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.565
as ethical leaders and
responsible citizens

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:39.790
in the global community.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.262
- TCU faculty and peers push
you daily to be your best

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:45.733
and to dream and accomplish
things that you never thought

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.900
you could do.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.502
- College is not just about academics.

00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:50.728
There are clubs and organizations
for every degree program

00:00:50.728 --> 00:00:51.941
and for your social life.

00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:53.978
- During my time with student government,

00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:55.835
I've worked to create
a leadership conference

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:57.390
within our athletic conference

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.370
and I worked with the TCU administration

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.543
to bring 24 hour access to our library.

00:01:01.543 --> 00:01:03.575
- I'm involved in Alpha Epsilon Delta,

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:05.806
a pre-health organization,
and through them,

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:07.537
I receive free organic chemistry tutoring,

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:09.638
as well as the opportunity to volunteer

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:11.351
at Cook's Children's Hospital.

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:13.507
- It's all over the world
where students just like me

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:16.397
have had the unique
experience in studying abroad

00:01:16.397 --> 00:01:18.312
and learning in the global community.

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:19.869
- Faculty at TCU are about more than

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.676
expanding your knowledge in the classroom.

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:23.851
So whether you want to meet
them for a cup of coffee

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.920
at the bookstore or a game
of racquetball at the rec,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.537
faculty are here to meet your needs.

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:29.836
- There's no other place
that combines the intimate

00:01:29.836 --> 00:01:32.901
classroom setting, the big
university social experience,

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:34.865
top-rated academic achievement,

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:36.511
and a warm family environment.

00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:38.582
- TCU offers more than an education.

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:40.757
It offers a life-changing experience,

00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:43.075
opportunities to expand
your mind and character,

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:45.550
and develop you into one
of tomorrow's leaders.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.598
- The values you develop here, as well as

00:01:47.598 --> 00:01:51.006
your academic experiences,
will enable you to go out

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.096
into the world and to meet any challenge.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:54.682
- That's what TCU is all about.

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:56.923
Together we're becoming ethical leaders

00:01:56.923 --> 00:01:59.389
and responsible citizens
in the global community.

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:02.022
I hope that you will come
see our horned frog family

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:02.931
firsthand.

00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.098
