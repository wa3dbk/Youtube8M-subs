Hi, I'm Trent Bosch. We're here in Fort Collins, Colorado

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.790
in my personal studio and today I want to
share with you

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.500
all the techniques I use in making my decorative utility bowls

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.930
we're gonna go through numerous
techniques - first off we're gonna go out

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.320
the wood lot - I'm gonna show you how I select wood

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.920
how I chainsaw it up into blocks
and we're gonna bring it inside the shop here

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.079
we're gonna bandsaw it, then we're going to mount it on the lathe and rough-turn a bowl

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.749
I rough-turn the bowls, then I dry them - I dry them

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:56.159
using numerous methods - we're going to
talk about each one of those methods

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.409
then we're gonna finish-turn a dry bowl

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.929
and then the funnest part - is we're going to start to

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.100
look at all kinds of different carving, texturing

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.010
decorative ideas for those bowls
that are gonna make those bowls stand out

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.860
and be much different then just a standard, plain

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.280
utility bowl -so we're gonna be making a really interesting, decorative utility bowl today

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.840
...here we are at the wood pile

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.540
I picked out this elm piece that we're gonna cut up

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.380
and turn into a number of bowl blanks
it's been out here for about six months or so

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.580
so you can see by the end it's a little cracked and a little checked

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.560
but we're going to be able to get rid of that if we cut off about six or so inches, I try and get my wood

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.640
in fairly long lengths from the tree
surgeons that get me my wood

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450
that way if I don't get to it right away it will

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.990
still have plenty of wood left, if
we were to have a piece that was maybe

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.440
cut up into a firewood length

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.180
that cracked in on both sides I'd have to cut
off both sides and we'd end up with a short

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.220
little piece that wouldn't make much

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.000
...something else worth mentioning

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.720
is that this handle - I'm tucking it into my body, holding it tight into my hip

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.500
so that I use my body as support for the tool

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.180
If I was to act a little bit scared of the lathe

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.130
and try and stand back from it I wouldn't have any support with this hand like this

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.770
so it's very important to tuck that tool into your body and move your body with the cut

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.300
that allows you have the greatest,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.180
the least amount of stress on your body as possible
