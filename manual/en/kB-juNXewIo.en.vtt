00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.670
Hello and welcome to this introductory video
on some of the more specialist strip supplied

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.490
by LED supplies.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.670
In this video we will introduce side emitting
LED strip, Colour Temperature Adjustable LED

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.680
strip and RGBW LED strip
First lets look at some of our side emitting

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.180
LED strip.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.240
We are using the blue version in this video,
which is part number 1MFL-SIDE-B2.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.320
The strip can be cut and connected in exactly
the same way as we showed you in our video

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.260
on cutting, connecting and powering strip,
and the brightness can be adjusted as demonstrated

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.000
in our video on dimming and controlling strip.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.370
Here you can see the side emitting LED strip
being controlled using our smartphone &amp; tablet

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.950
controller, part number RGB-WIFI-2
The difference with this side emitting strip,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.809
is as the name suggests.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.870
The light is emitted from the side of the
LED chip instead of straight out.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.929
This means that when the strip is stuck down
the light is projected out at 90 degrees,

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:10.569
very useful in certain applications.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:20.039
We stock side emitting LED strip in warm white,
cool white, red and blue colour output options

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.499
Next lets look at our colour temperature adjustable
LED strip.

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:29.920
This strip has a mixture of both cool white
and warm white LED chips mounted to the PCB,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.020
which enables you to change the warmth of
the light it gives off.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.599
Here we have connected some of our 5MFL-600SMD-HYBRID
tape to our smartphone and tablet controller.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:48.310
You can see as we move our finger around the
colour wheel the light the tape emits changes

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.509
using either all the warm white LEDs, all
the cool white LEDs or a mixture of both.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.409
The brightness can be adjusted, and the strip
can be turned on and off also using this little

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:08.509
device
Lets move on and look at RGBW LED strip.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.670
This strip is much the same as RGB strip,
but it has a dedicated white LED chip added.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.610
One of the drawbacks of standard RGB tape
is it does not provide a very good quality

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.110
white light.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.001
RGB provides white light by powering the Red,
Blue and Breen LEDs all at once, but the White

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:32.890
given off is usually tinted slightly blue
or slightly pink.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.700
By adding the white LED chip, RGBW strip overcomes
this problem providing a pure white light

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.770
output of much better quality.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.260
RGBW LED strip also offers a much wider colour
palette than standard RGB LED strip.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.070
The White LED chip on our RGBW strip can be
either warm white or cool white.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:05.070
The RGBW strip we demonstrate here is our
5MFL-300SMD-RGBW type using a cool white chip

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.570
in addition to the RGB.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.000
We control it using our WIFI-104 controller
suitable for use with your iPhone or Android

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.260
smartphone.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.580
That concludes this introductory video on
more specialist LED strip we offer.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.980
We hope you have found it useful.
