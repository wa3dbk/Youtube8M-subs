00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.570
 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.660
 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.230
Hi my name's Russell and I'm the owner of
Riverside Garden Centre, we stock the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.369
biggest range of Weber

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.029
barbecues and tools. Weber have now
brought out their new range of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.180
Weber Q barbecues they're very similar to last year, just more stylish unlike me which is

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.949
getting older.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.760
They've brought out the Weber Q1400 bbq which
is the electric, and it is the only electric

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
that which they do which is perfect for those
balconies in London,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.879
because most flats in London are
restricted on

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.379
gas they're not allowed to have gas on the
balconies only electric so this is

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.839
where we sell a lot of these.

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.870
Then we've got the Weber Q1000 bbq

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.199
again nice little compact barbecue

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.739
and has a small gas cylinder again

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.750
a little extra for these, you can buy
add-on shelf units

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.159
for both of these barbecues if you
require. Going onto

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.380
the Weber Q1200 bbq which

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.350
is very similar to the Weber Q1000 has the
shelves

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.009
built in and still the little gas bottle.
Then we go onto

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.119
the Weber Q2200 bbq which, is probably thirty
percent bigger

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.670
again very nice barbecue bigger shelves,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.789
new style of thermometer,

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.899
very stylish new hangin facility there
for the tools

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.780
as we've got here, then also with a
permanent cart.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.320
Then we go onto the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.840
Weber Q3200 bbq which

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.140
is again, a much bigger barbecue as a
standard fitting

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.289
it comes with the warming rack, the light unit

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.700
and has the central burner as well as the
ring burner,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.299
again in a permanent cart, electronic
ignition

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.569
absolutely ideal for a family barbecue, a
very popular barbecue.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.819
So I'd like to show you some of the key
features on the range of the Weber Q's,

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.480
and one of them is the trip tray, which is absolutely brilliant

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.180
simply slides underneath all the fat and all your debris drops into there

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.650
and when you're finished with it, throw it away. The other thing that we've been asking Weber for

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.349
some years is a warming rack for the
range of the Weber Q2200

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.980
and finally they've got it and it's here
so it's an extra,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.700
but it's well worth buying. Going on to the
cast iron cooking grate

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.170
which is absolutely superb, it is covered
through the whole range

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.170
of the Weber Q barbecues even the electric
absolutely fantastic.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.250
So we got the Weber Q1200 and the Weber Q2200

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.000
and the Weber Q3200 cooking plates, and you can see

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.000
there's about 30 percent difference in
sizing.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600
One of the key features between these
two barbecues is that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.099
the Weber Q1200 has the higher lid, so it's
perfect if you want to do roasting.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.030
This little trivet here which will be absolutely perfect, sit your roast there

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.500
job done. Now the other key feature on
this barbecue

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.560
is the little gas bottles which is

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.950
great, absolutely great if you want to
take this barbecue to the beach

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.439
or picnicking it is absolutely perfect. If
you're in the

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.540
situation and you want to use in the
garden

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.310
then you can buy the conversion kit,
which will allow you to put that onto

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.510
the largest bottle and that makes it
more efficient for you

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.599
and much more economical. Don't forget

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.790
