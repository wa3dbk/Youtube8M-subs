Hello! Welcome to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Many people have made a request. I've
received comments from many of you that...

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.500
... you wish to learn to make Mix masala,
garam masala. This is because....

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
... these are commonly used in all my
recipes.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.500
People who reside outside India don't have
access to dry powdered masalas.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They get only the whole spices locally there.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.200
For example, cinnamon, cloves etc. are
easily available.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.700
I will show how to gather the ingredients
with you at home to make masala out of it.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900
Today I will teach you to make Garam masala.
Stay tuned to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's see the ingredients needed for
Garam masala.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.500
20 grams of cinnamon.
3 grams of green cardamom with skin.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
10 grams of cloves.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.300
We first got to roast the ingredients
together.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
Now what is the purpose of making this
masala?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.600
When we cook chicken or mutton, for the
tempering we always use ...

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.100
... cinnamon, cloves and black pepper.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
At times, we get it in our morsel and when we
bite it we don't like it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If we have a powdered masala and we add
half a teaspoon then...

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.500
... then the chicken or mutton get all the
aroma and flavour of these spices.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Then all relish the recipe.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Let's start making the masala.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We first got to roast these ingredients.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
20 grams cinnamon.
10 grams cloves.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
3 grams green cardamom which means
10 to 12 of them.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.100
We got to roast till the colour of the
skin of green cardamom doesn't change.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
Once the colour of the skin of green 
cardamom changes, put off the flame.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
After the ingredients cool down we need
to grind them together in the mixer.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200
Let's grind all the ingredients together.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.100
The masala is ready. 
Transfer it into a bowl.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.500
The aroma is wonderful. While cooking
non-vegetarian recipes you need to ...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
... add just half or quarter teaspoon
to your recipe.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Your recipe will turn out to be
out of this world.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
