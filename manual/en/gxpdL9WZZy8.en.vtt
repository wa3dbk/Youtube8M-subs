00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.041
Hi. This is absolutely demented.

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:29.959
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and I'm so nervous and scared.

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:33.000
But I'm really excited about everything.

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:39.667
I'm just dreading
the 14 hours of flying tomorrow.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.000
It's going to be a very long day.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:46.750
But I think we'll be all right.
We can watch movies and stuff.

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:54.083
To put it short, I would say
that I'm feeling totally awesome, and...

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.333
I don't know.
I have great expectations.

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:04.458
I really don't know what to expect.

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:10.041
But I think it will be great, as long as
I can keep a positive attitude.

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:14.750
We're going to the airport.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:19.834
The time is probably
5:30 or something in the morning.

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:23.417
And I'm really excited.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.375
Thinking of how I'll pass the time
on the plane. But I'm feeling good.

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:37.834
7 AM
Helsinki international airport

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:06.458
Jere, you outlaw! You're not supposed
to have your phone on.

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:11.583
We just arrived at LAX airport.
Or we're outside already.

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:15.250
We're getting our car
and going to the city!

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:31.542
So, how are you feeling, Johannes?

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:34.083
Hi...

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:39.625
The GPS can say how she's feeling.

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:44.041
All right. Nice to see you.
I've been here a couple of days.

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:47.959
We're heading to Manhattan Beach -

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:52.917
to sniff around...
Sara's new neighborhood.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.959
"Sniff around Sara's you-know-what."

00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:01.417
It's her new potential neighborhood.
Then we'll grab a bite to eat.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.667
Right, and...
- I totally took the wrong turn here.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.125
And how are you feeling?
- Great. I'm amazingly sleepy.

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:16.667
I didn't really sleep on the plane,
but otherwise I'm feeling...

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.250
We're in LA!

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:25.000
This is so great.
I've got mixed feelings.

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:29.166
But mainly it's great.
I'm excited.

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:38.792
Okay.
I have a 30-hour day behind me.

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:42.792
I began the day at 4 AM
at home in Porvoo.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.500
And here I am...
In Hollywood.

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:53.834
We've spent the whole day flying.

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:58.750
We arrived here
at 4 PM Los Angeles time -

00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:06.542
and we've just settled into a house
next door to somebody from NCIS.

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:10.333
We're going to spend
the first weekend here.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:16.291
I'm feeling really drowsy and
I'm looking forward to hitting the hay.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:20.875
That's going to hit the spot,
as you can imagine.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.291
It's really important that I could
go on this trip without hesitation.

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:32.291
Everybody back home in Finland
is supporting me in this.

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:38.917
My mom and dad told me to go ahead,
if this is my thing.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.959
That really helped me to
start this trip with positive feelings.

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.417
Also my boyfriend told me -

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.291
that he doesn't want to stand in my way,
whatever I decide.

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:59.291
I really respect that decision.

00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:06.250
It feels really good to be doing this,
knowing my loved ones are supporting me.
