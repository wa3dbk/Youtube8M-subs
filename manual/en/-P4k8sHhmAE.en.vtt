00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.270
[Narrator]
As on most weekends, Ryan Spencer is packing

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.130
for a trip....

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.120
((door opens))

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.100
[Narrator]
...You might say he's an outdoor evangelist.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.360
[Ryan Spencer]
We do about thirty-six weekends a year and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.150
we go all over the state.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.080
((door closes))

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.160
[Ryan]
I go from park to park and show people how

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.589
to go camping for the first time.

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:19.460
((truck passing))

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.060
[Ryan]
I'm an Outdoor Education Specialist at Texas

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.789
Parks and Wildlife, and I specialize in getting
people outside and connecting them with nature.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.869
[Narrator]
Today Ryan is at Blanco State Park, introducing

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.570
some families to camping on behalf of the
Texas Outdoor Family program.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.430
[Ryan to group]
Studies have shown that children who spend

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.250
time outside are healthier, happier, and stronger...

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.890
((air pump))

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.500
[Karenia to others]
We've got the strongest man on the job.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.019
[Ryan to group]
... they have better family cohesion

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.099
((laughs))

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.100
[Karenia Holloway]
This actually gives you a time to come together

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.940
and just talk to one another and just experience
life together. And so that's something that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.539
we don't always get the opportunity to do.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.070
[Byron to son]
This one goes north?

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.030
[Narrator]
Campers get the chance to try out activities,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.460
and find new ways to enjoy the outdoors together.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.750
[Lindsay]
So you're close. It says what?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630
[Calvin]
Four feet. Oh!

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.740
[Isaiah]
You found it!

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.000
((water flowing))

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.500
[Narrator]
Families can choose to dive in...

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.619
((people in water))

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.000
[Narrator]
...or just get their feet wet.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.240
((paddling sounds))

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.060
[Byron Folgar]
Never done kayaking before, this was the first

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.360
time, so I was a little bit hesitant, I didn't
know if he was going to like it or not, and

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.210
he enjoyed it.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.040
[to Calvin]
Yeah, Calvin. That's good!

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.780
[Isaiah]
Going up the river, down the river, yeah,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.920
pretty cool.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.860
[Calvin]
What time is it?

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.200
[Narrator]
A weekend is only a taste...

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.299
[Calvin]
Oh darn.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.049
[Narrator]
...but one taste can inspire future family outings.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.649
[Matt Brimberry]
They show you how to camp. We're highly satisfied

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.110
with what the Texas Outdoor Family did for
our family.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.740
[Ryan]
We make it easy for folks to come out and

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.860
try it for the first time. We try to take
the scariness away from camping.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.090
[Ryan to group]
And just drop it in. Thank you very much.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.430
[Jerry Karacz]
It's nice to do something different and have

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.850
some nice time out with the family and friends.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.130
[Ryan]
Alright. Got everybody?

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.399

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.599
[Group]
Outdoor family!

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.380
[Lindsay]
That looks good!
