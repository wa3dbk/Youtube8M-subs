00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
 

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.195
Welcome to Wildcat country.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:06.422
It's a great day to
be a Wildcat.

00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:10.850
Every day's a great day
to be a Wildcat!

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.180
Nancy Kinner's absolutely
great.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.510
She gets these freshmen going.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.430
She gives us that charge of
energy that we really need to

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.680
kick off the event.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.380
 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.805
The Cat Pack is basically
the overarching spirit

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:24.566
squad here at UNH.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.532
UNH!

00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:26.498
UNH!

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:28.430
UNH!

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.642
Today we're teaching this new
class of Wildcats some chants

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.452
that we normally do at
hockey games, and any

00:00:33.452 --> 00:00:34.606
other sporting event.

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:37.076
Go blue, go white!

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:39.546
Go blue, go white!

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:42.016
Go blue, go white!

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:44.490
Go blue, go white!

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.900
And we're also going to do
my personal favorite.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.420
It's called I believe in UNH.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.380
Which really exemplifies the
sense of camaraderie and

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.070
family that you have
here at UNH.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.376
It brings everyone together,
just makes them feel included.

00:00:57.376 --> 00:00:58.864
I!

00:00:58.864 --> 00:00:59.856
I!

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:00.848
I believe!

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:02.336
I believe!

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:03.328
I believe in U!

00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:05.808
I believe in U!

00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:07.792
I believe in UNH!

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:09.280
I believe in UNH!

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.264
I believe in UNH!

00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:13.248
I believe in UNH!

00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:15.240
I believe in UNH!

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.030
When you're in that crowd, and
that crowd's cheering, that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.290
moment, that's what
I live for.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070
You get that sense of-- it's
that positive, exuberant

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.800
energy that's coming
out of you, coming

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.820
out of everyone there.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.720
You're taking part in something
that's just bigger

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.520
than your everyday
experiences, and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.430
you can feel that.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.200
And that's, like, it just
keeps you going.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.000
I believe in UNH!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.800
I believe in UNH!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.070
You feel it in your heart,
really, and it's a sense of

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.120
belonging that you really
can't get anywhere else.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.449
Three quick claps
at the whistle!

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:51.270
[WHISTLING AND CLAPPING]

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.360
Unbelievable.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.605
Best group ever.

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:56.230
Coach Mac, classic
football coach.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.362
The reason UNH is so great is
because of what's happening in

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:02.695
this room right today.

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:06.332
The people that you're with,
people that are sitting in

00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:10.949
this room are the people that
maybe four, five years from

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.600
now start being your
business partners.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.050
Seven, eight years from
now could be at

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.520
your wedding party.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.175
10 or 12 years from now could
be the person you need the

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.870
most at the time you
need them the most.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.750
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.650
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.040
And I just feed off of the
energy, and I just love people

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.262
being passionate about our
school together, and just

00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:42.498
having it be one
big community.

00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:44.830
Because if we're all loving our
school, then we can all

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.150
just relate to each other
so much better.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.480
It's definitely an experience,
that's for sure.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.700
It's UNH, that's what it is.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.190
Yeah.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.170
The chants were fun.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.660
Yeah, the chants.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.620
Football coach was cool.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.250
It was amazing.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.520
I loved it.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.790
It was so exciting.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.840
Definitely was.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.840
Excited to be a Wildcat.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.180
Yeah.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.960
Definitely getting motivated
for the year.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.370
Yeah.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.950
This right here, this is
tradition at its finest.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.630
We have our freshman
class coming down.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.950
They're learning one
of our greatest

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.420
traditions, pat the cat.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.440
Whatever you're going to do,
whether it's going to a big

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.760
hockey game and you want to will
the team to a victory,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.420
you've got a big test coming up
next week and you need that

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.230
little extra push
to get you by.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.630
Or if you're just having maybe
an off day, and you need a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.800
little kick to get
you started.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.836
You come over here, you pat this
cat, and that's exactly

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:25.569
what it's going to do.

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.230
It's going to push you through
to accomplish whatever you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.480
need to do.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.555
 

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:35.210
There's so many little pieces
of this university that can

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.570
come together at these events
and welcome these incoming

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.900
freshman classes, and show
them how special Wildcat

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.150
country is.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.762
