Hi, this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.050
On today's episode let's look at getting Goggle
Maps back onto your iPhone.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.240
Now a lot of fuss has been made about the
loss functionality of removing Goggle Maps

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.230
from the iPhone in iOS 6.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.470
Goggle Maps had things like street view that
just aren't available in the new Maps app.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.730
But you can easily get street view and other
features back by using the Goggle Maps website.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.820
There is a special mobile version that you
can automatically go to on your iPhone.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.530
You can even make this available as an icon
on you home screen.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.920
So on your iPhone you go into Safari and you
simply browse over to maps.goggle.com/.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.739
You will be taken to the mobile version of
the Goggle map site.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.359
It will also ask you to use you current location
just as you would in the old maps app.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.260
So this is what is called the web app.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.659
It's a webpage, being in Safari.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.420
But it works like an app because it really
understands the iPhone.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.589
The screen size.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.759
It has icons and things that are easy for
touch.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.940
You will see the map in the middle looks exactly
like the middle part of the maps app that

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.900
you were used to because it is exactly the
same.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.900
The same graphics.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.540
So you are actually getting the same maps
but the controls look a little different.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.729
So at the top here you have got several controls.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.630
This one here at the top allows you to zero
in to your current location.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.590
This one gives you directions so you tap on
that and you can go from my location to another

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.590
destination.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.450
You can choose multiple destinations.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.649
Right away you can see some features that
are not available in the maps app now that

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.100
were available in Goggle Maps.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.659
Which namely you can have public transportation,
walking, and biking directions.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:47.659
That can be very useful.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.530
You can plot the route and then you can decide
to say let's do biking directions and then

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.810
go and you can see it will give us the full
directions here and you can in addition to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.579
that go to map view and see the maps.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.830
Now the last button over here allows you to
go in and has various options including turning

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.500
on and off layers such as traffic so you can
get back that Goggle traffic if you liked

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.470
that better than one of the new maps app.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.070
Another thing that you can do that I like
is that you can sign in.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.350
So for instance you can go in and sign in
there and send it to your Goggle account and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.690
that way you can have all sorts of different
things saved like different places.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.280
If I go into directions here you can see that
I can sign in there and create my own maps

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.230
and star and save places and rate places using
my Goggle account.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.200
So that can come in handy and it's nice to
be able to create your own maps just as you

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.500
can on web pages on Mac or PC.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.540
Now the one inconvenient thing is that in
order to get to this you have to launch Safari

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.670
and then maybe use a bookmark for maps.goggle.com
and you go to the webpage.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.730
But you can actually put this as an icon on
your home screen.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.260
So the way to do that would be to tap the
share button at the bottom of the browser

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.510
there and you can share it to your home screen
like that.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.320
You can give it a name.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.920
Now you can see it appears there as this icon
right here.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.850
I can tap on it and you go right to maps.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.170
It almost seems like you are using a regular
app.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.350
You can in fact do that with any webpage that
you go to.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.730
So for instance you can go to MacMost.com
and share and add to home screen and you now

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.800
have a MacMost app.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.870
It just takes you to the MacMost website.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.970
Another big missing feature from the new Maps
app is street view.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.970
Street view is a Goggle thing.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.540
Goggle captured all these different images
from all over the place and has a street view

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540
function.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.140
The new Maps app has the fly over function
which is different and has some similar use.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.320
But if you want street view you can go into
Goggle maps here and then you can actually

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.980
zoom in and tap on any location you want.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.780
So I'm going to just tap here and then you
can see at the bottom I get various buttons

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.790
that tells me where I am.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.510
I've got that little person button right there
on the bottom right hand corner and I can

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:24.010
tap on that and I can jump into street view
and get that same street view, the same images

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.290
I was viewing before in the Maps app.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.090
This is something that Goggle just added this
last week.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.350
So that's how to get the prime functionality
and a little bit more back on your iPhone

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.810
by adding Goggle Maps web app as an icon on
your home screen and then you can use that

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.560
for what it is good for and use the new Apple
maps for what it is good for.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.530
For instance talk to Siri to give you turn
by turn spoken directions.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.930
I hope you found this useful.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:05:09.820
Until next time this is Gary with MacMost
Now.
