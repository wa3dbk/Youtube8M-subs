00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.580
Church: Let me get this straight.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.160
You gave this guy our flag?

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.260
Caboose: Is that bad?

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.720
Church: Bad? Oh no, that's not bad!

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.500
Next time he comes over, why don't you just help him blow up the whole goddamn base?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.300
Tucker: There! There he is!

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.900
Church: Where?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.200
Oh! Yeah! Oh, I got him!

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.820
He's sneakin' around back behind the cliffs.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.280
Tucker: He must be one smart son of a bitch.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.040
Donut: Aw, man, I am so freakin' lost.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.320
Where the hell is the base?

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780
Church: Oh, shit.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.540
Hey, Tucker, look at his armor.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.420
It's red.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.400
Tucker: Aw, man! That means it's their sergeant.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.400
Church: Well, that makes sense.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.180
At least now we know how he got by our defenses.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.980
Caboose: Uh, you know, he came in the back door where you guys were standing.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.800
Tucker: Yeah, okay, well, let's take him out, then.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.720
Church: Roger that.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.800
Okay.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.980
Say goodnight, Sarge.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.000
[four gunshots]

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.280
Donut: Son of a bitch!

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.820
Church: Aw, crap.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.820
What?

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.600
Tucker: You're really not very good with that thing, are you?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.380
Donut: Hey! It's me! Don't shoot!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.800
I'm the guy that bought the flag, remember?!

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.720
Tucker: Oh, great. Now he's taunting us.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.260
That's just embarrasing.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.660
Church: Alright, that's it! I've had it!

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.080
Rookie, you stay here!

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560
Me and Tucker, we'll head through the teleporter, we'll cut him off at the pass!

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.140
Caboose: Right!

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.500
Church: Tucker, you ready? Let's go!

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200
Tucker: There is no way I'm going through that thing.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.520
Church: Tucker, we don't have time for this!

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.160
Why would they give us a teleporter if it doesn't work?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.660
Tucker: I don't know! Why would they give us a tank that no one can drive?

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.700
Church: We already tested the teleporter, remember?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.400
Tucker: We threw rocks through it!

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.040
Church: Yeah, and? So what?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.580
The rocks came out the other side, didn't they?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.120
Tucker: Yeah, but they were all hot and covered with black stuff.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.500
Church: Oh, so I guess that's what all this is all about, then?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.460
You're afraid of a little black stuff?

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.960
Tucker: Yes! I am!

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.020
I am afraid of black stuff.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.360
Church: Tucker, I almost hate to do this to you.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.320
Tucker: You wouldn't.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.760
Church: You know, I look at it this way.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.740
Either A, we go through there and get the flag back, or, B, we stay here, and I get to kill you.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.600
Either way, I win.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.880
Tucker: For the record, I want you to know rocks aren't people.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.720
Church: Duly noted.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.760
Now get in there.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.180
TUCKER: Crap. Alright.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.800
One!

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.380
Two!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.800
[whoooooooom]

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.700
Caboose: Huh.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.360
He didn't come out the other side.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.980
Church: Yeeeeah...

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.340
I've, uh... I've decided I'm not going to use the teleporter.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.540
Okay, rookie, you stay here! I'll be back with the flag!

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.640
Simmons: I still have no idea what you're talking about.
I didn't hear any shots.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.420
Grif: [sigh] I'm telling you, it was four shots.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.480
Like, bam! Bam! Bam!

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.040
Simmons: Wait a second, that's only three bams.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.900
Grif: Bam.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.360
Wait a second... We got a blue guy on the move out there.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.620
Simmons: Where's he headed?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.960
Grif: Oh, crap!

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.000
It's...

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.940
It's Donut.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.100
And he's got something.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.160
It looks like...

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.700
Simmons...

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.900
Get the Warthog.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.940
Simmons: Heh, you mean the Puma?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.700
Caboose: Where am I...?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.800
Oh, well that looks nice!

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800
Oh my God! A giant person!
