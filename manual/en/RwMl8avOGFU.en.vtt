00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.910
My name is Abraham Conlon.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.950
I'm the owner and chef of Fat Rice.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.650
Fat Rice is a restaurant in Logan
Square specializing in Macanese cuisine.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.960
Today, the dish that
we're making is serradura.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.390
It's a popular Portuguese pudding,
meaning serradura means sawdust.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.190
It is a basic whipped cream-based
pudding with a cookie crumb on top.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.700
So we start by caramelizing the sugar
in the pan on the induction unit.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.510
We start to get a little bit
of color, melt down the sugar.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.520
We add the cream, bring to a boil,
smash out any lumps with a spoon.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.360
When it all comes together, we
go ahead and add a few chilies.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.740
And then we bring it back to a boil
and then remove that from the heat,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.570
put it into the bowl, and we'll leave it
to cool until we're ready to assemble.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.690
So in the blender, we add the cashews.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.360
Then we add the tea biscuits.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.020
You turn the blender on.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.750
We get that so it's nice and smooth
and crumbly just like sawdust.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.750
We go ahead and put it in a
pan until ready to assemble.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.230
Then we move over to
the base of the dessert.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.400
We start off with heavy whipping
cream, put that into the mixer,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.890
start it off on low, gradually increase
the speed to finish whipping the cream.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.070
We add a little bit of
sweetened condensed milk

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.850
and then we add some limes
zest, turn the mixer back on

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.340
to incorporate those flavors.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.940
We're slicing a ripe banana.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.880
And now we're ready to plate.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.610
We put a little bit of the caramel
sauce in the bottom, a few banana slices

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.420
on top of that, fill about
halfway with our cream mixture,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.140
a little bit more caramel,
a couple more banana slices.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.410
With the crumb topping, it's
nice to alternate layers

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.400
so that when you're eating it
you have variants of texture.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.040
And then we finish off
with the crumb topping.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.439
And that's how you make serradura, a
very simple Portuguese-style dessert.
