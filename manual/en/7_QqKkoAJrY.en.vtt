00:00:00.377 --> 00:00:02.391
Hello! Starting another I Could Kill For Dessert!

00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:05.687
And today is a Friend's Special Episode.

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:12.078
As a good friend is a friend who talks less and hears more, nothing better than the kitchen of Cozinha Para 2 to make a recipe for you!

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:16.918
And today I'm going to make a very easy recipe, like those they make here. And the best thing:

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:20.426
it won't use oven and nothing really elaborated.

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:24.360
Actually, I'm going to use a microwave. Carol will teach me how to use it, because I don't know.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.735
So, I'm going to make a Passion Fruit Cheesecake Cup for them and for you, and it's going to be delicious! Lets start?

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:43.966
The first thing I'm going to do is process some Oreo to make the Cheesecake's base.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.828
Don't worry, don't freak out! All the ingredients with the right amount are down here in the link, ok?

00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:52.104
Oreo - 1 package

00:00:53.988 --> 00:01:00.691
When your Oreo are like a beach sand, is ready and you can put in the bottom of the cup.

00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:05.570
And with the butt of your spoon, you knead it to stick in the bottom of the cup.

00:01:05.828 --> 00:01:15.921
I have two types of Passion Fruit: a passion fruit tart and a passion fruit sweet, that seems like a papaya.

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:17.315
Husband: You're overreacting.

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:19.815
No, come on! It's a small papaya, look! Isn't it?

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:20.813
Duca: It's a small papaya!

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:26.822
Despite Paulo doesn't agree, Duca agrees with me. It seems like a small papaya.

00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:32.551
It's really sweet, but I won't use it in the filling we're going to prepare with cream cheese.

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.879
I'm going to use it later, just to decorate it.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:42.639
So you will take this one, the tart one, and will separate the juice (100ml) from the seeds using the sieve.

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:59.423
And then, when you finished getting the passion fruit juice, you will add gelatin powder (1tbsp) and let it hydrate for about 5 minutes.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:05.369
To prepare the filling, besides the passion fruit juice and the gelatin, you'll need 1 cup of sugar and cream cheese.

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:06.694
2 packages

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:08.382
1 cup of sugar

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:19.437
When your gelatin are looking like egg yolk, you call a responsible person or your best friend to put it in the microwave for 15 seconds.

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:29.251
When the gelatin is melted, put it in the cream, combine, assemble in the cups and put in the fridge!

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.971
Fridge - 20 minutes

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.403
When your cheesecake is ready, you'll cut that passion fruit that seems like a small papaya and is very sweet,

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:53.733
and will put over your cheesecake, just to make some flourish on it and it gets prettier!

00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:01.933
And it's ready! Look how beautiful!

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:05.605
Duca: Do I really have to eat these passion fruit's seeds? Will grow passion fruit in my belly?

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:09.995
And this was another I Could Kill For Dessert, featuring Cozinha pra 2!
