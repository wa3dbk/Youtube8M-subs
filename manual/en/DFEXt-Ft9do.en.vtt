00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
People are passionate about dog food, and
everybody wants to make sure

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.560
that they're feeding what's best for their
pet.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.240
Today, I'll be talking about the top 5 things
you

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.060
don't want to get wrong when feeding your furbaby.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.640
&gt;&gt; Meg: And now, the vet who you can never,
EVER feed after midnight,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.020
&gt;&gt; Meg: Dr. Andy Roark!

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.119
What do pet owners forget when feeding their
pets?

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.679
&gt;&gt; Meg: Wine pairings!

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen: Sending thank you notes. I mean
really, how hard is it?

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.350
No, and no. But...I will tell you.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.600
We know that not all dogs are the same, so
why would we expect one dog food to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.420
be the best for all of them? For example,
long haired dogs have 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.300
a higher essential fatty acid requirement

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.560
than short haired dogs do. That
means if the long haired dog doesn't

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.600
get what he needs, he's going to end up with
a dumpy coat,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.680
living in a van down by the river.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.229
If black dogs don't get what they need, they
will actually lose their blackness. Seriously!

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.909
There's an amino acid called phenylalanine,
and it's used to make the

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.960
black skin pigment melanin. If they don't
get enough melanin from their diet,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
they can't keep up their black coat. Have
you ever seen those black dogs

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.450
that turn auburn after a while? They're not
getting enough phenylalanine from their diet.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.560
And energy requirements vary widely between
individuals.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.639
You know that skinny dude who eats everything
that he wants and never gains a pound,

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:37.179
while you eat salads and the scale still creeps
up? Yeah.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.030
That happens in the dog world, too. That's
why we've gotta find food with a calorie

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.600
content that works for your specific dog.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.420
The point is, dog food is NOT one size fits
all.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.700
Fiber has lots of digestive benefits, and
many large breed dogs have higher fiber

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.099
requirements than small breed dogs. If they
don't get it, the can end up with

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.950
chronic colitis, and diarrhea that just keeps
coming back.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.360
If you have a large breed dog that frequently
gets diarrhea, you got a couple options.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.710
Number 1, you could put a shower drain right
in the middle of your house.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.180
Or number 2, you could talk to your veterinarian
about transitioning to a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.740
higher fiber diet. You can add fiber from
sources like cilium, pumpkin, or oat bran.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.540
However, it generally takes a lot of these
supplements to make the difference

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.630
that a change in dog food could make easily.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.020
Some dog foods will tell you that vomiting
or diarrhea while changing over to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.260
their dog food is normal. It's not.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.910
If you went a restaurant and they handed you
a vomit bag with the menu when you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.650
walked in, do you think you'd keep going back?

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.980
If you're seeing either of these signs, either
the dog food isn't working for your dog,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.240
or we're transitioning too fast. If you plan
to change dog foods, plan to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.680
slowly increase the amount of new food while
decreasing the amount of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.210
old food over 3-4 days. And in some dogs,
it can even take a week.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.680
Just watch, and if your dog is having soft
stools or throws up, let's slow

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.860
down the transition and take our time.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.620
 We just want to get there without getting a sick pooch.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.060
Commercial dog food provides nutritionally
balanced diets, IF they are 90% or more

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.510
of what your dog eats. That means if you feed
half dog food and half

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.730
table scraps or green beans or anything else,
we may run into nutrient

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.460
deficiencies. To summarize, if you have something
that's balanced, and you add something to

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.720
it miiight not still be balanced.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.030
The amount of food your dog food bag says
to feed, is based on recommendations

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.530
for the "average" dog. However, your dog might
be a couch potato, and need

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.130
a whole lot less food. Or, he might be a 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.060
four legged Arnold Schwarzenegger, and need a lot more.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen: Hasta la vista, puppy!

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.940
I'll be bark.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.700
&gt;&gt; Stephen: Come with me if you want to lick.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.750
To find out how much to feed, weigh your dog
and then feed the recommended

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.510
amount for 2 weeks using a measuring cup.
After 2 weeks, re-weigh your dog.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.530
If your dog is gaining or losing weight, adjust
the amount you feed accordingly

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.270
and continue to use the measuring cup. Remember,
the guidelines on the bag

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.000
are just a starting point. And the ending
point is the poop bag.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.810
Please tell me you use poop bags.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.270
Don't be THAT guy.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.100
