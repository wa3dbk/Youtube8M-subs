00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.920
Hi, I’m Helen from eSpares. If you find
that your dishwasher is leaking from the front,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.430
it’s probably due to damaged or broken seals.
This Bosch dishwasher, like most, has two

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.530
seals. The first is a three-sided seal which
runs round like this, this is really easy

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.562
to change and you can see me do it in another
video. The second seal, you can’t actually

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:35.000
see it, but it runs along the bottom of the
door and it looks like this. Now this is a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.160
much bigger job as I actually need to remove
the door to do this. Before ordering any spare

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.150
parts, always make sure you get the full model
details from the appliance. On a dishwasher,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.830
this can normally be found on the edge of
the door and remember- before you start any

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.081
work, always switch off at the mains first.
So I need to remove the door, to do this I

00:00:57.081 --> 00:01:02.650
need to unhook the hinges, and to get to the
hinges, I need to remove the top and the side

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.100
panels. For this part of the job, I need a
torx head screw driver, a set of bits can

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:19.690
be found on the eSpares website. I've now
removed the top and side panels and the baskets,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.830
for convenience. Now on this Bosch dishwasher,
the hinge is held under tension by a spring

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:36.210
and pulley system, so to unhook this I need
to close the door, remove this plastic cover

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.890
and then with a pair of pliers, I need to
unhook this plastic part of the pulley system,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.320
and I need to do the same on the other side.
With the hinges un-sprung, I can now go about

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.880
removing the door. Now be careful because
the door is now really heavy and can easily

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.159
fall open so always make sure it’s closed
properly. I need to remove this front panel

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:12.000
here, to do this I need to remove the kickplate
first,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.489
and then I need to remove three screws either
side of the door. I can now remove the door

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:32.040
from the machine by getting a flat head screw
driver and prising open the metal clips and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:42.969
then pulling the door away. I just need to
pull the door seal away from the machine and

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.480
then lay the door down- now please be aware
that you’re still attached by wires to the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:57.560
machine so you can’t move the door very
far.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.650
I need to remove these hinge protectors and
put them to one side. Now you can see that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.319
the door seal is sandwiched between the hinge
and the inner part of the door, I need to

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:19.499
remove these two screws either side to remove
the hinge. So now I can remove the hinges

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:28.989
and put them to one side, remove the old door
seal and pop the new one in, making sure it’s

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:40.480
the right way round.
And then I can reattach the hinges and put

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.689
everything back together. Now I’ve just
rested the door in place while I attach the

00:03:49.689 --> 00:04:04.689
door seal at the bottom here to the lip of
the machine.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:13.239
Don’t forget to reattach the hinge-pulley
system.

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.090
There you go, one lower seal replaced on this
Bosch dishwasher! Seals for most makes and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.879
models of dishwasher are available on the
eSpares website.
