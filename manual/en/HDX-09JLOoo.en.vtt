00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.690
I need to know how to play PS4 games without
disc.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.530
If you want to go all digital, get a larger
hard drive.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.980
They are installing the whole game to the
HDD these days whether you have a disc or

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.080
not.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.330
You can buy the game from the PSN store, download
the digital game to the console and play it

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.609
all you want.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.821
Run out of room, and you can delete it and
as long as PSN recognizes the account, you

00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:30.090
can re-download the game.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.400
That only tells me that if I have a digital
game, I do not lose it even if I delete it.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.840
You need the disc to play the application
for most games and purchases, if not all.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.110
It is a form of digital rights management,
tying the game to a physical item you had

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.510
to install instead of a crack code and download.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.010
What is the solution, since I do not want
to mess with discs anymore?

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.820
You either need the game disc to play, or
a digital version of the full game.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.430
I have the disc.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.829
The full digital version is a separate version
and a separate product.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.920
And you do not get a free full digital version
with the disc.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.520
I’ve paid for the disc, and I had to wait
for it to download the game.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.860
Can I just play that after the download without
the disc?

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.180
If you buy the full digital version off the
PSN store, yes, you can play that game without

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.580
a disc.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.380
If you buy the disc, you’ll always need
the disc to play it.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.430
So I either buy all new all digital games
to play PS4 games without the disc, or get

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.360
the disc versions and always need the disc
to play.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.049
That’s right.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.370
The downside would be having to pay a second
time for all digital versions.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.200
The downside is having to wait for hours per
download for every download, so you do not

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.320
have to wait to find the disc to play it again.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.340
I could download it in the background and
even play it on disc, while waiting for it

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.790
to finish downloading digitally.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.580
If you’re willing to do that, just play
the disc.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.770
And remember, if you’ve got the disc, you
can still play locally even if you do not

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.180
have a working internet connection.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.830
I do not care if I can play as soon as it
has downloaded the first level, since it may

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.540
not keep up with my game play.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.470
And if I do not have an internet connection,
more than my gaming is impacted.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.260
You could also play games without disc by
sharing multiplayer games with your friends.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.610
You do that by going to the Share button and
selecting play a game together.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.819
Thanks for sharing that advice.
