00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.880
It is time for our first Ask Jessie.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.100
You've asked questions and now I'm going to
answer 'em.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:18.189
Patches wants to know the answers, too.

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.522
Our first question is from Alice Glendarroch:
What type of facility do you have for the

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:24.522
animals?

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.119
Like, was it a school, or office building?

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.119
Or is it part of your house?

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.429
I was just wondering how you figured out a
place to house 80 animals.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.189
(I realized you probably didn't start with
80.)

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.850
The animal facility has been built onto, into,
around our house, I guess.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.559
And then we do house some of the animals outside,
and some of them are partially housed inside-outside.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.860
Most of the animals are tropical species,
so they have to be inside, temperature-controlled.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.899
But they are really small reptiles or birds,
so we started with 30 and then we've just

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.500
expanded to fit the ones that need housing.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.149
Next question from Grubslekcin.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.739
Oh my gosh, this is hard.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:03.940
Hey Jessi!

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.770
We are passing through the area this summer
and my kids were curious if we were allowed

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.160
to come and visit with the animals.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.000
I would l--here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.430
Shh.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.300
I would love to meet all of you face-to-face.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.130
I would love to share the animals with everybody.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.150
We are not open to the public.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.650
We don't have the funds to be able to make
the facility big enough to house humans as

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.670
well as the animals.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.190
You can find us at a bunch of public events,
as well, and we go out and do, um, school

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.980
presentations and other special events.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.830
Birthday parties, even.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.930
So, that's how we're sharing the animals and
YouTube videos right now.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.040
Next question, Fiona @theinsanefiona, asks:
Has there been any particular animal that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.970
has majorly impacted your life or career goals?

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.180
There have been so many!

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.940
Well, I think every single animal that I have
interacted with somehow has influenced my

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.010
life, but there are those that have stood
out.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.450
My first horse I got when she was 10; her
name was Belle.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.850
She was a rescue.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.670
She made a really huge impact on me and just
really reinforced my love of animals.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.090
Buddy the raccoon has been my biggest teacher
of hands-on, free-contact training and interaction.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.080
And even though he's passed on, he continues
to influence my interaction with animals today.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.580
Savodee the spotted hyena impressed me the
most on his understanding of human communication.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.450
He knew over 300 different cues, human cues.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.450
Awesome.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.950
Annie the vervet monkey, she taught me the
most about patience and how important clear

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.110
communication is when working with a protected
contact animal.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.920
Kemosabe, the prehensile tail porcupine, he
was my biggest eye-opener to the world of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.310
YouTube videos going viral.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.290
He has over a million views.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.470
Kemosabe's tree fort, who knew?

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.110
Next question from Ron Jennings: Here's an
animal question for you.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.890
I just recently found out that it's legal
in my area to own a spider monkey and I'd

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.800
love to have one, but I don't know if it's
really ethical to do so.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.030
So I know that the exotic pet store is a bit
sketchy, so I'm not sure if you can get one

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.030
through ethical means, but if it is, what
is the best source of info on how to properly

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.290
care for one?

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.290
[Sigh.]

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.650
No, no, no, no, no.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.440
Please no.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.440
[Exhales.]

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.720
Monkeys do not make good pets.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.850
They don't.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.740
I mean, I'm not going to say that no one can
properly take care of a spider monkey, because

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.430
that's just not true, but they are so far
out of the ranges of something as an appropriate

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.500
pet.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.500
Just no.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.130
So, I really kind of feel like it'd be easier
to take care of a human child than it would

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.730
be to take care of a monkey.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.280
I mean our whole society is built around being
able to take care of human children.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.770
There's just so little help out there for
properly caring for monkeys.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:58.800
I mean, if you think you're ready for a monkey
as a pet, you have to make sure that they

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.840
have a HUGE enclosure, that they can do natural
behaviors, which spider monkeys swing and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.200
hang from branches.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.720
And they are social, so you'll have to get
a couple of them.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.790
And then you have to get the right permits,
and socialization, and give them the right--

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.690
diet that they need.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.500
Not to mention, make sure that they don't
get sick and finding a vet to take care of

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500
them.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.590
It's just...monkey's don't make good pets.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.590
Bethany Ellerby asks: I'm just interested
to know if you rehome or release your animals,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.480
or whether, after they're in your care, they
stay with your permanently.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.370
All of our animals are non-releasable, meaning
that they can't survive in the wild.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.660
While, I wholeheartedly support rehabers who
take in animals from the wild that are injured

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.410
and rehabilitate them and put them back out
into the wild.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.910
Such wonderful, amazing, happy stories.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.130
We're just--Animal Wonders is not a rehab
facility.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.490
So, we take in animals that have been displaced
from their home.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.680
So that means that they no longer have a home.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.240
And then we provide them with the best possible
placement.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.150
Usually that means staying at Animal Wonders
for their entire life.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.280
But there are occasions when animals would
be better in another facility, another home.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.780
And those cases are assessed on an individual
basis.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.840
Like the recent re-homing of our brush-tailed
bettong pair, which you can find that story

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840
right here.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.470
William Turner asks: What a beautiful tortoise!

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.530
Did you mention Yucca's age and lifespan?

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.850
How did you get that pronunciation?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.440
"Yoo-cca,"as "you," instead of "yuck."

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.520
Best of luck to you.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.050
There is a white tuber that grows in Peru
called 'yuca,' and it's absolutely delicious

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.090
if you fry it and cover it in salt.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.550
Augusto named Yucca, so I'm blaming him for
that coincidence.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.040
Yucca was born in 2008, which makes her about
six years old.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.360
They can live up to 80 years.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.710
Happyanne512 asks: Is Yucca potty trained?

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.330
Otherwise the reptile room must get quite
messy.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.240
No, she is not potty-trained and yes it does
get quite messy.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:04.350
And, last question, Chaospotato asks: At 1:56,
is that poop in a jar in the background?

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.750
What, this?!

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.750
This?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.750
This is not poop.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.160
This is monkey biscuits, and yes they do make
monkey biscuits.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.650
However, this is poop.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.900
If you like learning about animals and you
want to learn more, you can find me and ask

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.320
me questions on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook.
