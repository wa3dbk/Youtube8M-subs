00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.580
Well my project today is I'm gonna go
ahead and change

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.259
the freewheel on this bike.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.059
This has got a Sachs freewheel on there
and it's a bit worn.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.410
And shifting is not too great. So I'm going to
go ahead and put a brand new

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.439
Shimano freewheel. What a freewheel is,

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.779
its a self-contained little unit. It screws

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.330
onto the hub. So it's got little threads back
here. And

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.019
it's got the whole bearing system
inside there

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.070
so it spins on there. And it's got pawls.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.890
So what it does is, it allows it to spin
free in one direction

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.559
but then catch in the other direction so
it turns the wheel. So that's what a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.090
freewheel is.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.890
Not to be confused with a cassette
in which

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.430
the little bearing and pawl stuff

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.890
is in a part...another part that is attached
to the hub called a free hub.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.289
But I'll probably do another video on
that too.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.770
So the first thing I want to do is remove the wheel.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.960
And for ease of use I've got the
chain shifted to the smallest

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.680
ring. So go ahead and pop this down. It just makes it a
little easier to put the thing back on.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.780
Okay, I've got the wheel here. I wanna go ahead and
remove

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.780
the skewer. And get the spring.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.979
And put it out of here. And go ahead and put that aside.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.970
Don't lose the springs. Now depending
on what brand of freewheel

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.520
you are removing and installing, you are going to need

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.159
different I tools. If you look right

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.649
in here, there's like little splines.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.240
You might be able see it on the the new one a
little bit better.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.509
See, there's little splines in here, and so what
you are going to need

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.810
is a tool that's going to fit those little splines.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.479
Here's like a few of the different freewheel tools that I have.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.549
Here's one has splines on it.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.439
And then these ones have little notches.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.420
Some other brands of freewheels also have
these little notches these fit into.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.870
The Sachs also used the same one here.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.280
This is a Park Tool FR-1.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.750
These other ones here are also made by Park Tool.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.260
These tools generally cost,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.010
usually under about 10 bucks. You can find them for maybe

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.879
like 8 bucks at your local bike shop. Anyway this tool

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.890
what it's going to do is it's just going to slide right in here and
mesh with those little splines in there.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.709
Okay so I have the tool in there

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.680
And one thing you can do is you can put the skewer

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.010
back through here, and have it actually go
through the tool

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.760
to help hold the tool on. You don't want to have it clamped real tight. You want it a little bit loose so

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.800
it gives it a little room to move out.
But I

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.830
rarely ever do that. Not on this kind.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.840
On the other ones that have the little notches that come out...

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.760
the other two types of tools, I usually do.
But on this kind I generally don't.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.769
So slide this in here and I have a big
Crescent wrench.

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
and I'm going to fit this on here. And what I want to do

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.780
is turn this

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.709
counterclockwise. Now if this freewheel
has been on the bike for a while,

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.030
what happens is, this is turning
clockwise it's actually tightening this

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.230
thing on. So if this has been on the bike
for a while....

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.390
these things can be extremely tight.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.450
And you may need more than just a wrench to remove it

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.780
So what I am going to use is

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.870
a big cheater bar.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.150
So I am just going to slide this over the Crescent wrench here.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.319
to give me more leverage. And

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.879
usually I will just hold the wheel. If its real

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.030
tough I can actually kind of brace this up
against a wall or something.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.739
I rarely have to do that. Usually just

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.370
do this and break that thing loose.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.220
And once you get it loose then you can just

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.389
unscrew this off. Just turn this tool.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.840
It'll come loose. There.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.979
It comes right off. And so there's the threads

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.229
that the freewheel screws right
onto.

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.490
Okay I am ready to install the new freewheel.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.850
Just slide it on here and

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.540
turn it on. Get the threading started.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.540
and it should thread on pretty easy. Then just go ahead and spin it on.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.790
Until it's tight there. Then you can take the tool

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.970
slide it on there.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.740
Use the wrench to go ahead and

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.449
tighten it on there. I don't need the cheater
bar to

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.930
tighten it. I just use the wrench to tighten it on there.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.000
And that'll be good enough. As I ride it

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.500
the freewheel itself will go ahead and
tighten itself on.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.660
Now I wanna reinstall the skewer.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.070
So I just slide this up.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.949
The lever goes on the side opposite the freewheel. Slide this on here.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.509
Get that started.

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.509
Now I wanna reinstall the wheel.

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.320
Since I had the chain on the
smallest cog when I pulled it off

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.240
I am going to go ahead and put the chain on smallest cog putting it back on.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.020
Slide it back up in here.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.220
Tighten this on here.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.610
Like that. Then just go ahead and

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.620
test it, make sure everything works good.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.259
There, and that is how you change

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.009
a freewheel on a bike wheel. If you found

I'll see what I can do.
