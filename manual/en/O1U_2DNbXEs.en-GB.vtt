00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.449
In this nugget, we will learn the basic concepts of 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.420
LEDs.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.260
Light Emitting Diodes or LEDs 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.040
are small, point light sources that can be used

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.530
individually or in a cluster of more than one chip. 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.279
Optical materials can be used around the LED chip or cluster 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.439
to direct and screen the light. 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.760
If the LED chip or cluster, with its driver, 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.949
is encapsulated in a bulb with a conventional lamp foot,

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.199
we have a direct replacement for an incandescent lamp, 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.379
which is called 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.670
LED retrofit lamps. 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.050
Spectral power distribution characterizes 
light by giving the power 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.610
of light 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.980
at each wavelength in the visible spectrum.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.730
The materials available today make it possible to produce 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.260
LEDs in all colors. The spectral power distribution 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.120
is always narrow. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.620
Since the spectrum of a single LED is always narrow, 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.020
white LED chips cannot yet be produced. 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.220
But white LED light can nevertheless be obtained 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.360
by combining red, green and blue

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.170
LED chips into a single module or system 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.140
to give white light. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.200
A single LED producing red, green and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.820
and blue light would therefore result in white light. 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.460
This type of LED is called RGB LED. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.799
It has four pins, one for each color 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.430
and a common cathode.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.800
Good-quality white light can be obtained by using a combination 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.180
of blue LED chip and yellow fluorescent material 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.190
called phosphor. This is called a

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.470
“white phosphor LED”.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.500
This graph shows the spectral power distribution 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.530
of such a white phosphor LED, from which it can be seen

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.780
that now light is emitted over almost the whole 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.210
of the visible spectrum.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.850
Using an LED has a multitude of amazing benefits.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.500
LEDs have long life. The useful lifetime of professional luminaires 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.700
is 75.000 and for consumer retrofit 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.340
about 20.000 hours. 
LEDs are energy efficient. 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.569
A LED lamp is as efficient as a CFL lamp

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.450
and about 6 times as efficient as an incandescent lamp. 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.810
Light emitted from LEDs do not contain any 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.610
infrared or ultraviolet radiation. This makes the use of LEDs 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.540
around heat sensitive or UV sensitive materials safe.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.440
Because of these benefits, more LEDs are being used as integral part of luminaires.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.500
thank you
