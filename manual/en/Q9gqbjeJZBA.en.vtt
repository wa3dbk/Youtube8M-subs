00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.429
Hey, we're back at Animal Wonders! Our goal
and mission is to take care of animals, but

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.880
that's not all we do. We have to run a business,
we have to educate, we have to take care of

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.980
all these crazy little details.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.940
I want to share all the things that we do
at Animal Wonders, but I can't do it in one

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.769
episode, so today, let's talk about poop,
dirt, and being somebody.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.470
Not many people get to have the privilege
of being their own boss. I think there's a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.699
million more perks than there are downfalls
of being your own boss. You have to - on the

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.320
first hand, you have to call all the shots,
all the really difficult ones, like which

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.460
animal to put in the video.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.779
But on the other hand, you get to call all
the shots, so when you see a problem, you

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.100
can attack it directly and efficiently and
just take care of that sucker. Some of them

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.500
are really hard decisions, like what t-shirt
to hang on the wall.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.160
I was taught a very important lesson: be somebody.
As in, "somebody should fix that!" You need

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.699
to BE that somebody. I'm responsible for 8-plus
animals; I'm their sole caregiver, so it's

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.260
my responsibility to make sure that they get
everything they need.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.820
But I also have a responsibility to my family
and friends and also, this planet that we

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.710
all owe our lives to, so I love that me and
Augusto are able to be our own bosses and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.490
make decisions that can better our environment.
And one particular decision that we're able

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.600
to make, I'm incredibly proud of.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.600
With lots of animals, undeniably, comes lots
of poop. This leads to an abundance of cleaning,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.960
which leads to an abundance of trash. What
do we do with all this poop?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.860
We compost if of course! With the help of
my amazing brother who has studied and experimented

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.420
with horticulture, we compost and create our
own fertilizer. We take all the soiled animal

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
bedding, and we put it in a big pile, right
here, and then we collect and add to it over

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.219
the year.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.920
In the springtime when we move our horse off
her winter pasture, we take all the animal

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.539
bedding from the holding bin, and we move
it to the composting bin. We scrape her win-

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.740
the horse's winter pasture, we put a good
amount of that horse manure into this pile,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.130
and we mix it, and then we let it sit for
about a year to cook.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.460
During the time the moisture content has to
be high enough that it keeps the microorganisms,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.110
bacteria --antingeno bacteria, fungus, mold,
yeast, protozoa, rotifers-- happy and healthy.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.000
Having friendly worm and other little detritivores
crawling around in this pile is going to help

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.360
break down the material. They're going to
be eating it and pooping it out, which is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.440
going to decompose it, and they're also creating
tunnels that help this big pile breathe. And

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.090
that's going to create aerobic respiration
amongst all the microbes.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.060
We want the microbes to resperate aerobically,
and this is going to speed up the composting

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.090
process. We're gonna have healthy, usable
soil, without potentially harmful pathogens.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.980
If the heap gets too dense, it's gonna start
resperating anaerobically. And that's bad

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.720
because it's going to create a slimy, stinky,
horrible mess, and it's going to take longer

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.230
to decompose, and it's not gonna get hot enough
in the middle to kill all the bad pathogens.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.510
Now it's essential that the compost generate
enough heat in the middle of the pile to kill

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.870
any pathogens that would make us sick if we
consumed it.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.320
You also need the right balance. Every material
is going to have their own different ratio;

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.200
what you're looking for is a general overall
ratio of about 30:1 carbon to nitrogen. And

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.900
that's going to give the best possible environment
for your microorganisms.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.390
Paper cardboard and wood shavings which we
have plenty of, that's all high in carbon.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.900
Anything fresh and green like leftover food,
or feces and urine, are going to be really

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.310
high in nitrogen. Once the fertilizer has
cooked for a year we move it to the ready

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.080
to use pile. Then we have wonderful nutrient
rich soil that we can use on the garden. With

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.700
no nasty pathogens, this wonderful soil is
packed full of healthy bacteria.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.950
For the last five years, my brother Jake has
mixed and moved this all manually, with a

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.590
shovel. We were so lucky this year to have
access to a front-end loader that made this

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.140
so much easier. We then use this homemade
fertilizer to grow greens and vegetables so

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.290
we can feed our animals fresh, clean produce.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.100
This is one of the decisions that I'm really
proud to have been able to make as a boss.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.040
It not only helps deal with a really big issue
at Animal Wonders, it reduces the cost of

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.650
food, it's ecologically friendly, and it makes
me really happy to grow a garden.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.400
I'm continuously amazed by nature, but I'm
even more amazed by all these cycles that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.459
we find in nature! We can find them in almost
any observable phenomena. Look there's a little

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.400
bee pollinating that flower right now. And
I'm in love with cycles! Decomposition, pollination,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.680
photosynthesis, days, seasons, rock cycle,
nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle, photosynthesis,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.690
said that one already! Life cycle, menstrual
cycle, I love nature! So I'm really proud

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.910
to have been able to make this decision and
be somebody by moving Animal Wonders towards

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.130
a more sustainable organization by choosing
to compost.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.340
And that's just one of the many decisions
that's involved in caring for all these animals

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.220
and it's not readily visible to the public.
So I'm really glad that I'm able to share

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.340
the behind the scenes with you, so that you
can learn about all these amazing things that

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.780
we get to do.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.690
So we've been getting some great questions
and observations in the comments section and

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.780
that has inspired me to learn more and then
share more with you, which in itself has become

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.300
a cycle! So keep commenting, questioning,
and wondering! You can find me on Twitter,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.380
Tumblr, and Facebook, and you can join us

Past video: Welcome back guys today we're
going to be talking about behavioral enrichment.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.030
Now I know a lot of you guys really enjoy
sensory stimulation, like...

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:27.030
If you think this looks like a big pile of
crap... Oh, I love poop.
