00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.980
When one thinks of gnomes the mind often wanders
to those creepy all-too-happy garden statues

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.259
strewn across your neighbor's yard.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.580
Who would have thought that they were dare-devils?

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.609
OK, in fantasy it's long been known that gnomes
like to tinker and invent contraptions, but

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.070
if we are to believe Sky Gnomes by Foursaken
Media, their favorite form of entertainment

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.170
is to build racing machines that allow them
to plummet from the sky as fast as gnome-nly

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.499
possible.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.270
Sky Gnomes is an entirely multiplayer experience.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.050
Loading up a race will almost always immediately
throw you in with two other players seamlessly.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.000
It does make us wonder if we were racing bots
at any point in time to make up for how quick

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.960
things seemed to work, but either way you're
not waiting around to start a game.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.650
Once the race starts you have a third person
perspective of your racer while controlling

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.730
the joystick with your finger.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.570
The trick is to hit as many snowflakes as
possible as they speed you up (as does flying

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.010
through checkpoints).

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.680
Along the way there are flying coin dispensaries
and ice that if hit will most assuredly slow

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.010
you down.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.070
Once finished you'll gain coin and spare part
bonuses for completing objectives (which is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.149
how you advance to different tournaments),
and will gain a random spare part on the wheel.

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.649
The coins and spare parts are to upgrade your
racer.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.390
Not only to make it faster and move maneuverable
but there are a host of trinkets to craft

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.570
that act as perks as you're racing (of course
additional trinket slots have to be built

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.250
onto your racer).

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.899
Racing will place you on the daily leaderboards
and you get bonuses for climbing the ranks

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.840
as well as defeating any rivals on the boards
the game throws against you (giving you a

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.369
reason to return to earlier races).

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.270
The thing is while the depth of additional
content is here, the racing itself is kind

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.709
of lackluster.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.659
Creating chain combos is tough because of
the difficulty of actually hitting snowflakes,

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.539
and then due to the amount of races needed
to upgrade, it seems that it would be easier

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.479
just to buy a spare parts pack as an in-app
purchase to get a leg up on the competition,

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.369
which is never something we like to see in
games.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.470
For those who find the racing exciting however,
Sky Gnomes will certainly give you plenty

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.239
to strive for and a lot of bang for your buck.
