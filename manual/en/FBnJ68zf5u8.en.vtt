00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.779
The Large Magellanic Cloud, or LMC, is a small
companion galaxy of our own Milky Way. It

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.180
can be seen with the naked eye, as a faint
grey blotch in the constellation of Dorado.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.930
It's a favorite hunting ground for astronomers
and it has been studied by many telescopes.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.420
Its most dramatic feature is the Tarantula
Nebula, a bright region of glowing gas and

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.370
energetic star formation. Hubble has produced
a close-up view of this nebula, which reveals

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.609
this dynamic region of our Universe in unprecedented
detail.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.250
This part of the Tarantula Nebula is one of
its most dynamic, showing the area around

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.960
the supernova remnant NGC 2060. These wispy
tendrils of dust and gas are the only visible

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.020
remnant of a star which has exploded.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.200
After puffing out these smoky remains, the
core of the star that formed NGC 2060 collapsed

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:23.409
into a pulsar, which is a type of neutron
star. The Tarantula nebula glows brightly

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.159
because the atoms in its hydrogen gas are
excited by the bright, newborn stars that

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.520
have recently formed here.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.520
These toddler-stars shine forth with intense
ultraviolet radiation that ionizes the gas,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.810
making it light up red and green. The light
is so intense that although around 170 000

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.710
light-years distant, and outside the Milky
Way, the Tarantula Nebula is nevertheless

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.259
visible without a telescope on a dark night
to Earth-bound observers.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.950
But the biggest and brightest stars in the
Tarantula are actually just outside Hubble's

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:09.590
field of view. This wider, but less detailed
view of the Tarantula Nebula was taken with

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.980
the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope, at La Silla
Observatory in Chile. It shows the source

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.850
of much of the Tarantula's light: the super
star cluster RMC 136.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.860
So it wasn't in fact that long ago that astronomers
were still debating whether this intense light

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.100
came from a compact star cluster, or perhaps
an unknown kind of super-star. It's only been

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.020
in the past 20 years that we have been able
to prove that it is indeed a star cluster

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.390
- albeit one that hosts some of the most massive
stars that have ever been observed.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.850
The Tarantula Nebula also hosts the supernova
1987a. Now, of all the supernovae that have

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:11.260
been observed since the invention of the telescope,
this one is by far the closest to us. 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.270
Pulling further back, the size of the Tarantula
Nebula relative to its host galaxy becomes

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.480
clear. It is the brightest known star forming
region in the local Universe and one of the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.510
most attractive spots in the night sky.
