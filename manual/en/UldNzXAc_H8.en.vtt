00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.779
because there's been so many changes in
the health care reform

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.460
law and the media has talked about this
at length

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.490
I think I don't know about all of you
I am totally confused myself

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.530
with regard to the issues and what it is
we need to do

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.730
as a result of that I asked expert Ron
Crawford who is the vice president

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.960
benefits at Starbucks was spent years
studying

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.109
all aspects on health care issues and
the new law

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.059
to help us understand the situation and
to give you his personal insight and

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:32.710
advice

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.520
as to what to do to. Ron, can you explain
for me, forget everybody else, for

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.930
me

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.050
what really is going on and what we need
to do

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.530
that if the primary goal health care
reforms to ensure that all Americans

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.780
have

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.920
access to affordable comprehensive
health care but going forward we're all

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.930
gonna be required to have health
insurance beginning january 1st 2014

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.340
so what that means for all this is we're
gonna need to make a choice as to what

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.690
plan is best for us

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.539
gonna need to that plan and getting
enrolled it's gonna boil down to three

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:03.690
primary choices

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.260
coverage through a family member spouse or
parent coverage through Starbucks

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.049
or seeking coverage on the new insurance
marketplaces

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.700
sorry let me ask you a question if you
had each child working for Starbucks was

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.320
working

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.830
25 hours a week right what would you
advise him to do

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.799
you know the first thing I do is
advisement how to take a look at

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.909
the insurance marketplaces see what kind
of coverage is out there soon kinda

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.229
rates are available they're likely gonna
be and more expensive than the Starbucks

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:32.759
option

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.820
because Starbucks subsidizes a
significant portion of the premium

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.100
associate with coverage through
Starbucks so we could take a look at the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.590
coverage to the insurance marketplace

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.130
but primarily the the main choice is
going to be between covering

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.640
themselves on the Starbucks plan or
joining a plan with me as a parent

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.600
okay for going out and getting their own
plan or no they could go and seek their

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.070
own

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.070
coverage insurance marketplace but what
they'll find is it's probably gonna be

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.130
more expensive

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.780
because they won't be eligible for any
subsidies to the federal government

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.250
because they're eligible for coverage
under Starbucks

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.640
and given the fact that Starbucks has
had a great plan and King

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.099
and going to continue to provide that
plan you would say

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.599
stay with Starbucks I was is there a
Starbucks our coverage is affordable

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.870
and comprehensive and it's available to
our partners who work at least 20 hours

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.319
a week

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.470
but it's not mandatory they can do
whatever they want some mandatory in

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.720
fact you you really to take this point
I'm in time to take a look at your

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.270
options

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.209
your best option is to ensure you have
coverage by January 2014

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.489
there are some cases where that will not
be required but by and large the smart

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.840
choices to make sure you have coverage
by January 2014

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.120
again take a look at your three options
through family member

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.709
through Starbucks or through insurance
marketplace okay

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.800
you know going back to you the very
beginning this has been a hallmark

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.950
what it means to be a Starbucks partner
long would be in stock

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.000
it's going to continue to be and we're
gonna do everything we can to continue

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.010
to provide you with the kind of health
care you've had in the past

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.170
if you have any questions what should
they do from this point on you have any

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.060
questions we have a ton of resources
available to you

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.310
are them can be found at mysbuxben.com. you can go there

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.540
you can find a number of resources
and FAQ documents

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.610
you can find the 1-800 number you can
call our benefits center to get

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.510
personalized help

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.150
and even for service partners that don't
work the twenty hours or more

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.650
we'll have a resource available to them
if you can answer four questions

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.980
where you live what's your income level
do you have coverage to your employer

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.940
and you have any family members if you
can answer those four questions on this

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.620
website

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.670
it will take you directly to the
insurance marketplace where you can

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.569
enroll in coverage

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.440
so we're making that tool available to
partners who don't work the 20 hours

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.280
so we're actually making health care
tools or coverage available to

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.840
every Starbucks partner regardless. tell
them where to go again.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.030
