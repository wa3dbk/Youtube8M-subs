00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.589
Joe: Hey, it's Joe Crump.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.730
Welcome to my video series.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.500
This next question is from Kimberly Stancel.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.020
Actually, I've got a couple of questions here
but they're pretty much the same and I'm going

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.160
to read them both.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.370
She's from Virginia Beach, Virginia.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.800
She says,
Kimberly: "Here in my area, conventional real

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.740
estate sales are rather slow..."

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.359
(Welcome to the rest of the country.)

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.480
"...What would likely be the fastest way to
replace income with real estate investment

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.310
if one finds oneself with bad credit and then
suddenly is unemployed?"

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.330
Joe: Boy, you're in the same situation a lot
of people are.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.339
Here's another one.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.390
This one is from Ellie Nestergard.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.780
Ellie says,
Ellie: "I've only got one question.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.260
After closing my restaurant this spring, my
credit has taken a substantial nosedive.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.320
We're talking in as about to file bankruptcy.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.879
How does someone like me without a pot to
piss in even begin to think about getting

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.700
involved in this business?

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.100
It takes money to make money and I'm unbelievably
at the point where I thought I'd never be

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.850
- flat broke on my ass."

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.369
Joe: That's pretty frank.

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.689
First of all, I want to say I've been there
where both of you guys are and I know a lot

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.579
of other people that are listening to this
video are as well (I think I'm losing my voice

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.740
here).

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.219
I've been in a difficult situation.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.109
Back in 1991, when the last real estate crash
happened, I had 17 million dollars in real

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:44.109
estate, and when the market dropped 30% in
California (and its dropped 45% in California

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:49.530
this time) but when it dropped 30% in California
back then, I lost all of my properties.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.030
The bank came and took them all.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969
Joe: I moved back to Indiana.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.319
I moved in with my family.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.920
I was so happy to have that support group.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.789
We had a 30 day old baby and it was my just
my wife and I.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.869
We moved back in with my parents to be able
to get back on our feet.

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.219
I became a realtor.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.709
Joe: I had to figure out a way to do this
with no money, with no credit, with no way

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.080
to access any of those things like I did before,
and that's what I learned how to do - you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.510
don't need money to make money.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.880
As a matter of fact, if you can't make money
with no money, then you sure can't make money

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.200
with money.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.960
Learn how to make money without money.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.150
Learn how to pull yourself up by the bootstraps
and do these deals with zero down and no credit.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.830
Learn how to flip properties sand then how
to keep properties for the long term.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.700
Joe: These are the things that I teach: using
the subject-to, lease option, multi-mortgage,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.380
land contracts.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.930
These are the types of deals, the options
- these are the types of things that I teach

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.680
so that you can turn around and flip these
properties and make a lot of money in a fairly

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.570
short period of time.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.500
Joe: So, it didn't take me very long to get
back on my feet.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.630
I became a realtor, and I expect a lot of
you are going through this, too - I got really

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.630
discouraged.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.390
I felt less of myself.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.730
I felt that I just completely screwed up.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.760
And some of it was my fault because I didn't
have the knowledge - I didn't have somebody

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.980
telling me, don't do this and don't do that,
don't take that risk, etc.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.650
- I thought I was the golden child, I thought
I could do anything, because everything I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.430
touched turn to gold.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.310
Every deal that I did made money.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.220
Until the crash - until something came along
that I didn't have much control over.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.700
Joe: Although this time, in this crash that
we're experiencing right now, I didn't get

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.150
caught in it because I built my business a
completely different way.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.820
I did not get hurt.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.230
I haven't lost any money.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.290
As a matter of fact, my business is booming
because of this economy, and you can be taking

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.770
advantage of this economy too; you can be
doing this as well.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.250
Joe: You've just got to move forward.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.100
You've got to learn some of these techniques
that I'm teaching.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.460
Listen to all of these videos that I'm cranking
out here because I'm giving you the details;

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.320
I'm giving you the red meat here that you
can actually go out and use on a day to day

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320
basis.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.190
Joe: Now, if you want to get into more detail,
get into my mentor program or get the "Push

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.810
Button Method" or buy my book or do something
else.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.110
Or, if you don't like my techniques use somebody
else's because there's a lot of people that

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.070
have good information out there that you can
learn from.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.509
Joe: Don't be discouraged; move forward.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:40.479
Remember, the pain and the stuff that you're
going through now doesn't last forever.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.069
Your credit will come back (my credits perfect
now).

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.860
Your money will come back (I've got a lot
of money in the bank and I've got a lot of

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.080
properties and a lot of assets because I took
positive action - I did the things that I

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.629
needed to do).

00:04:53.629 --> 00:05:01.509
Joe: I feel for your situation because I've
been there personally and I wish you good

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:02.509
luck.

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.509
Good luck to you.

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:03.510
Thanks.
