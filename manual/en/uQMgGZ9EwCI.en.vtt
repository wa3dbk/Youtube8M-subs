00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.286
(foreboding music)

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:05.322
- Are you ready?

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:05.866
- Yeah!

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:06.921
- What is this we are making?

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:10.910
- This is a Kim Jong Un nuclear bomb shot.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.635
I am putting this Big Mac into a blender.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:15.562
- (Skyy) Exactly, Big Mac.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.835
- Fries.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.100
Pew! Pew! Pew!

00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:23.186
A death sauce!

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.394
- (Skyy) Is that Korean BBQ Sauce?

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:28.000
(laughter)

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.505
- (Skyy) Half an apple pie, okay?

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:34.422
Because we are using the
other half for something else.

00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:38.791
Now we need to hit that
with some of our milkshake.

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:39.855
- (Nikki) This is for all the people

00:00:39.855 --> 00:00:42.472
with lactose intolerance.

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:45.741
- (Skyy) Get in some more.

00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:46.408
Okay, that's good.

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:48.700
- Okay, finally!

00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:51.229
How much?

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.913
- (Skyy) I'll tell you when to stop.

00:00:56.725 --> 00:00:58.970
Okay, right there, that's good.

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:03.075
- Here it goes.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.354
(blender runs)

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.237
- It looks really gross.

00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:29.330
It smells disgusting!

00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:34.753
- (Skyy) Okay.

00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:36.084
- It smells so gross.

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:37.727
- (Skyy) What I need you to do,

00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:39.573
pour this into this cloth.

00:01:39.573 --> 00:01:42.543
We can use this cloth as
our little strainer, okay.

00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:44.072
- (Nikki) Looks like
something a cat threw up.

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:48.188
This is exactly what my
cat's throw up looks like.

00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:48.750
- (Skyy) You think so?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.461
- (Nikki) Yes, I know so.

00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:52.414
I cleaned that up before.

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:53.494
- (Skyy) Okay, that's
enough, that's enough.

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:55.300
- (Nikki) Oh my god,
it smells worse though.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.158
- So get the liquid out of this, alright.

00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:01.365
- Eww!!!

00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:04.111
Eww, its got its own liquid.

00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:06.192
That's not liquid.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.381
- (Skyy) It's liquidy.

00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.007
Scoop it up and put some spoons in there.

00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:12.229
- Put some...- (Skyy) Yeah!

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.209
(Skyy) More than that, man.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.907
Pick up the whole bowl and turn it.

00:02:15.907 --> 00:02:18.873
- (Nikki) (fake crying)

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:21.304
My mom told me to go to college.

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:23.570
- (Skyy) Okay, that's good,
that's good, that's good.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.516
Let's just add in a bit more vodka.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:32.173
Make sure we keep it potent.

00:02:32.757 --> 00:02:34.130
Okay, good.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.886
Let's hit that with some Diet Coke.

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:44.125
Alright, perfect.

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:46.269
You know what to do.

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.113
Shake it up!

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.979
- Keep it sexy.

00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:55.634
If this leaks on me, I swear to God

00:02:55.812 --> 00:02:58.046
I'm going to kill someone.

00:02:58.604 --> 00:03:00.387
It will probably be Kim Jong-il

00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:02.501
Kim Jong Un.

00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:08.113
- (Skyy) Mmmhmm, and now
we garnish with what?

00:03:08.113 --> 00:03:09.637
- (Nikki) Apple pie!

00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:10.515
- (Skyy) That's right, homeboy.

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:12.423
We got a little apple pie on there.

00:03:12.423 --> 00:03:13.949
- (Nikki) It doesn't make it better, Skyy.

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.518
- (Skyy) I know.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.040
I had to take my hoodie off for this.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.612
Oh my god, the (mumbling)

00:03:19.612 --> 00:03:20.838
Oh, turn it hard.

00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:21.743
I can tell y'all something.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.028
Y'all might think we're pretending.

00:03:23.028 --> 00:03:27.800
This smells really really freaking bad.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.250
- It smells like diseases
and broken childhood dreams.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.621
- And there you have it!

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.620
The Kim Jung Un Nuclear Bomb!

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.129
Oh boy, this is real bad ass, okay.

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.291
This aint no light shot.

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:40.951
- Oh god.

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:41.589
- Ready?

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:42.578
- Eww, it's like eww.

00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:43.856
- Mine's soaked in it too.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.719
- Eww, I hate this, Skyy.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.765
- Nikki, are you ready?

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:49.721
Are you ready?

00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:50.656
The world is watching us.

00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:52.130
Come one, let's do this man!

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.429
You know Kim Jung is going
to see this video, right?

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:56.422
You know he's googling himself right now.

00:03:56.422 --> 00:03:59.383
- I hope he nuclear blows me
up after this shot because...

00:03:59.383 --> 00:04:00.190
- Okay, ready?

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.023
- I guess.

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:09.453
(laughter)

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.951
(gags)

00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:18.391
(laughter)

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.194
- (Nikki) Oh my god, eww!

00:04:48.145 --> 00:04:50.124
- Whoa!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.471
Dude, you've got to have a
competition with your friends

00:04:54.471 --> 00:04:56.978
to see which one of
them can hold that down.

00:04:56.978 --> 00:04:58.527
That shit's hard to go down.

00:04:58.527 --> 00:05:01.610
- It's going to be a nuclear
bomb in the toilet after.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.279
- Oh my god that bomb.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:04.158
You going to try it?

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:05.307
You won't try it?

00:05:05.307 --> 00:05:07.913
- Not after that!

00:05:07.983 --> 00:05:11.075
- Okay, hold on, hold on, okay.

00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:14.490
Come on Skyy, man the
fuck up man, come on.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.204
Come on, man!

00:05:16.204 --> 00:05:17.643
Be bad!

00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:18.489
- You too?

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:20.592
- This what you do, this what you do!

00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:24.709
Come one, come on babe, you can do this!

00:05:27.918 --> 00:05:29.418
Just get a little vodka.

00:05:29.418 --> 00:05:31.931
You gotta take vodka.

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:34.428
- I'm instagramming this.

00:05:34.904 --> 00:05:37.511
Swish your mouth with vodka first?

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:39.555
(swishing sounds)

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.011
America!

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:48.126
(laughter)

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:01.790
Oh my god!

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.570
Oh my god!

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.339
(gags)

00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:18.771
That's in the line of fire.

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:21.580
- Whoa!

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.604
Can you do it?

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.122
Tipsy Bartender, holy shit that...

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:30.502
