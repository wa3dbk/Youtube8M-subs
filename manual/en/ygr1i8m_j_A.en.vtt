00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:03.810
What music does is the first thing

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.950
Is it brings people together

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.580
It deals with emotions

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.632
Oddly enough people can connect to

00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:13.230
The spectrum of emotions we go through as,
as humans

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.350
Our music is about spreading good vibes

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.029
That knowing that in some little way

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.280
I was able to make their life a little better

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.600
That makes me really happy

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.680
Like I think that's kinda why we're here anyway

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.110
When you look at those fans

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.390
Those people that come to enjoy your music

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.390
Nothing else matters

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.279
I get so much joy from just performing

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.279
And being on the stage

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.820
We push eachother musically

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.360
They say that probably we were singing

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.620
Before we were speaking

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.510
It's a fundemental part of being a, a human
being

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.860
There's always room for someone

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.960
Who's kind of a dreamer

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.470
I mean I believe optimism is available to
everyone

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.850
It's really important to cultivate positivity

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.800
Because like begets like

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.750
I think optimism spreads

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.460
In the same way cynicism spreads

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.460
With optimism we say

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.579
Yeah we can change things

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.860
We, when we look at things with cynicism

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.350
We just say aw it's just the way it is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.150
It's contagious you gotta work to uh

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.809
Keep the good vibe alive

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.239
Which is why Life is good

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.239
Is such a powerful tool

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.979
I've always believed that I could do

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.369
What I wanted to do

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.229
Do what you love so that

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.229
You'll love what you do

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.229
You know what I mean?

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.450
And I think, I think you can

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.540
If you can approach the rest of your life

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060
Through that then that, that's powerful

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.430
And it's just, honestly, it's just

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.860
A better what to live

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830
You have the power to sort of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.160
Pass on that, like, optimism

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.100
And that encouragement to the kids

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.960
It's priceless to have people like that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.960
To look up to and to kind of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.439
Try to follow in their footsteps

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.620
A playmaker is anyone's who's doin'

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.650
Whatever they can to give back

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.210
With whatever skills that you've got

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.490
My playmakers would be my parents

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.170
They have not stopped in

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.830
The last twenty years being at everything

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.360
Always being their when I'm like

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.979
Nervous why I didn't go be a doctor

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.159
Someone that influenced me in my life

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.159
Is my grandma, she supported me

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.159
With singing and performing

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.340
As I've gone out into the world

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.799
I meet playmakers everyday

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.070
Someone who helps you imagine

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.320
Someone who helps you create

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.560
People who are doing whatever they can

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.710
With what they can

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.470
Encouraging play is one of the most important

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.049
Things we can do for children

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.049
But also as adults

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.380
I think the more you can play

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.290
That the more enriched your life will be

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.340
Play, play is in

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.479
I mean play is the reason why

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.479
Why we all live

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.479
Playing with the kids is the best

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.409
Kids, it's all about the simplicity

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.510
And just the, yeah, the seeing

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.930
Wonder in the most mundane and simple of situations

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.770
Want to know what I do for play?

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.349
Fish, it was this big

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.940
I caught a striper in New York on the beach

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.739
Hey it was big as me

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.959
Hey, we're the Fresh Beat Band

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.720
And Life is good

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.720
Life is good

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.720
Life is good

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.720
Life is good

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.720
Life

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720
Life is good

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.720
Guess what?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.279
Life is good
