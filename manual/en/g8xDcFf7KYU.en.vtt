Bonus Fact #1: In addition to "father of cyberpunk" William Gibson, the author of this mod also drew inspiration from hard-boiled detective noir authors like Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:03:23.300
Bonus Fact #2: In the Shadowrun setting, magic has returned to a dystopian world driven by cyber technology. Shadowrunners like your character live in the cracks between the megacorporations and criminal organization that run the world.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:04:05.600
Bonus Fact #3: The creator of Nightmare Harvest did not have much previous scripting experience, and approached this mod with a primary focus on writing a good story.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:54.600
Bonus Fact #4: Relying on AI to control your companions makes the frequent AI glitches a big nuisance. You can reset them by hitting F1 and typing "clearCache" - but be warned! This will crash your game. It'll be fixed when you restart.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:47.000
Bonus Fact #5: Like the mod author's writing? You can find more of it on his blog: kylestephenfrancis.com. Nothing says "I loved your Shadowrun mod" like a good cyberstalking. &lt;3

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:39.500
Bonus Facts #6: The Dragonfall expansion not only brings tech upgrades but its own stand-alone story, so it's also worth keeping in mind if the core Shadowrun Returns didn't sate you.
