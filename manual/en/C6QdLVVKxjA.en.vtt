&gt;&gt; Hilah: Hey dudes!

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.020
I am Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I’ve
got a last minute Valentine’s Day surprise

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.010
for you, a vodka cherry limeade cocktail.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.760
I’ve gotten a few requests for more cocktails
and like I do not pretend to be a bartendress

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.090
or a bartender, or a bar firmer, but this
vodka cherry limeade is really good and you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.960
know, whatever nothing says love like vodka
right?

[Vodka Cherry Limeade]

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.639
&gt;&gt; Hilah: Okay, so the first thing we want
to put our vodka in.

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:36.770
I have got some ice in my shaker here, and
if you don’t have a shaker you could totally

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.659
just do this in a glass with some ice, or
dispense with the cocktail altogether and

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.429
just drink vodka because you’re all alone
on Valentine’s Day.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.860
Okay, then I’ve got some straight-up cherry
juice.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.769
This is the juice of virgin cherries right
here.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.729
Okay, and then some lime juice.

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:11.210
Let’s see how much I can get out of this
mangy old lime.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.240
Perfecto!

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.920
And then some sweetened lime juice if you
don’t have this, I mean just, you can buy

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.670
this whatever, I’ve had this in my fridge
for probably 10 years.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.670
But you can find it easily.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.759
If you don’t want to buy it though, you
can totally just make some simple syrup.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.270
It’s just equal parts sugar and water cooked
over a medium heat until the sugar dissolves,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.060
and then you cool it off.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.340
Easy sleazy!

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.590
So, shake it.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.390
And before I pour it I have a special surprise,
hold on.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.740
Okay, I found this little heart-shaped silicone,
ice cube mold, so I made some little cherry

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.689
ice cubes with just like freeze some water,
add a cherry once it’s frozen, and then

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.143
add some more whatever, and whatever, and
I made some with grenadine just for the color.

00:02:00.143 --> 00:02:06.460
I really hate how grenadine tastes, but anyway
it’s cute, heart-shaped, blah blah.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.489
Oh, and then you can see the little cherries
floating around in there.

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.790
I am going to add a couple of little like
green, bloop!

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.060
And then I’ve got you know, a couple of
those guys, bloop!

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.060
Yay!

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.060
There you go.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.640
It’s a little Valentine’s cherry vodka
limeade cocktail for you and your sweet or

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640
just for you.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.200
It just depends on your plans that night.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.239
Mmmmmmm!

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.280
Delightful!

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.319
Refreshing.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.760
I love that cherry juice in there, so there
you go.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.091
I hope that tides you over, all you drunkards
and hobos out there, but have a great weekend!

00:02:46.091 --> 00:03:03.099
If you have any questions, leave them below
in the comments, and I will see 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.040
you guys next week!

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
Bye!
