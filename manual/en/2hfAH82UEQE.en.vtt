00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760
 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.220
SPEAKER: Time for any
cyclist is crucial.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.290
Obligations can become obstacles
during critical training

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.079
periods.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.260
This year, Mark Cavendish has
balanced a rigorous training

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.470
schedule while developing and
releasing his name Cavendish

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.386
collection.

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:25.760
MARK CAVENDISH: The Cavendish
brand stands for everything

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.780
that I stand for a.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.380
You look at the bikes.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.338
You look at the helmet.

00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:30.510
You look at the apparel
and the attention

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.490
to detail to make me perform
to perfection or the closest

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.370
perfection that I can, you know?

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.380
SPEAKER: The event marks the
first time Specialized has ever

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.570
designed an entire
rider-specific product line,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.830
and moves Cavendish into
an elite group of athletes

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.040
with their own signature
brand of product.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.350
MARK CAVENDISH: Every
single bit I really

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.797
pushed to how I wanted it.

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:54.630
It's not just putting
my name to it, really.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.960
I had a part of
the design process

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.810
and I'm so happy
with the results.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.510
We wanted the
design of every item

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.760
to be explained through
its performance, you know?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.050
The speed, the feel,
the performance of it,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.440
to do all the talking for it.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.205
So it was very understated.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:11.580
SPEAKER: Cavendish
has become one

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.020
of the most popular
cyclists in the sport.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.050
And with that comes managing
those responsibilities

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.550
and the intense preparation for
the year's most important race.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:31.280
 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.370
With the Tour de
France drawing near,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.740
team Astana has come
to Ypres to study

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.350
one of the most critical
sections of the upcoming race.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.090
JAKOB FUGLSANG: We have
to do the reconnaisation

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.686
of the fifth state of the tour.

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:48.480
We are going to check
it out, see how it is.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.632
 

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:53.215
SPEAKER: This year,
the Tour de France

00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:56.120
will contain nine sectors
of cobbles, on the route

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.650
from Ypres to Arenberg.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.120
The team is here to
scout their routes

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.289
and test their equipment
on the difficult terrain.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.330
SPEAKER 2: It's not easy.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.750
And also, none of
us are specialists

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.039
in riding cobblestone.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.250
So we stay good
together and everybody

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.550
seems to get along quite
OK with the cobbles.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.250
SPEAKER: After starting the
season as one of the favorites,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.410
Vincenzo Nibali has
yet to podium in 2014.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.730
Still, the Italian rider
has started slow in the past

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.050
and looks to focus on excellent
results at the Tour de France.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.852
 

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.310
VINCENZO NIBALI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:46.839
 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.255
SPEAKER 2: It's
going to be tough.

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:49.480
I think everybody knows that.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.140
And it's going to
be a harsh stage.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.680
It's going to be 150 kilometers
of fighting probably.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:04.658
 

00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:06.910
SPEAKER: For all cycling
teams, the pressure

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.370
builds as they get closer
to the Tour de France.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.830
Teams look to fine-tune
their approach

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.190
and exhaust every possible
way to improve their program.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.110
 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.650
Mark Cavendish and
Omega Pharma Quick-Step

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.950
have come to the
specialized wind tunnel

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.730
to work on their lead
out train and figure out

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.726
the best possible way to
put Cavendish in position

00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:31.225
to finish.

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:34.340
 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.660
Nibali is also pushing for
more improvements as well as he

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.400
becomes accustomed
with his new rider

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.972
first engineered--
S-Works Tarmac.

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:43.430
VINCENZO NIBALI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.810
 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.440
SPEAKER: Among the
improvements to the new tarmac

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.620
are a comprehensive
design that provides

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.570
more complete performance
across all spectrums,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.400
particularly descending
and climbing.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.530
SPEAKER 3: The stiffness
is-- you can feel it.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.320
It's much more in front so
you can drive it better.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.490
SPEAKER 4: The weight
transfers better, more secure

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.685
and tighter.

00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:11.750
You can feel the
bike under your--

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.700
 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.095
SPEAKER: For all the riders,
the moment of truth is looming,

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:26.015
and soon they will know if
all the training, the testing,

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.696
the equipment, the research,
and the competition

00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:33.993
will end in the sport's
most coveted prize.

00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:49.238
