00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.090
Male 1: We're going to learn how to play the
Muffled Slap on the Djembe.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.840
This is not as common, but sometimes it's
used with the bass Djembe parts, or the soloists

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.180
can use it to embellish what they're playing
on the lead parts.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.360
My drum I have here is a low tune drum.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.619
It's a bass Djembe.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.550
So it's low.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.860
Bimba.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.110
Bimba: This is the solo Djembe.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.060
Male 1: That's the solo Djembe.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.380
So a Muffled Slap is like a closed slap.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.970
And the way we do that is by keeping our hand
against the skin of the drum.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.430
You'll see my thumb is out of the way.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.950
And I slide my hand all the way up, until
my pinky knuckle lines up with the rim.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.250
And I also make sure that there's one space
for the right, one space for the left.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.130
If you find that your hands are covering the
same space, either your technique is faulty,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.500
or your drum is too small.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.030
So the Muffled Slap chokes the drum like this.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:26.110
And sometimes, you put your other hand to
even make it tighter like this.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.190
Sounds different on Bimba's drum.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.380
Bimba: Because my Djembe is a solo Djembe,
very high.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.479
So my Muffle is a little different, because
as soon as I use it, you can hear how high

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.140
the drum is done.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.080
See?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.020
See?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.320
No different Muffle.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.549
Different one.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.299
Another one.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.299
Yet another one.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.330
You got a this one.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.670
So you got three different muffles.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:08.060
The longer you been playing the Djembe the
longer you got to hold that technique.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.400
Male 1: That's how you play the Muffled Slap
on the Djembe.
