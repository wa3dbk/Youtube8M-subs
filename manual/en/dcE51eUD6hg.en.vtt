Hi, I’m Jim from Zoar Outdoor on behalf
of expertvillage.com. In this segment we’re

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.269
going to be talking about fishing gear and
especially fly fishing. It is important to

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.200
protect your rods, after all they’re a valuable
investment and something that you can be able

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.699
to use for most of your life. I’ve had this
particular rod for example for 20 years. So

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.189
some fly rod manufacturers will provide a
case with the rod, just as you can see here.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.570
But if you have an entry level rod that, for
example an inexpensive fiberglass rod that

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.090
didn’t come with its own protective case,
just go on down to your hardware store and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.750
get a cap and some PVC tubing and you can
setup our own protective case, and believe

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.630
me these are great, you can drive a truck
over these babies and it’ll protect your

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.500
rod. Other options and by the way you can
get them in different lengths, of course depending

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.300
on the length of your fly rods, so this is
a nice 2 piece setup, where this is for a

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.020
4 or 5 piece setup. Other options such as
made by Orvis, it’s a delightful little

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.140
rig, probably no longer made but allow you
to put in a couple of different fly rods and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.109
equipment and put your other fishing gear
inside here so that you have a convenient

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.649
carry system for your gear. If you’re going
out in a boat or if you want something that

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.290
you can use in a big hurry, this kind of a
unit, which is available from places like

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.049
Cabelas or Orvis or William Joseph or any
number of other manufacturers, is a wonderful

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.290
thing to have. You can have a strong fly rod
all set to fish, but it’s protective in

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.369
a PVC tubing that includes the fly rod as
well. If you’re going out in a situation

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.030
where you might be using more than one fly
rod for example, a floating line and a sink

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.780
tip line, you can get a side by unit. These
work really well to protect, it’s got the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.260
PVC on both sides and it’s got the protective
padding for your reel. I use this all the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.170
time when I’m guiding so we can switch back
and forth between different techniques, such

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.040
as fishing for rising trout with a dry fly,
or for floating through a section where there

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.530
aren’t rising trout, we can use the sinking
line with a streamer or a nymphs or a wet

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.330
fly. So this is really convenient, and it
gives you great protection which is essential

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.140
for your great gear.
