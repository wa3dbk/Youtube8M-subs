and needs very few ingredients, you can just

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:27.430

at ingredients one by one.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.760
For Mayonnaise Veg Sandwich you need 3 slices
of Bread, Tomato Ketchup, Butter, Sliced Tomatoes,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.090
Sliced Cucumber, two tsp Mayonnaise and Chat
Masala.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:57.879
Now I am going to remove edges of Bread Slices,
you will need sharp knife, bread is ready

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.070
so now I am going to make our first side ready.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:22.270
Apply little butter on bread slice, little
bit chat masala, put the slices of tomatoes,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:50.460
again sprinkle some chat masala, on other
slice of bread apply mayonnaise, put this

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:04.930
bread on to the top of the tomatoes, again
apply some mayonnaise on it, apply some tomato

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:26.520
ketchup on it, little bit chat masala, slices
of Cucumber, apply some butter on third slice

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:43.590
little a bit, some tomato ketchup, put little
chat masala on cucumbers, put third bread

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.390

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.980
So this is it my simple, easy and delicious
Mayonnaise Veg Sandwich ready to serve.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.140
You can also add shredded cheese in it if
you need but according to me if you have good

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.440
quality cheese then and then only otherwise
avoid the cheese.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.900
Now I am going to slice my sandwich, first
a fall press it with knife so we can cut it

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:42.940
perfectly, from the centre I am going to divide
it into two parts, do it gently otherwise

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.980
you will destroy your sandwich, see it's ready,
wow it's looking very nice and beautiful,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:04:00.390
put it at the centre of serving plate, serve
it with the tomato ketchup or chutney of your

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.040
choice, so my very easy, simple and delicious
Mayonnaise Veg Sandwich is ready to serve.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:16.540
Wow it is 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:32.750
so delicious seriously because of Mayonnaise
and chat masala, I donâ€™t have this kind

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.449
of sandwich in my life ever before this because
usually they use chat masala and butter in

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:46.900
the veg sandwich but I have used mayonnaise
in it little bit to it, I love the crunchiness

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:56.419
of cucumber and tomato in it, it is little
sour but really very good in taste, you can

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:06.259
add lettuce and cheese if you want it is also
good with this sandwich but I don't like cheese

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.270
in roast sandwich, I just only like cheese
in roasted or guild sandwich.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.830
