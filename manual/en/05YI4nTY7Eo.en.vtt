00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.529
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we have some special visitors coming in. As you have seen before

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.539
we have our special group of true leaders and they have a really important lesson

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.220
that they would like to share with you today, having to do with our

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.319
anti-bullying program, Not In Our Town." " Do you guys see a lot of bullying here in the fourth grade?" "Yes."

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.969
"I was the bullied in fifth grade

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.210
and it was really difficult for me.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.500
I had a lot of trouble that year. You're always looking over your shoulder making sure no one's there.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.270
You're just

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.670
You're always scared, you don't know, they could do it anytime,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.570
lunch, P.E., even in class. You just don't know when it's going to happen.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.339
Did someone want to share how they've seen it before?

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.089
Yes, you in the back." "This little kid was calling this girl names

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.960
and throwing blue chips at her

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.350
and he was calling her names everyday

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.280
and just being mean." "Did you do anything when you saw it happen?"

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.680
"I told the lady and he got in trouble." "Good job."

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.530
"Our goal here today is to show you guys how to be an active

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.490
bystander instead of being a passive bystander.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.980
Another way of calling an active
bystander is an

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.190
upstander because they are standing up for
something or someone."

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.370
"To be an active bystander

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.200
you could tell someone like your teacher,
you could support the victim,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.180
and you could intervene, meaning telling the bully to stop."

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.530
"Who can you tell when

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.750
you're telling someone? So who can you come up to and tell?"
"You can tell

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.170
your teacher or you can
tell a true leader like you guys."

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.000
"How can you help support the victim?"

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.080
"You can be their friend." "When we're
talking about intervening

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.649
what does that mean? What is the word
intervene?"

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.000
"To stop the bully from

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.330
being mean to the person that's being bullied

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.530
and just help out the person that was being
bullied." "What are some ways that you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.420
could intervene?"

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.400
"Go up to them and tell them to stop."

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.360
"You could go tell one of your friends and they could come and help you stop the bully."

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.380
"You can tell anyone on campus, that's older."

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.780
"Okay, so you can tell an older person.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.549
I want three volunteers to come up here
and show me

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.910
ways that they can be bullies, victims, and bystanders.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.400
Okay, so Im going to let you three

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.170
act out one way you could tell someone by reporting it."

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.570
"Hey you, give me that ball." "Why should I?" "Cause I want that ball."

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.780
"It's my ball." "Who cares?" "I had it first." "I don't really..." "That's her ball.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.030
Sorry, you're going to have to go find another ball."

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.060
"You're a loser, you don't have any friends. You probably have imaginary friends don't you?"

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.350
"Hey just leave her alone and stop bugging her. You need to stop being mean."

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.450
"Okay."

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.950
"You're not good at anything. You can't kick a soccer ball or play baseball or throw a basketball or anything."

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.520
"Yes I can." "You're not good at anything."

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.040
"Stop calling her names Carter. Come on Megan let's go play."

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.050
"That was good because he went up to her and asked her to be his friend,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.050
instead of just her being all alone. So good
job everybody.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.050
Does anybody have any questions that they'd like to ask?"

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.420
"Where does bullying mostly happen?"

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.910
"Well, where do you guys think it mostly
happens?" "Sometimes on the bus there's a lot of bullying."

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.000
"Okay good." "What do you do if you try to intervene

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.570
and the bully starts bullying you?"

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.020
"That's a really good question and

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.770
when you do that you just say hey knock
it off that's not what I'm here to do, I was trying to

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.340
stop them and then you can go get someone to help them."

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.400
"Going through this program, being a true leader, it changed me.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.850
It made me stronger mentally.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.140
Now I know how to handle bullying and I know how to handle it when someone's getting bullied.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.520
Okay, so I hope this lesson day has taught everybody something

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.480
Has everybody learned something today?" "Yes." "Okay."
