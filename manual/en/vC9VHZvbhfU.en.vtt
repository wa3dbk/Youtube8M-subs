00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.010
Noise is the most common complaint which members
have about their washing machine.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.080
And if your machine is unusually loud.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.960
There are three easy steps we can all take
to make our machines quieter.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.140
First things first, unplug your washing machine
before doing any sort of maintenance.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.360
First place to start is at the washing machines
feet.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.369
These all should be unscrewed and firmly in
contact with the floor.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.079
if the feet are not thoroughly deployed, the
machine can really move about, especially

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.350
during the spin cycle, which can create a
lot of noise.To deploy the feet, undo the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.600
locking nut and then unscrew the foot until
it's in firm contact with the floor.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.710
To make sure the machine is level, use a spirit
level, and adjust the feet as necessary.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.420
Once you're happy your washing machine is
level, remember to screw the locking nuts

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.059
back into place before you start.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.249
Washing heavy items like this cotton towel,
by itself or with other lighter garments,

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.860
can unbalance your load and cause excessive
noise within your machine.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.640
Some washing machines like this one should
be able to detect if there is a unbalanced

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.970
load in the machine.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570
And will stop the machine from entering the
spin cycle.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.830
older machines, may not have the capability
to do this.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.510
And could end up cutting out part way through
your spin cycle If your machine is still excessively

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.650
loud, it's time to check the drum bearings.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.140
Once your washing machine has been emptied
of clothes, give the drum a turn by hand.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.520
If you come across much resistance, it's an
indicator that the drum bearings might have

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.520
failed.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.710
If the drum bearings have gone, you may find
that the drum no longer lines up with the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170
seal.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.480
