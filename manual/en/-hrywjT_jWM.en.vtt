00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.030
Rotating behind me is Jaguar's new XF Sportbrake.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.440
Now Jaguar saying that this is the most versatile
Jaguar that they've made, which is a bit of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.470
a given considering that it's the only xx
currently available in the range.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.890
Don't be fooled by the words essentially it's
just Jaguar's fancy word for a state car,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.970
and it just means it maintains some of the
sporty and handling characteristics of the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.470
XS Saloon.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.670
Jaguar says that this car is totally new,
from the B-Pillar back.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.610
So that's the pillar just behind the front
window.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.210
And that means it's got new doors, new windows
and a new roof and the tail gate is made from

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.690
a light weight composite material just to
keep weight down so it can match the excess

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.120
[xx] for driving characteristics.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.949
Sportbrake also gets a few nice handy little
features, like when you have a tow bar, actually

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.350
activates electronic stability control and
traction control systems which stop the kind

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.390
of whatever you're towing snaking the car
at the back, which is quite a nice advantage

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.730
to have, because this might be something you
would use to tow a caravan or a trailer, or

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.680
something like that But converting the XF
into an estate is all about practicality,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.729
and there's quite a lot of it.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.700
The new designed roof means that there's five
centimeters extra head room in the back for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.700
the rear passengers.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.610
There's also a 550 liter boot, which isn't
quite on a par with rivals like the BMW 5

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.509
series, Audi A-6 and the Mercedes E-Class
estate.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.539
However, when the seats are folded flat, it's
got 1,675 liters of boot space, which is pretty

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:30.539
good.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.729
Still not as good as the E class, but compared
to the rivals Its decent.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.759
From launch there will be two engines available
the 2.2 diesel and the 3 liter B6 3 L twin

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.400
turbo diesel.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.840
Now you'll be able to get from around November
prices should start around 32,000 pounds.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.899

other cars launched at the Geneva Motor Show,
