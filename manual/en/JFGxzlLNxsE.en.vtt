Hi, I am Tonya Zavasta, the author of seven
books on natural health and beauty. Today

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.820
I want to talk to you about alternatives to
Botox. I would like to share with you how

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:27.390
I keep wrinkles at bay. Get some of that paper
first-aid tape. You can find in every drugstore.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.780
After applying your night cream, place about
a two-inch strip on the forehead, an inch

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.410
and a half strip on your brow crease, on the
crows feet, at the corners of your eyes, on your

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.480
cheek lines and on any other wrinkles you
would like to smooth. Wear this tape for a

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.540
couple of hours, or overnight if you choose.
At first, to avoid redness

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.680
you might want to apply some Vaseline under
the tape. But soon, your skin will adjust

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.149
and will not show any sign of irritation.
You will have to get creative on when to use it.

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:12.580
Your hubby invariably will leap when he
sees you looking like a mummy; but most men

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.180
will understand with time. Use this technique
daily and you will be very pleased with the results.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.659
A little odd, but it works!

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.030
Now, back to Botox for a moment. Botox,
at least for me, is unacceptable, because

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.530
it means deliberately bringing toxins into
the body. But Botox isn’t the only offender.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.939
It may sound strange, but consuming food that
has been fried, baked, boiled, cooked in any

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.880
manner introduces a host of toxic substances
into the body.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.759
To slow down aging—wrinkling in particular,
include more raw foods in your diet. Beauty

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.899
comes from within. And what we put into our
bodies is reflected on the outside, in our

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.100
appearance. Eating raw foods will dramatically
improve your complexion.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.109
Visit my website where you can find many delicious
raw food recipes you can start using right

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:18.059
