Hi I'm Howard from the Mr. Food Test Kitchen

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.530
and today I wanna show you how to make the
best eggnog.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.680
And it's perfect around the holidays!

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.330
All we do is we're gonna take 4 cups of
milk and we'll just pour that in like this.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.259
And we'll just put on the heat so we can get
this heating up.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.760
Wrong one...

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.760
Okay.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.740
And now we're gonna add some whole cloves.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.710
Now the nice thing about these cloves is they
have a ton of flavor.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.970
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna simmer
this, and when the flavor is in our milk mixture,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.960
we'll strain it later so we'll get all that
goodness right in there.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.030
Now we're gonna add some ground cinnamon.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.380
We can also add some fresh cinnamon if you'd
like, some cinnamon sticks.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.649
It's not really fresh, but it's dry, some
cinnamon sticks.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.320
And again, that can simmer so you get that
flavor and we're gonna add a little bit of

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.670
vanilla.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.019
Mmmm!

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.800
And we're gonna let that just come to a simmer,
not--you don't want it to boil, you want it

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.890
to simmer.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.090
And then while that's doing its thing, we're
gonna beat together some egg yolks with a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.280
cup and a half of sugar.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880
Sounds like a lot, but we're making a bunch
'cause this is for a party.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.170
We're gonna whisk this together,
until it starts to get creamy and almost light.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.100
You really incorporate the sugar into this.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.000
A little elbow grease never hurt anybody.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.479
Oh that's lookin' real nice.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.230
Okay, and now that our milk mixture warmed
up--let me turn the heat off.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.380
And we're gonna just take this, and slowly--this
is real important here--just to slowly just

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.869
add a little bit of the milk at a time.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.170
Because you don't wanna cook the eggs.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.789
Again, I really wanna emphasize, do this slowly.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.689
You can see it's coming together real nicely.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.010
And you can see the cloves and the cinnamon,
but that's okay because we're gonna strain

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.870
this so we'll get all that flavor but we'll
strain out those pieces.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.550
MmmM!

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.440
Smells amazing!

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.390
Okay, you can pick up the pace a little bit
after you get the initial in because like

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.140
I said you don't wanna cook the eggs 'cause
the hot milk would cook the eggs otherwise.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.110
We'll slowly get this in here.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.610
Mmm!

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.620
Alright, so now that we have this done and
it's well incorporated, it's nice and smooth

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.500
and silky and we incorporated the eggs and
the milk, the vanilla.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.660
We're gonna pour it back into the saucepan.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.410
Mmmm!

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.900
We go that in there, so now what we're gonna
do, we're gonna put this on low.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.950
And we just wanna let this simmer for about
five minutes.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.200
And it's gonna thicken up, nice and rich, and
then we'll just add a little bit more cream,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.310
strain it, and we're ready!

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.350
Alright, it thickened up, and take it off
the heat.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.110
And we'll slowly pour it through the strainer.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.150
Oh my gosh, this smells amazing!

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:29.100
We set this in the sink and we have a little
bit of cloves in there.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.240
Strain those right out.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.811
And now what we're gonna do, we're gonna add
a little bit, gotta get my whisk again, we're

00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:41.160
just gonna stir in a little bit of half and
half.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.110
Again if you wanna get super decadent you
can always go with full-fledged heavy cream.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.530
But again, we wanna slowly stir this in.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.740
Mmm!

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.750
Now we can just chill this up and it will
be ready to serve if we wanna go for the entire

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.890
family but if we wanna make it a little bit
more adult-friendly we could say, we can  just add

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.940
a little bit of rum--spiced rum would work
great, plain rum, really whatever you have.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.940
Or, some brandy.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.780
I'm gonna add brandy 'cause that's a little
bit more traditional.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.160
We're gonna add about two cups...

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.769
Merry Christmas!

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.860
So, we add that and this will go in the fridge
to chill up.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.590
And we're gonna be havin' lots mugfuls of,

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.810
"OOH IT'S SO GOOD!!Â®"
