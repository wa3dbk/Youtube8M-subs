00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:08.502
(fun music)

00:00:08.502 --> 00:00:10.383
- This morning, we're
setting off from Melbourne

00:00:10.383 --> 00:00:11.567
on a two day trip

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:15.513
to see the Great Ocean
Road and Phillip Island.

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:18.233
(fun music)

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.787
Just outside of Melbourne,
is one of the most famous

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:25.400
and scenic coastlines in the
world, the Great Ocean Road.

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:27.240
Oh my!

00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:30.119
The Twelve Apostles are
created by natural erosion,

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.021
the waves coming up and crashing

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:34.722
against these limestone structures.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.742
They're just sticking
right out of the water,

00:00:36.742 --> 00:00:40.364
like skyscrapers of sorts.

00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:43.429
When you walk down here to Loch
Ard Gorge, it's so dramatic.

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.890
You're surrounded by these steep cliffs.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.348
The water is this turquoise-blue
and you can't help but just

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:54.244
take your shoes off and feel
the sand between your toes.

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:59.003
(fun music)

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.632
The Cape Otway Lightstation is the oldest

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:04.163
surviving lighthouse on Mainland Australia

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:07.250
and it's been in continuous
operation since 1848.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.001
The view up here is stunning.

00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:13.660
We have time for a break for lunch.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.470
We have this incredible
view of the lighthouse.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.039
It's a delicious goodie.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.949
(fun music)

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:27.072
Day two is officially underway.

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:29.464
We're on the ferry, making
our way to Phillip Island

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.670
to see some of the best it has to offer

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.730
including the penguin parade.

00:01:35.943 --> 00:01:37.290
If you have a sweet tooth,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.981
the Phillip Island Chocolate
Factory is the place for you.

00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.280
Woah!

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.229
Everything here is made of
chocolate and it's interactive.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.551
This may just be my favorite museum ever.

00:01:51.628 --> 00:01:53.984
Churchill Island is right
next to Phillip Island

00:01:53.984 --> 00:01:58.521
and it has a working farm and
homestead from the 1800's.

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:02.938
The Moonlit Sanctuary is home
to some of the most famous

00:02:02.938 --> 00:02:06.214
creatures of Australia and
plays an important role

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:09.323
in the preservation of some
of its endangered species.

00:02:09.323 --> 00:02:13.237
Hi! Oh my goodness, you're
a hungry little fella!

00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:16.947
It's the last stop of the
day and it's time to see

00:02:16.947 --> 00:02:18.939
the world famous penguin parade.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.769
(penguins braying)

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.976
The penguins wait til dusk
to come out of the water

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:28.258
because the darkness protects
them from predators up above.

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:31.031
Here they come, just walking
up next to the boardwalk.

00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:32.932
We're so close to them!

00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:37.253
This has been an unforgettable two days,

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:38.902
driving down the Great Ocean Road

00:02:38.902 --> 00:02:40.202
and seeing the Twelve Apostles

00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:44.591
and then Phillip Island and
all of its incredible wildlife.

00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:47.168
This is an absolute must
when visiting Australia.

00:02:47.168 --> 00:02:50.854
(fun music)
