We don't have to open it.

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:41.540

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.620
There is also some text about the music.

00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:04.680

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:24.740
What's that mini book?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's about the content and about how much they like us, 
 and that they are glad that we have bought it.

00:02:39.976 --> 00:02:41.980
Artbook!

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.550
Let's get back to the art book. You've skipped it.

00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:47.200
I wanted to show it in the end.

00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:50.260
Here you are.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.240

-Yeap, filming.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.800
At the end... the sketches.

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.610
And our favourite monkeys.

00:03:17.527 --> 00:03:19.530
Those are mobs, right?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.500
Yeah, yeah, there is a dungeon with those. They drink a lot.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.900
You remember the name of that dung?

00:03:33.688 --> 00:03:44.690
Mmm nope but it is in a brewery. Yeah, there 
 were overgrown rabbits on drugs and monkeys with ADHD.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.800
-Right, one of the first quests is about taking back vegetables from those monkeys?
-Yeah

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:56.410

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:51.540
The most important thing is to start it well.

00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:54.940
Boss is going to kill us for that.

00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:00.050

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.200

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.400
Is there any content desrciption of that box you have in your hands right now? It should 
 be on the back.
As far as i know there should be something about the soundtrack.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.150
