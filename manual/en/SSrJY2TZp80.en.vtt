00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.559
Frank Jacobs: On this Xeikon Three Thousand
Five Hundred, we are currently producing a

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.840
chocolate box. On the unwinder, an image web
cleaner is installed, this takes away the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.699
paper dust from the substrate. This Xeikon
Three Thousand Five Hundred prints in five

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.070
colors, CMYK plus what we call our super black.
It is also equipped with the Alpine Fuser

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.060
Drum, especially designed to handle the folding
carton substrates.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.170
Directly behind the press we have the web
varnishing module, which applies a spot varnish

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.660
supplied by Actega. In this case it is a spot
varnish that is food-safe, it is of the water-based

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.539
type. Then we cut the substrate into sheets,
blank or test sheets will be rejected by the

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.199
waste separator and then the sheets will be
piled in the pile high stacker. The pile will

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.439
be brought to the device from Kurz, the DM-liner.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.612
Sonja Steffl: We need the Xeikon machines,

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:11.960
the digital printers, before our process because
all the areas which were pre-printed in black

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.780
are going to be folded afterwards. And the
foil only adheres to the pre-printed areas

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.280
which you can see here.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.060
Frank Jacobs: After this step, Bograma will

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.580
cut these sheets into ready to fold cartons.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.860
Stefan Buchi: With the flexible die tool technology

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.830
we have very fast settle times. Because we
are having two magnetic cylinders, so we can

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.189
use male and female dies, you just have to
put the dies on, there is no shifting, nothing

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.450
you need to do, cutting and creasing is included
and then you can run the machine already on

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.770
that.
First of all we have an alignment table to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.469
set the paper in the right direction sideways.
Then we have a positioning roller, which detects

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.469
the exact sheet position to the cylinder position
and speeds up or slows down the paper. At

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.130
the end of the machine we deliver the cutted
products, together with the mace matrix and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.390
at the end of the machine we separate the
mace matrix from the products and running

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.390
on a delivery.
