Welcome to Tower Dental TV. I am joined by Dr. Flaviu Oltean, owner of Tower Dental

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.610
a family and cosmetic dentist in Aurora
Colorado located near Buckley

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.920
Air Force base.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.970
Dr. Oltean, tell us, where exactly is Tower Dental located?

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.119
We are located at the corner of Mississippi Avenue and Tower Roads, at

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.189
1155 S. Tower Road

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.989
Right next to the Navy Federal Union and across the street from

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.220
Buckley Air Force base.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.280
Sounds like a great location near the air
force base.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.510
What specific types of insurance do you offer? Is there any insurance that you offer

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.580
that is a bit unique?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.800
Well, excuse me, that you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.190
accept?

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.790
Yeah, we accept, and we are also in network with most of the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.820
PPO plans like Delta, Cigna, you name it.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.060
But we are also a network that provides for Tricare

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.310
That's the military dental insurance.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.680
It's run by MetLife.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.000
Excellent, and are there any other special

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.980
services that you offer or do you offer

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.490
emergency dental services? 
Yes we offer same day emergency so if you call us we

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.350
will make any effort to see you the same day for any dental emergencies like

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.440
pain, swelling, bleeding or any other dental emergencies.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.490
But for our patients of record, also we offer

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.979
24 hour emergencies so if you want to become our patient, you have access to my cell phone line

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.440
and you can call me at any time.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.460
Sounds like that would be something that would be great to have. In general, what's the best

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.470
