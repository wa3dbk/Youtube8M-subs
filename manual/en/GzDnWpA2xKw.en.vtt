Three hours remaining, guys,
three more hours.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.242 line:0%
I do sick tattoos outside of
this competition,

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:13.179 line:0%
and then once I'm faced with
rules and regulations and stuff,

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.813 line:0%
it's shown in all my work.

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:17.050
I'm not going to do it well,
because that's not what I do.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.319
- Are you cracking?
- I'm, like, out of my element.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.088
So Ink Master is not the title
suited for you.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.357
I need to step it up.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.625
I've had a taste of the top,

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.293
and I've had a taste
of the bottom.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:31.598
And the top tastes a lot better,
and that's where I wanna be.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:35.534 line:0%
Last time I was here,
I went home at this point.

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:38.337
If you can't do black-and-gray,
you can't be Ink Master.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:39.972
It's your Achilles heel.

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:43.142
(Dave)
You do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:45.578
I played the game the last time
with a lot of integrity,

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.079
but didn't last too long.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.114
Today I am all about strategy.

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:50.949
I really need the skull pick,
so I need to

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.552
knock this one out of the park.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:57.857
(Dave)
Five! Four! Three!

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.860
Two! One!
That is it.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.163
Machines down. Time is up.
No more ink.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.099 align:start size:66% position:34%
That was a close one.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.767 size:84% position:58%
For a while, I didn't think
I was going to finish it.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.868 size:75% position:38%
Really? Are you serious?

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:12.405 line:0%
If they were sending someone
home for one of these postcards,

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.675 line:0%
Big Ceeze better go
pack his [bleep].

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.143
â™ª 

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.845
Artists, it is now time to
critique your work.

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:22.348
Big Ceeze, come on up.

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:25.218
(Dave)
Why did you choose Seattle as
the postcard that you wanted?

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.186 align:end position:100%
That was the first time that
I left New York City,

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.354 size:84% position:58%
and went to the west coast.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.223 align:start size:81% position:19%
That trip changed my life.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.824
(Oliver)
I feel like the Space Needle
just kind of

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.159
comes out of the blue with the
bottom of the bridge.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.561
(Chris)
The left side looks finished,

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.464
and then when you get to the
middle, to the structure

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.833
and the flowers, it just has
an unfinished feel.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.802
(Dave)
Erik...this is New York?

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.103
- Brooklyn, actually.
- (Dave) Brooklyn.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.539
A few years ago, I was sitting
in a restaurant

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.308
overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge,
and at that point

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.945
I was really inspired to start
my own company.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.546
It's very symbolic.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.081
(Oliver)
I love the composition.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.283
It definitely tells this guy's
personal story.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.552
It doesn't hit a postcard
challenge for me,

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.021
but at the same time, the
craftsmanship in the tattoo

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.289
is very strong, the line work
is very nice.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.558
Overall, you got a nice tattoo.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.926
Thank you.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.627
(Dave)
Marisa.

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:11.230
(Oliver)
I would not look at this image
and ever think New Orleans.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.032
But definitely some of
the best outlines

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.567
we've seen from you so far.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.303
It's good to see that you can do
these crisp, sharp lines.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.871
(Dave)
Kruseman.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.907
(Oliver)
I love this tattoo, man.

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.875
It definitely has a
postcard vibe.

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.678
The composition in this tattoo,
where you have the silhouette

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.180
coming into the foreground, and
then the dynamic lettering

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.750
going from thick to thin
creates a nice flow.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.017
This is another great job.

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:34.320
Duffy.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.688
(Oliver)
There's some very clean elements
to this tattoo,

00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:38.458
especially the "greetings from."

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.726
But you definitely lost it in
the word Colorado.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.762
Doing negative letters
is very tricky.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.498
It's not tight and clean.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.766
(Dave)
Katie.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.200
(Oliver)
You have a very simple
composition.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.370
The color blends are
super smooth.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.205
The orange-yellow in the sky,
blue to light blue in the water.

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.007
(Chris)
The highlight is definitely
the postage mark.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.611
That really lends itself nicely
to this being a postcard.
