00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.649
In Avid Media Composer version 7, you can
now reference media that exceeds HD resolution.

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.480
This means you can re-frame and move around
in your video image to a certain extent without

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.770
losing quality.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.020
This functionality is similar to the old Avid
Pan and Zoom effect, except that you can now

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.280
point to a video file instead of just a still
image.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.740
To make this work, the key is to have media
that exceeds the resolution of your project's

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.970
video format.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.200
You can view your project's format by clicking
on the format tab within the project window.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.430
So ,in this example, I'm working within a
1920 x 1080 project.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.530
To start, navigate to the File menu and choose
AMA link.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.510
Find a high resolution picture or high resolution
video file on your hard drive, which in this

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.950
case is a 4K movie file.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.230
Then press the open button.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.379
Okay, so now edit the 4K high resolution video
clip to an empty sequence.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.780
Then move the playhead to the first frame
of the clip segment

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.930
You should see a green dot within the clip
segment in the timeline.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.830
This means the native video resolution of
the file that you are pointing to does not

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.450
match the project's resolution.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.710
Navigate to the upper left corner of the timeline
window and press the effect mode button.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.400
This will launch the effect editor window.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.280
In the lower right corner of the effect editor
window click on the keyframe graphs button.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.710
Then click on the pink keyframe button choose
add to all parameters.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.329
In doing so, this will make keyframing easier
when it comes to moving around within the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.800
video frame.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.590
To preview the area that you will be seeing
within the 4K video file, click on the box

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.000
that says match project raster.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.750
In doing so, you should see a smaller box
appear within the right side of the composer

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.750
window.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.800
This box represents the area that fits within
your project settings.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.759
In this case, it's the standard HD size of
1920 by 1080.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.610
Now, as you move the box around, you can see
the area it represents on the left side of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.920
the composer window.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.989
Also, notice how Avid Media Composer automatically
creates this pink keyframe based on the position

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.620
of the wireframe box.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.560
This indicates your starting point.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.109
Within the right side of the composer window,
move the position indicator to the last frame

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.329
of the clip segment.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.780
Then place and/or scale the wireframe box.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.040
This will represent what you will see at the
end of the clip segment.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.669
Then go ahead and close the effect editor
window.

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.629
Now move back to the right side of the composer
window, and back up to the first frame and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.629
press play.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.889
Okay fantastic, now you have the basics of
re-framing 4K media within Avid Media Composer.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.569
