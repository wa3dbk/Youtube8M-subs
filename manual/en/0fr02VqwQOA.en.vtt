*Jungle Noises*

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.120
Hey, guys.  As many of you already know, I made a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.960
MySpace, like, a few months ago. And

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.960
it's doing great. I have, like, 30,000

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.960
friends and growing. But

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.960
sometimes, it does get a little

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.000
stressful. I get, like, 600 friend requests

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a day, on average.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Do you have any idea how

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
long it takes to approve all of those?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Not to mention, I get tons of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
comments and messages saying stuff like

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"Why don't you ever comment me back?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
"I mean, I watch all your

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
videos." "Why won't you accept

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
my friend requests?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I sent it, like,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
an hour ago! You never

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
respond to my messages.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
(hyperventilating)

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Aw, suck it up! I got stuff

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to do, you know? I-- I--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I clean my keyboard.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I read...

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the-- the dictionary apparently.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You know?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I do stuff.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So anyways, all joking aside,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'd like to say that I'm sorry

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that I can't reply to all you guys.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I really do feel bad sometimes.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So I wrote you guys a song that I hope you'll like

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
despite the fact that I'm losing my voice

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
right now and,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
yeah, here it is.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.220
As time goes by, I learned that myspace is a great responsibility.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.520
And I realize all the things I haven't done affect all the people around me.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.500
So I wanted to take this time out and apologize for things I haven't done and things that didn't occur yet.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.540
And things I don't want to take responsibility for.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.620
I'm sorry that my friend requests have grown

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.200
Takes about an hour to approve em alone

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.720
You were online and I did not know

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.460
That you were at home just waiting for me

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.300
To respond to every message and comment I see

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.020
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.660
I'm sorry for the times that I did not check

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.400
I'm sorry for the things I haven't done

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.200
I'm a ninja, gangstah, emo, nerd, asian

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.980
I'm sorry that I'm busy and always away

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.620
I got a lot to do, what more can I say

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.340
Cuz I'm doing homework like everyday

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.100
I'm sorry that I had to write that fricken essay

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.980
I know I didn't take all your request

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.860
Like how to be gay or how to be a prep

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.700
I understand that you get pissed off

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.420
And its not your fault, I know

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.220
All the hate mail I get from you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.660
Just because I respond too slow

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.460
I should apologize for singing this song

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.340
It sucks and makes a fool out of me

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.720
I would respond to you right now

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.480
But I'd forget cuz my A.D.D.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.360
You can blame my A.D.D.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.180
For me being so busy

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.000
Its not that I am lazy

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.640
Its just cuz my A.D.D.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.440
Said you can blame my A.D.D.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.120
For me being so busy

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.680
Its not that I am lazy

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.400
Its just cuz my A.D.D.
