Hello. Hello. Hello. It' s Nichole
Kellerman here, founder and creator of SuccessfulWeightLossSchool.com,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.480
where women go to stop dieting, reshape their
bodies and feel widly alive. Okay, I was going

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.620
to attempt to do the whole house with this
mask on. I can' t do it. It s really hot in

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.920
here. I love you. I think it would be hilarious.
I just can' t do it. It' s too hot. Way too

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.920
hot in here. I will dance during a little
dance party that we do in the video. I' ll

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.000
wear with the mask on for you. I' ll fix my hair
really quickly. Today, Halloween is coming

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.300
right? And actually my birthday is almost
coming October 28. October 28 is my birthday.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.300
So I do really like Halloween. I think it's
 really fun. And what happens during Halloween?

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.540
Candy, right? We' re going to be talking about
eating too much candy. Why you should not

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.650
eat that much candy at Halloween. There' s
so much temptation. So the number one thing

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670
when it comes to the candy being in the house
is you got to get it out. You got to get it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.670
out in the house. Get it out of the house.
Don' t donate it. Don' t take it to work because

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.549
that' s enforcing unhealthy habits on your
work committing you don' t want that. Just

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.190
throw it away. It' s toxic anyway. You' re doing
people a favor by throwing it away. I know

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.720
you don' t let me saying that like it' s a wasteful
food. It' s just a little square of toxic sugar,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.720
a little cancer creator. So throwing it away
is actually a better thing. Avoid these sticky

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.590
candies. Those are typically really high in
sugar. If you' re going to eat some candies,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.590
then what I would like you to do is eat the
little minis. One is good. And make sure there

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.910
like nut or some sort of protein in it.
So peanut butter and if you are going to have

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.440
candy, make sure you are a food L.O.V.E.R.
If you sign up on the top of my website on

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.200
the right hand side with the weight loss success
kit, the second training in there is all about

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.200
being a food-lover. And I'm not telling you
to not eat candy at all. Do I have fly away's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.349
because of that mask? I' m not telling you
to not eat candy at all. I am down for you

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:55.349
to have a little sugar in your life. That
is cool with me but in moderation, okay? And

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.900
make sure that when you' re eating it, you
are completely guilt-free. Because I tell

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.180
my Successful Weight Loss School students
all the time is that, if you are eating something

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.250
while feeling guilt at the same time, you
are tripling the calories. Tripling the calories

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.250
when you're feeling guilt while you're eating
something. So I'm not going into whole food

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.430
L.O.V.E.R concept if you are new to me. Make
sure you go up there and you sign up that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.440
free weight loss success kit so you can all
learn about being a food-lover. And if you
