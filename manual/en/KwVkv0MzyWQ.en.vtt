00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.920
We are going to talk a little bit about our
waste lines and our vent lines right now.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.760
The waste line being when you turn the sink
on and the water that falls into the sink,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.619
where does it go, well it goes right down
into this pipe here, travels down the pipe,

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:25.861
down to this long sweep here and into the
actual drain that ties into the sewer. A common

00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.300
fall in order to make the water run properly
and any solids that might be in there you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:40.750
need 1/8 inch to the foot fall so if this
is 4 feet you need 1/4 inch lower here than

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:49.800
here so that the water will naturally but
not too quickly flow down into the sewer line.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.329
This right here is 1 and 1/4 inch adapter
which is most commonly used for your bathroom

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:04.509
sinks and it always 1 and 1/4 inch and your
kitchen sinks and washtubs are 1 and 1/2 inch.

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.540
Just because the volume of water in those
sinks is greater than you would ever use in

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:21.950
a bathroom. Okay now once we come over here
you see this long sweep that is a 3x2 combo

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.400
that ties into what we call our vent pipe.
This vent pipe runs all the way up the wall,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.800
into the attic, and up through the roof and
you have to have a vent in order for all of

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.939
your water and your sewer line to flow so
that it does not hiccup or burp or it breaks

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.960
the vacuum is what will happen. You see here
some more black pipe that I have added. You

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.540
see here is a 2 inch pea trap that is going
to act as the drain for the washing machine.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.579
This white box here is where you have your
hot and cold line and then your waste line

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.710
and your hoses that hook up to your washing
machine will tie into these lines here and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.480
then the drain hose that comes out of the
washing machine will drop down into here and

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.920
then as your washing machine pumps water out
of it this is where it goes. The reason there

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.850
is a pea trap in here is that water will always
sit here and here and this part will always

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:30.600
be full of water. That keeps any gases that
ties into the street from coming up here and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.180
having the smell of sewage in your room. Back
to our drain for our sink - we don't have

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.170
a pea trap in this line because the pea trap
will be added in the drain of the sink and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.450
the same function there. The pea trap for
the sink will have water in it and that keeps

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.250
the gases from flowing up into your bathroom.
Now you will see here that this drops down

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.430
into the 3x2 combo into our main line which
our main line also doubles as our vent line

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.981
so all the washing machine water will drop
down here into our main sewer line and all

00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:14.310
of our sink water will drop down into this
main line. This vent will act as a vent for

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.760
the washing machine, the sink, the toilet
and the shower that will be installed behind

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.411
me. We originally planned on using a 2 inch
vent and as I reviewed the code I found that

00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:31.230
we had to have a 3 inch vent because it is
the code for the building that we are doing

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:39.020
here so this is a 3 inch ABS sewer pipe and
it runs all the way up through the ceiling

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.340
and travels all the way through the wall into
the ceiling through the attic and out through

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:54.360
the top of the shingled roof and I have 12
inches protruding above the shingle line of

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.580
vent pipe and that too is code.
