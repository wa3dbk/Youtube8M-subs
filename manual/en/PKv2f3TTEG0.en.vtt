00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:02.740
This is the GR8.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.231
The anchor of the Charles Owen range, and
probably the one, when you look through the

00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:10.410
magazines, that you'll see most often.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.400
It has the microsuede cover with the famous
Charles Owen badge on the front.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.210
It features a suede harness that laces up
at the back, and so, can pull the helmet and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.390
give you security.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.660
This one has the metal clip on the side.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.210
The metal clip gives that real traditional
feel, and just because it's a little unique

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.930
to Charles Owen, it has a secondary snap.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.910
And to undo it, what you do is you lift the
helmet, the buckle away from the face and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.170
then rotate it forwards.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.900
You lift it away from the face and rotate
it forwards, and that's the very, very simple

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.370
way of removing it off the helmet.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.780
But if you don't lift away from your face,
then the buckle will actually lock itself

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.600
onto the hook.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.210
Inside, we have the silver anti-microbial
lining, which actually has, keeps the helmet

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.280
sweet smelling.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.760
And the triple-standard certification inside
gives us so many positive accident reports.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.520
You can have some real fun with the GR8 and
with the many color options that are available.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.120
Obviously, you've got the classic black on
black, but let's have an explore of some of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.970
the other options you have.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.250
Starting off with the black and the charcoal.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.520
With having a contrast stripe, it helps the
helmet to look a lot smaller on your head,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.549
and if you're concerned about that, then contrast
color can be something that will interest

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.549
you.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.100
And let's have a look at something else.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.580
This is the Breast Cancer Awareness.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.369
A real statement for a rider.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:02.760
It features the pink bow on the front and
has the pink and black combination with the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.320
embroidery embellishing that.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.970
With the purchase of this helmet, there is
a donation made by Charles Owen and SmartPak

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.090
to a well-known cancer charity.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.950
So, when you're thinking of all the amazing
color options you can have, check out the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.110
