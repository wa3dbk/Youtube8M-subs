00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.219
Motorola BACKFLIP. Expected Q1 2010.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.240
The Motorola BACKFLIP is Motorola's latest
Android handset, closely related to the CLIQ

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.520
and
DEXT, but this time it comes with a novel

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.579
QWERTY keyboard that gives the phone the
"Backflip" name.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.720
Rather than go for a conventional arrangement,
the Backflip's keyboard is hinged and folds

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.439
back behind the screen. This means that you
can easily use the Backflip as a PDA-style

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.350
tablet
device, a mini computer with a keyboard or

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.850
alternatively you can use the keyboard as
a stand

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.429
so that you can use the Backflip while sitting
on a table (to watch videos, for example).

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.030
As far as we know, this form factor is unique..
and it does seem like a good idea, although

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.960
exactly how customers will react to it is
unknown.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.870
As we said before, this is basically the CLIQ
 / DEXT smartphone packaged in a different

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.090
way.
There's a 3.1" 480 x 320 pixel touchscreen

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.360
display, 5 megapixel camera with autofocus
and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.310
LED flash, tri-band 3.5G support and WiFi.
GPS is built in, and there's also a microSD

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.119
memory slot (with a 2GB card in the standard
sales package), Bluetooth and USB connectivity

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:31.580
plus a 3.5mm audio socket.
Underneath the hardware, the Motorola BACKFLIP

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.630
runs the Android 1.5 operating system as
found on the CLIQ / DEXT, rather than Android

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.010
2.0 on the Motorola DROID / Milestone or 2.1
on the Google Nexus One. Version 1.5 is pretty

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.479
up-to-date though, and Motorola's spec sheet
says that the phone is upgradeable to Android

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.950
2.x.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.490
The BACKFLIP is integrated into Motorola's
MOTOBLUR service, offering seamless

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.280
integration and backup capabilities across
devices. MOTOBLUR is really aimed at consumers

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.619
rather than business customers, and overall
Motorola do seem to be pitching the phone

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.869
as a
fun way to keep in touch through messaging

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.320
and social networking sites, and to enjoy
multimedia.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.500
Inside is a very large
1400 mAh battery that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.380
Motorola says provides
up to 6 hours talktime

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.940
and 13 days standby
time. The phone itself weighs 133 grams and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.780
measures 108
x 53 x 15mm, so it's a little on the large

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.330
side but it is still
pocket-friendly.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.220
Motorola say that the BACKFLIP should be available
this quarter in markets worldwide, including

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.250
North America and Europe.
There's no guidance on price, but we should

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.410
imagine that it will come in at less than
â‚¬300 SIM-free. You can see more of the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.330
BACKFLIP (including the novel keyboard) at
