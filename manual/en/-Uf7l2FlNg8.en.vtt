00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
I should eat before going out

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.080
1,2,3 wow!

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.580
looks good~

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.360
Bon appetit!

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.060
'neo sarang hae' thank you for the star ballon and fan enrolling

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.920
I only cooked for one. i'm going out soon,so  I don't need to cook for two

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.260
A pot stand for those living by themselves

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.080
Tada~ (a toilet paper)

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.400
No, the pot stand wouldn't fall, don't worry guys

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.380
I planned to go out at 10 A.M. but it was delayed to 11 A.M. so I'm going out after finishing this

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.320
Q: Do you exercise these days?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.340
I do it when I feel like doing it

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.340
(someone gave her a sticker on the show)

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.840
Q: why aren't you eating Kimchi with ramyun?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.040
I was too lazy to bring Kimchi here and put it back into the fridge so I just put it in the ramyun

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.620
You know, there is a thing with people living by themselves

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.920
Because they are too lazy to clean up after having a meal..

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.820
They put food in one bowl on purpose

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.140
They don't usually prepare several dishes or bowls

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.360
Is it only me?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.220
Cause they're lazy..

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.060
When you put all the food in a bowl, it gradually becomes a Bibimbab

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.460
You know, the rice gets wet from the all the food

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.300
Where's my toilet paper..

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.600
Oh right, it's here!! I was looking for it lol

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.240
I'm not eating the rest of the soup, It'll make me fat

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.380
See, I do have my own philosophy

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.000
You may say "Don't eat ramyun if you're afraid of getting fat"

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.600
I don't eat the soup from ramyun

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.700
and for the fried chicken, I only eat half portion of it

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.780
and when I'm eating Bossam(boiled pork), I tend to eat lots of vegetables
