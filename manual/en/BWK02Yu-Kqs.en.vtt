Hey guys, I'm here with Bob at the Web Gem
Glove Forming and he's got a great new product

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.560
here to help form your glove.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.560
Bob, this thing is really cool.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.140
What, what are some of the things you can
do with it?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.770
Well, everything from break in your glove,
to maintain your glove, to protect the glove.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.770
It's designed to give a serious player a great
opportunity to take care of his glove.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.210
Make it last longer, play better, give him
a consistent feel.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.210
Very nice.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.760
Can you show us the uh, model.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.810
So, there's, uh, this is actually the flare
system.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.170
There's four different systems.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.590
A catcher's, first base, you've got a flare,
and then we've also got a roll system.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.780
A little bit different shape, but, really
it depends on the way you like your glove,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.970
the position you play, what your personal
preference is.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.930
The idea is the same for all of them.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.260
Put the form in the glove, put the whole thing
in the bag whenever you're not playing, and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.340
it keeps it protected, maintains it.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.510
This is actually a glove that we turned into
a flare that wasn't flared and the one you're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.610
holding there is the same thing.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:23.070
It was a glove that was not a flare but we
turned it into a flare so.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.560
It gives you an opportunity to do that as
well.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.560
Any glove on the market.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
This will fit up to a twelve and three quarter
inch glove and will turn it into a flare for

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
you.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560
Just pop it in there whenever you're not playing,
take the whole thing and drop it in the bag,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560
and then pull that strap over the top, and
that's pulling the glove nice and tight against

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.560
that form that's creating that flare on this
particular model.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560
Now it's protected.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.790
You've got everything you need there.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.030
Handle wrap comes off.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.010
You can take that to any Lids store and get
it embroidered with your name and number for

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.560
about ten bucks, you've got it personalized.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.100
You've got a rag and some conditioner that
comes with it and goes in the pouch.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.630
You can keep everything together if you go
on the road you've got everything you need

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.960
to take care of your glove.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.960
Very nice.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960
Very nice.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.960
Thanks a lot Bob.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.963
I appreciate it.
