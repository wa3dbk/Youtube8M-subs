Hi everyone, I'm photographer Alexander Svet

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.300
and I'm very glad to introduce to you our new Film Styles Extended Set for Capture One.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.030
Extended Set contains 100 new film styles

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.109
25 film grain emulation styles and uses the amazing new features of Capture One 8 engine.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.529
Let's see all the details.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.539
With Film Styles Extended Set you will get 70  new color styles

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.029
and 30 black and white styles.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.329
There are a lot of completely new film styles like

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.120
Kodak Gold and Royal Gold, Kodak Ektar, Agfa Vista, Rollei Retro,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.100
Kodak Max and UltraMax.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.100
I really love our versions of Kodak and Agfa films.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.910
And one of my favorite black and white films is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.910
PX Silver Shade

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.189
For cross-processing fans weâ€™ve developed

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.520
6 new X-pro styles: for example Fuji Sensia

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.520
and Kodak E100S.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.549
Also we have added new variations for
existing styles.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.090
Every experienced photographer knows
there are many ways to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.420
emulate one certain film and all them will
be true.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.649
Now we can choose from different
variants

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.430
and find the best fit for your image.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.790
By your many requests we have developed
artistic variations of the most popular film styles.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.140
In extended set you will find summer, winter, gold,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.140
T-balanced and some other artistic
variants of our styles.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.850
Artistic styles are the great tool

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.850
for creative work with color in Capture One.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.580
Film Grain Styles

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.030
are another great feature of the
Extended Set. We have created

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.110
25 universal film grain styles arranged
by different ISO

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.890
and film development specifics.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.010
You can use them on any image and they
will also work well together with our

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.080
film styles from

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.340
Original and Extended sets.
Just turn on Stack Styles feature in

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.340
Capture One, now you can combine film styles and grain styles together.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.130
Grain styles are also available as presets
for your convenience.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.500
In this case you don't need to turn on Stack Styles feature to use grain presets

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.940
and film styles.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.760
For each of 30 black and white styles we
have made

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.800
unique film grain emulation.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.000
The grain picture is as close to the original film, as Capture One engine can produce.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.600
And we are really proud about the results.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.260
When we were developing

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.880
Extended set one of our main goals was
to implement best new

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.600
Capture One 8 features in to styles.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.300
For example a lot of our styles are now using black and white point correction on curve tool.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.040
This is a great feature of Capture One 8,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.200
which opens completely new possibilities
to emulate film picture

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.630
Let's summarize

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.770
all the features on the Extended Set: 70
new color styles with different artistic

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.000
variations of the most popular films.

30 black and white styles and
additional 30 variants with unique

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.700
