Hello everyone this is Colin from GIGABYTE.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:13.413
Now working at GIGABYTE I often have to put a lot of PC systems together.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:20.860
And anybody who builds a PC knows they have to go often in to the BIOS to make BIOS system changes.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.789
But for people who may be aren’t so comfortable with the BIOS,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.393
this could be a pretty daunting thing to have to go and make changes.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:32.665
So what GIGABYTE has done is, we have created an easy to use utility in order to make those Bios changes.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:39.139
So in front of me here I have our new utility called Touch BIOS.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:48.248
So as you can see in front we have many different icons representing all of the different functionalities of the BIOS.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.620
Now Touch BIOS is so easy to use that you can use your mouse;

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.726
but if you have a touchable monitor you can even use your finger just like the name says "Touch BIOS".

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.864
So as you can see here we have different icons representing different BIOS features.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:10.704
So we have got overclocking section, you can do things like change your password.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:15.342
We also have links to go to different GIGABYTE utilities. 

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:18.578
This is @BIOS in case you want to flash your BIOS

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:29.220
We also have… you can check on your different system on temperatures or your voltages, so this is a basic PC status.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:36.296
So basically what we have done is trying to make it easy as possible for people to make these changes.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:41.301
So let me quickly go in to one of them and show you how to make changes.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.804
So this one right here is overclocking section.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.313
So as you can see here we’ve tried to widen the scroll bar here we have made the Fonts really big to make it easy again for navigation.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:58.718
And what we have done is we’ve put all of the main features that we normally have for overclocking in this section.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.157
So as you can see if you want to make voltage changes all we have to do is go in to voltage section…  

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.161
And click what ever changes we want to make.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:15.402
So let’s say we wanna change the voltage all we have to do in order to accept the change is ‘save to CMOS’.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:19.539
Do you want to save? Yes, and it is successfully saved.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:24.444
And of course we've also tried to make this customizable as possible,

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:30.316
So what we have done is we’ve enabled users to arrange these icons however they want.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:34.921
So depending on whatever they use them in; whatever is more convenient for them.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:42.495
We also have a function where you can remove icons that maybe you don’t use very often or add ones that you do.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:47.434
So you can just go through remove confirm and there you go.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.710
So very customizable very easy to use.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:58.311
and another benefit of this is you don’t have to reboot go into BIOS to make BIOS system changes.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:07.787
You can actually just do it by using this utility, you can make your changes, reboot and the system will accept those settings.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.255
So there you have it.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.624
This is GIGABYTE Touch BIOS.

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.295
A very new way for users to use their BIOS.
