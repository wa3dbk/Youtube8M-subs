00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.470
The starlight reflects in the night sky

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.720
shining and expanding its brightness in all directions.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.170
The certainty of your sight over me makes me feel

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.670
like a starlight delineating a kaleidoscope in the nocturne sky.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.350
The warmth around me finally makes me feel calm, dispelling all my worries,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.720
all the pain and sadness disappear as if I was finally waking from a dream.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.990
It is as if the intensity of my love suffocates my soul,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.020
however, is a feeling that fills me with happiness.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.370
My love is my greatest weapon,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.020
there is nothing in the universe that can defeat it...

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.470
The strength of my feelings illuminates the sky with starlight,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.670
emitting and reflecting their glow in all directions.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.200
The light is dispersed into small fragments when my heart breaks,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.320
like a starlight delineating a kaleidoscope in the nocturne sky.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.050
Slowly, from this place I'll get to the higher limit.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.420
The warmth disappears, but I will not feel scared again.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.020
I'll spread my wings with strength and elegance

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.710
and I will always carry my love with me,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.970
however, the memory of that person makes me feel...

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.820
The starlight being reflected in the night sky

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.020
illuminating and spreading its shine in all directions.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.450
The certainty of your sight over me makes me feel

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.420
like a starlight delineating a kaleidoscope in the nocturne sky.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.850
The strength of my feelings illuminates the sky with starlight,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.050
emitting and reflecting their glow in all directions.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.500
The light is dispersed into small fragments when my heart breaks,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.440
like a starlight delineating a kaleidoscope in the nocturne sky.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.160
The starlight reflects in the night sky

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.300
shining and expanding its brightness in all directions.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.810
The certainty of your sight over me makes me feel

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.740
like a starlight delineating a kaleidoscope in the nocturne sky.
