My name is Diana Gutierrez, and I'm a high
school teacher in San Jose. One of the funniest

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.750
moments in my high school teaching life was
when we did a unit on "Night", by Elie Wiesel,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.150
the Holocaust unit, and I wanted to mix things
up that day. I wanted to get us outside of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.230
the classroom, and I wanted them to experience
a certain chapter on their feet. So, I brought

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.760
them in to the auditorium, and I had them
close their eyes, and I turned off all the

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.620
lights, and we were recreating the scene where
Elie and his father are dying in the snow,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.420
and one of them finds a piece of bread on
the ground, and you know, all the camp survivors

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.780
are, like, scrambling for the bread, and he
has to decide whether to give the bread to

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.750
his father, or eat it himself and watch his
father, you know, possibly die. It was a very

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.219
intense scene. I knew that they would fall
asleep if we did a discussion about it, so

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.960
I decided to play my violin. Now, nobody knew
I played the violin, but I knew it was important

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.240
to set the tone. So, as soon as the lights
went off, I came in and I played a really

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.110
somber tune on the violin, and most of my
students were rustling around, like, "oh,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.780
my gosh, she's playing the violin. What are
we doing?" But, they eventually got into it,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.240
and I guided them sort of like a meditation,
and I said, "okay, get up. Keep your eyes

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.540
closed, and see if you can find another survivor
in the dark." And, it was really cool. I felt

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.880
like they understood something, and we read,
you know, lines of the book, that they had

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.430
memorized to really get into it. At the end
of it, I turned the lights back on, and, you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.430
know, we had one more line to go, and I said:
"Where's Gavino? You know, it's his line."

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.950
There at, we were all looking around, "where
is he?" And, in the corner we see Gavino fast

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.250
asleep, snoring, with his hands like this,
like he's cold, and we thought he was playing

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.990
a joke on us, and we go over and we poke him,
and he wakes up, and he's like, "am I dreaming?"

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.310
He was like, "I heard music, and it was so
beautiful." So, that was pretty funny, and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.540
I'm glad that, you know, he got something
out of that lesson, even if it was a nap.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.720
My name is Diana Gutierrez, and I'm a high
school teacher in San Jose.
