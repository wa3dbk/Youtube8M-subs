00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:08.400
Is this what you use your treadmill for, hanging
up your clothes?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.650
I am going to show you today what you need
to do to get an entirely new workout.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.830
An upper body workout using your treadmill,
and you know what?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:34.490
You don't even have to plug it in.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.440
[Music Intro]

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.870
What's up guys?

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.190
Jeff Cavaliere AthleanX.com

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.730
I am standing here next to something a lot
of guys you probably have.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.480
Maybe not, but you can still get some use
out of this workout here.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.470
But if you do have one of these at home, and
you do use it just to hang your clothes on-

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.060
I have got something different for you.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.560
Now last week we got hit by a surprise snow
storm here in October.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.859
It knocked the power out in Connecticut, a
lot people still without power.

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.009
So if you were relying on your treadmill as
a way of getting your workout in

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.069
Which if you are doing Athlean-X by now, you
shouldn't be.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.869
But if you were, you had to something else,
and now we have something else you can do.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.009
We are going to call it the broken treadmill
workout.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.840
Or you can just leave it unplugged, if you
have no power.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.250
Basically what we are going to do is get on
the treadmill, 6 exercises, 30 seconds a piece.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.359
We are going to come on feet on the belt,
hands on the ground.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.060
And we are going to start with walking your
feet alternate.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.440
So it is like a mountain climber here, really
pushing.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.690
As you are pushing here, you are working your
quads, your glutes, your upper body, and you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.889
are working your core.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:01.020
30 seconds straight through.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:14.069
Then once we are up here what we want to do
is 2 feet together, we are going to hop.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:23.989
So take it in, and push, in and push.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:24.989
[Exercises]

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.409
[Keeps Exercising]

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:32.319
Much more intense, real intense core workout,
and also up through our back.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.450
Because as we hop, we have to stabilize up
throught the back and shoulders.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.439
Next thing we do, we turn it right around.

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.599
We come up on our hands, up on our toes.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.620
We are in sort of a plank position here.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.939
And we walk it out, OK, same exact thing in
a reverse pattern that we did with our legs.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:00.650
Really pushing, again, working your core,
pushing with your upper body.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.700
Up against a lot of resistance

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:13.569
You have got your triceps working, your chest,
OK, 30 seconds.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.939
Then you drop it down.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.500
Now, we are going to pull the belt towards
us, almost like a lat pull-down.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.099
So one arm walks it down, and down.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.790
[Exercises]

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.840
Reach, pull, you see your whole back working.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.740
Keep your posture here, you don't want to
round your back.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.579
[Exercises]

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.430
OK.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.129
So we are working push, we are working pull.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.860
We are really integrating a lot of muscles
at once, which is what Athlean-X is all about.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.709
Do you need a treadmill, a broken treadmill
at that to do Athlean-X?

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:01.709
No.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.400
This is just integrating a lot of principles
of what Athlean-X is all about.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.530
Being able to get multiple muscle groups working
together at one time to function in a stronger

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.560
way-

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.799
And to allow you to build more muscle.

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.410
Now last you have got to hit the legs so you
come down on the floor.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.430
We start up pushing it out.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.140
You are walking, pushing, working your quads
on the extension.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:36.630
You are working your glutes because you have
to stay up in this bridge.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.320
Really drive them out.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.169
30 seconds.

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.410
Then the killer of them all, one of the best
hamstring exercises that you can do.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.090
Very similar to one of the exercises we do
in Athlean-X.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.520
Not using a treadmill, but actually just using
your own body weight.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.310
Where we can incorporate closed-chain hamstring
workout.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.270
What I mean by that is, your feet are actually
on something, connected to the ground, not

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.660
on your stomach doing hamstring curls.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.890
That has no relevance to you as an athlete
OK.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.092
On something, on the ground, engaged up into
a bridge.

00:05:16.092 --> 00:05:20.800
You are tying in glutes and hamstrings to
work together.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.710
And now you pull it in.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:31.570
Guys, I am telling you one of the most intense
drills you can do for hamstrings.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.150
As you fall of the belt--here we go.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.340
Pulling back all the way through, all the
way through.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.930
It is a killer, but it is a killer because
we generally don't train the hamstrings the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.680
way they need to be trained.Which is closed
chain.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.419
So again, a lot of principles here.

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.740
You might not be using a treadmill to do this
workout.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.580
If you don't have one, that's OK.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.979
What I want you to see is the principles that
are behind it.

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.660
This is Athlean-X, incorporating multiple
muscle groups, making the muscles work the

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.509
way they are supposed to.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.910
Getting your feet on the ground, being athletic.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.960
Getting athletic muscle.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.340
If you haven't already,guys, head to AthleanX.com
right now, grab the 90 day training system.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.009
90 days to the best body of your life: Be
explosive, look athletic.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.240
Guys, let me say it one more time, If you
want to look like an athlete, you have to

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.289
train like an athlete.

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.050
Head over to AthleanX.com and start that body
reconstruction today.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.389
we will be back here again next week.

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.650
Guys, remember, leave a comment below, if
you like what you saw.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.520
If you have your own sort of exercise that
you have done before, something creative,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.520
unique-

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520
Let us all know below.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:07:19.439
I will see you here in 7 days.
