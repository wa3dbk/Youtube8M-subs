00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.700
Hey friends.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.529
Xur is rumored to sell the Thunderlord this
week for the first time and it will be your

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.379
first time with the Thunderlord for many of
you.

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.440
So I’ll go over this weapon in detail, give
you tips in using it, and analyze whether

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.179
it is worth using exotic slot on this or not.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.750
First, let’s go over the notable stats and
perks.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.230
The stats on this thing is just excellent
all-round.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.900
It’s got balanced RoF (66) and relatively
high Impact (53), great range (32), good stability

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.439
(41), good reload speed (46).

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.519
Moreover, the aim assist on this thing is
really high, at 90.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.920
That makes using this weapon very easy.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.110
Its recoil direction score is pretty high
to, at 70, which means that this is going

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.989
to kick mostly upwards.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.770
The first perk is Feeding Frenzy, which is
really nice for a machine gun.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.379
This dramatically increases reload speed after
kill and can definitely get you out of sticky

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.379
situations.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.579
The exotic perk, lightning round, increases
fire rate the longer you hold it down.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.929
This doesn’t sound that useful until you
bind it with Field scout and start melting

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:56.929
bosses with it.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.170
This is the gjallarhorn of machine guns.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.070
Also, there’s a hidden perk in Lightning
Rounds – there’s about 10% chance that

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.980
enemies you kill will explode, so kinda like
Firefly, but it doesn’t trigger too frequently.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.540
However, the 10% adds up when you’re shooting
at a LOT of enemies, so pretty much all Hive

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.540
encounters.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.540
You shoot at a bunch of thralls, and at least
one of them are guaranteed to blow up and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.290
kill others around him.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.910
For ballistics, I recommend linear compensator
mainly for the more predictable recoil.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.010
That is going to be handy when you’re shooting
at 600 RPM.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.220
For 2nd tree of perks, while you can increase
reload speed with Flared Magwell, the inclusion

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.300
of Feeding Frenzy pretty much eliminates any
reason to use Flared Magwell over Perfect

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.420
balance or Field Scout, especially since Feeding
Frenzy doesn’t work well with Flared Magwell.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.150
So for this tree, I usually recommend Field
Scout because it will allow you to take advantage

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.070
of the exotic perk more.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.670
If you need more stability, I recommend you
to use Field Scout when you pick up heavy

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.610
ammo, and THEN switch to perfect balance.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.110
So, what is this gun?

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.990
Why is this an exotic and what’s its purpose?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.600
Well, without Lightning Rounds, it’s just
a legendary machine gun with pretty good stats.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.740
But the fact that you can fire lightning fast
(ha) means you can output crazy DPS, and that’s

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.750
why you would use Thunderlord over legendary
machine guns.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.459
But why would I use this over gjallarhorn
if I’m going to use an exotic heavy?

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.269
Well, I’ll go over that in a minute when
I cover the PvE section.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.230
Let’s talk about this weapon in PvP.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.590
It does 64 crit and 51 body shot, which means
you will 4-shot people no matter where you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.590
hit them!

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.700
This is a blessing and a curse, but mostly
blessing – with fast fire rate and short

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.519
TTK of 0.5 seconds, and remember that this
is 0.5 seconds while bodyshotting, this gun

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.330
can kill very fast, is very easy to use, and
will automatically win gunfights if your enemy

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.680
misses even one crit.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.480
Now, here’s the caveat: while the Thunderlord
is VERY nice to use in PvP due to its handling

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.450
and stats, you’re not really gonna use the
exotic perk, which really defeats a purpose

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.239
of using an exotic.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.020
The increased fire rate while holding down
trigger and the occasionally firefly explosions

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.359
aren’t really helpful in PvP.

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.359
So I would use Thunderlord in PvP only if
you like the extra high stability or if you

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.180
don’t have other good exotic primary or
secondary.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.249
If you want to save a slot, I recommend picking
up a Deviant Gravity-A legendary machine gun,

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.109
which has same archetype and very similar
stats.

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.439
Now, let’s talk about this gun in Pve.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.689
Like I said before, the purpose of this gun
is extreme Dps, and this actually comes into

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:33.260
play in PvE, especially when going against
majors and ultras.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.420
The fire rate starts at 360 RPM and goes all
the way up to 600 RPM.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.370
That’s 67% increase in Dps!

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.130
Alright, it does great DPS, but if I wanted
high DPS, why wouldn’t I use a rocket launcher,

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.209
especially if I have something like Gjallarhorn?

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.999
That’s a great point.

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:56.169
The Thunderlord has a bit of identity crisis
– while machine guns’ purpose are to not

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:01.489
waste as much damage as rocket launchers and
to sustain damage over time, Thunderlord wants

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.400
to do maximum burst DPS, which is what rocket
launchers are for.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.779
However, I would say the reason you would
use Thunderlord over rocket launchers is the

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:11.380
total damage.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.459
While rockets definitely do higher burst DPS,
Thunderlord makes up the relatively lower

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.280
DPS with Lightning Rounds and allows you to
deliver more total damage to the target.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.020
With Field Scout, it does 4~5x more total
damage than your average rocket launcher,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.790
and ~2x than Gjallarhorn.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.800
So if you’ve ever tried mashing a strike
boss with rocket launchers but only took away

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.090
1/4th of the health, now you know what the
Thunderlord is for and what it can do.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.220
It delivers massive amounts of total damage
in DPS that challenges rocket launchers.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.970
That’s why it’s an exotic and that’s
why you would use this over rocket launchers.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.430
Now, the gun is amazing, but it is important
to know how to use the gun effectively.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.210
First and foremost, if you’re taking advantage
of Lightning Rounds, you’re gonna have to

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.460
learn how to tame the 600 RPM beast.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.060
Most people are thrown off by the seemingly
high recoil, but here’s where the Linear

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.860
Compensator kicks in: since most of Thunderlord’s
recoil is actually just visual kick and the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.440
gun itself actually doesn’t kick too much,
all you have to do is to trust the gun and

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.730
pull the thumbstick down slightly as it kicks
mostly up.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.140
If you do that, you will notice that you’ll
have an easier time constantly landing crits,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.760
whereas if you tried to manually correct for
the visual recoil, you would’ve missed a

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.880
lot of your shots.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.570
Also, it is a good idea to get closer to the
enemy the faster you fire.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.740
And if you’ve heard people advising you
to use it like a scout rifle, please don’t.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.060
If you want to use this like a scout rifle,
take out an actual scout rifle.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.210
The whole purpose of this gun is that it fires
lightning fast, and limiting its potential

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.300
is not something you should do.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.170
One last tip; if you want to conserve your
ammo over many rounds of strikes, or if you

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.931
want FREE ammo, that’s right, FREE ammo,
keep this trick in mind: if you have some

00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:59.050
rounds left, switch to perfect balance before
you orbit.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.850
Then, before you land on your next destination,
switch to Field Scout to get free ammo!

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.080
This is a nice way to conserve ammo between
vanguard strikes.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.870
As to why this glitch works, I’ll leave
it to you viewers to figure out yourselves.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.650
So, Thunderlord.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.350
An exotic machine gun that fires ridiculously
fast and deal crazy DPS – you should definitely

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.350
buy this from Xur.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.010
A good rule of thumb is to buy whatever gear
you don’t have whether you think you’d

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.180
want it or not because you never know when
you’re gonna regret it...

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.150
So, hopefully I convinced you to pick up this
gun, upgrade it and use it frequently.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.811
Hopefully I also cleared up the nature of
this gun and what it is for.

00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:37.729
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you on
the next review!
