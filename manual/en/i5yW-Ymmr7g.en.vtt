Tommy Tolson: Today we were doing a level of three interoperability technology demonstration. Our goal was three things: one, to establish a continuous data link

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:35.250 position:98%
between three different control stations; number two, was to hand over control of a star sapphire camera between three different control systems and our third goal

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:47.320 position:98%
was to have an imagery team take our payload product, which is full motion video and metadata, and turn that into intelligence products that we can push up the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:58.200 position:97%
SIPRNET to the office of naval intelligence. So we are pushing the envelope out to show that we can use standardized messages, standardized logic and sequence

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.170 position:98%
in writing software that will work with any control system and any payload.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.200 position:97%
Sean Crocker: The Coast Guard’s role in this demonstration is we are out there testing video equipment. What we are looking for is video quality when we are going

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.530 position:98%
into intercept a target of interest. Just the quality of the video, it is going to basically help us with eyes on the situation before we get in there.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:32.390 position:98%
Tommy Tolson: The scenario is, we’ve got a high value individual holding a particular package that we want to intercept for reasons of national security,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:45.560 position:97%
so we had an aircraft on station with a star sapphire high definition camera and we had a coast guard vessel ready to help us pursue that high value individual.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.040 position:97%
Sean Crocker: We will intercept any boat that has been deemed a target of interest based on intelligence that we receive and that is really all we roll into

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.370 position:98%
a situation with is the intelligence that we get down at the deck plates. This technology is going to be extremely helpful.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:12.040 position:97%
Tommy Tolson: Right now without these systems being interoperable, unless you have the right controller and its payload together, you are not able to take control

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:21.080 position:97%
of the camera. You are not able to get direct video products and so you have no situational awareness other than what you can see and what people are telling you.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:31.170 position:98%
And how we are trying to increases situational awareness with interoperability is so that the Sailor or Soldier or Marine or the Coast Guardsman can actually

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.550 position:56%
take control of the payload himself.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.170 position:91%
"Gentleman in the red shirt, get down one knee at a time."

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:46.290 position:98%
Tommy Tolson: To see exactly what is going on. In this case we can identify the high value individual and board the right boat.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.170 position:97%
Kirby Miller: It is cool, but now it is an imperative. You have to be able, you never know where you're going to end up, who you're going to be supporting

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.450 position:97%
or who's going to be supporting you. We have to be able to talk to each other. So this type of proof of concept is showing we can go back to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.470 position:97%
what we have, what we are living with today, fix it for the future then going forward build it the right way so that it is an open architecture that everybody

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.060 position:88%
can plug into and pull out of and have a common picture.
