00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:12.227
This week, with the arrival of
the "Historic Superstorm Sandy,"

00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:14.761
the President worked alongside
FEMA officials and the American

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.795
Red Cross; addressed the
nation and federal agencies

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:21.027
on emergency preparedness and
recovery; and visited with some

00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:22.961
of those affected by the storm.

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:26.161
That's October 26th
to November 1st or

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.961
"What's Brightest in America!"

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.027
The President:
I think we also saw what's
brightest in America.

00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:33.961
Narrator:
On Friday, in anticipation
of the upcoming holiday,

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:36.161
White House staff brought
their kids and family members

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.994
into the Eisenhower Executive
Office Building to participate

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:42.061
in the "Family Trick 'Bo'
Treat" event with the halls

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.961
of the building filled with
fun costumes scary bowls of

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.428
candy and Bo-inspired decorations!

00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:48.628
(children giggling)

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:49.227
Child:
Trick or treat!

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:50.695
Adult Voices:
Trick or treat!

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:53.328
Narrator:
On Sunday, with the storm
approaching, the President

00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:56.528
traveled to FEMA headquarters in
Washington, D.C. to ensure that

00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.161
federal resources were
pre-positioned and plans

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:02.094
were in place to move quickly
in support of state and local

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:03.394
response efforts.

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:05.594
The President:
We have to take this seriously.

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:07.861
The federal government is
working effectively with the

00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.961
state and local governments.

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.928
It's going to be very important
that populations in all the

00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:15.795
impacted states
take this seriously.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:18.394
Listen to your state and
local elected officials.

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:21.928
My message to the governors
as well as to the mayors is

00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:24.528
anything they need,
we will be there.

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:27.928
Narrator:
On Monday, as the storm neared
landfall, the President urged

00:01:27.928 --> 00:01:30.761
residents in the path of
Hurricane Sandy to heed

00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:32.261
warnings from local officials.

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:34.094
The President:
The most important
message that I have

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:38.728
for the public right now is
please listen to what your state

00:01:38.728 --> 00:01:41.294
and local officials are saying.

00:01:41.294 --> 00:01:44.795
When they tell you to evacuate,
you need to evacuate.

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.061
Narrator:
On Tuesday, the President
met with his senior Homeland

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:49.227
Security team in
the Situation Room.

00:01:49.227 --> 00:01:51.428
Then visited the Washington
headquarters of the U.S.

00:01:51.428 --> 00:01:52.161
Red Cross --

00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:52.761
(applause)

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:54.561
-- where he expressed his
condolences to the families of

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.895
those who were lost in the storm
and urged Americans across the

00:01:57.895 --> 00:02:00.961
country to come together in
support of those whose lives

00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:02.428
were upended by the storm.

00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:05.127
The President:
Obviously this is something
that is heartbreaking for

00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:06.361
the entire nation.

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:12.328
And we certainly feel profoundly
for all the families whose lives

00:02:12.328 --> 00:02:15.227
have been upended and are going
to be going through some very

00:02:15.227 --> 00:02:19.127
tough times over the next
several days and perhaps

00:02:19.127 --> 00:02:20.895
several weeks and months.

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.861
The most important message I
have for them is that America

00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:24.728
is with you.

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:26.928
We are standing behind you.

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:29.194
And we are going to do
everything we can to help

00:02:29.194 --> 00:02:31.261
you get back on your feet.

00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.828
Narrator:
On Wednesday, the President
traveled to New Jersey where

00:02:33.828 --> 00:02:37.061
he and FEMA Administrator
Craig Fugate met with New Jersey

00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:39.994
Governor Chris Christie and
spoke to residents whose homes

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:42.861
were damaged by the storm;
praised the efforts of first

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.861
responders who risked
their lives to protect

00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:45.528
their communities --

00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:46.094
(cheering and applause)

00:02:46.094 --> 00:02:48.161
-- and vowed to continue working
closely with state and local

00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:51.361
officials who are responsible
for leading the storm recovery

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:52.695
and response efforts.

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:55.428
The President:
And we go through tough
times but we bounce back.

00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:58.394
And the reason we bounce
back is because we look

00:02:58.394 --> 00:02:59.961
out for one another.

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:02.227
And we don't leave
anybody behind.

00:03:02.227 --> 00:03:06.328
And so my commitment to the
people on this block, the people

00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:09.594
of this community, and the
people of this state is that

00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:12.895
that same spirit will carry over
all the way through until our

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:13.928
work is done.

00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:15.795
Narrator:

00:03:19.127 --> 00:03:20.928
And thanks again for checking
out your West Wing Week!

00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:23.928
Craig Fugate:
That's two things
that are on right now.

00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:31.127
One is FEMA assistance where
you can call 1-800-621-FEMA.

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.994
And start registering --

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:33.795
The President:
You said do one thing.

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:36.161
Now, what does
"registering" mean, Craig?

00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:37.561
Configure Fugate:
You're going to talk
to a person who is

00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:39.461
going to start getting you
information, find out where you

00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:43.428
live, find out what's going on
and get an inspector out there

00:03:43.428 --> 00:03:45.661
to take a look at your home
and see what the damages are.

00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:47.628
The second thing is for
everybody who has businesses,

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:51.027
boats or other types of
commercial operation, Small

00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:53.961
Business Administration
Disaster Loans.

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:56.061
We'll be working together
to get a center set up here.

00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:59.661
But the thing I wanted to do is
let you know, make the call, get

00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:02.361
started, we can start helping
people find a place to stay

00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:04.561
while we figure out how long
it's going to take to fix and

00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:05.428
repair your homes --

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:06.428
(applause)

00:04:06.428 --> 00:04:10.661
-- whether you're a renter or
a homeowner, make the call!
