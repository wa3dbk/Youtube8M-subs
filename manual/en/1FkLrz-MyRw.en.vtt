00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:35.059
Hey guys, what's up?

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.010
It's Jeff Cavaliere here in the playground.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.280
Not the XBOX, but a playground to bring you
the A-Team workout and we're talking about

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.960
TEAM ATHLEAN here, not those other guys.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.460
The real TEAM ATHLEAN to show you that I was
a fan of that show back in the day.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.320
I think what's most impressive is that they
were resourceful.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.000
Whatever they needed to do, whatever they
needed to come up with to get out of the situation

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.530
they were in, they did.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.890
And i think that for us guys, sometimes we're
out in the park where there's kids, on a Saturday...

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.000
...you've already made your excuse that you
can't get your workout in.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.171
I'm gonna remove that excuse by showing you
that even here, with a set of bars, you can

00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:15.810
basically do whatever you want to do.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.909
So we put together the A-Team workout, I'm
gonna take you through it now.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:26.290
We'll start over here with our two part muscle
up dip pull-up combo.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.310
Alright, so we pull up on top of a high bar
up here, position yourself up high and do

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.670
your dip.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:53.779
[pause]
Ok, about 10...drop yourself straight down.

00:01:53.779 --> 00:02:01.469
[pause]
And 10.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.930
Moving on.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.209
Those were our Murdock muscle pull-up combination.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:20.710
Now coming over here, we're gonna hang from
the bar, get up from the top, abs, push straight

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:34.940
out and come in.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:44.200
[pause]
Next.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.430
Right here we're gonna work the chest muscles,
triceps, core strength.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:58.710
What we're gonna do is come from here, position
our feet low, get into a plank..

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.810
You have to see all your muscles underneath
engaged and working.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:15.400
Now scale and down.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:31.640
[pause]
One more.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.110
About five or six round trips.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.490
Come over here, last one.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.850
The A-Team has Mr X, ATHLEAN Team has Mr X.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.800
We're going to do the Mr X Crunch.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:04:02.920
Grab the bar, feet apart...catch my breath.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.350
[pause]
Try to pause at the top.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:23.000
[pause]
Alright, so a quick circuit.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.490
Get all the guys, get all the catch members,
but most importantly, you've got exercises

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.249
to cover the whole body.

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.150
You can throw in some leg exercises real simple.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.460
One leg, squat variations, jumps or we can
actually jump up the stairs.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:48.150
You can use the park bench over here, you
can do some of your jumps.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.039
Get creative, guys!

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.719
No excuses.

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:56.440
Don't say that you don't have time, don't
say that you don't have access to a playground,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.229
because we all know you do.

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.599
Guys, if you're looking for a way to bring
your workouts to a whole new level of creativity...not

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.030
the same old boring crap, but something that's
going to get you in shape... ...the weather's

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.069
nice, it's time to look good.

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.901
Forget the excuses, get the ATHLEAN-X Training
System and learn a lot of creative ways that

00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:16.901
you can do this.

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:22.009
Head over to athleanx.com, I promise I'll
make it fun, I'll make it effective.

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:39.930
I'll see you guys back here again next week
with a new workout.
