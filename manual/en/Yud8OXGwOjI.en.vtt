00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.170
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: Hi, my name is John Rogers. Welcome
to this series of videos on antique Chinese

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.980
furniture. By the time you get through seeing
them you will be able to differentiate new

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.949
from old furniture. You'll be able to identify
the restoration to old furniture. You'll be

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.890
able to specify the age of a piece of furniture
within about a 50 year band. You'll be able

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.890
to identify restoration, basic furniture construction.
You'll be able to recognize the most frequently

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.280
used woods. And you will also know something
about the symbols, the Chinese symbols that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.030
add so much richness and variety to carvings
and to design. Let me introduce you to my

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.960
friend Yuqing. One of the things I would say
about why Yuqing and I work so much together

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.960
is because I don't know one of the two Chinese
languages. Yuqing is bilingual in Mandarin

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.520
and in English. Yuqing?

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.500
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: Hi, my name is Yuqing Zhao. I
have an antique Chinese furniture business

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.500
in San Francisco. John and I have been doing
business for years. I make several buying

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.530
trips to China every year. so as John said
I'm bilingual and I'm also an expert in Chinese

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.530
antique furniture. And we'll go through later
some pieces to show you what's new and what's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.209
old and what type of wood they are and so
forth.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.179
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: So enjoy and I just hope that you
have as much fun seeing these as we will have

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.099
had in making them. Thanks so much.
