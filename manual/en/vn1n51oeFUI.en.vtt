00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.870
The Tesla program is a very
interesting program because

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.409
the Tesla vehicle being a sports vehicle

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.310
it's very constrained in terms of the
space that's available

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.380
The battery pack it uses is under the floor

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.560
which actually raises the floor

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.019
of the vehicle quite high

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.369
but because it's a sports vehicle
the roof line is very low

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.500
and the seat is

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.990
packaged, has to be packaged in this space

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.850
and so we're

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.970
burnt from both ends really.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.880
So with Model S, it's quite unique

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.990
architecture without an internal
combustion engine in the front

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.450
and a big petrol tank the rear, 
in essence our interior architecture

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.020
lends itself to a lot of imagination, and what Futuris could actually bring

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.950
to the table with this totally new
architecture concept were different ways

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.920
to actually expand on the available space without having the interior

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.700
feel like eat was dissimilar to an
everyday premium luxury sedan

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.190
So our group is

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.260
an applied optimisation

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.460
so we look for

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.770
industry that can

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.620
lead us on projects that are of value to them

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.750
and then we can use l strategies an our
capability in applied optimisation

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.460
to give them a capability that
they wouldn't otherwise have

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.080
the design of the height adjust system

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.250
which Martin's team

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.670
was involved in was key.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.010
But the modularity of the seat was important 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.770
Because it was startup company with relatively low volume production

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.930
A company like Tesla wouldn't want to spend a lot of money on tooling

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.200
but they also want

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.690
the ability in the flexibility to have
seats that can be

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.830
made to do different things

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.430
power height adjust or manual height adjust; seats that go backwards or forwards or tilt.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.810
They want passengers in the rear to be able to put their feet

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.870
safely and comfortably under the seat, so that it feels like a larger car.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.970
So we were constrained in a way that

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.729
automotive seating architectures are usually not constrained.

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.500
So it's a very highly constrained problem

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.780
that's actually a very difficult one to
solve.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.830
So what we're actually looking for

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.450
in both a design and technology
point-of-view was to work with a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.719
company not too dissimilar to our own

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.369
our attention to detail was quite
specific

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.719
obviously the world's first ground-up
electric vehicle required a fair amount

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.709
of attention and Futuris really provided
that as a similar mindset.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.079
The front seat structure

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.159
that Martine's been working on

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.809
is very good at what it does

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.130
it's very lean,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.879
it's very efficient,

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.609
very low-mass, benchmarking is one of
the

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.999
lowest mass

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.909
seats that does, that performs those functions

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:41.889
there is.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.449
From of volume point of view,

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:48.929
it's going to be quite significant
in our our own terms, delivering up to five thousand

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.799
units by the end of this year of 2012,

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.869
and a full calendar year of production
close to twenty thousand units.

00:02:55.869 --> 00:03:00.540
Because it's so efficient and so low-cost which
actually sell it in China.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.260
So we specifically designed two
structures to be low-cost and sold

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.519
in China.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.169
But actually it may end up being that the one we designed from mature market is the one

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.859
that becomes the most popular.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.509
i think its simplicity

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.019
is

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.269
is a beautiful thing actually.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.799
Well to have a concept or an idea to come to fruition and to actually be able

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.540
to sit in a seat that you had a hand in
manufacturing

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.020
is pretty awesome into today's day and age.
I suppose with the technology

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.730
advancement that we've seen in the last
ten and fifteen years, the thought

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.980
process that long ago to have anything
make it in to actual production that the world

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.260
could enjoy was pretty few and far
between. But that accessibility on a

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.970
global scale for any budding design or engineering student

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.859
is a reality now.

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.920
The relationship between RMIT and Futuris is

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.440
of exceptional value to the academics
and to the students. It helps the academics to

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.109
be at the cutting edge of the
technologies that we apply

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.519
and it helps us to be the best practicing engineers that we can be.

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.889
The seat design required a fair amount
of collaboration and of course

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.519
new ideas mix with manufacturing
processes that can bring that to market

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.389
and I'm sure that that RMIT influence had a big impact.
