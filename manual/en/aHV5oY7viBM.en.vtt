00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:17.315
So what we've got here...

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:19.701
We've got the PUMA rigged up with a pen.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.480
The pen can float up and down because

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.400
The table is not exactly flat.

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:26.639
I have taken a DXF (AutoCAD) file

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.852
and converted it to a series of movements

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:29.927
If it works...

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.320
This sould draw a square then some stuff in it.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.563
We are going to give it a try...

00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:51.893
Now it does not do a circle, so what we have is...

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200
100 points on a polygon...

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.270
and that is what we are using for a circle.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.540
Is this the process sheet?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.380
Yeah

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.680
But it din't really work

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Well, it has 100 ponts to process

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.511
But it didn't pick up speed like the last one.

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:09.233
No, I might have to use a different command

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.700
Yeah, see that (simple lines) is still running at 100%

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:17.919
But it is doing the design properly.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.960
So that's good.

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:24.624
Ok, now what we have done...

00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:27.644
we have changed it so that the speed in-between

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.540
will be very much... slower

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.370
We should get a little bit neater lines...

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:55.019
Now here we have 100 points... it can only go so fast...

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.700
this particular section is running 200% speed.

00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:00.753
The rest are all at 20% speed

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:25.733
Oh, we are drawing... excellent!
