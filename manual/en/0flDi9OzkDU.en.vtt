00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.710
How your hour glass body shape can bring a
man to his knees.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.589
An hour glass signifies when time is running
out.

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.329
If you've been blessed with an hour glass
body shape then you're time is also running

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.650
out.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.640
You only have a lifetime to make use of this
perfectly proportioned body shape that you

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.080
have been gifted with.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.140
So how can you tell if you have this perfectly
proportioned hour glass body shape?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.140
Well, you're going to want to take three measurements.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.149
You're going to want to measure your bust,
your waist, and your hips.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.339
Now, if your bust and your hips are roughly
the same circumference, then you were probably

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.760
in hour glass body shape.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.309
There have even been songs written about this
beautiful female shape.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.870
To paraphrase the Commodores and their timeless
song Brickhouse "You are 36-24-36, what a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.969
winning hand?"

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.170
Now that you know your body shape is in indeed
a brick house, you need to know how to dress

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.910
this body shape to maximize your... shall
we say... your assets.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.360
So, here's what to look for when shopping
for items to flatter your hour glass body

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.140
shape.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.830
For shirts, a V-neckline shirt is going to
be the most flattering for you because it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.380
just gives just a hint of cleavage.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.930
A higher neckline is going to make your bust
look larger than it really is and it's going

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.980
to look just proportioned to the rest of your
body.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.860
So, imagine you see like Dolly Parton in a
turtle neck and how disproportioned she would

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.860
look.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.570
That's exactly why you don't want a high neckline.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.840
The V-neckline is going to be the most flattering
for you.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.320
This also applies to cardigans.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.990
Again, you're going to look for the deep V-neckline
and you're going to love cardigans as an hour

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.990
glass body shape.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.160
They should really be as staple in your wardrobe
because they would work well for so many different

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.280
outfits.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.210
For your jacket, you want to look for the
two button option.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.800
Again, that deep V-neckline.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.159
You want the two buttons because again that's
going to accentuate your tiny waist and that's

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.250
going to be the most flattering on you.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.780
For print you want to aim for mid-size prints.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.259
You don't want something that's going to overwhelm
your body.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.480
So, imagine if you had a floral print and
with a giant sunflower all over the dress.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.940
That would be entirely too much and overwhelm
your body.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.780
On the other side, if you had teeny tiny flowers
all over this dress, and you just saw all

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.240
the little dots everywhere, again that will
be overwhelming for you.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.870
So you want to aim for these mid-size prints.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.550
For your coats and jackets, you're going to
want to look for pocket flaps on the hip.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.020
Again, it's going to help to emphasize your
narrow waist.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.390
This one here is a tricky one for people that
are hour glass body shape.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.510
The reason why is because if you're an hour
glass body shape, it's usually difficult for

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.100
you to find pants and wear pants that fit
properly because there is such a big difference

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.430
between your hips and your waist.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.060
So usually they will be tight and fitted around
your thigh and your hip area, and they'll

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.459
be loose around your waist.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.240
So, it's often where it's loose and you have
to wear a belt and it bunges and it doesn't

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.150
look too attractive.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.060
So generally if you are an hour glass body
shape what you're going to want to do is wear

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.430
a longer length shirts.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.810
So I just said, like crotch length shirt.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.209
You can see there how long you want it to
go because generally you wanted to hide the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.490
top part of your pants because like I said
generally if you are an hour glass shape you

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.970
have a little bit of trouble finding pants
that fit properly.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.480
So this length is going to be perfect for
you.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.099
Remember for an hour glass figure you want
to show off all of your great curves that

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.840
you've been blessed with.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.310
But you don't want to add a bulk or you don't
want to do anything to make your perfectly

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.650
proportioned body look unbalanced.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.150
So, all we're doing is we don't have to emphasize
really anything with you.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.160
We can make it look like your waist is even
smaller or if you are already perfectly proportion

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.650
there is not a whole bunch of work to do.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.600
So, if you are an hour glass and you are looking
for celebrities with hour glass body shapes

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.980
that you can use as a style reference, I'm
going to give you a couple here.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.020
You can look at Selma Hayek, Scarlett Johanssen,
or Christina Hendricks.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.569
All of them are hour glass body shapes.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.770
You can look to these celebrities to get a
sense of what will work on your body.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.819
These women are continually less attracted
by men and celebrated in the press for their

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:16.819
curves.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:23.690
I want you to remember that it's a blessing
and not a curse to have an hour glass body

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.780
shape.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.300
You probably already know this but the men
will love you and the women will envy you

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.430
for your hour glass body shape.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.780
And I am going to end this video with another
quote from the Commodors, "Don't worry, I'm

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.380
not going to sing brick house for you and
put you through that torture," but I am going

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.780
to say a line from the song, it says, "Sure
enough to bring a man to his knees because

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.340
you're a brick house.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.180
So go out there and get them, you hour glass
body shapes."

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.480

you.
