OK, here we are with probably the coolest
thing I've ever seen

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.080
coming out of nfc

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.119
technology wise, nfc in a beer mat.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.029
I'm pretty sure blokes everywhere are now
sitting there going 'what a brilliant idea!'

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.429
If that isn't the killer app for nfc what is?

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.639
Basically, from a marketing point of view
you've got your traditional marketing and

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:33.940
branding type stuff going on on the
printed surface but embedded into here

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.859
you have an nfc chip so all I need to do
to read the information is

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.070
place my device on top of it

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.470
and just move it.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.740
And then it will scan it. Now I've stored
no data on it yet so let's have a quick look

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.930
and store some data.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.040
I use tagwriter

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.470
I can create

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.350
a proper web address on to this next,
and all I do now is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.750
scan and store.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.750
Oops, the store failed.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.150
There we go, and you can see on this one
there's 137 bytes that can be stored onto this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.490
particular tag.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.390
Then I can read that information back

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.430
just pass the phone back over the tag

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.840
and it will fire the command, in this case a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.760
website address.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.310
But you can store anything on here. 137 bytes
is going to be good enough to put your

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.360
basic contact information in there,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.210
address,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.750
phone number, or a really long web
address if that's what you want to do.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.860
Another way you can do it is if you store a
short url, a shorter web 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.510
address converted by bitly

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.530
then you can store a bit more information
like getting a contactable phone

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.200
number and details in there as well.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.860
This really is going to open up a world
of new ideas. The idea you could enter a

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.650
competition just while scanning the
nfc while you're sat in a bar is remarkable

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.980
People are really going to get this
especially as we now

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.180
have more and more of these devices finding
their way up into people's hands, you know

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.210
the Samsung Galaxy S3, the Samsung Galaxy Note 2, the new Nokias, any of the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.119
major smart phones coming through,  not the iPhone 5, any of the Apple products,

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.579
we're rocking nfc now, it's only Apple that are holding things back really so everyone,

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.719
next time you're sat in the pub why don't
you give your beer mat a quick scan

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.019
see if it has nfc, and if it hasn't complain
to the landlord and say I want nfc

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.379
in my beer mats with my pint.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.309
Thank you so very, very much Sir.
