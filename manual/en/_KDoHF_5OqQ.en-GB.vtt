A lot of people like taking the fruit facial
as this is natural, nourishing and easy to

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.820
do. Most fruits are rich sources of Vitamins,
minerals and antioxidants which rejuvenate

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.400
the skin naturally.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.860
1. clean the face with baby oil using a piece
of cloth. This would help remove all the external

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.410
impurities.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:01:00.280
2. Apply a finger full of lemon scrub on the
face and rub gently to exfoliate dead skin.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:10.100
Wipe off with a cotton cloth.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:36.890
3. Next, apply the lemon cleansing gel and
cleanse the face well.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.890
Most of the fruit packs are made by blending
soft fruit pulps together to create a thick

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.890
puree and is then applied on the face. In
this fruit facial, we are using primarily

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.530
two fruits: Papaya and Banana. Papaya is a
natural skin exfoliator and anti-aging agent.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.410
Banana is rich in Vitamin C and B6 which is
very important to maintain the elasticity

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.410
of the skin.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.550
It is rich in antioxidants and hence protects
the skin from oxygen free radicals. A natural

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.890
moisturizer, it hydrates the skin well. A
mixture of these can give smooth and supple

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.330
skin.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.370
4. Prepare a fruit face pack with blitzed
Papaya and Banana. Ensure that the Papaya

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:32.560
and Banana are absolutely fresh. Apply this
on the face and leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:03:08.340
5. Wipe it off with a damp cotton cloth and
spray a bit of rose water to the skin.
