00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.010
My name is Tami Eggleston and I'm a
professor of psychology at McKendree

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.780
University and I'm also a member of the
Association for Applied Sport Psychology

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.770
Sport Psychology performance consultants.
It's a long name but basically it means

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.519
that I work with teams and individuals
at McKendree I also work with teams and

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.359
individuals though outside of McKendree
University on all kinds of things and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.949
now recently sports psychology has
gotten a lot broader than just working

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.490
with athletes. Right now there are
actually performance consultants that

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.300
are working with the military working
with people and their jobs and just

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.960
working with people in their lives in
general. In the last month I've actually

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.440
worked with the McKendree University
band to help people kind of deal with

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.100
their stress when there may be getting
ready to perform a big band concert and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.570
I've even gone to some elderly care
facilities and helped older people with

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.620
their memories and what's interesting
it's all the same theories it's all the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.609
same kind of background and techniques
that can help people in sports and can

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.180
also help them and sort of their lives
in general. When people think of

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.720
psychology I think a lot of times they
think about depression and schizophrenia

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.070
and kind of negative things, but
psychologists also study things like

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.230
success and optimism and confidence and
helping you do better in your life, so

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.620
it's not just negative things that
psychologists study Psychologists also

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.610
study really positive things now at
first on the surface that seems kind of

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.410
like okay be more confident set goals be
happier and you'll be more successful

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.060
and that kind of seems kind of simple on
the surface but human beings are pretty

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.080
complex and what's interesting about
sports psychology and positive

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.940
psychology is you can't have too much of
a good thing. So if you're overly

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.490
confident or you're overly optimistic
that can actually cause you problems so

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.900
for example an athlete who is so
successful that they think that they can

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.440
never make a mistake they may not
practice hard enough so then when they

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.800
get ready to actually perform they may
actually start to make more mistakes or

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.360
a business person who's so optimistic
and so confident might actually not make

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.960
any contingency plans so then when
something bad happens in their business

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.560
they're not actually ready for it
because they're so optimistic that they

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.430
never thought anything bad could happen
to them or a politician might be so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.010
confident and so full of self-esteem
that they actually might make mistakes

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.760
that later on could hurt themselves
personally or they could hurt their

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.450
whole country if they make really bad
mistakes. So it's interesting in sports

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.460
psychology positive psychology that
these traits like self-esteem, confidence,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.990
optimism, that sounds so great you
actually don't want too much of but you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.750
also don't want too little of and I
think that's what makes sports

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.370
psychology and positive psychology so
interesting is that complexity of having

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.630
enough to be confident but not having so
much that you're overly confident and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.710
then you don't prepare very well. One
little thing that I think is fun to do

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.100
when I talk to people about what is
sport psychology and how can it help you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.920
in your sport how can it help you in
business how can it help you in life I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.120
have one really simple little thing that
I like to share with people I want you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.530
to kind of imagine a circle and then
another circle and think of anything in

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.370
your life right now business related
maybe you want to quit smoking maybe you

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.060
want to be a better golfer and in the
inside circle think of all of the things

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.990
that you can control think of the things
that you're totally in control of like

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.640
you're breathing your preparation you're
attitude those are all the things that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.690
you're totally in control of and then in
the outside circle think of all of the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.620
things that may be influencing your
business your sport your life but you

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.390
don't really have control of. So that
might be things like the weather that

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.840
might be things like your teammates, or
the other people you work with, or your

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.710
office size, or the price of fuel, or all
these things that are on the outside of

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.060
you and what sports psychologists and
performance consultants say is you

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.740
should spend all of your time on this
inner circle really focusing on the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.250
things that you can control and not
wasting your precious mental energy on

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.910
all those outside things that can make
you a better golfer that can help you

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.180
quit smoking that can make you better in
your business world better in your

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.670
personal life. So that's a whirlwind tour
of sports psychology positive psychology

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.080
and hopefully I gave you one little
piece of the puzzle of this big huge

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.450
picture of sport psychology and positive
psychology.
