00:00:00.262 --> 00:00:01.843
Bradley: Hello this is the future.

00:00:01.843 --> 00:00:02.427
Oscar: Hiya.

00:00:02.427 --> 00:00:04.334
Bradley: Hello the future just passed you.

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:05.790
She was on her phone,
that's why the future

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.510
passed her, she wasn't paying attention.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.014
Oscar: Oh yeah.

00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:12.028
(pop music playing)

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:25.692
Welcome to Translogic
I'm Bradley Hasemeyer.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.235
In 2011 we had the chance to check out the

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.080
Audi A3 e-tron.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.641
At the time it was kind of a concept,

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:34.378
a test bed, and it was pure electric.

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:36.724
Fast forward 2 years and here we have

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:37.777
the Variant.

00:00:37.777 --> 00:00:40.088
It's the A3 e tron plug-in hybrid

00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:42.992
and guess what, you can
actually buy this one.

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:45.770
(pop music playing)

00:00:47.556 --> 00:00:48.831
All right, so we're here with Oscar

00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:52.259
from Technical Development at Audi AG.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:54.677
Today we're in beautiful Santa Monica,

00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:56.870
we're driving the 2014 Audi A3.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.430
This is the e-tron though, this is the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.287
plug-in hybrid.

00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:04.447
Why was it that Audi decided to get in

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:06.204
to the plug-in hybrid now?

00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:08.843
Oscar: Plug-in hybrid
is the most suitable way

00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:11.112
to meet the customer expectations.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:11.937
Bradley: Okay.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:14.120
Oscar: It should support
their every day mobility.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.485
Long distance ranges should be easy to do

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:20.045
and it should be easy to charge the car.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.648
Most important it should be cost efficient

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.412
also, and affordable.

00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:25.383
Bradley: Yeah.

00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:30.043
Oscar: The A3 e-tron
combines all these demands.

00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:32.425
Bradley: Some of the specs on this:

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:36.899
About 200 hp, roughly 260 lb-ft of torque,

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.211
so it's great right
off the line of course,

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.108
like classic electric vehicles.

00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:42.451
Oscar: This is the EV mode,

00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:45.253
but you can also run it in hybrid mode

00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:48.312
where the combustion engine runs together

00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:49.749
with the electric motor.

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:51.031
Bradley: This is the most
power you're going to get?

00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:52.074
Oscar: This is the most power.

00:01:52.074 --> 00:01:53.033
Bradley: You've got
engine giving full force,

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.500
you've got battery giving full force.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.527
Oscar: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:55.527 --> 00:01:57.191
This is the moment when you have all

00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:01.355
260 ft-lb of the system torque.

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.834
This is the mode where you can gain

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:07.196
the top speed of under 38 miles per hour.

00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:10.962
(music playing)

00:02:11.178 --> 00:02:13.500
Bradley: You guys are bringing the new

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.607
A3 this specifically is the e-tron.

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:18.172
Tell me a little bit about this car.

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:20.555
Luca: We believe in Audi
that this is actually

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:22.418
the right solution in the next years

00:02:22.418 --> 00:02:25.937
to avoid that the consumer
gets any compromise

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.177
in terms of performance, in terms of range

00:02:28.177 --> 00:02:29.662
or in terms of package.

00:02:29.662 --> 00:02:31.093
Bradley: Is there anything
in your development

00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:33.195
of the technology that is different than

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.637
just your basic plug-in hybrid?

00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:39.751
Luca: This car is electric range of 50 km

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:41.501
and you can charge a
battery in something more

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.101
than 2 hours.

00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:43.368
Bradley: Full charged?

00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:44.843
Luca: This is basically the story.

00:02:44.843 --> 00:02:47.482
The story is that we tried
to listen to what the people

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:50.236
really need and they say
they don't want to have

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.557
any compromise in range, they want to

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:54.162
go on vacation without any problem.

00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:55.610
They want to charge the motor very quickly

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.798
and they still want some
exciting performance

00:02:57.798 --> 00:02:58.895
of the car.

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:00.934
Bradley: Something that's
unique about this is,

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:02.840
when people buy this
car you're giving them

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.948
a wall charger included.

00:03:04.948 --> 00:03:07.476
Luca: We tried to facilitate
the whole experience

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:10.039
of the consumer, so we
have to try to get this

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.882
the [unintelligible]
down so that the people

00:03:11.882 --> 00:03:15.181
don't have, let's say,
they don't fear the change.

00:03:15.464 --> 00:03:17.365
(poop music playing)

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:19.306
Oscar: You have also
a so-called hold mode.

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:25.945
This ensures that you can
store the electrical range,

00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:28.977
like now 29 miles, to ensure that you can

00:03:28.977 --> 00:03:31.654
run the last 29 miles on your destination

00:03:31.654 --> 00:03:33.061
purely electric.

00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:34.828
It doesn't charge the
battery but if you want ...

00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:35.797
Bradley: That's the charge mode?

00:03:35.797 --> 00:03:36.909
Oscar: That's the charge mode.

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:37.529
Bradley: Yes!

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.123
Oscar: You just have to press this button,

00:03:39.123 --> 00:03:40.883
charging switched on.

00:03:40.883 --> 00:03:41.797
Bradley: Okay.

00:03:41.797 --> 00:03:43.067
Oscar: From now on the combustion engine

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:46.372
uses the electric motor
to work as a generator

00:03:46.372 --> 00:03:48.587
to generate power for the high voltage

00:03:48.587 --> 00:03:50.276
battery that we've got here.

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:54.869
(pop music playing)

00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:57.256
Bradley: You guys are also introducing

00:03:57.256 --> 00:04:00.256
the new MMI interface on this vehicle

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:03.695
and it will be in subsequent
vehicles as well, right?

00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:04.866
Luca: That's right.

00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:06.320
The A3 is the first one to have this new

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.954
technology.

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:08.266
We have a very, very flat screen,

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:09.622
a very strong video processor

00:04:09.622 --> 00:04:11.230
and you've got a lot of services possible

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.880
from Facebook to Twitter, etc.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.611
This is the first car
with the phone [GLT],

00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:17.516
technology.

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:18.622
Oscar: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:18.622 --> 00:04:20.222
Luca: We know especially
for the young generation

00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:22.154
this is a must.

00:04:22.154 --> 00:04:24.885
Our idea is obviously that we can scale

00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:26.564
the technology in many,
many [unintelligible].

00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:30.335
So you're not forced to buy a specific car

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.428
to benefit of this technology.

00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:34.381
We will be able to, and largely offer

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:36.673
so that if you want a hatchback,

00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:37.710
if you want a ...

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.132
Bradley: Right, right, right.

00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:40.649
Luca: ... an SUV you can get it.

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:42.222
That's the idea, that's
also the advantage.

00:04:42.222 --> 00:04:43.589
Bradley: It's like Mr. Potato Head,

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:45.604
the plug-in hybrid Mr. Potato Head.

00:04:45.604 --> 00:04:46.419
Luca: Yeah that's right.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.148
Bradley: What about a plug-in hybrid R8?

00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:49.306
Luca: Cool, no?

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:50.572
Bradley: That would be cool.

00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:51.982
Oh, so that's not a no!

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:55.688
That is not a no, let's
put that on the record.

00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:57.119
I love it, it's great.

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:00.440
I'll expect delivery in 2015 when it goes

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.620
on the market.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.549
I'll wait, i'll wait for it.

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:05.102
It's still going to be about a year

00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:06.424
before you can get your hands on one,

00:05:06.424 --> 00:05:08.305
but it's good to see the e-tron program

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:09.748
finally taking off.

00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:12.076
We're certainly paying
attention to what Audio's

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:13.381
got next in line.

00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:16.080
An R8 e-tron anyone?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.876
All right, for Translogic
I'm Bradley Hasemeyer,

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:19.911
see ya next time.

00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:22.928
(pop music playing)
