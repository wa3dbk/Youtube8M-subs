00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.290
The drones are coming!

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.340
And they're

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.750
making renewable energy?

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:14.259
You know, the trouble with wind power is that
it needs to be windy.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.590
And if it's not you really only have two solutions
- go out and find the wind, or create it.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.570
So, how does one create wind?

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.520
Well that's why I've cooked up this huge vat
of chili.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520
Just kidding.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.029
Actually, there's a company called Solar Wind
Energy Tower that has a solution.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.200
They propose building towers out in the desert
that will suck up hot, dry air.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.790
Now that hot, dry air goes up the tower until
it hits the top, where they add in water vapor,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.090
making that air heavy.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.710
And then the air rushes down at speeds upwards
of fifty miles-per-hour, until it hits turbines

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.910
which then will generate electricity.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.830
The best place to harvest wind energy tends
to be the coastline.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.460
And if you're like me, you like to get your
shade from a nice beach umbrella, not a noisy

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.390
300-ft tall windmill.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.580
Luckily, Makani Power, an engineering firm
run by a California wind surfer has come up

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.650
with a pretty cool idea.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.900
They have a wind harvesting drone attached
to a rope, which sounds pretty radical if

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.900
you ask me.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.750
The most effective part of a turbine blade
is the tip.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.250
So the Makani Airborne Wind Turbine travels
in a vertical circle in the same path as the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.680
tip of a conventional turbine blade.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.120
Wing mounted rotors catch the rushing wind,
which is converted into electricity by small

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.850
generators and sent back to the ground via
the tether, which is a conductive cable.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.270
So why is this any better than a traditional
windmill?

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.410
The same reason it's better to live in an
RV than an Egyptian pyramid.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.450
It takes a lot less material to make, and
it's portable.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.070
Mental note.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.770
Really need to work on my analogies.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.940
It's possible that these Makani turbines could
be flown out over the ocean where winds are

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.530
particularly strong.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.870
Now the electricity they generate could just
be sent down to buoys floating in the ocean

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.479
and collected later to be sent back to land.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.870
Now of course this doesn't mean we should
just abandon our traditional wind harvesting

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.480
strategies, we just have to make them smarter.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.110
Which is what companies like GE are doing.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.459
You see, they're adding sensors to wind turbines
to collect oodles of data, and turn it into

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.511
dynamic action on the turbines themselves,
so if the wind conditions change, the turbine

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:18.579
can automatically adjust the tilt of the blades
and maximize efficiency.

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.290
Clearly, none of these solutions are perfect,
which is why we're going to have to continue

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.079
to innovate in this space.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.180
After all, when it comes to renewable energy,
the winds of change are always blowing.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.159
And that leads us to a question.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.909
What renewable energy source do you think
is the most promising?

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.630
Is it solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.950

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.040
I think they will "renew" your interest in
the future.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.499
It's an energy joke.
