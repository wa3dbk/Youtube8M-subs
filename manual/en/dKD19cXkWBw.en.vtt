Hi everyone, and welcome to Biology
Professor. Today, I want to talk about

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.100
genetic recombination in bacteria.
Bacterial cells are pretty cool because

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:21.349
they have the ability to take up foreign
DNA and actually incorporate it into

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.069
their own genetic profile in order to
make the protein that foreign DNA

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:33.050
encoded for. This can give bacterial cells
extra functionality, for example, they

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.820
might gain new DNA that codes
for toxins, that codes for virulence

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.199
factors, that codes for antibiotic
resistance, and the bacterial cell can

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.109
actually gain new functionality through
this way.  There are three different

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:58.329
mechanisms by which bacteria can obtain foreign DNA. These are transformation,

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.379
conjugation, and transduction. I have
videos on all three of these mechanisms,

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:12.080
but today, let's talk about first one:
transformation. Transformation is when a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.130
bacterial cell takes up foreign DNA from
its environment by bringing that DNA

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.980
from its extracellular environment
across its plasma membrane. The ability

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.240
of the cell to take up DNA across its
plasma membrane in this way is called

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.080
competence.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.649
Many types of bacteria are naturally
competent and they can do this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.640
process with ease. Examples of such
bacteria include species of Bacillus,

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:05.579
species of Staphylococcus, and species of Streptococcus, and of course there are

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.700
well-known human pathogens within each
of these types of bacteria. So now let's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.319
look at this mechanism in a little more
detail. Here we have our recipient

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:32.910
bacterial cell.  This here is its chromosomal DNA. So this

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.060
is the DNA that it has had since it was
produced by replication of previous

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.569
bacterial cells. But there might be
foreign DNA in this cell's environment. I'm

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:54.739
going to draw this foreign DNA in red.
This is DNA that is just going to be

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.799
floating through the cell's environment.
It might, for example, be from a previous

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.819
bacterial cell that died and lysed, and
pieces of its of this donor cell's DNA

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.519
are now just floating around the
environment. The recipient bacterial cell

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:23.250
can actually take this DNA across its
plasma membrane so that now this DNA is

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.209
inside the cell, then through the process
of recombination,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.940
the bacterial cell has its chromosomal
DNA that has recombined with this

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.710
foreign DNA so the foreign DNA has now
been integrated into the chromosome.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.950
There might be some additional foreign DNA that was not integrated and it's

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.490
just going to be broken down. Also,
the bacterial DNA that was replaced by

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.330
this foreign DNA is also going to be
broken down and now we have this

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.730
genetically transformed bacterial cell.
This new DNA that's taken up can give it

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.640
different functions, for example there
are species of E. coli that actually

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:33.600
produce Shiga toxin.  This is a toxin that
they obtained from the bacteria

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.040
Shigella, so Shigella produces
shiga toxin, some E. coli cells can

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.860
produce it too because they're able to
go through this genetic recombination

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:49.450
process. This DNA could also encode for
virulence factors, for example one virulence

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.710
factor might be a capsule. If
the bacteria can produce a capsule

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.470
covering its outer cell wall, this may
enable it to hide from a host immune

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.410
system, and so this is why the process of
transformation is very important to

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.870
bacterial cells in that it can enable
them to survive in different

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.970
environments they might not have been
able to otherwise.
