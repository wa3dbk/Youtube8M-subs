00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:10.292
Should I study computer engineering?

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:14.863
You’ll certainly get a lot better pay than
if you’re trying to do web design.

00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:19.723
And for 99% of people, you’ll make a lot
more than bloggers, too.

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:22.743
I’ve heard programming is hard.

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:26.483
Programming can be hard if you have trouble
planning the logical flow of a program or

00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:27.973
mapping out data flow.

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:32.343
I’ve heard that computer engineering is
essentially programming.

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:35.313
It depends on where you go to school.

00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:39.753
Computer science may be programming whereas
computer engineering is hardware.

00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:43.203
Do you have to be a math geek to do computer
engineering?

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:44.593
No.

00:00:44.593 --> 00:00:48.473
Being an engineering type is a necessity for
computer engineering.

00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:51.313
I kind of guessed from the major.

00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:55.662
Computer engineering is good for those who
like technology, who are detailed and technical

00:00:55.662 --> 00:00:57.142
in nature.

00:00:57.142 --> 00:01:00.412
And it could attract those who want to make
a killing like Steve Jobs.

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:04.672
Or it could be those who want to design the
next killer app.

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:09.213
Is computer engineering for those who want
to design the next generation of the iPhone?

00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:15.213
That’s more the purview of electrical engineers
than computer engineering majors.

00:01:15.213 --> 00:01:17.793
Can computer engineers design hardware?

00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:22.893
Yes, but most of their work and their classes
focus on the software.

00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:25.132
Do I have to be good at math?

00:01:25.132 --> 00:01:27.573
You need to understand some math.

00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:32.333
Now spaghetti like flow charts, that’s something
you need to be good at.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.803
To understand the logic flow.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:39.173
And the variable references in object oriented
programming and handling and transformation

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:40.173
of data.

00:01:40.173 --> 00:01:45.963
Oh, and you need to be able to track the classes
you create and class inheritance.

00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:50.823
What do you study in computer engineering,
other than logic and diagrams?

00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:53.732
Several different programming languages.

00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:58.492
And you’ll learn some math, technical writing
and the standard educational core.

00:01:58.492 --> 00:02:02.332
Do I have to worry about my job being outsourced
to India?

00:02:02.332 --> 00:02:07.393
Microsoft tried that, and they got Windows
7 and Windows 8 out of it.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.932
Do not worry about code monkeys taking your
job just yet.
