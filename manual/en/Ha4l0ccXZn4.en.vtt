00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.790
The Thai Clinch.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.860
The clinch is designed so that when two people
in close, you're going to basically try and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.260
manipulate and wrestle with the person's head
and neck and at the same time throw the knees

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.430
to the mid-section, and if possible at times
to the head.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.470
With your partner, we're going to start with
the hands up high.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.770
Now, when we enter into the clinch we never
want to enter in, okay, square because our

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.570
opponents could, you know, throw a jab across,
down the middle, and the next thing you know

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
you're on the ground.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.830
So when we go in, they call it threading the
needle which means, basically, when I go in,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.420
I enter in with my left hand first okay?,
establishing some kind of hold with the left

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.510
hand okay?

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.831
And then putting my right hand up okay, and
then either throw your knees or try to come

00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:55.750
in on the inside and get in a good position.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.280
There are a couple of positions that you don't
want to be in, okay?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.650
And the most dangerous one is here with your
head down.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.000
If your head is down, you really don't have
much to pull your head out, okay?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.430
You're going to be taking a lot of knees in
from the mid-section if you decide to close

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.170
the distance to grab the waist, they can take
the waist out and keep you, you know, in that

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.330
position for pretty much as long as they want.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.330
Okay?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.050
Another position you don't want to be in is
if your arm is locked here, they've got you

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.450
around the neck.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.090
Now your right side or left side is going
to be taking a lot of knees.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.090
Alright?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.090
So, one drill that you can do to get used
to, you know, keeping your head up is - hands

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.770
up, we thread the needle, we come in, now
with your partner you want to rise up on the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.430
balls of your feet and keep your head up,
shoulders up.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.770
From that position, we just pommel, okay?

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.130
Your partner comes on the inside with both
hands, alright?

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.080
I pommel in, and in, and then he comes in
and in.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.200
Alright?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.759
So, once you've got the gist of that, you
can take that and go a little bit quicker

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.060
with it, but always making sure when you enter
in, head up nice and high.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.060
Okay?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.900
And then try and pommel your hands in one
by one, trying to get control of the head.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Alright?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.499
Now, when you come in for the head, you want
to get your elbow in the middle of the chest

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.409
and get your hand on the crown of their head.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.660
You don't want to be in the back of the neck
because now he can bring his head back and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.430
he's not in danger anymore.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.650
Once his head comes down and you're on the
crown of his head, if he tries to bring his

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.730
head up bring your head up, okay?, his head's
not going anywhere, alright?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.700
Another good position in the clinch is one
hand on the crown of the head and the other

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.829
hand on the shoulder.

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.040
That way, if he wants to try and get his left
hand in okay?

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.890
Whichever way he tries to get the left hand
in okay?, I lock him off.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.529
If he comes in the outside, I can open him
up more on the outside if he decides to come

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.249
and deliver knees to the outside.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.809
From this position, it's very easy to go from
here to the head okay?, which puts him in

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:09.829
even more of a dangerous position.

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:10.829
Okay?

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.940
And that's just a basic run through of the
Thai clinch.
