00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.180
Let's see Cosplay

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.580
What Cosplay means is costume play

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.020
Cosplay to me play is just a way to have fun and express yourself

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.379
It's an escape from reality you know we get to be who ever we want to be

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:43.979
like the sky is the limit

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.500
To me is a unique form of expression

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.040
it's making a 3D work of art around a living figure

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.470
and then expressing yourself in a unique way 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.559
Anime and Comics and woah people actually come together and do this kind of thing that's crazy.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.170
It's kinda like its own little theater show
basically you're playing your character

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.010
you have to act as your character you have to be your character

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.630
I think that most people Cosplay just because we get to put on a different mask you know

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.850
we walk around every day in regular life
and we have to wear masks for every occasion 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.940
and then whenever we have our Cosplay on even though it is another mask you know

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.960
it's  one of the truest masks you can have to your soul.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.880
I started Cosplay actually one Halloween when I really wanted my mother to dress me up Sailor Moon

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.530
and it was very very terrible but

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.710
it was a great experience because I felt
that thrill of

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.479
bringing to life a character and being a
different persona

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.059
just for an hour or an afternoon 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.380
Let us begin...

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.140
HURAH!!!

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.200
I've always wanted to be the knight in
shining armor

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.640
now I get to do it for real 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980
And this gets a bad rep but people Cosplay for attention, I Cosplay for attention

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.360
there is nothing wrong with Cosplaying for attention. Attention is good.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.010
Being able to get yourself out there

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.120
and you know promoting you as a
person and you know

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.579
your career and that's the great thing cause I know a lot of people who

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.760
Cosplay aspire to be artists or you know

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.920
do costumes in you know in movies
and stuff

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.970
so it's really cool to meet people who
do that too

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.790
and just like also learning from them
because it'll help you in the long run

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.960
I like the challenge for one but you
know it's always just a blast like

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.510
wow man it's like you actually were able to make that you know just the look on people's faces

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.329
when you tell them like

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.870
this isn't bought, I made this.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.290
And in a way its healthy for you to go beyond
your comfort zone

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.590
and to learn more about yourself in that
way.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.780
But there is also that sense of escapism that ability to

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.709
be yourself add your own flavor to a
character and build it

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.549
and be something new you know it's like
recreating yourself

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.589
every time with every new character with
every new piece. 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.959
You don't have to make something that
wows and pops

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.450
you just got to do something that makes you happy that you made it

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.650
you're gonna love it you're gonna meet such amazing people you're gonna be

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.070
opened up to such an amazing opportunities

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.420
There are some people who aren't comfortable in their own skin

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.450
Cosplay is a way to embrace who they
really are

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.470
I Cosplay to put on a good show

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.980
its like a walking theater production to me.
