00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:03.909
are called little boy is broke all the
washington boy's been call the hero for

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.660
letting teachers you know their
classmate had weapons in his back this

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.839
is a strange story

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.579
jute justin sanders says he doesn't
really know the kid who is accused of

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.369
bringing night and a gun to school but
they rode the bus together but that he

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.239
saw the boy trip to what getting off the
bus the boys backpacks build and allowed

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.939
just in to see that there was a knife in
the back and uh... this scared justin so

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.289
he told teachers and then they were
actually able to find that there was

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:38.329
also a gun and ammunition there was a
plan to kill his ex-girlfriend and hurt

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.410
seven others do ten-year-olds have
ex-girlfriends i guess so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.240
what with fifth grader within
expropriate niya

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.490
how serious the pink suit and he's
building used to kill our well i think

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.880
she was cheating

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.190
did she give some other kid her
chocolate milk at lunch and i don't know

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.450
what happened but in any case it almost
led to the potential death of over five

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.620
people i guess we can laugh about it
since this didn't happen

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.840
i'm shocked shock lewis that this little
boy was able to tell his teachers what

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.840
was going on without an anti response
you can see if the class

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.159
i mean you you have to assume that in
this case it was probably something his

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.890
parents said to him earlier

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.170
that uh...

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.660
them constant sir

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.130
i don't know report this or maybe you
know i may be after numerous school

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.140
shootings as some teachers in faculty
take it upon themselves to say

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.670
you know if you ever see something like
this you're listening to me or the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.780
parents might have here yeah aniket

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.229

circumstances if you accidentally had

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.829
that kid luis which he talked about many
times

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920
and most likely would love the kit

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.410
it are we on track so far

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.610
or on the same page the ok thank you

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.110
in you wanted to keep the kids safe ms
their any circumstance where you would

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.200
say that a kid

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.780
take this country the disco

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.130
are now

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.260
nothing you can imagine

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.720
i mean i must i knew that every other
kid in that school had a gun

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.360
but it's a gun freeze up

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.020
notes on what do you think

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.960
years saying but would i recommend to
the kid too

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.829
bring a gun illegally into school

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.719
only if there was like an apocalypse
like children of men the road type of

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.999
apocalypse now in a normal situation but
i will add that if i accidentally had a

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.549
kid i would presume can with there

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.450
would you uh... but would you can't even
really going to school through an

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.809
apocalyptic children of men like
situation point
