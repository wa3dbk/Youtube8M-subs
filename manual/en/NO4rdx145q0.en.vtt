Hey Guys!

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.580
So Thanksgiving was yesterday

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.120
and we posted a video called Things That Ruin Thanksgiving Part 2

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.900
where basically we had to make a whole Thanksgiving dinner as props for the video shoot

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.200
and my parents actually came into town and cooked a whole another Thanksgiving dinner

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.380
so now we have like..

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.360
way too much food

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.120
And rather than eating leftovers until all the food goes bad

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.000
and we have to throw it away and waste it I thought

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.300
Why not just pack it up right now while it's still good and give it to someone who needs it more than we do

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.500
And today that's what we're gonna do

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.320
We just finished up packing all these meals and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.200
we're going to deliver them to the homeless people of Las Vegas which if you don't know there's alot of them

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.540
And yes we already called the Las Vegas Police Department to make sure it was legal to do

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.720
because sadly it's illegal to feed the homeless in certain states believe it or not

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.500
because the last time I did this in a video called Chrismas Ninja where I gave away food and presents to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.760
kids and random homeless people

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.960
sadly I got a lot of people saying it was illegal to do and I shouldn't be doing that

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.080
which I personally think it's ridiculous and discourages helping other people

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.120
But what ever we got the OK so we are good to go

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.400
But you know what's even more fun than that?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.560
Feeding the homeless and not getting caught as a Ninja

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.460
This is the wrong way

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.280
This is still the wrong way

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.940
It's almost there..

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.640
There we go

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.260
This is like a vulnerable spot for a NinjaI they gotta fix this

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.800
I'll just walk around like this I guess

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.780
Who wants the butt?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.500
Here we go. First one

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.720
*Laughter*

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.260
Did I do it?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.620
Yeah, good job bro

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.640
Have a good night man

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.760
Have a great night!

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.400
What's up bro?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.240
He got hella scared

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.400
Yeah, i know he's hella screamed..

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.700
He was like agh, have a great night!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.640
Was he happy?

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.880
He seemed happy

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.080
Happy thanks!

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.900
I know. We can give another

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.880
He was like "Thank you so much I don't have much but here can I give you this?" I was like "Sure"

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.480
Yeah he gave me some papers

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.700
He was really appreciative actually

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.460
Happy Thanksgiving!

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.460
Happy Thanksgiving to you, Happy Holidays!

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.300
Thank you!

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.640
Thank YOU!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.960
Happy Thanksgiving!

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.540
I hope you guys like the food!

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.140
We're just trying to find people to give food that need it more than us so..

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.120
That was a Ninja!

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.540
I can't believe I got visited by a Ninja!

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.040
And he snuck right up on you huh?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.240
Yeah he- I could not see him coming!

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.740
Haha! Happy Thanksgiving!

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.580
Happy Thanksgiving to you and the Ninja dude

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120
