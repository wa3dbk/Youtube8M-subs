00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.419
In the past, our ancestors they fished...

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.760
...for dolphins, turtles and whales.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.920
But these days, they are 
no longer going to the high seas...

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.360
...and there are motorised canoes
which come here to sell us turtles.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.640
Over the past 50 years...

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.560
...many kinds of key species have disappeared,
such as the white grouper and the dorado.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.920
On the other hand, turtles have certainly not disappeared.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.280
They have actually increased in number
because they are protected.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.120
This means that catching turtles these days...

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.360
...is easier than catching a white grouper.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.960
So the overfishing has negatively impacted the fisheries...

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.280
...and has led people to hunt turtles more aggressively.
