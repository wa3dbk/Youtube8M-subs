Hi everyone,
this is Jillian Beck.

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:03.958
Welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:08.708
Today I'll be showing you my new
favorite protein shake recipe

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.417
which is a protein Frappuccino.

00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:12.792
Now, I know it's pretty simple.

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.250
It will take 2 minutes to make
but we're always looking for,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.458
you know, new, delicious protein
recipes--protein shakes because

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:22.208
we--as you and I both
know, we probably have

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:23.667
a protein shake every day.

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.417
And so this one I think is
great because a lot of people

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:28.333
love to go to Starbucks.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:32.208
They love their Frappuccino
and this is, to me,

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:34.667
if not just as
good, it's better.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:39.542
So I love this new--new protein
shake that I've come up with.

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:42.208
The secret ingredient is PB2.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.875
I've done instant coffee
in the past in my shakes

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.667
and then recently just added
a tablespoon of the PB2

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.083
and it was mind blowing.

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:51.458
So I'm really
excited to show you this.

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:54.292
What you're gonna need is
your vanilla protein powder.

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:56.417
Now I use whey isolates.

00:00:56.417 --> 00:01:00.667
It's the leanest in
terms of macros, very clean.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.667
I love BB.com whey
isolate so check it out.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.542
And we're gonna go with that and
then we need 1 tablespoon of our

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:10.542
PB2, which if you haven't heard
of this, you need to get it.

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:14.750
Two tablespoons of this stuff
equals forty-five calories,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.083
only one point five--
did I read that right?

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:19.458
One point five grams of fat.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.667
So it's a great alternative if
you love peanut butter but don't

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.667
need all the fat
and the calories.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:25.708
So we've got that.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.458
We've got our instant coffee.

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:31.875
You could also use like expresso
grounds, which is an awesome

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:35.000
flavor and kind of gives
it like a grittier texture

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.292
but it's really good.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.708
So you can do that as well.

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:41.500
And then some almond milk and
then water and crushed ice.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.667
So we'll start with our protein.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:49.792
We'll go ahead and we'll
had 1 tablespoon of the PB2.

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:53.250
Just go ahead with that.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.333
Then 1 teaspoon of
our instant coffee.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:00.583
I just got Nescafe but
any brand will really do.

00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:03.167
So go ahead with that.

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:05.875
And then a splash
of almond milk.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.417
You don't really measure but
usually it's about a fourth

00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:11.500
a cup or a splash,
I don't know.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.958
It's not a whole lot so
just to add kind of

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.583
like a creamy texture.

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:17.417
Based on your macronutrient
needs, you can add a full cup

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:18.583
if you wanted.

00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:20.792
I always go with
unsweetened vanilla.

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:24.417
A full cup of this stuff equaled
30 calories so I mean it's--

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:27.667
if you want a full cup, it's
totally fine but I'm just doing

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.833
a splash and then I'm
adding water and a bunch

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:31.792
of crushed ice, which is key.

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:39.000
So I'm gonna go over
here and add that.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.208
All right, so we've got our
protein, PB2, instant coffee,

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:45.875
almond milk, water
and crushed ice.

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:48.250
We'll go ahead and put the
top on that and I use the magic

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.792
bullet just because
I love that it makes

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:52.750
individual protein shakes.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.792
I use it once or twice a
day so just gonna use that

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:58.708
to blend this bad boy up.

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:01.208
So.

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.083
Okay, and there we go.

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:18.125
You have to check out the
consistency of this 'cause

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:23.708
it's so frothy and amazing
and absolutely delicious.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:28.125
And I put a straw in there,
drink it like it's a Frappuccino

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.833
but to me it's better.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:31.083
I've got my protein.

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:35.125
It's under probably 150 calories
because the whey protein's so

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:37.417
lean and then you just got
a splash of almond milk.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:40.875
No calories in the instant
coffee and then only

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.500
1 tablespoon of the PB2.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.042
So you're well under 150
calories, plenty of protein,

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:49.042
very low carb, if any,
from your protein powder

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:50.292
so you're set to go.

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:51.792
I hope you guys enjoy.
