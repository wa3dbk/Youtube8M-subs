00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:09.689
Here we will explore the process by which money is created.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:12.642
Let me introduce you to John Kenneth Galbraith.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:16.769
He taught at Harvard University for many years and was active in politics,

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.902
serving in the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson;

00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:26.757
and among other roles served as United States Ambassador to India under Kennedy.

00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:31.801
He was one of a few two-time recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:36.688
Clearly a pretty accomplished and stand-up kind of guy. About money, he famously said:

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:41.762
“The process by which money is created is so simple that the mind is repelled.”

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:47.947
What he meant was, even after hearing how money is actually created, you won't want to believe it.

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:56.494
So if you don’t get this segment on the first pass, don’t worry, because money creation is truly a bizarre thing to ponder, let alone accept

00:00:57.041 --> 00:01:01.461
But not because it's difficult. Any normal 10 year old child could understand it.

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:04.702
First, let’s look at how money is created by banks.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:10.955
Leaving aside for now where this money comes from, suppose a person walks into town with $1000 and,

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:19.335
luckily, a brand new bank with no deposits has just opened up The $1000 is deposited in the bank,

00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:28.367
and now the person has a $1000 asset (their bank account) and the bank has a $1000 liability (the very same bank account).

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:37.816
Now, there’s a rule on the books a federal rule, that allows banks to loan out a proportion, a fraction, of the money they have on deposit to others.

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:43.289
In theory, banks are allowed to loan out up to 90% of what people have on deposit with them,

00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:50.622
although, as we’ll see later, the actual proportion is much closer to 100% than 90%.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.440
For our example here we'll use 90%.

00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:59.977
Regardless of the actual amounts, because banks retain, or reserve,

00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:05.375
only a fraction of their deposits in reserve, the term for this process is “fractional reserve banking.”

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:12.144
Back to our example. We now have a bank with $1000 on deposit, and banks do not make money by holding on to it –

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.040
rather, they make their living by borrowing at one rate and loaning at a higher rate.

00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:27.344
Since any bank can loan out up to 90%, the bank in our example manages to locate a single individual that wants to borrow $900, and so the bank loans then $900.

00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:30.807
And so the Bank loans them $900.

00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:36.972
This borrower then spends that money by giving it to another person, perhaps his accountant who, in turn,

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:44.332
deposits it in a bank Now it could be the same bank, or a different bank, but that really doesn’t change how this story gets told at all.

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:48.648
So let's keep it simple and make it the very same bank.

00:02:49.184 --> 00:02:59.444
With this new deposit, the bank has a fresh $900 to work with, and so it gets busy finding somebody who wants to borrow 90% of that amount, or $810

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.430
And so another loan, this time for $810, is made, which gets spent and

00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:10.961
re-deposited in the bank, meaning that a brand new, fresh deposit of $810 is available to loan against.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:18.475
So the bank loans out 90% of $810, or $729, and so it goes,

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:26.049
until we finally discover that the original $1000 deposit has mushroomed into a total of $10,000.

00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:34.404
Did you follow that? We went from a stranger ambling into town with $1000 but now there's $10,000 floating around town.

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:40.495
Is this all real money? You bet it is, especially if it’s in your bank account.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.150
But if you were paying close attention, you’d realize that what we’ve actually got here are three things.

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:55.996
First, we’ve got $1000 held in reserve by the bank $10,000 in total in various bank accounts, and $9000 dollars of new debt.

00:03:56.212 --> 00:04:00.822
The original $1000 is now entirely held in reserve by the bank,

00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:09.165
but every new dollar, all $9,000 of them, was loaned into existence and is “backed” by an equivalent amount of debt.

00:04:09.474 --> 00:04:13.024
How’s your mind doing? Is it repelled yet?

00:04:13.347 --> 00:04:20.977
You might also notice here that if everybody who had money at the bank, all $10,000 dollars of them, tried to take their money out at once,

00:04:21.347 --> 00:04:25.575
that the bank would not be able to pay it out, because, well, they wouldn’t have it.

00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:29.817
The bank would only have $1000 hanging around in reserve. Period.

00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:37.551
You might also notice that this mechanism of creating new money out of new deposits works great…as long as nobody defaults on their loan.

00:04:37.738 --> 00:04:40.908
If and when that happens, things get tricky..

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.240
If the debt defaults exceed the fractional reserve lending rate, it's a complete disaster.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:55.080
For now, I want you to understand that money is loaned into existence. Conversely, when loans are paid back, money ‘disappears.’

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.313
In out example where our happy little town has $10,000 floating around greasing the skids of commerce,

00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:07.336
if everyone paid back their loans, the town would have to limp along on just the original $1000 dollars.

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:11.500
This is how money is created, and I invite you to verify this for yourself.

00:05:11.698 --> 00:05:20.178
One place is the Federal Reserve itself, which has published a handy comic book from which I drew this fine example.

00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:27.597
You may have noticed that I left out something very important here, and that is interest.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.130
You might be asking yourself, Wait a minute, where does the money come from to pay the interest on all the loans?

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.611
If all the loans are paid back without interest, we can undo the entire string of transactions,

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:43.878
but when we factor in interest, there suddenly isn’t enough money to pay back all the loans.

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:52.046
Clearly that is a big hole in this story, and so we’ll need to find out where that comes from.

00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:57.123
In doing so, we’ll also clear up the mystery of where the original $1000 came from.

00:05:57.414 --> 00:06:03.584
So what was the purpose of all this? Why did we spend these past few minutes studying the mechanism of money creation?

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.540
Because in order to appreciate the implications of our massive levels of debt,

00:06:08.731 --> 00:06:13.201
you have to understand how the debt came into being. That’s one reason.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:20.960
And the more important reason is related to all those exponential graphs we viewed earlier in Section 3. But we’re not quite there yet.

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:26.096
First we need to travel to the headwaters to find the original source of all money.

00:06:26.307 --> 00:06:31.007
Where did that original $1000 dollars come from in our banking example?

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:36.335
To find out, we need to go visit the Federal Reserve; the place where money springs into existence.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.690
