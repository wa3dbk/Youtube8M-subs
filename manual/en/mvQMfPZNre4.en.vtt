&gt;&gt;John: We very much know

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.286
that authentic assessment is having
a positive impact on the students

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:22.526
for the simple reason they know
where they are at any given time.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:24.446
Whether it's a project-based
assessment,

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.876
a performance-based assessment,
these are very much more authentic

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:30.616
and kids find it much more
difficult because we're asking them

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.596
to not learn a procedure
and spit it back out again,

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.626
but to understand a concept
that procedure represents.

00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:39.736
&gt;&gt;Andy: Exhibitions are an exit
requirement at School of the Future,

00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:44.146
and the idea of the exhibitions is
to write eight to ten-page papers

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:48.556
that use the habits of mind
to make informed arguments

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.826
about a particular topic.

00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:53.996
So for instance, a math student
might write a math exhibition looking

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:55.556
at the geometry of bridges.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:59.976
A social studies student might
write an exhibition on analysis

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.946
of advertising towards children.

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:05.196
Whatever they do, it always has
to have these habits of mind,

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:08.966
point of view, evidence,
connections, significance,

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.586
alternative points of view.

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:14.346
What we're really trying to do in
each subject is to teach these habits

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:18.266
of mind through this authentic
process of writing a paper.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.086
So for instance, Esther,
who's the ninth grade teacher,

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:25.216
has incredible exhibitions that
come regularly out of her class.

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:27.626
Things that you would be shocked.

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:31.226
These are ninth grade exhibitions
that are extremely well-written, 15,

00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:35.146
20 pages exploring controversial,
thought-provoking stuff

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:37.736
in rigorous intellectual ways.

00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:41.536
&gt;&gt;Esther: So if we're doing
exhibitions, first obviously we work

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:44.766
on essential question,
thesis, outline,

00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.106
but then they write
the first argument

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.656
and then we revise the first
argument until it's ready to go.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:51.746
Second argument, third argument,
and then at the end of the year,

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:53.606
you obviously have the whole paper.

00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:55.806
And in the same way, if
we're doing graphic novels,

00:01:55.966 --> 00:02:00.966
first they'll write a story, and
then they turn that into a script

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:03.766
so they have all the dialogue ready,
and then they do a storyboard,

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.886
and then they make the
actual graphic novel.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:10.526
All those things in between will
grade the script that they write,

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:13.426
and will give a little
grade to the storyboard.

00:02:13.426 --> 00:02:15.666
We'll see how they're
progressing in these skills,

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:18.846
but it's all towards
the same final piece.

00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:22.726
&gt;&gt;David: There was a particular
unit that she did in ninth grade

00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:26.566
where her teacher had students
do a graphic novel just

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:30.106
to see how my daughter could take
that assignment and create something

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:34.066
of enormous beauty and
force both intellectually

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:39.746
and artistically was just-- it
really just amazed all of us.

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:43.466
&gt;&gt;Andy: That's where I sort of see
all of the art of what we're trying

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:46.466
to do at the School of the
Future, which is to constantly stay

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.516
within the domain of the
students' authentic interest,

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:53.696
but to help them ramp up that
interest in those intellectual skills

00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:55.676
so that they can achieve
more powerful things

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.976
than they would have been able to
do just left to their own devices.
