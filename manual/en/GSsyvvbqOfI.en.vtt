00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.670
hey I'm going to do a little video about
sharpening knives there's a ton of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.410
videos out there but I didn't find one
that was aimed at someone who has never

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.680
sharpened a knife before and doesn't
know where to start and what to get so

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.410
let me just show you a few different
stones and then I'm going to tell you of

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.219
all the stones I use the simplest and
quickest way to put an edge on a knife

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.860
I'll show you the best stone I have but
I also have never used it because I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:50.250
don't need to this is a Norton stone
this requires lubrication oil you could

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.280
use water but like a light oil on the
other side what it does is help to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.430
slough off the metal filings as you're
sharpening but it's never been used and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.500
there's a reason for that because I've
never needed to use that here's another

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.520
one this is a round one this is you keep
it in your pocket you could use it for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.960
axes you could carry it in the woods
with you it's got a rough side and a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:28.200
medium side and I haven't used that
either I've got a couple of harder

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.250
stones here and these are to put the
final really fine polished edge and I do

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.759
use these a lot this this is an Arkansas
stone here real limited comes from

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.390
Arkansas there's only one place they get
this kind of stone and it's in Arkansas

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.850
and I think this is synthetic this one
here this is another Arkansas stone this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:03.869
is just one you can carry in your pocket
but it's been used so this is a pretty

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.360
good setup here this
is a what I use but the stuff I use is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.320
over here and I'll show you that I
haven't got to this yet and the only

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.960
reason my habit is because I wear these
out before I get to this this is a three

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.330
stone set up here you got rough

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.580
you got your medium side here and then
you have your Arkansas your fine fine

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:42.330
stone here but of all this stuff this is
what I use this is a cheap Harbor

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:51.830
Freight stone rough medium and then this
is a kind of a fairly expensive stone

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.650
Arkansas stone all the stuff I have this
is the stuff I prefer because it's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.150
simple basic easy I've got the point
where I can really quickly put a nice

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.280
sharp shaving kind of edge on my blades
I use it for my kitchen knives and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.760
hunting knives and I've even used it for
chisels now I'm going to show you how to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:25.410
start if you've got a really bad edge
one that's never been sharpened maybe

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.459
it's got dings and dents and nicks in it
you might have to look at it under a

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.510
with a magnifying glass to see but
sometime if you have a blade that's got

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.630
a fairly decent edge on it you might
want it on to start with a rough you

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.380
might want to start with a medium side
but let's just say that you have a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.370
really bad blade or a really bad edge on
each blade is a little different

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.930
depending on the thickness but that
would determine what angle you want to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:06.060
hold this at generally a the angle would
be between 15 and 25 degrees and for

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.099
those that may not know what degrees are
that would be

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:18.350
90 degrees that would be 45 and that
would be 22 and a half so between 15 and

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.590
25 degrees is generally what you want if
you had a blade with her that was really

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.759
thick you would want to go towards the
25 degree angle and a thin blade you

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.960
would want to go towards the 15 degrees
so now I'm going to show you the basic

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.870
strokes before I do that don't let me
tell you as you're pulling this towards

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:46.190
you what happens is the the very edge of
this blade you get this birth this curve

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.979
that curves over if you're stroking it
this way that curves that away it's not

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.370
something you can see with your naked
eye but you can feel it with your finger

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:02.360
to do that and what you're doing is
you're sharpening that burr away and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.880
you're sharpening it until there's no
more burr until the edge is fine and

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.830
there's no more burr
so you know people do this differently

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.389
and I'm going to show you the way I do
it and I and I'm sure I'll have people

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.440
told me that they do it differently or
I'm doing it wrong but I'm going to show

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.789
you how I do it and this is just to get
you started and once you get once you

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.060
put an egg's on a blade like this you'll
be hooked the next thing you know you'll

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.229
be sharpen and everything you've got
here we go I do five strokes on either

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.690
side and I pull it towards me lots of
people go in both directions I just go

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.970
in one direction and here's how I do it
I rest my fingers on the blade and I

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.560
pull it towards me like that

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:59.690
as you come to the curb in you want to
lift up a little bit I think that was

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:16.009
five and flip it over and you go on the
opposite direction this blade right now

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.460
I can shave with it so I'm just showing
it under that might take a hundred

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.039
strokes on this
to get past all your Nicks and dings on

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:28.470
your blade so then I turned it over once
I got past that once I got the beginning

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.250
edge that I wanted I would turn it over
go to the fine edge and what this does

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:55.139
let's rub out all the scratches on the
edge that the rough side put on and then

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.120
I would be done with that oh and when
you get that kind of an edge on it when

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.620
you've got all the scratches rubbed off
this stone which is a really fine fine

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:12.029
hard Arkansas stone what this does is
polish that edge and I you can see when

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:17.400
you've got it right it'll shine and
here's something else as you're doing

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.800
this you sort of get into a groove and
you develop a mechanical you don't even

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.879
think about what you're doing no it's
just it becomes automatic muscle memory

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:33.240
and you get a feel for when that bird is
disappearing you can hear it and you can

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:41.219
feel it and I can't think of anything
else to tell you but if you didn't know

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:46.830
how to sharpen and you didn't know what
you get just this stone will go a long

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.860
long way and sharpen your kitchen knives
that's a that's a cheap dollar stone

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.870
Harbor Freight it's just got a rough and
a medium side and if you really wanted

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.729
to go big-time and put a razor-sharp
edge on it you would get a hard Arkansas

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:08.750
stone thanks for watching
