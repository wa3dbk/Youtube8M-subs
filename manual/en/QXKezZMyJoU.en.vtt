00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.220
Salutations celestial sight seers!

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:17.110
Thanks for the last three years of watching
and sharing this program.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.800
I'm David Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky;
what's up this week?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.780
How many stars do you see in Orion when you
look up at the Hunter constellation at night?

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.770
Most of us can see the 3 belt stars and 4
shoulder and knee stars, even from heavily

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.270
light polluted areas.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.180
But there's a lot more that could be visible
here; for example, where Orion's sword region

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.730
is, his head, shield held up towards Taurus
or his club extended over his head, as many

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.770
of those stars are 3-rd, 4-th, or even 5-th
magnitude.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.480
Regular viewers of these videos know that
Eyes on the Sky talks about light pollution

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.329
reduction strategies.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.040
This week is about measuring light pollution,
and everyone can do this: It's not only easy

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.320
to do, it's necessary to understand the extent
of light pollution around the world.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.710
The Globe at Night is a campaign designed
to do just that, and taking part is as simple

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.360
as looking up at the night sky, and relaying
to Globe at Night what you see -- even if

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.950
it's cloudy!

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.890
Here's how it works: Go outside, and let your
eyes adapt to the outdoor illumination in

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.970
your area, doing your best to shield direct
lights from your view.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.720
Then take a look at one of several major constellations
in the sky, and report what you see (even

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.070
if it's just clouds) with simple to read star
charts that best match what's up there.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.900
Most people know the constellation Orion for
example -- or at least have seen it, even

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.110
if they didn't know what it was.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.110
The three belt stars nearly intersect the
celestial equator, so Orion is visible from

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.960
nearly every location on Earth humans live,
in both the northern and southern hemispheres.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.540
For those unsure where and how to start, when
you go to the Globe at Night website, click

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.180
on the "Observe" link.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.430
That will take you to a page that details
the 5 simple steps to take next: Finding the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.750
constellation to observe, determining your
latitude and longitude, when to view, matching

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.340
up your view of the sky with the provided
star charts, and then reporting your data

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.709
to Globe at Night.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.340
It's that easy!

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.749
And if you have an Android smartphone or tablet,
it's even easier than that.

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:22.590
Download the free app "Loss of the Night,"
and follow the simple instructions.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.709
Make sure you have GPS turned on so that the
app can accurately assess your location, the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.809
just tap on "Start Observing Stars."

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:35.430
A circle with an arrow will appear, and guide
you towards progressively dimmer stars in

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.569
the sky.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.269
It prefers seven measurements, so keep inputting
whether you can see a star or not until one

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.129
is too dim to see.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.260
Then enter that information, and you're done!

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.090
It only takes a couple of minutes of time.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.559
What's great about The Globe at Night campaign
now is that it has been extended to all months

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.700
of the year!

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.069
You can submit observations either by smart
phone using simple arrows pointing to visible

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.279
stars, or use the star maps provided on the
globeatnight.org website.

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.510
And this year, you can choose from more than
just Orion, Leo and Crux.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.599
Southern hemisphere observers can add Scorpius,
Sagittarius and Cetus to their options, and

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.260
northern hemisphere observers can submit observations
using Hercules, Cygnus, Pegasus and Perseus.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.379
With so many options, why NOT help out with
this effort to measure the extent of light

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.379
pollution?

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.569
More data means we can more accurately assess
the problem, and then work to reduce it.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.769
Of course, your own efforts to actively reduce
light pollution and light trespass are needed

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.249
as well, either by installing motion sensors
for outdoor lights, using shields to keep

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:46.049
lighting aimed down at the ground, or using
specialty light bulbs in post lamps to ensure

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.200
lighting goes downwards and reduces glare
at the same time.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.439
Every little bit helps!

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.419
Along The Ecliptic: Mercury is rising in the
western sky just after sunset, though it will

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.290
be better placed next week, so stay tuned
for spotting the innermost planet then.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.930
Jupiter wedges it's way in between the two
twins of Gemini, sauntering it's way slowly

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.290
towards the feet of Castor.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.590
The Moon, Mars and Spica all gather together
on the morning of January 23-rd to share the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.500
same 6 degrees of sky with each other.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.480
Two mornings later, the slimming crescent
Moon stops by to see Saturn, less than a degree

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.690
and a half from the ringed sixth planet.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.100
And just before sunrise, Venus has veered
to the other side of twilight, and will be

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.780
a "morning star" for the next 9 months or
so.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.790
That's all for this week.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.291
Keep your eyes on the sky and your outdoor
lights aimed down, so we can all see, what's

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.291
up.

00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:49.380
I'm David Fuller, wishing you clear and dark
skies.
