00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.700
[Intro]

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.600
Alright, today I’m going to show you how
to replace the starter motor on a 1998 Toyota

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.610
Tacoma.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.070
The starter motor is actually here underneath
the passenger side wheel well, right back

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.340
there.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.470
Make sure that when you take the wheel off
to get access to that starter motor behind

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.590
the wheel well, that you support the truck
at more than one point so you have a back

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.590
up.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.870
We don’t want any flat do-it-yourselfers
out there.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.030
If you look at the replacement starter that
I just bought, there are only 2 bolts that

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.060
hold it in place; right here on the bottom
and then up here at the top as well.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.340
When you’re looking at it from the inside,
you see that bottom bolt down there?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.300
It actually comes through the other side and
screws into the starter motor so there’s

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.370
nothing to ratchet off on this side, you just
have to take the bolt out from the other end.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.690
So now I’m going to go underneath and show
you what the bolts look like coming into the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.690
back of the starter.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.900
So there’s the wheel well coming underneath
the truck.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.290
And we got the transmission here.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.079
So the first bolt is going to be this guy
right here.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.780
It’s a 14 millimeter; so undo that guy.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.610
And then way up in there, right here, there’s
another 14 millimeter bolt that we’re going

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.210
to take out as well.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.090
So I’m going to unscrew both of those bolts
and pull them out.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.979
This one’s not going to have room to pull
out so I’m just going to bring it up until

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.100
this bracket and then it should be unscrewed
all the way from the other side.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.119
Then the starter motor has 2 connections on
it.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.290
You can see this guy right there.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.320
I’m going to take off this other side right
here that’s just clipped in that I just

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.650
undo from the back side.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.230
To get a little more leverage with your wrenches,
you can see it’s up there attached to the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.430
bolt and I have 2 wrenches hooked together
and I can move them like this.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.180
It will give me an extra foot of leverage
on that bolt so I can break it loose.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.170
So before I get too crazy disconnecting things
on the starter, I’m going to go ahead and

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.531
remove the battery connection; the negative
battery terminal, so that I doesn’t start

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.790
sparking on me or anything when I start working
below.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.390
And now that that’s done, I’ve already
popped off that little plastic piece.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.689
It was sitting just like this up underneath
the starter on that little bolt right there.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.399
That’s a 14 millimeter.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.520
So I’m going to unscrew that and pop off
that connection from the starter.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.400
And then there’s one more connection on
the other side that you can barely see.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.700
It just plugs right into this little plastic
connection on the starter so I’m just going

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.459
to undo that as well.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.870
That will get rid of all the electrical components
from the starter and allow me to pull it out

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.950
from the transmission.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.350
There’s a shot with it disconnected.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.650
Got that nut off and then that little wire
just pops down off of that bottom part.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.430
The little plastic connection is down there
with it as well; it’s popped off the starter.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.980
Remember that if you try to do this with your
vehicle hot, you’re going to have a bad

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.480
time because these things are right up right
next to the bolts.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.720
Now I’ve got those two bolts out from the
sides of the starter.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.700
That hole for the starter is pretty worthless
because the starter comes out better down

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.879
here anyway, so I pulled it down out by the
axle and that is it.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.460
So there we go.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.270
Now I’m going to take the other starter,
put it back in next to the axle and try to

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.489
mount that boy back into place.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.349
The new starter is in place, bolted in.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.450
Got the two wire connections down at the bottom
all put in place.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.400
Make sure that you don’t over tighten that
bolt down at the bottom, or that bottom connection

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.769
will just twist right off and you’ll have
to get back in there and attach a new starter.

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.840
So make sure that you don’t over tighten
that at all.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:43.700
The battery connection’s screwed on again
and we’ll give it a test start.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.700
And we’re good.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.720
Now all we need to do is put the wheel back
on and we are good to go.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.910
If you have any questions about the painted
calipers, or the LED light bar, or the truck

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.310
box, I will link each of those videos at the
end of this one.
