00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:15.786
Last year, the BMW 1-series had an easy ride. The Audi A3 was very old and the previous A-class was for different people.

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:22.937
But, now, there are new competitors from both sides. This new A3 for example. Build on the new MQB-platform.

00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:33.053
And of course all know drivetrains. Designwise, Audi played it safe. Looks once, you see an Audi, Look twice, you see which one.

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:38.726
I think Audi overdelivered, sometimes I have to look four or more times to see which model it is. 

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:54.483
Something you don't have to do with this new A-class.  No longer a small MPV, but a nice hatchback. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.184
So lets see if that 1-series has problems on other issues as well.

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:16.123
Inside the Audi it isn't a surprise either. Very clean, very empty. All is concentrated in the TFT-screen.

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:21.424
But the ergonomics are great, because the MMI-system works fluent. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.840
Nice new gimmick, just write down your adress. Works even better than earlier in the A8.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:53.200
Nice, that writing, but you can do it even faster... {GIVES ADRES}

00:01:52.211 --> 00:02:03.772
Easy piesy. the ergonomics are ok, but not as good as in the Audi. There are some mistakes in menu-movement.

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:12.654
But it does look better. Look at those air-vents. really SLS AMG-Style!

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:44.954
Right now only 3 engines for the A3. more will follow. Right now two petrols and one diesel. 

00:02:45.327 --> 00:02:50.193
Now we drive the 2.0 TDI with 150 with a manual gearbox. 

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:57.075
That gearbox is very nice, one of the best in this class. In a GTi I would rather have this than a DSG. 

00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:10.317
And that engine has quite some power. 150 ps but even more torque. And that is available throughout the rev-range. 

00:03:12.263 --> 00:03:19.596
Just fire it up in 6th gear and it goes. And that is better than the competition in this class. 

00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:46.691
This Benz does have a automatic gearbox, one with double clutch. It doesn't work all that good. 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.690
It doesn't make the right gear-chioce at points. For example, it remains in first gear far to long. 

00:03:54.283 --> 00:03:59.257
But if you need a lower gear, it waits to long to shift back. Shame. 

00:04:02.324 --> 00:04:14.548
The engine: a 136 PS 1.8. A little noisy, but power enough. 

00:04:17.984 --> 00:04:24.611
the drive then. Not exciting, it seldom is in an Audi. But it is good. It is annoyingly good tough.

00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:29.034
 the body moves a little more than the A-class, but the steering is more direct. The feedback could be better tough. 

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:36.566
So you get the same middle of the road effect as with a Golf. Only this is the middle of the premium road. 

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:43.400
You could easily do 200.000 km a year and be fine, but it never is a drivers car. 

00:04:46.825 --> 00:05:04.096
 And that is what the Benz does accomplish. It is more focussed than the A3. It is less comfortable though.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.619
The traction seems a little better and the body has less movement in left-right movement.

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:27.434
enjoyed youreself? Well no. But I am ever annoyed either. That Audi is just such a good car. German perfection all the way.  

00:05:28.388 --> 00:05:35.102
It all fits: engine, interior, ergonomics, gearbox, comfort. Then you get out and look at it. Looks like the previous one. 

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:51.573
The Benz has some faults. Gearbox could be better, ergonomics as well. But is does look nice. Both in- and outside. 

00:05:52.322 --> 00:05:55.542
And it drives more fun. --True, but if you consider that the main point, you should include the BMW. 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.487
Lets do that for the magazine. Deal!
