00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.959
We are the Mario Brothers.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.159
Mario Brothers Team and we´ll conquer the race with our super bullet.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.259
In almost every competition, the villain is missing, right? 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.559
So, a villain from our time, at least mine, El Ecolóco, from Odisea Burbujas.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.459
The Department of Public Security of the Estate of Jalisco, participating at the best events.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.159
Let me introduce you to Guzmán Duck, if you want to take his statement. He´s been reluctant, he doesn´t want to talk.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.159
We were playing Angry Birds when we heard about the race and we said this is the concept.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.159
This is the car from the Matehuala Handsome Boys.  Cutting-edge technology.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.159
And we got this from a Bald Eagle of Alaska.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.159
I´m Coluchi San and this is my car, Tiger.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.000
Tigeeeeeeeeeers!

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.000
It´s difficult … A big challenge for the pilots but we are ready.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.900
Filth!

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.500
Trash!

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.100
Rock!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.500
Well, the strategy is not to be afraid.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.400
Don´t crash.

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:17.000
Don´t slow down.

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.001
Survive.

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:19.500
I think that only half will finish.

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.000
Fat ass birds! Fat ass birds!

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:56.501
Can I go again?

00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:02.501
Great experience. Recommended for everybody.

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:04.501
-Didn't see anything
-We flipped over

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It felt great!

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:09.500
The race was awesome.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.501
Filth, trash and Rock! Filth, trash and Rock! First Place!
