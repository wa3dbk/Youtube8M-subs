Hi, I'm Bruce Marnie and on behalf of Expert
Village in this segment we are going to see

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:11.509
how to scale a saltwater fish. The basic steps
in scaling a saltwater fish is to lay the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:18.110
fish on its side on a cutting board, holding
the head with the commercial scaler or a spoon

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:28.220
in your hand stroke the fish starting from
the tail up towards the head like this. If

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.250
you were to use the spoon you would do basically
the same technique as such stroking with the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.800
edge of the spoon towards the head of the
fish. You will notice a problem with scaling

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800
is that all of the scales fly all over the
kitchen and make a mess everywhere we can

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.149
mimize them mess of flying scales in the kitchen
by simply moving the fish into a sink filled

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.900
with cold water. Be sure that your sink has
an adequate particle trap in the drain because

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.210
you don't want to let the scales go down the
drain after your finished and you have to

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.869
drain the water out of the sink. So we will
move the fish into the water completely submerging

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.679
it and just continue the scaling process under
water in your kitchen sink. All the scales

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.149
just float off into the water and eventually
collect in the sink trap in the base of the

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:28.850
sink.
Continue scaling all the way up to the edge

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.679
of every fin right up to the edge of the fin
here. But be careful not to poke your finger

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.429
on the fin rays of the fish especially on
the dorsal fin where the rays can be very

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.869
sharp. That's why the scaler has a fairly
long handle so that you can reach those areas

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.899
without endangering your fingers or your hands.
Keep the fish underwater and just keep stroking

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:02.601
uniformly towards the head of the fish until
all of the scales are removed. Turn the fish

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:10.560
over and do the same thing on the other side.
Starting from the tail work your way towards

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.440
the head. Once all of the scales are removed
you should be able to run your hand from the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.530
tail towards the front of the fish towards
the head without feeling your fingers grabbing

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.840
on any scales. The fish should feel very smooth
at that point.
