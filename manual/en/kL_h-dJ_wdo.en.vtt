00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.530
Hello young people.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.630
Ice rafted erratics near Mattawa, Washington.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.910
Erratics, boulders that do not match the local
bedrock.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.449
The local bedrock here in central Washington
is brown.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.680
Layers of basalt, lava rock.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.180
And yet we've got these big light-colored
boulders.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.670
Granite and metamorphic rocks that dot the
landscape.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.590
How did they get here?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.980
Erratics are usually associated with glaciers.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.199
Ice-sheets bringing these boulders to an area.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.250
But here at Mattawa, we are 60 miles south
of where the ice-sheet used to be in north

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.609
central Washington.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:56.859
North of Wenatchee.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.510
So this is not from glacial activity.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.200
This is from Ice Age floods ripping off pieces
of that ice-sheet and carrying these boulders

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.409
down here.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.409
Ice-rafted erratics.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:24.310
Let's go a little further south in the Pasco
basin and look for more of these guys, O.K.?

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.159
How about this beauty?

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.260
We're on the lower slopes of Rattlesnake Mountain
near Benton City, Washington.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.960
This is argillite, a metamorphic rock that
used to be shale.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.030
One point five billion years old.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.750
This thing's like twelve feet long, it's angular.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.299
The Ice Age floods brought this boulder here.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.240
This is Rocky Mountain geology brought to
south central Washington.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.970
Rafts of ice, icebergs floating in the water
carrying boulders like these.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.759
This guy either fell off of it's ice-raft
or the iceberg got into some quiet water,

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.549
stranded, melted and left the rock.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.710
Regardless, this boulder has been sitting
here for at least 13,000 years.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:32.050
Ice-rafted erratics in south central Washington.
