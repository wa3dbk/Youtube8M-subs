Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.290
[pause]

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.820
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.880
Another frequent question I get from DermTV
viewers is: why does my skin

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.519
stay red after it heals? Look, we all get
minor injuries to our skin, cuts,

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.000
scrapes, burns, even minor surgical injuries
such as after I’ve taken a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.659
mole off. But probably the most common injury
to your skin is probably an

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.410
acne blemish. So, normally within a week or
two, the scab is gone, the skin

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.860
is healed, it’s nice and flat - but it’s
pink and normally it will stay

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.219
pink for maybe a week or two. But sometimes
that goes on for many weeks or

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.160
even months and that’s really annoying,
especially on your face where

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.530
you’ve had pimples because you don’t want
that redness to be visible. So,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.370
what’s going on here, why is this happening?
Anytime the skin is injured,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.339
obviously it needs to repair itself and to
do that it needs to bring

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.711
additional nutrients in to make the new cells
that repair the skin and to

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:05.530
take away the debris. Well, how do you get
those additional nutrients in?

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.770
By widening the supply lines. The supply lines
are the blood vessels. They

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.869
may start out like this but then they enlarge
like that to bring so much

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.329
more supplies and nutrients in. Additional
blood means the skin is redder

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.250
and so you see this redness and it persists.
When the repair is finished,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.630
the supply lines, the blood vessels, should
shrink back down so the redness

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.100
goes away. But you know something? Those blood
vessels often are verklempt

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.970
and they don’t know they’re supposed to
get smaller and they remain

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.719
enlarged. The extra blood that they bring
isn’t harmful but it’s annoying

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.079
to see the redness. So what can you do to
get rid of that extra redness

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.719
that persists? The easiest way at home is
just to do it with compresses,

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.600
especially milk and water compresses. The
milk has protein which is very

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.890
soothing for the healing skin and the compresses
work by evaporation. The

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.810
evaporation causes a cooling of the skin and
anytime the skin cools it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.600
constricts those blood vessels to hide the
blood and the skin gets less

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.220
red. Another way to do it is to buy an over
the counter cortisone cream. 1%

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.740
hydrocortisone has a chemical that actively
constricts those blood vessels

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.180
and decreases the redness. And if neither
of those are helping, you can

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.410
always see your dermatologist who can remove
the extra enlarged blood

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.470
vessels with a laser. One more way to take
care of it: why not just cover

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.020
it or camouflage it with foundation? If you’re
going to do that, try to get

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.860
a foundation that has a green tint in it because
green is opposite to red

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.510
on the color wheel and it camouflages and
hides it immediately.
