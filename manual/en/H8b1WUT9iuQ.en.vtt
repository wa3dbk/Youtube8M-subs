Hi, my name is Lauren Horner and I'm an
attorney with Jones Ward PLC

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.350
My practice area includes drugs and devices in class action litigation. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.980
We heard breaking news

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.810
that nutritional supplements sold by
some of the biggest names in the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.720
industry do not contain

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.500
the ingredients listed on the label. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.681
The retailers include GNC, Walmart, Walgreens, and Target. 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.199
The affected supplement appear to
include ones that were sold under

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.580
their private or store brand labels

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.329
What's worse, some of these supplements were found to contain known allergens

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.000
like wheat and bean ingredients. As a result, people who have an allergy to such

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
ingredients could become seriously sick or even die as a result of making these supplements. 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.730
The supplements may include: echinacea, 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.329
garlic, ginkgo, biloba, ginseng, 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.300
saw palmetto, St. John's wort, or valerian root.  

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.000
As a result the New York Attorney
General has issued cease-and-desist letters

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.569
demanding that these retailers stop
selling adulterated nutritional

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:17.090
supplements immediately

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.360
If you have recently purchased
store-brand in echinacea,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.580
garlic, ginkgo biloba, ginseng,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.569
saw palmetto, st john's wort, or valerian root

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.039
from either GNC, Walmart, Walgreens, or
Target, 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.410
I'd be happy to discuss your rights with
you. You can contact me

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.349
attorney Lauren Horner at 888-595-2922

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:44.679
Or you can email me at Lauren@JonesWard.com. 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.170
