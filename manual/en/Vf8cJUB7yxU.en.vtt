00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.166
- WHEN I WAS 18 YEARS OLD,
I WAS SELLING VACUUM CLEANERS,

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.966
AND AT THE SAME AGE,
OUR NEXT GUEST

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.966
HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED
A POTENTIAL TREATMENT

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:07.966
FOR BREAST CANCER.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.633
HER NAME
IS SARA SAKOWITZ.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:11.533
SARA, COME ON DOWN.
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.533
[cheers and applause]

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.966
HI!

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.300
- OH, MY GOD.
- HI, SARA.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.200
[cheers and applause]

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700
HOW ARE YOU?
- THIS IS A SURPRISE.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.266
- SURPRISE.
- OH, MY GOD.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.066
- YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST COMING TO A TAPING?

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.100
- YEAH.
- YEAH, NO.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.533
WE WANT TO TALK
TO SOMEBODY LIKE YOU,

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.833
WHO IS WORKING
ON CURING CANCER.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:37.300
I MEAN,
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.366
YOU'RE 18 YEARS OLD,
AND YOU'RE WORKING ON A--

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.266
SO HOW--
YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT, RIGHT?

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.800
- I AM.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.266
- AND SO HOW DID THIS COME UP,
THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS?

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.500
- SO MY FRIENDS KIND OF--
THEY TELL ME I LIVE

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.700
THIS CRAZY DOUBLE LIFE

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.033
BECAUSE, BY DAY,
I'M A FRESHMAN AT COLUMBIA.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.600
I'M STUDYING
BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.400
AND THEN AT NIGHT,
I GUESS WHEN EVERYONE ELSE

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.533
IS GOING
TO FRAT PARTIES,

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.666
I'M GOING
TO MY CANCER RESEARCH LAB,

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:03.400
PUTTING ON A LAB COAT,
AND RESEARCHING BREAST CANCER.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.100
- WOW, AND DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE
IN YOUR FAMILY

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.933
THAT YOU--THAT--
WHAT SPARKED THIS?

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.966
- SO WHEN I WAS NINE,

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.366
MY COUSIN DIED
FROM BREAST CANCER,

00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.933
AND THAT WAS REALLY
THE FIRST TIME

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.666
I HAD EVER, I THINK,
ENCOUNTERED DEATH

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.200
SO CLOSE TO MY FAMILY,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.433
AND I FELT THE IMPACT IT HAD
ON EVERYONE AROUND ME.

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:22.733
AND SCIENCE WAS ALREADY BIG
IN MY LIFE,

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.100
AND I THOUGHT I NEEDED
TO UNDERSTAND,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.533
REALLY, THE SCIENCE
BEHIND CANCER

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.033
TO GET PAST,
I GUESS, THE SHOCK.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.200
AND THEN
WHEN I TURNED 16,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.833
I STARTED AT MY FIRST
CANCER RESEARCH LAB,

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.366
AND THAT WAS KIND
OF THE BEGINNING.

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.466
- WOW, IT'S AMAZING.

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.666
SO YOU WERE JUST DRAWN
TO THIS.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.666
AND HOW DOES
YOUR TREATMENT WORK?

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.400
- SO BASICALLY
EVERYONE HAS GENES,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.100
AND GENES ARE KIND OF LIKE
ON-OFF SWITCHES,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.300
AND AGAINST CANCER, GENES CAN
ACTUALLY ACT LIKE AN ARMY.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.933
SO EVERYONE HAS GENES
THAT CAN PREVENT THE BLOCK--

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.700
OR PREVENT THE SPREAD
OF CANCER.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
BUT WHEN CANCER--
OR WHEN CANCER STARTS,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.600
A LOT OF THESE GENES
ARE ACTUALLY SWITCHED OFF,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.366
SO THEY'RE TURNED OFF.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.400
AND SO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.600
WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING TO DO

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.133
IS TURN ON THESE IMPORTANT
ANTI-CANCER GENES,

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.166
AND WHAT MY TREATMENT,
OR THERAPY, DOES

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.633
IS ACTUALLY PREVENT
THE SILENCING OF THOSE GENES

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.200
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.500
SO THE HOPE IS
THAT IT CAN PREVENT

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.833
THE PROGRESSION
OF CANCER.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.800
- YEAH.
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.566
[cheers and applause]

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.900
SO...

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.366
[applause]

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.433
COULD IT--IS THIS
JUST FOR BREAST CANCER?

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:27.300
COULD THIS WORK
FOR ANY AND ALL CANCER?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.933
OR ARE DIFFERENT CANCERS
TREATED IN DIFFERENT WAYS?

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:31.933
- SO THE MOST EXCITING PART
OF MY RESEARCH,

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:33.266
I THINK, IS THAT

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:35.333
WHERE OTHER THERAPIES
HAVE FOCUSED ON,

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:38.133
YOU KNOW, SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
OF SPECIFIC CANCERS,

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.666
MY--THE MECHANISM
THAT UNDERLIES MY THERAPY

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:42.200
IS NOT ONLY FOUND
IN BREAST CANCER.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.666
IT'S FOUND
IN EVERYTHING

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.200
FROM LUNG CANCER
TO COLON CANCER.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.600
AND THE CHEMICAL
THAT I ACTUALLY--

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.266
I USE TO BLOCK THE PATHWAY
IN THE FIRST PLACE

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:52.400
WAS FIRST INTRODUCED
TO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CANCER,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.733
LYMPHOMA,

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:56.533
SO I'M REALLY HOPING
THAT THIS TYPE OF THERAPY

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:58.366
CAN BE EXTENDED FROM LYMPHOMA
TO BREAST CANCER

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:00.133
TO MANY OTHER TYPES
OF CANCERS TOO.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:01.666
- SARA, GOOD FOR YOU.
IT'S AMAZING.

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:02.900
- THANK YOU.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.433
- THAT'S AMAZING,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:07.566
18 YEARS OLD.

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.366
YOU ARE CHANGING THE WORLD.
- THANK YOU.

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:10.866
- SO THIS YEAR,
WE ARE PARTNERING

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:13.033

AND THEY'RE COMMITTED
TO HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:16.300
PURSUE CAREERS

FROM CURING CANCER
TO CREATING APPS,

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:21.000
CODING IS A WAY
TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.466
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW ABOUT,

00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:23.633
IT'S CODING,

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:25.500
SO I'M GONNA DO SOME CODING
RIGHT NOW.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.700
I WANT TO GIVE YOU
SOMETHING.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.966
ANDY, BRING OUT
MY NEW COMPUTER, PLEASE.

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:33.800
[laughter]

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.266
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLUG IT IN.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.100
[laughter]

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.500
LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE EVERYTHING
READY TO GO.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.533
WE--GOOD TO GO?
OKAY.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.700

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.500
JUST TAKE A LOOK
