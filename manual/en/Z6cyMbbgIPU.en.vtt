00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.630
YOU AND WE'LL DO THAT COMING

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.970
UP.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.070
ERIKA.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.200
ERIKA: THANKS SO MUCH.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.240
WORCESTER FIREFIGHTERS FORCED

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.910
TO MAKE DRAMATIC ESCAPES AS THE

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.110
HOUSE BURNS.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.840
ONE FIREFIGHTER CALLING FROM A

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.480
WINDOW TRYING TO REACH FOR A

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.880
LADDER.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.010
TURNS OUT ALL OF OUR SNOW IS

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.650
LIKELY WHAT SAVED HIM.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.350
LET'S GET RIGHT TO FRANK

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.650
COLLINS LIVE AT THE SCENE,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.280
FRANK?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.150
GOOD AFTERNOON.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.190
THIS HOUSE IS PROBABLY A TOTAL

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.120
LOSS AND THEY TELL ME FLAMES

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.820
RIPPED THROUGH THE INSIDE, BUT

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.460
WHEN THE FLAMES GOT TOO HOT FOR

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.790
CREWS BATTLING THE FLAMES, THE

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.200
CHIEF TELLS ME WHAT'S PILED UP

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.270
ON THE OUTSIDE, ALL OF THIS

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.830
SNOW SAVED ONE FIREFIGHTER.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.700
WHILE TRYING TO ESCAPE THE

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.140
RAGING FLAMES AND INTENSE HEAT

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.100
ON THE SECOND FLOOR, A

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.370
WORCESTER FIREFIGHTER REACHED

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.640
FOR A LADDER OUTSIDE THE

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.370
WINDOW.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.780
IN A HURRY TO GET OUT, HE

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.940
MISSED THAT LADDER AND FELL.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.250
UNDERNEATH WHERE HE WAS,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.580
THERE WAS A LOT OF SNOW AND A

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.250
BUSH THERE.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.350
FIREFIGHTERS SAY THE LARGE

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.790
SNOW PILE SOFTENED WHAT COULD

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.890
HAVE BEEN A BAD FALL.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.660
HIT THE SNOW AND IF THERE'S

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.920
A GOOD PART TO THE SNOW, THAT'S

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.890
IT.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.630
THE PICTURES WERE TAKEN BY

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.330
NAOMI.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.600
SHE AND HER FAMILY LIVE NEXT

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.370
DOOR.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.870
THE FLAMES WERE HUGE.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.270
FIREFIGHTERS TOLD THEM TO

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.340
EVALUATE.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.700
THE FIRE WAS DIFFICULT TO

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.170
CONTAIN.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.580
THE FLAMES WERE ENGULFING,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.420
HARD TIME GETTING IT UNDER

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.220
CONTROL.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.850
THE OLD HOMES ARE PRETTY CUT

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.750
UP.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.990
ONCE IT'S IN THE WALLS, IT'S

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.290
HARD TO TRACK DOWN.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.130
AT 3:30 THIS MORNING.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.560
I WAS HAVING THE FIRE BLOWN

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.160
OUT OF THE BOTH SIDES OF THE

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.500
REAR OF THE BUILDING WHEN I GOT

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.860
HERE.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.300
AND THE TENANT WAS OUTSIDE

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.800
WHEN THE CREWS ARRIVED TO THE

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.730
FIRE.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.270
THE FIREFIGHTERS WENT INSIDE

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.400
SEARCHING FOR THE OWNER ON THE

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.670
SECOND FLOOR.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.540
FORTUNATELY, THEY ALREADY MADE

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.110
THEIR EXIT.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.410
THE HOUSE BADLY DAMAGED BY

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.410
FIRE, WATER AND SMOKE.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.680
MORE IMPORTANTLY, NO ONE

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.780
SERIOUSLY HURT.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420
ONE MORE LOOK AT THE WINDOW

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.690
THE FIREFIGHTER FELL FROM.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.250
HE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL IN

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.950
WHAT WAS SAID TO BE MINOR

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.060
INJURIES.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.760
HE WAS IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE TO

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.050
GO ON A FAMILY VACATION HE HAD
