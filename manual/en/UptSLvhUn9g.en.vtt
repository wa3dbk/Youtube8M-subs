MELISSA SANDVIG: Dance means everything
to me. NINA KRIPAS: It makes me very emotional.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.760
I feel that's what I'm supposed to do in life.
MELISSA SANDVIG: You're inspired and you move by

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.410
how you feel. It's the best feeling in the
world. My name is Melissa Sandvig. I grew

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.349
up in Orange County and started dancing when
I was about five years old. NINA KRIPAS: My

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.949
name is Nina Kripas. I started with ballet,
I was in a national ballet school in Austria.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.640
MELISSA SANDVIG: Dancing kind of ran in my
family. It was in my blood. Basically I was

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.750
dancing out of my mother's womb (LAUGHS).
NINA KRIPAS: I was just a very hyper active

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.960
child and my grandmother was a dancer. I kind
of knew very early I don't wanna be that ballerina

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.710
stuck in the opera house and just you know
always have to be very disciplined and very

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.470
strict. MELISSA SANDVIG: There are limitations
that were restricting for me. I was insecure,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.350
you know I was too muscular, I was too strong,
I was too animated. NINA KRIPAS: A moment where

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.530
I thought I would quit dancing was when I
was about fifteen and there was one of this

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.390
ballet teachers and I didn't quite like him.
I thought he liked everybody else more in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.920
school and stuff and I was like, I'm done
with this. It's it's over. I'm gonna go be

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.360
an architect or something. MELISSA SANDVIG:
For me I could've stopped way back when I

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.500
was twelve when somebody said you won't be
able to do this, you have the wrong body.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.090
But then I didn't let it stop me. NINA KRIPAS:
I was really about to quit, but then I didn't

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.620
give up because I thought my grandmother
was a dancer, so I thought if she was able

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.409
to go through it, I m not gonna give up. I've
always wanted to explore and be free.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.140
So contemporary dance was my first possibility
to express myself and just be emotional with

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.670
the dance too and not be restricted in any
way. MELISSA SANDVIG: I was able to have a

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.340
little bit more freedom with my movement and
embrace my strength and use my muscles, or

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.340
not feeling bad that I have them because I
don't look like a skinny ballerina. NINA KRIPAS:

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.259
I realized my versatility is what helps me
to really work as a dancer and to survive

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.259
as a dancer and be happy in what I do. MELISSA
SANDVIG: Now I like to be known as a strong,

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.420
technical ballet dancer that can do other
things. NINA KRIPAS: So I always question myself

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.370
and I'm thinking what is my purpose in life,
what am I supposed to do, why am I here? And

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.290
then it always comes back that dance is just
my ticket to freedom.
