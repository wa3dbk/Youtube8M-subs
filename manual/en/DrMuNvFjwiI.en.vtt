00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
(lively music)

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.940
Hello everybody!

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.620
Welcome to my cooking channel!

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.480
Today, we are going to make ttalgi-jam.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.600
Uh oh, ttalgi.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.020
Ttalgi means ‘strawberries’, strawberry jam.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.060
I’ve been making ttalgi-jam for my family for a long time.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.360
I used to make huge amount,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.500
but today I’m going to make just only one pound strawberries,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.520
small portion.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.980
All Korean housewives, they make their own ttalgi-jam,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880
especially the ttalgi in peak season.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.300
But these days, strawberries are available all year round.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.540
By the way, my ‘bread rolls’ video was uploaded,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.860
just in previous video

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.640
and then I promised that I’m going to make this ttalgi-jam video for you guys.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.300
So today, I’m just making this for only pound of strawberries.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.540
Really pretty, eh?

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.920
These strawberries are beautiful.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.740
And then remove the stems.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.720
Add half cup sugar.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
Close the lid,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.340
and then boil over medium heat.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.860
Today I bought really high quality, like a good size, strawberries.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.580
But usually we make the really smaller one.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.200
Around twelve minutes past, and then this is really boiling.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.960
Potato masher.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.520
From this moment, you don’t need to cover

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.940
until the ttalgi-jam is made.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.200
Lower the heat, medium-low.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.740
My bread is done,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.220
my strawberry jam is still sizzling.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.080
Wowowow

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.700
Wonderful

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.660
Oh my god.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.080
So mash this,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.540
mash mash

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.500
So this density,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.000
it’s like a still runny jelly

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.380
When it’s cooled, it will become a little thicker.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.820
With one pound of strawberries, we make one cup

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.500
strawberry jam

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.300
You like to make a really special kind of weekend day,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.180
and then, just make this.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.000
This small jar is a half cup,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.820
so we make the one cup.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.360
Two jars are filled with this strawberry jam.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.220
Hot bread, hot strawberry jam.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.500
So delicious!

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.640
Today we made strawberry jam

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.640
Korean name: ‘ttalgi-jam’

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.940
When it runs out,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.160
you feel like eating more,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.060
make it again!

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.420
Just go pick up one package of strawberries and make this.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.060
Easy, easy easy.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.840
Enjoy my strawberry jam recipe everybody.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.340
See you next time!

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.840
Bye!
