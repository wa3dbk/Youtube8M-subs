I'm Jeremy from F.H. Steinbart Company. And
today we'll be doing a beer brewing tutorial

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.140
on behalf of Expert Village. Now that we're
through using grains for this beer. It's time

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:19.150
to add some malt extracts to it. What we can
do here is go ahead and shut off our heat.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.119
This is very important. The last thing you
want to do is scorch this malt extract to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.399
the bottom of your pan. Go on and open your
bag. Pour it on in there like so. For this

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:41.899
beer we'll be using about 7 pounds of malt
extract. For lighter lower alcohol beers you

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:53.890
use less malt extract. For heavier more flavorful
beers you use more. For this stout we're a

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:03.370
bit on the high side. But that's ok, because
we want a nice heavy flavorful stout. And

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:14.409
that's what all this malt extract is going
to get us. We've got one more bag to add in

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:22.270
here. We'll go ahead and thoroughly stir our
malt extract in. This is dry malt extract;

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.760
you'll also see another form of malt extract
called liquid malt extract. There's not a

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.719
lot of difference between the two. Dry malt
extract has the tendency to float on the top

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.259
a little bit more, so when we add our dry
malt extract, we just have to stir it down

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.960
in there real thoroughly until all the chunks
break up. Traditionally any brewer would have

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.939
to take the sugars from malt extract and extract
them from malted barley through a complicated

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:01.270
process called mashing. Malt extract is made
for home brewers and small breweries. And

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.719
the use of malt extract allows them to fore
go the mashing process. Just add it and you

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:16.860
are done. Makes things a lot easier. Now that
we have our malt extract in the pot and thoroughly

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.140
mixed in, its time turn back on the heat.
Pour your self a beer and wait for this to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:34.940
boil here. Usually it will take about 20-30
minutes depending on how hot your stove is.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.650
But you really want to watch this guy. It?s
a good idea to come back and stir it every

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.120
5-10 minutes. And once your thermometer reads
about 205 degrees or so, you don't want to

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.700
leave that pot. You really want to watch this
guy and make sure that it doesn't boil over.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.410
It makes a big mess that nobody wants to have
to deal with.
