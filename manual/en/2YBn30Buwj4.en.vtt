00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.210
Medical decision making, this is from one
of our Blitz video customers.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.490
“Hello, very helpful EM video but I noticed
that you didn’t emphasize to write the CMS

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.339
Risk Data Table for MDM in the CPT book.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.100
Is it because there’s a simpler way to figure
out the level of MDM or is it because the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.160
level of examination and determining the PFSH
are the only things you need to figure out

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:45.610
the correct code?”

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.420
So E&amp;M coding has evolved on the board exam.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.430
The CMS risk, I put a hyperlink here to show
you what that looks like.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.550
This is the Table of Risks.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.420
And yeah, if you want to write that in your
manual, go ahead.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.399
You can write anything you want in your manual.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280
You can’t print this and tape it.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.280
That is not allowed.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.190
The reason why I don’t recommend it is because
there is a table that I believe that they

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.540
will use more on the board exam so let me
show you now that I got my document camera

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.180
working.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:31.630
What I teach my students or those that purchased
the E&amp;M CEU Webinar is to locate your HEM

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.720
in time is my little rhyme here.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.210
So where’s my little pointer?

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.670
Okay, well I had my nails done so I can use
my fingers.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.380
Okay so you have Locate Your HEM in Time so
H is history, E is exam, M is medical decision

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.380
making.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.940
So on the board exam, your job is trying to
pull out that information from the note.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.869
You know, what is the level of history?

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.950
What is the level of exam?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.950
What is the level of medical decision making?

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.549
So this questioner is asking specifically
about the MDM.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.679
So on this page 3, what I’ve done is I’ve
written in some tables that I do encourage

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.100
you to write.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.220
Okay but the medical decision making table
is actually a copy of what’s already in

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.170
your manual on page 10.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.520
Okay so let me show you just so that you see
with your own peepers.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.819
Alright so here it is printed in the manual.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.590
Okay and so what I did is I just drew some
columns.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.290
So it’s real clear that we’re dealing
with 3 separate pieces of medical decision

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.290
making.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.370
We’ve got the DMO piece – diagnoses and
management options.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.569
We’ve got the data piece and then we’ve
got the risk piece.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.560
So this risk piece is when you do auditing,
they use that table of risk that I just showed

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.080
you and that backs into these levels.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.310
That’s getting to the nth degree of difficulty.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.019
And it’s my experience that they don’t
do that on the board exam unless they’ve

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.220
recently changed.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.480
They might not tell you it’s straightforward
low, moderate or high which we want to you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.379
know, do to put into my little Locate Your
HEM in Time technique.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:31.400
But they might tell you it’s limited DMO,
it’s moderate data and it’s low risk.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.370
And then you need to pull up those pieces
together using this table that already exists

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.470
in the book.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.260
So this table is saying 2 of 3.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.129
So you can have… and I got that from…
over here, in the guidelines.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.310
It says, “To qualify for a given type of
decision making, 2 of the 3 elements must

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.730
be met or exceeded.”

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.920
So if you had a…

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920
I forgot what I said.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.159
If you have a limited moderate low, you can
throw out one of them but the limited and

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.700
low is going to bring you down to a low complexity.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.580
Now if I said limited, moderate, moderate,
then we can throw out the limited because

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.799
it’s 2 of 3 that we need to meet or exceed.

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.859
So it’s moderate moderate, it’s a moderate
complexity.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.289
Okay so for the risk, we don’t need to use
that detailed table.

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.960
We can just use the table they give you in
the CPT manual.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.780
Now if you’re going to become you know,
an E&amp;M auditor, yes you need to know the table

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.780
of risk.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.009
You need to have that handy as a reference
tool.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.050
If you’re going to take the E&amp;M specialty
exam which I’m doing the end of September,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.259
by the way so wish me luck, then you can bring
in those reference materials.

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.270
You don’t have to write it in your book.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.219
You’re allowed to actually bring it in.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:50.199
So keep that in mind.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.509
And so this table now, we can see minimal,
low, moderate, high.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.409
So this is just getting even more detailed,
more granular.

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.210
You do not need that for the CPC board exam.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.039
If you do then I’ll eat my hat.

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.399
And if you do, it will probably be one of
the 10 questions and I still doubt it.

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:11.619
I have not heard that that’s been happening.

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:15.949
That would be like having to learn VIR coding
– Vascular Interventional Radiology to take

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.199
the CPC exam.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.460
They might ask you some things about families
of arteries but they’re not going to…

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.680
you’re not being tested on being a super
detailed coder in every single specialty.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:44.299
They want you to have a broad base of knowledge.
