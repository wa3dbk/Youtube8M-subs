00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.660
well there are very few toys which are as
creative as this marble swan. you require

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.660
a paper cup, a marble, some glue and scissors.
take a water cup and with the help of a paper

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.630
cutter you remove the circular base. on top
you can see a rim. make a small cut and remove

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.690
the rim also. it has the same thickness at
the top and bottom. it is like a small cylinder.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.690
and now you flatten the paper cup. so ther
will be two layers. with the help of pencil

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.370
draw a shape of the swan. this is the neck,
the beak and these are the wings. you can

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:17.509
color this to make it pretty. this is the
eye of the swan. now with the scissors you

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.119
cut both the layers of the paper cup to give
the shape of a swan. these of course are the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.890
wings. the swan is cut and you can see two
distinct layers. now you make a small cut

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.810
near the base and push it inside so that it
creates an oval cavity. this is the cavity

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.700
where the marble will be placed. then apply
a bit of glue near the beak and neck and stick

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.360
both the layers together. the cavity below
is extremely crucial. its in this cavity that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.230
the marble will be sitting. and now this swan
will start rolling. if you place the swan

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.630
on the table and put the swan on the marble.
when you move the plate the swan will go round

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.080
and round. it is basically the marble that
is rolling and moving the cup swan along with

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.580
it. its an extremely simple machine.
