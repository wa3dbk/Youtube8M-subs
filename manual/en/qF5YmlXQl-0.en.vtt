00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.069
Are you thinking of buying a sailboat to take
your friends and family sailing this summer?

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:08.750
Ö
Well, Iíve got some bad news for you Ö

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.101
My nameís Peter Reuter and Iíve been messing
about with sailboats for almost 50 years Ö

00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:13.619
I built built my own 25 foot sailboat from
a set of plans many years ago Ö

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.630
Iíve owned and maintained several sailboats
over the years from 20 feet to 43 feet long

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.720
Ö
And Iíve spent a lot of years ocean racing

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.880
in Australia Ö
So I know a few things about how sailboats

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.650
work Ö
And if youíre looking to buy a sailboat this

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.050
summer or anytime in the future Ö
Unless youíre very very careful, or very

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.739
very lucky Ö
you could be in for a very distressing experience

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.809
Ö
because youíre going to encounter several

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.550
problems when buying your boatÖ
The first problem is Ö

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.609
If this is your first sailboat purchase, how
do you know which boat is right for you?

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.859
Ö
There are hundreds of boats for sale out there

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.140
on the marinas and on the internet.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.730
Some of them will be a good fit for your sailing
needs and experience Ö

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.280
And some wonít Ö
but how do you choose?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.940
Ö
choose the wrong boat and your sailing days

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.339
will be very frustrating - and very short
Ö

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.950
Youíll need a lot of experience or a whole
lot of good information to be sure youíre

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.860
making the right choice Ö
And then thereís problem #2 Ö

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.930
Maybe you do know what type of sailboat is
right for you Ö

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.440
But there will probably be dozens of your
type of boat out there for sale Ö

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.020
How do you know which one to choose?

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.259
Ö
Many of the boats you see will look good to

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.040
you Ö
Theyíre meant to look good, after all, they

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.210
have been prepared for sale Ö
But many of them will be ìlemonsî ñ to

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.400
be avoided like the plague Ö
But which ones?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.640
Ö
And then thereís problem #3 Ö

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.210
Most boat brokers are honest, but some are
not Ö

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.730
Just google ìboat broker scamsî and youíll
see what I mean Ö

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.219
And while most brokers will reveal any serious
problems with a boat before they sell it to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.710
you Ö
The only problems they can reveal to you are

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.260
the ones the seller has told them about Ö
If they havenít been advised of the problem,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.820
they canít tell you Ö
And remember, used sailboats donít come with

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.340
a money-back guarantee Ö
It truly is ìbuyer bewareî out there on

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.770
the marina Ö
So without good advice or long experience

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.630
you could end up buying a sailboat that is:
The wrong boat for your needs and sailing

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.640
expertise and experience
A boat that could cost you a small fortune

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.310
to repair and make safe
Or possibly a boat with so many hidden faults

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.640
that you risk your own life and the life of
your family by taking it on the water.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.150
Any one of these problems will cost you a
lot of heartache, waste a lot of money, and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.560
maybe put you at risk Ö
so , given these problems, what are your options?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.400
Ö
well, you could get a Marine Surveyor to do

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.260
professional survey on all the sailboats you
think look good Ö

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.700
The problem is, youíre going to see dozens
of sailboats that look good on the surfaceÖ

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.150
lots of shiny topsides and gleaming stainless
steel Ö

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.640
But every survey you get done will cost you
at least $25 per foot Ö

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.300
Thatís about about $700 for a 25 foot boat
Ö

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.739
So you canít afford a professional survey
on every sailboat that looks good to you Ö

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.730
The cost would soon become prohibitive Ö
However there is another way Ö

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.370
What if you knew how to spot all the major
and minor problems and faults that can be

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.080
found in a used sailboat?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.659
Ö
What if you knew which of these problems were

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.400
ìdeal-bustersî
and which were price negotiating points?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.879
Ö
What if you could find any ìdeal-busterî

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.769
faults in any boat with a quick 10 minute
check Ö

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.659
What if you could do a I hour survey on any
sailboat that passed your 10 minute check

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.510
Ö
And end up knowing the exact condition of

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.110
the boat - its good points and its faults?

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.640
Ö
Until you finally found the best boat

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.480
The one you wanted to buy
the one you will have inspected by a marine

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.980
surveyor Ö
Well you canÖ

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.799
all you need is Ö
