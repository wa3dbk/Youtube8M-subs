00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.690
Good afternoon once again!

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.480
This is Marc at the National Weather Service
in Norman with your afternoon winter weather

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.340
update.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.000
Our first taste of winter weather will begin
late tonight as bands of snow, sleet, and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.410
freezing rain develop over the Texas Panhandle
and central Texas and move eastward through

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.410
the day on Sunday.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.480
Here are the predictions as they stand right
now.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.940
As usual, we’re dealing with a very complex
system with a mixed mode of precipitation

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.360
types, so it will be important to monitor
conditions closely.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.039
The greatest accumulations of snow, sleet
and freezing rain, and their associated impacts

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.690
will be felt across southeastern and south
central Oklahoma and western north Texas (areas

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.729
shaded in pink and purple).

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.719
Here, up to 5 inches of snow and sleet may
accumulate.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.179
In addition, up to a quarter inch of icing
may occur over southeastern Oklahoma ahead

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.370
of the sleet and snow.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.510
These are the areas where the greatest impacts
to travel and commerce are expected.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.940
Many roadways will become slick and hazardous
and travel is not advised in these areas after

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.729
midnight tonight!

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.350
Areas along and north of interstate 40 will
see mainly snow or a mix of snow and sleet

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.789
for the duration of the event.

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.640
Travel impacts here will not be as significant,
but there will certainly be some slick spots

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.200
out there!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.850
With fairly high confidence in high impact
winter weather, a winter storm warning has

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.560
been issued and covers much of southern Oklahoma
and all of western north Texas.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.229
Monitor the forecast through the night as
these winter weather systems can evolve quickly!

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.710
Once we get done with tonight and tomorrow,
another winter storm looks to affect our region

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.770
from Monday night into Tuesday.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.380
As was mentioned yesterday, it looks as though
the most significant snow accumulations will

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.740
occur well to the north and west of the Oklahoma
City metro.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.229
However, there does appear to be a chance
for some light snow accumulation across central

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.229
Oklahoma.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.679
A mix of snow and rain will limit accumulation
potential south of interstate 40 into southern

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.110
Oklahoma and northern Texas.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.420
Again, it’s important to check back for
updates frequently.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.619
If this storm system takes a slightly more
southerly track, central Oklahoma will see

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.380
greater snowfall.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.150
A third winter weather event will follow on
the heels of the Monday-Tuesday event.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.500
While it’s way too early to even mention
potential snow amounts, we can provide some

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.310
idea of where the better chances for accumulating
snow will be.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.020
Right now it’s looking like areas along
and north of interstate 44 corridor have the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.580
best shot.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.730
By this time, temperatures look to be cold
enough that most of the precipitation falls

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.530
as snow, but again, things are likely to change
between now and then.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.409
Keep an eye on the forecast!

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.209
Takeaways
To sum things up, we are expecting a busy

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.709
week with three opportunities for winter weather.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.129
The first will occur late tonight and last
into tomorrow evening.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.530
The other two will take place late Monday
night into Tuesday and Thursday into Friday.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.310
There is high confidence in winter weather
impacts tonight into tomorrow over much of

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.610
southern and western Oklahoma and western
north Texas.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.360
If you haven’t already done so, prepare
for impacts to travel and plan on staying

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.209
where you are, especially if you’re within
the winter storm warning.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.920
Check our webpage at weather.gov/norman for
winter weather safety tips and continue to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.800
check back for updates to the forecast.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.980
Weather, in general, is unpredictable.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.170
Winter weather is another animal altogether!
