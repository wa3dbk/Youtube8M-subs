I'm Coyote Peterson and I love animals

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.140
I don't care if they're scaly, scary, hairy, toothy

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.030
or absolutely huge

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:14.087
look at that swamp beast

00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:17.242
I've always been drawn to these fascinating creatures

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.190
every one of them

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.361
from the bizarre to the deadly have lead me on countless

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:26.668
pursuits to understand their true nature and develop an appreciation for the incredible environments that they call home

00:00:26.668 --> 00:00:29.677
