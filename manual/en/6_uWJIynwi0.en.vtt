Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com
and today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.450
this bracelet here. This is a really easy
Bracelet project to do and it's a stretch

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.180
bracelet and what I've done is I cut
little squares out of a Lillypilly

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.380
copper sheet. I have one that's whole. This is how it comes.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.470
All I've done is I've cut them to fit the
squares and I glued them into place.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.910
Super easy to do

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.189
what you're going to need is
Lillypilly Copper Sheet. These come in

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.190
a bunch of different patinas. You can
really pick a fun color and have fun

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.670
design pattern

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.210
you'll need a stretch bracelet

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.600
these are plastic. They're very
comfortable to wear

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.850
and they're easy to work wit. You need some E6000 glue

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.960
a pen

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.570
a pair of metal shears all though scissors
will work I do prefer metal shears

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.480
just because I don't want to damage my
scissors

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.500
and then you'll also need a ruler

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.010
now each square is twenty millimeters by
twenty millimeters

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.100
that's a little hard to measure on a ruler if you're going to be cutting a bunch of squares

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.780
so I just kind of went with the
three-quarter inch measurement for this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.850
project

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.740
and I'm going to do squares which are three
quarters-inch by three quarters-inch. They

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.230
up just slightly small for the square
but it's not really noticeable. I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.690
just find it's a lot easier

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.090
so what you're gonna do is you're going to turn
your Copper Sheet over

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.110
take your ruler

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.730
line it up against the edge

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.760
and then with a pen you're just going to
make a little mark

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.400
where the three quarter inch is

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.400
do that in a couple different places

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.090
once we have a few reference marks just
going to draw a line

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.620
and then for this bracelet we need eight
squares

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.640
do another line

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.279
so I'm going to go from that line I just
drew, line my ruler up

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:13.039
same process, little marks at the
three-quarter inch

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:17.119
spot

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:21.369
this will be a little small, you
can just make it a little larger if

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:22.649
you want

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.739
but this works totally fine

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.089
since I know it's gonna be a
little bit small I'm just gonna go a

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:34.539
little bit above where those marks are

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:41.539
and my line did not end up really dark right there

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.250
now to get the actual square shape we
need to go from the other side now

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.250
and do the same process

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.849
we're making a grid pattern on the back
of our Lilly Pilly sheet

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.649
When you get to the very end it's gonna
be

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:27.079
even here so you're going to get two here. So we can tell that here we

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.369
have an inch and a half

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.469
divide that in half, three quarter of an inch

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:37.389
so this is going to be perfect

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.289
we're not gonna have to make another
measurement, we're going to know that that's

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:47.289
what it's going to be

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.999
if you can see we've got actually eight squares

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.409
all lined up

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.579
take my metal shears

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.139
unlock them

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.429
and I'm just going to cut these out

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:08.429
along the line that I drew

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.240
We've got all these little squares

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.469
and some of them are a little bit

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:39.240
crumbled looking. They're corners a little bit
bent up. All you need to do, this is such

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.639
a thin sheet

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.089
you don't need to hammer it out, all you
need to do is take your fingers

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:51.089
and flatten them. Do that with all your
little squares

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.469
Once they're flat, glue them in place

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.299
take some E6000 glue, use a scrap piece of wire or a tooth pick

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:04.889
for a applicator

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.689
if not you can actually just do it
directly from the bottle

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.289
place some on the back

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.669
flip it over

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.669
and press it into place in the middle of
your square

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.520
there's one

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.520
do that all the way around

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.590
once you've got all your squares in place
return the lid of the glue

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.050
and then what I want you to do go through and just press them

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.819
down. So work your way around the
bracelet

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.169
pressing them down into place. Now what's
nice about this project is normally if

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.009
you were cutting the Lillypilly copper
you'd wanna sand the corners down a

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.110
little bit just cuz they are sharp

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.069
but because this particular bracelet has
a bezel setting to each square

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.120
and it has nice rounded corners to the
plastic and the sharp corners of the

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.349
LillyPilly are set down within it

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.770
you're not going to have to worry about
filing those Lillypilly corners

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.770
at all

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.820
let this dry

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.979
and you're bracelet is going to be all
ready to go

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:59.360
That is how you make a quick and easy
bracelet

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.839
using these great bracelet forms

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.339
and Lillypilly Copper Sheets
