00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:09.290
Robert Downey Jr. talks how the Avengers plotline
affected Iron Man 3, his future with the Marvel

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.570
franchise and more!

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.480
Hey guys, I’m Melana Scantlin.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.389
ENTV has the details.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.860
Robert Downey Jr. will soon hit theaters in
the third installment of the Iron Man franchise.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.449
The actor sat down with Collider.com to talk
all things Tony Stark.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.030
Here are five questions he answered and this
is what we learned:

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.020
First up on the list -- How much longer will
he play Tony Stark?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.819
Downey says he honestly doesn’t know how
many films he has left in this Marvel Universe....

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:41.430
but tells Collider, “[I’m] not going to
pretend I’m over it [...]” He more than

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.149
hints that negotiations on his contract are
in effect, saying, “Let’s just say that

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.280
me, the agents and the lawyers are having
a bit of a ball right now.”

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.889
Number 2, How does his Avengers plotline affect
Iron Man 3?

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:59.699
Previous movies built a climax for Avengers
and now Iron Man 3 is just the third act in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.059
the Iron Man story.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.120
After dealing with intergalactic terrorists
in Avengers, Tony Stark becomes much more

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.340
paranoid.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.100
Speaking of Stark’s post-Avengers state
of mind, Downey says, “I wanted him back

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.420
home and I thought, ‘What if that happened
to any of us?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.329
Wouldn’t we be a little tripped out?

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.759
You’d be watching your back.’”

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.030
At #3: What’s the status of Starks relationship
with Pepper?

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.180
They were officially a couple in Avengers
and Iron Man 3 tears them apart after Pepper

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.329
is captured by Ben Kingsley’s character,
so Stark has to deal with his enemies hitting

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.960
too close to home.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.679
Downey tells Collider, “All [Tony] really
cares about is Pepper and [Jon Favreau’s

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:43.679
Happy character].

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.880
He doesn’t care about any of his material
stuff except some robots, this girl and his

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.140
one friend.”

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.049
Number 4, Will this film be bigger and more
action-packed than the last?

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.819
Even though Downey celebrates this film’s,
quote, “much smaller storytelling style”

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.320
-- it doesn’t mean it is short on action.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.490
He tells Collider “I’ve never done so
much action in my life.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.750
The scope feels really, really big [..] I
think Marvel’s intention is to defy expectations

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.750
again.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.170
Finally at number 5, Will Tony Stark join
Guardians of the Galaxy?

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.530
Fanboys and girls everywhere have their fingers
crossed that the leaked concept art of Stark’s

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.650
Space Armor suit may mean Downey will make
an appearance in the flick next summer-- though

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.720
the actor himself has yet to address the rumors.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.129
