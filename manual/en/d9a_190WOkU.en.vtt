My name's Nazish Jalali. I'm from Rampur in UP

00:00:08.556 --> 00:00:11.556
Today we're making a Rampur specialty, Khichda 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.829
Khichda's made from mutton and dals like chana, urad, masoor and moong

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:32.846
And rice, whole wheat and barley 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.960
We pound the wheat and barley, soak in water 
 for 2 hours and then cook  

00:01:00.474 --> 00:01:02.974
Add some salt to this

00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:09.196
Red chilly powder

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.446
Turmeric

00:01:18.597 --> 00:01:21.597
In a separate cooker, we take the chana dal soaked in water

00:01:23.074 --> 00:01:25.574
Add the urad dal to this

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:45.650

Add water and cook

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.180
Now we take the masoor dal in a separate cooker

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.290
And add the moong dal to this

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:40.140
Add water and cook

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.410

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:02.930
We add the soaked rice to this

00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.010
We heat oil in a separate vessel

00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:24.310
And add the mutton to this

00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:40.940
And cook till the mutton changes colour

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.880
Now add garlic paste

00:03:59.498 --> 00:04:02.000
Then ginger paste

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:05.350

00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:16.180
Add turmeric

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.890
And red chilly powder

00:04:31.248 --> 00:04:33.250
And then cook this

00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:43.220
Now add water to cook the mutton properly

00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:49.280
Now we mix all the ingredients in a big deg

00:05:13.873 --> 00:05:17.870
Now we use a stick blender to make the consistency smooth

00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:29.550
We heat oil and fry sliced onion in this

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.130
And add the brown onion to the mixture

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320

Finely chopped green chilly

00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:10.490
