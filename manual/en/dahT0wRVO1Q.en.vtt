00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.833
So let's set up our play field.

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.866
The play field for our game
will be very simple.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.400
We will place walls around the
edges to keep our Player GameObject

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:14.100
from falling off, and we will create
and place a set of collectable

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.966
objects for our player to pick up.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:20.933
First let's create a new GameObject
and rename it "Walls".

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:25.433
This will be an organizing parent
GameObject for our Wall objects.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.233
Let’s look at the organization
of our Hierarchy.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.066
Organization in our projects and
our Hierarchy are very important.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.166
We need to understand that
organization at a glance.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.066
We organize our projects
using folders or directories

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.866
created by our operating system.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:45.100
We add these to our project using
the Project view's Create menu

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.500
We organize our Hierarchies
by using GameObjects

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.233
In our Scene, GameObjects
can hold other GameObjects

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.666
Don’t be afraid to use an empty
GameObject as a directory

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.166
or folder in the Hierarchy

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.699
Reset this GameObject to origin;
and this step is important.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.699
We want the Transforms of all of
our container GameObjects to be

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.466
at origin before we use them.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
Now we will build our walls.

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:17.266
Let's start by creating a new
Cube to be our first wall.

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.266
Rename this "West Wall".

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.100
Reset this GameObject to origin.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.166
Now parent West Wall to
our Walls GameObject.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.633
Let's focus our Scene view camera
to our Wall object.[00:01

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:35.166
34.29]

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.500
We can do this by typing the F key
while the cursor is over

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:43.200
the Scene view , or by selecting
Edit &gt; Frame Selected.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:50.266
We need to change the size of the
Cube to fit one side of our play area.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.366
Change the Cube's Transform Scale
of X, Y and Z to .5 for thin,

00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:01.333
2 for tall, and 20.5 for long.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:05.699
Now we can simply push the wall
into place using the Translate tool,

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.199
or we could enter a value into
the Transform component.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.500
In this case we can set the
Transform's position X value to -10.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:18.166
This places the wall neatly
to the edge of our play area.

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:22.866
To create the next wall we could
start with another new Cube,

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:26.699
but then we'd have to rescale this
new Cube before we placed it.

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:30.899
Our current West Wall
is already the perfect size.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:35.166
So let's duplicate the
West Wall GameObject.

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.666
Let's rename it "East Wall".

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:41.500
To place the wall simply
remove the negative sign,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.000
and it pops into place on the
east side of our game area.

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.800
Now let's duplicate the east wall...

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:52.200
and call it "North Wall".

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:57.866
Reset the X position so theNorth Wall
is in the center of the play area.

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.200
We now have two choices:

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:05.233
We can rotate the wall by 90 degrees,
or, as this is a cuboid,

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:12.000
we can rescale the wall to 20.5
in the X and 0.5 in the Z.

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:16.066
Now it's scaled correctly for its
orientation as the "North Wall".

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:20.733
We can drag the wall into place,
or we can simply use the value of 10

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.966
in the Transform's Position
Z field to place it.

00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:28.400
Duplicate North Wall and
call it "South Wall",

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:32.333
and -10 in the Z-axis
pops it into place.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.466
Enter Play mode and test.

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:41.500
Fantastic, the walls work fine.

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:45.800
Remember to test early and test
often, don't wait to test.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.033
Let's exit Play mode.

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:53.566
Let's highlight the Player
GameObject and set the Editor to

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.600
Local mode, and try again.

00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:59.000
Note how in Local mode we
can see the Transform rotate.

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:05.200
Let's exit Play mode.

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:08.999
In the next episode we
will be creating

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.233
our collectable pickup object.
