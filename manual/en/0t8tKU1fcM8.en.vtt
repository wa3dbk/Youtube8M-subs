Hi everybody and welcome

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.340
Today I want to show you two new parts of my armor

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.240
You can download the templates in the description of the video, as usual

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.380
Here's the first new piece: The Elbow

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.200
It's pretty much ready to paint

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
it has this accurate details

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.900
on the inside I installed elastic straps

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.000
so it doesn't wobble when you wear it

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.740
The hand plate is the other new part

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.980
it has an elastic strap too

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.260
I used some new materials

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.180
It's a 3cm wide elastic strap

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.640
it costs less than 1000 Colombian pesos each meter (around 30cents to January 2016)

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.640
and I used a hot glue gun too

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.640
we're gonna need it

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:14.000
I finished the whole arm, so I want to show you how it looks when you wear it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.660
First, the biceps

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.060
then the elbow, with these two slots pointing to the outside

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.820
so, this (sorry)

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.980
as you can see, there're one strap on the top and two on the bottom

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.580
two straps in the bottom will allow us to move our elbow more easily

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.760
then... it looks like this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.660
forearm next

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.780
I'm going to use a bike gloves for now, but they are not accurate because they have the wrong colors and have some marks

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.760
they are supposed to be totally black

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.940
so, the elastic strap will secure the hand plate

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.420
and this is how our Clone Trooper arm is starting to look

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.320
the mobility is pretty good

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.900
ok, now I'll show you the process
