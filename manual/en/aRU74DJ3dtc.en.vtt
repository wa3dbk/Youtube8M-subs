00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.900
actually it started with a crazy idea

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.900
at a neighbor with a glass of wine

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.900
he told me

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.900
I had in my life always want to build an airplane

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.900
and I said to him build a plane is not possible?

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.900
yes he says, as you surf on the Internet,

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.900
take a look a the Internet

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.900
how more websites I was looking

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.900
the more sense I began to get

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.900
I have come in contact with a Dutchmen

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.900
Andre, who was himself working on his second Aircraft

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.900
I had a lot of pictures seen on his website

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.900
I visited AndrÃ©,

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:56.900
and the desire to build himself was of course even more

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.900
I have thought about 3 months

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:04.900
and then I started with the tail

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.900
when I not finish the tail section

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.900
it's not too big financial loss

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.900
It take six years to complete it

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.900
a lot has happened in those six years

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.900
Lots of nice moments

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:36.900
unfortunately there were the accidents with the Zenair Zodiac

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.900
that of course you live with it

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.900
I would not do it again

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.900
I have had a lot of fun

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.900
I am glad I have taken the finish

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.900
many aircrafts remain unfinished somewhere in an attic

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.900
it takes a lot of perseverance

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:13.900
after a full-time job you know you have to work till night

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.900
it was an attraction in the neighborhood

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.900
received much help from neighbors

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:28.900
occasionally you need someone to lift heavy wings

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:33.900
in the flying club there were fewer supporters

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:40.900
if you build yourself you also realize the risks

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:48.900
it should be good, because you are playing with a lifetime

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:40.900
I have also made it more difficult

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:45.900
by choosing an engine that was not mounted in a Zenair before

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.900
a Belgian-made engine ULPower 260i

00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:22.900
the engine also makes it harder to sell the aircraft later
