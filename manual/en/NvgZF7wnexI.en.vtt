Hi, I'm Brandon Etzel,

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.840
a cook here at Kerr Cafeteria.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.840
On any given day we

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.150
typically have five kinds

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.369
of mac n' cheese.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.099
Usually three kinds of mac n' cheese,

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.340
a traditional, a fried macaroni,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.050
and a desert macaroni.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.320
So we can really change it up

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.390
and give you something different everyday.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.460
Every day we put out

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.570
grill items including hamburgers,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.640
fried chicken

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.100
freshly toasted buns.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.620
They're all here as well as a complete condiments bar.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.290
Without a doubt the most popular thing

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.760
we go through is the hamburgers,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.040
which we go through reams of on a daily basis.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.650
The heavy gauge sliding door we have 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.940
is to help

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.149
bring back the sense of the industrial district

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.399
we have here in Denton.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.920
Where as we enter into the main lobby area

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760
it becomes more the Denton Square surrounding

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.410
the Denton Courthouse.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.340
All of our new fronts for our homestyle,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.420
our vegetarian

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.289
and our pizza and pasta line

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.539
all have fronts from the historic

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.830
Denton Square and Courthouse area.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.350
Each one is based off of a famous front.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.899
Either the 1600 Scripture Building,

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:13.950
the Denton Fine Arts Theater,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.570
the staple points of the Square.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.540
We really wanted to bring that,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.170
"This is your small town," back to Kerr Cafeteria.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.220
In the last year we have started making

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.850
our own custom, gourmet ice-creams,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.860
and it really enthuses us to get to make something
uniquely ours.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.729
Kerr-fateria is probably the best

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.560
and easiest place to get to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.770
for UNT.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.829
My favorite dining hall is definitely Kerr Hall

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.409
Whenever I'm having a test or anything

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.380
like that going on during the week

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.150
I can always come in and be sure that I'll
get a good meal.
