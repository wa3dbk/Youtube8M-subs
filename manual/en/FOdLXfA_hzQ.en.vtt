00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.859
Two years go 2K’s Bioshock introduced us
to the underwater city of Rapture and its

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.460
founder, the industrialist Andrew Ryan. The
game sent you exploring the crumbling ruins

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.030
of the failed utopian society and piecing
together the how the city rose and fell into

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.989
ruin. The rich story and stunning art direction
made the game a critical and commercial hit

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.329
that left fans hungry for more time in the
gorgeous but disturbing world of Rapture.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.870
2K Marin’s upcoming Bioshock 2 aims to give
fans a second run through Rapture in two flavors,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.170
a single player game set after the events
of the first game, and an all-new multiplayer

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:12.069
mode set just as the ambitious city is starting
to come apart at the seams.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.280
The single player experience is set roughly
ten years after the end of the original Bioshock.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.530
You’re cast in the role of Subject Delta,
an early prototype of the armored Big Daddy

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.630
behemoths seen escorting the creepy Little
Sisters around in the first game. But, unlike

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.280
the Big Daddy’s from the first game, you’re
not mindless and you have a very specific

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:41.060
mission find the Little Sister that you’ve
been bonded to who’s lost somewhere in Rapture.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.880
Your mission will send you through the vast
city, revisiting places seen in the first

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.920
game, though weathered by the passage of time,
and you’ll entirely new places as well.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.799
The game’s story has a tighter focus on
theme of family as it follows your search

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.950
for you little sister and introduces you to
the unlikely bonds that has formed among key

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.090
figures in the population.
The passage of time has also led to some unique

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.340
changes in both Rapture and its residents
that have led to the city becoming even more

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.459
disturbing and dangerous. The splicers, humans
who have taken to altering their DNA to improve

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.709
themselves, have gotten even crazier due to
their addiction to ADAM, the gene-altering

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.730
stem substance that’s been one of the factors
in Rapture’s fall. As the years have gone

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.900
by splicers have continued to tinker with
their DNA, resulting in some all new incarnations

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.750
such as Brute Splicers- hulking masses of
muscle that are tough to take down and who

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.110
use the environment to their advantage. But,
given that you’re based on the early designs

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.580
for one of the most powerful creatures in
the game, you’re not exactly a pushover.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.040
You’ll be able to use weapons such as the
rivet gun and drill which are core to a typical

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.150
Big Daddy’s arsenal. But, in addition, you’ll
also be able to use DNA enhancing plasmids

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.069
to gain powers well beyond that of a normal
splicer. The ability to use your weapons and

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.680
plasmid fueled powers in tandem presents some
new, tactical combinations thanks to a new

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.330
plasmid system that allows you to upgrade
their levels. Plasmids can also be combined

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.800
in certain instances, such as using Inferno
to ignite Cyclone traps to create fire-based

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:30.810
traps for enemies.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.330
You’ll need all these abilities and more
to deal with the game’s new villain, Sophia

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:48.560
Lamb, clinical psychologist and altruist.
Andrew Ryan’s idealogical opposite, she

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.569
has wound up in control of the city and the
head of a cult-like mob of splicers. She’s

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.409
also holds the key to you finding your little
sister, who’s name is, oddly enough, Eleanor

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.100
Lamb. When we said family was a theme in the
game, we never said healthy family. Another

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.230
interesting branch of Lamb’s brood are the
other residents of Rapture have done some

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.290
growing up and blossomed in unique ways. The
little sisters who weren’t rescued in the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.410
first game have grown and evolved into Big
Sisters. The young ladies have been inspired

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.950
by the Big Daddies who cared for them and
cobbled together suits of armor from the remains

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.060
of their former protectors. The result is
a unique new enemy that’s fast, agile, almost

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.289
as powerful as a big daddy, able to use plasmids,
and a deadly predator you’ll have to contend

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:48.400
with as you work your way to Eleanor in the
single player game.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.280
Bioshock 2’s multiplayer mode, changes things
up and drops you in Rapture during the riots

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.401
that caused the fall of the city shortly before
the start of the first Bioshock. You’ll

00:04:56.401 --> 00:05:01.490
play as a product tester for Sinclair Solutions,
a provider of weapons and plasmids. You’ll

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.590
fight in online matches of up to eight players
in a number of rapture-themed spins on traditional

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.720
multiplayer game types. You’ll be able to
see parts of rapture at the height of its

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.000
grandeur as the multiplayer maps all take
place in familiar locations before the urban

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
decay set in.
With a new story, characters, locales and

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.870
gameplay, there should be plenty of reasons
for fans to return to Rapture. Players can

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.400
look forward to reacquainting themselves with
the city of Rapture and its colorful and disturbing

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:51.389
residents on February 9th, 2010 when the game
ships for the PC, PS3, and X360.
