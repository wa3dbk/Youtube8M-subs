Hello everybody this is Jay Ensminger with Hanser Music Group

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.620
here to talk about one of the newest additions to the Powerwerks family,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.199
the PW40.  This particular model here is the PW40BATBT battery powered

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.660
which also incorporates Bluetooth.  This represents the next gen of 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.880
products that you'll end up seeing coming out from Powerwerks over the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.279
2014 calendar year.  What you'll see initially

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.320
is the unit itself is very similar in scope

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.130
and also then size from the traditional PW50's

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.130
and PW100's that we've had in the market over the past several years.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.540
What's a little bit different is we've moved the controls to the front

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.410
of the unit itself.  We've still incorporated both

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.039
a mic and line level in the first channel and
then you have

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.870
for the second channel, an auxiliary in and line level in.  The auxiliary in still allows you to plug anything in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.410
as far as an iPod or iPhone

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.840
or even computer for any of your digital playback.  Whereas you still have

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.510
a mic line input if you still doing anything

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.620
as far as vocals or singer-songwriter type events.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.150
Now what's really cool about these
units we still incorporate our

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.160
Powerlink system. So that's where you can
actually

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.550
daisy chain as many of these units together as you need, depending on the size of the room

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.900
but as you see here we're not only Bluetooth 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.810
enabled but it's also a battery-powered unit.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.490
Now with the PW40 the battery life will
last up to 10 hours on a full charge

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.590
so the Bluetooth capability.  That's a class 2 rating.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.350
That's means rate up to 33 feet even though we know it goes a little bit longer than that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.380
Any device that you have that is Bluetooth compatible, you can now sync up directly with the PW40.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.800
 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.050
These little guys are actually gonna end
up shipping here at the tail 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.630
end of April. The PW40 in it's battery format

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.810
is going to street for around $174.99 while it's Bluetooth counterpart 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.770
is going to street at $239.99.  So check out some more about

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.450
the PW40's and some other products we have coming out this year.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.900
