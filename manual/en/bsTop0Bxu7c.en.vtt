00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.960
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
today a real simple recipe.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.660
I've had a lot of requests
for Yum Yum Sauce.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.690
I've been kinda workin' on it a little bit

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.660
because I didn't wanna
put something out there

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.030
that really wasn't what I was happy with.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.800
Yum Yum Sauce is served in the

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.770
American-style Japanese steak restaurants,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.815
it's definitely not Japanese in origin,

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:21.540
but I'm sure that when
the restaurants first

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.650
started using it they were using the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.050
Kewpie brand mayonnaise to make this.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.320
And so to make that transition to using

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.490
the cheaper American mayonnaise
they're adding sugar.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.160
So anyway, let's kinda get started.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.130
I've got two tablespoons of melted butter,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.140
two tablespoons of fine
sugar, this can often be

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.170
referred to as baker's sugar,
it dissolves a lot easier than

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.160
the standard granulated sugar,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.990
but it's not powdered sugar either.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.330
Two tablespoons of vinegar, I'm using

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.480
the cane vinegar but rice
vinegar will work just as well.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.910
I have half a teaspoon
of granulated garlic.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.820
I've tried it with fresh
garlic and actually think that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.950
granulated garlic is a little
better because it's not as

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.650
garlic-forward I guess you
could say, it's not as strong.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.170
It gives you that garlic
flavor without being as strong.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.210
I have a quarter teaspoon of white pepper,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.340
one tablespoon of tomato paste.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.370
This is the stuff that comes
in a tube, that way I'm not

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.510
opening up a can for just one tablespoon.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.810
I mean a lot of times I'm
using one or two tablespoons

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.670
in small recipes anyway so I just buy

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.150
the stuff in the tube, keep
it around in the fridge.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.180
Now we're gonna mix all this up while my

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.290
two tablespoons of melted
butter is still warm.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.230
This will help everything dissolve.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.590
(cheerful music)

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.940
This is not the most
healthy recipe there is.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.640
There we go, got everything
mixed up in there pretty good,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.680
put this over here, bring my mayonnaise,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.710
check to make sure I'm still
in the shot... there we go.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.500
Now we're gonna pour this in
and we're gonna mix it in.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.180
(cheerful music)

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.210
Now after I get this mixed up real good

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.390
I'm gonna put it in the fridge
and I'm gonna let it sit

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.770
for one hour that way everything
comes together really good.
