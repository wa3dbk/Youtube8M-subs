00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.410
hello everyone Michael here from the
daily note 2 youtube channel and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.379
welcome to another episode of galaxy note 2
tips and tricks episode

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:09.689
seventeen

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.100
now you probably already have a 16GB device

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.769
or you thinking of getting a

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.630
galaxy note 2 and the 16GB one is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.599
the only model that's available

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.289
so this video is for making best of what
we have

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.090
so the first tip i have for you guys is
to make sure you get an

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.329
external micro SDXC card
this one specifically is a

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.420
sixty-four gigabyte class ten

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.000
sandisk mobile alternate micro SDXC card

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.370
and it is pretty much available
worldwide for about sixty dollars

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.570
pending on whether you buy from
amazon or ebay or

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.060
whatever the case

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.059
so anyway

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.380
when you insert this card for the first time
it will ask you if you want to

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.750
format the card and that is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.930
definitely the way you should format it
you should not put it into

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.370
a computer first and then format it and
put on to the

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.450
phone that seems to cause a lot of
problems down the line because not

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.240
all apps support

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.370
other formats than FAT32
that it gets formatted and if you

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.050
format it in the galaxy note 2

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.960
so anyway let's see how many
gigabytes space they give us when I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.090
put in a 64GB

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.950
external card so you could see that
they give you

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.400
59.46GB of external space

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.870
it's not as good as internal space but
it could definitely use that to our

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.329
advantage to help

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.710
this situation

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.990
first thing you should do is you should
go your camera app

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.710
and you should go to settings

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.100
and then scroll all the way down
and you should see storage by the default

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.380
it is set to phone

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.930
but set it to your memory card so
that when you take photos and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.900
videos

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.320
it knows to use your memory card

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.149
and you won't have any problems such as
it not being able to record

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.690
1080p video the class ten card
even the class six card is plenty fast enough

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.269
to handle all the bit rates that it
wants to throw at it so

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.379
set it to your memory card

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.289
and the last tip I have for you guys is

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:21.180
be wario of gamer games or 3D games

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.519
for example asphalt seven
it is a very popular game out right now

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.569
but it only seems to want to use your
internal storage for everything so

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.519
as you can see is using 1.49GB of my internal internal

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.379
storage

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.920
and that's a huge chunk

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.120
so imagine just a couple of those games
and it will fill up

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.629
16GB  galaxy note 2 rather quickly

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.959
so just be ware of that situation
hopefully

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.280
these games will be

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.829
updating to jelly beans so that it knows
how to

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.989
move this external data
to the external card and one last thing

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.690
people have asked me to stop by a couple of
carriers to see if even in korea

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.510
if it's true that they've stop making the
sixty-four gigabyte model because i do

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.039
have a sixty-four gigabyte model

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:16.769
that rumor actually is
putting out to be true i stopped by a

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.839
couple carriers the least popular
carrier

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.439
that provides DCMA LTE model
unfortunately not

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.759
as good as GSM model for
exporting

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.499
anyway the CDMA LTE model

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:36.199
they have a very limited stock of the
64GB model

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.299
so if i really wanted that i should get

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.749
get that right away because they aren't
making any more 64GB

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:43.829
devices

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.929
and i've heard from two or three
people

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:50.429
that they went into the most popular
carrier and

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:55.349
it turns out that they haven't
had the 64GB model for

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.229
for a couple weeks now so they've been
sold out for quite a bit a while and

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.889
they don't seemed to be expecting any more in
stock because they are not being manufactured

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.509
or that's what the sales people are
saying so i always take what sales people

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:12.829
tell me with a grain of salt but
that does seem to be the case

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.889
anyway that's the end of today's episode

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.999
