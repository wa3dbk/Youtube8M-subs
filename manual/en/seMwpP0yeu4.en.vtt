00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.140
So, Riley how was the first day of school?

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.660
Fine, I guess.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.060
Did you guys pick up on that?

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.160
- Sure did. Something's wrong... 
- Signal the husband.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.560
*coughing*

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.760
Oh-Oh. She's looking at us... What did she say?

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.340
Oh, sorry sir. No one was listening.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.320
Is it garbage night? We left the toilet seat up? What is it woman, what?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.620
I'm Joy, this is Sadness, that's Anger,
this is Disgust and that's Fear.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.300
We're Riley's emotions.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.239
Yeah!

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.360
These are Riley's memories.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.700
They're mostly happy, you'll notice. Not to brag...

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.420
I wanted to maybe hold one.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.200
What happened?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.940
Sadness!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.020
She did something to the memory!

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.040
Is everything okay?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.240
I don't know!

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.460
- Take it back, joy! 
- I'm trying!

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.560
Joy, no... wait...

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.640
The core memories! *screaming*

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.440
No! No! No! *screaming*

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.460
Can I say that curse word now?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.820
What do we do now?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.160
Nothing's working! Why isn't it working?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.360
We have a major problem.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.580
Oh, I wish Joy was here!

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.060
We can fix this.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.580
We just have to get back to headquarters.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.620
That's long term memory, you could get lost in there.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.740
Think positive!

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.580
Ok, I'm positive you will get lost in there!

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.480
What was that? Was it a bear?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.160
There are no bears in San Francisco.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.840
I saw a really hairy guy, he looked like a bear.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.060
This place is huge! Imagination land!

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.780
No way! Dream productions!

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.440
Rainbow Unicorn, she's right there!

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.960
I loved you in "Fairy dream adventure part 7". Ok, bye.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.700
I love you.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.860
We can't focus on what's going wrong, there's always a way to turn things around.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.160
It's broccoli!

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.840
Congratulations San Francisco, you've ruined pizza!

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.120
Who's the birthday girl?

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.700
*screaming*

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.680
Brain freeze! *screaming*

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.220
Hang on!

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.800
Riley, here we come!
