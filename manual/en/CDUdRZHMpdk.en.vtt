00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.600
We always worked from day to day...

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.480
l mean, when we were writing
in the rehearsal studios...

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.420
Cos l mean, all the songs
are obviously named...

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.880
Lemmy always wrote all the lyrics.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.760
He's a good lyricist,
l love Lemmy's lyrics, he's great.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.770
Lemmy can be very, sort of, deep,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.430
he can be very educational,
he can be very philosophical,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.770
and he can be very funny,
all in the same song.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.440
But it doesn't seem like it upon first glance.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.410
l wouldn't say you have to know him
to read between the lines.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.940
He writes about things that are going on
not only in his life

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.920
but all around him or everyone else.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.890
But not...

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.780
You know, not specifically.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.790
Very tongue-in-cheek or cynical,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.820
without naming names.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.800
Double meanings and double entendres.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.330
But you know what he's writing about.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.570
He writes great love songs,
they just don't sound like love songs.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.480
So he always wrote the lyrics,
and the song titles came from those lyrics.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.150
He always left his lyric writing
right to the very last minute.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.780
He would be writing all the way through

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.780
but he would be changing and chopping them
when he was at home

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.860
and not until he was satisfied
with lyrics for a certain tune

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.960
would he then show the band the lyrics.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.870
We'd be listening to a playback in the studio

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.310
and he'd come up with a different lyric
every day.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.000
lt seemed as if he'd just pulled it
out of the hat

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.950
but he'd be working on it at home
or while he was at the bar.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.440
The thing about Lemmy,
he's got great powers of concentration.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.220
He could be working
on the lyrics for something

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.750
the same time as reading a book,
playing a one-armed bandit,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.230
sweet-talking some girl and smoking
a cigarette at the same time

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.390
and apply equal amount of concentration
on each subject.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.430
Every one was different.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.610
Most of them l write under the clock
in the studio.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.630
l find that works.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.840
Some l've written before we had the song,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.510
most of them l've written for the song
when we've already got the riff.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.890
But Sacrifice and Orgasmatron
l wrote before we've had the riff.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.120
Couple of songs here and there.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.930
But usually l'm better off
writing to the riff, you know.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.800
l think Lemmy is a very, very fine writer.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.410
Very fine writer. Nobody's ever
given him the time of day for it.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.980
lnfluential people have not
so far stood up and said,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.880
this man is a fine writer,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.510
in the British sense.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.750
Don't forget he's British, English.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.350
Lives in LA. Most sensible move
he ever made.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.490
He was starving in this country,
going nowhere,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.060
went to LA and two years later
he's got a Grammy nomination.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.800
That says something about
what you can achieve in Los Angeles.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.740
He would never have achieved that
in Shepherd's Bush.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.770
But he's got a...

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.310
unparalleled passion for what it is he does

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.370
and as a lyricist he can hardly be touched.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.080
So all around, just his bass sound,
his persona, his creative...

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.080
lt's a lot more than even
what Motorhead encompasses.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.560
l mean, obviously, it's mostly Lemmy's input
as far as the writing's concerned,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.470
but the depth of it,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.100
l think people don't even realize
how sincere and deep some of it is.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.040
Cos it's probably delivered
at such high velocity

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.910
that people are trying to keep their molars in

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.850
and their fillings in their teeth from falling out,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.550
and never stop to think about
the sensitive subtleties

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.920
of Lemmy Kilminster's delivery.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.590
l think Lemmy as a lyricist
is completely underrated.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.600
How many other guys in rock-'n'-roll bands
can you name

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.470
that have managed to fit the word
''parallelogram'' into a song?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500
l'd say he's in a field of one in terms of that.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.910
l think, lyrically, Ace Of Spades,
it's got some fantastic wordplay.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.970
lt's got some straight-up
and direct stuff on there as well

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.640
but it is a hugely romantic record.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.050
l think his lyrics are very romantic on that.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.280
They do celebrate life on the road

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.320
but they also celebrate
the notion of swaggering rock-'n'-roll,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.300
and that rock-'n'-roll is not just about the music,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.700
it's about a way of life.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.030
And l think that's what that record,
lyrically, symbolizes to me.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.940
Lemmy as a lyricist is very underrated.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.370
Extremely underrated.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.250
People chuckle sometimes at the ''simplicity''.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.610
But you know what?
You can remember those words.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.020
And if you look into some of it,
some of his lyrics are very funny.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.050
There's an oblique sense of humor.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.860
He's a great Spike Milligan fan,
and The Goons and Monty Python.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.800
He loves vintage comedy.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.920
He's got an incredible sense of humor,

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.160
very dry, very ironic.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.730
The best sense of humor.
Too quick for most people.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.230
Certainly too quick for me half the time.
But a great sense of humor.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.580
And you do see it in some of the song titles.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.280
Shoot You ln The Back, there's a sense
of irony to a lot of this stuff.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.880
There really is. He's having fun with words.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.950
One of the problems with Motorhead,

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.520
l was always a bit disappointed
that people didn't read Lemmy's lyrics,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.760
which are very, very pungent, very meaningful,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.230
they're not just ordinary lyrics.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.790
l think if people took more notice...

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.470
The trouble was, it was very easy
to dismiss what Motorhead played.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.910
We had terrible trouble with our licensees,
nobody wanted to put Motorhead out.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.980
And we had to really talk everybody into it.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.710
Once they started selling records,
then it was a different thing.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.780
The way we used to write songs,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.990
we always wrote way more
than what came out on the album

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.620
because we'd always pick and choose.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.930
We might rehearse a number
for ages and ages

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.030
but at the end throw it out

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.060
cos we'd get into the studio and record it
and hear what it really sounds like.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.600
Quite a few numbers
don't sound anywhere near as good

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.550
as when you're playing them
at a thousand million watts

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.380
and can't hear what you're playing
in the rehearsal studios.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.980
You get in the studio
and you can hear every little thing.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.050
Some numbers don't sound as good.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.720
So we did have a certain amount
of self quality control.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.960
l think, with any kind of music,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.690
whatever your personality is,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.140
whatever the kind of person you are
and you write and play music,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.200
your persona, so to speak,
or a side of your character,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.540
will somehow come through in the music.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.910
l mean, l don't think you can avoid that.
