How to Make Low-Fat Chicken Tenders.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.130
Even if you're watching your waistline, you
don't have to give up your favorite foods.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.849
Baked – not fried – chicken tenders can
be just as tasty as the real deal.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.290
You will need 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken
breasts 1/4 c.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.520
All-purpose flour 1/4 tsp. black pepper 1
large egg white 1/4 c.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.210
Low-fat buttermilk 1 c. of cornflakes And
low-fat dressing or dipping sauce A large

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.890
baking sheet Aluminum foil An 8-inch kitchen
knife 3 small bowls A wire rack Cooking spray

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.469
And tongs and parmesan cheese, italian seasoning,
or cajun spice.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.910
Step 1.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.530
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and line a
baking sheet with foil.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.239
Set the sheet aside.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.780
Step 2.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.499
Use the kitchen knife to cut the chicken into
pieces 1 to 2 inches in length.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:02.499
Step 3.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.970
Combine the flour and black pepper in a bowl.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.800
In a second bowl, beat the egg white and buttermilk
with a fork.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.360
In the third bowl, crush the cup of cornflakes
so they look like breadcrumbs.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.540
You can add Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning,
or Cajun spice to the flour mixture for some

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.890
extra flavor.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.890
Step 4.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.070
Dip a tender into the flour and pepper first
and turn over to coat completely.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.100
Step 5.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.030
Dip into the egg and buttermilk mixture, and
then roll in the cornflakes until the chicken

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.610
piece is completely covered.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.820
Place on a wire rack to set.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.840
Repeat with the rest of the chicken.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.240
Step 6.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.590
Spray the foil with cooking spray, and then
transfer the tenders from the wire rack onto

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.590
the pan.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.380
Leave about 2 inches of space between each
tender, then put the pan in the oven.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.780
Step 7.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.780
Bake for five minutes, then turn over with
tongs and bake the other side until golden,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.300
about five minutes more.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.530
Serve with your favorite low-fat dressing
or dipping sauce.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.310
Did you know Fried chicken tenders from a
fast-food chain can contain 40 grams of fat

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.090
– 61 percent of the recommended daily allowance.
