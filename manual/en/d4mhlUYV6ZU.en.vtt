[ Silence ]

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.820
Good. The last activity we’re going
to do, guys, is called Radio Active River.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.470
Here’s what’s going to happen.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.940
I’m going to put you in two teams.
Let’s get from [Diego], [Marisol],

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.550
all you guys, let’s go to that -- let’s
go by the water -- water bubbler.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.050
All these guys.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.160
- Push your chairs in?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.930
- Yes. Let’s push these chairs
all the way against the wall.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.290
You guys on this side are going to
push your desks that way,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040
and you’re going to
come over here by the board.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.990
[ Quiet talking ]

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.560
Push that chair in.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:01:13.420
[ Quiet talking ]

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.450
And this has to stay.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.910
You guys are going to take this line.
They're going to take that line.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.840
So the one students that were on this -- 
left side of the room, come over here.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.700
Okay.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.050
So here’s what’s
going to happen.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.870
You -- this is your guys.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.650
And this is for you guys.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.010
You guys are going to have
three small spots, one big spot.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.690
You guys have to use these spots
to get to that side of the room,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.800
the same way you guys are using
your three basketball spots

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.570
with the big number spots to take
your team all the way to that side.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.030
Okay. You guys will stay here.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.180
You guys will go through
that aisle there.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.670
You can't touch the floor, and you got
to bring everything with you.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.750
You understand that, guys?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.340
Did we get that over here, team?

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.860
- Yes!
- Yes.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.230
- So you got your three basketball spots
plus your big number spots.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.140
You guys, without touching the floor,
and bringing all your spots with you,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.710
you have to get your team
across to that side.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.480
Any questions?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.790
(students)
- No.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.720
- Ready, go.
Go ahead, guys.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:54.230
[ Quiet talking ]

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.580
Ah, you stepped out.
You got to come all the way back.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.940
Nope, nope, nope.
You stepped on the floor.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.660
Take the two spots back.
Yep. Here.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.480
[ Quiet talking ]

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.940
No, you can't slide with it.
Nope.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:48.070
[ Quiet talking ]

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.030
That was close.
Good.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:02.160
[ Quiet talking ]

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.700
All right. Good.
Just stay there for a second.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:20.890
[ Quiet talking ]

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.230
And freeze for a second.
That was pretty good.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.860
One -- things we need to work on first.
Let’s make sure this team -- the boys

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.290
had good ideas, but what they didn't do,
they didn't communicate them

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.450
with the rest of the team.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.990
What if the girls would have had
good ideas about using those spots?

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.010
Okay?

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.620
Same thing with you guys. You guys --
you started throwing spots out.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.490
Did you communicate as a team
what you were going to do

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.400
with those spots, how you were
going to retrieve them?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.970
And some of these, ah, I could say
some of the -- some of us made it,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.100
some of us didn't.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.410
This may be too long of a jump
for some students.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.000
It may not be too long of a jump
for other students.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.650
So you got to take
all those things into consideration.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.040
So you’re going to go
pick up your spots again.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.530
Go ahead. Pick them up.
Pick them up there.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.560
We’re going to try one more time,
but this time we’re going to

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.280
communicate a little bit better.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.070
And I’m going to take a spot away.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.030
Now I’m taking a spot away.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.160
- Do we got to go back?

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.670
- Now you got to back, yeah.
I told you the wrong -- I --

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.370
no, no, stay there.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.100
But I told you the wrong -- you got to
go all the way to the different one now.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.150
- Okay.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.110
- And, go.
Go ahead. Go.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.450
Now, did you communicate
with them what you’re doing?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.460
Make sure you communicate.
Maybe they have good ideas.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:06:05.830
[ Quiet talking ]

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.970
Come right there.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:15.900
[ Quiet talking ]

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.060
All right. That may be too far
of a jump for some students.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.480
Did you guys talk about that?
[Inaudible], you stepped inside.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.020
Go back.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.550
Stepped inside.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.480
[ Quiet talking ]

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.390
Ah, ah, ah, ah, you stepped inside.
Go back.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.660
[ Quiet talking ]

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.600
No. She made it.
There, she made it.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.540
Uh, no, no, no.
Come back.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:07:07.750
[ Quiet talking ]

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.000
[Whistle] Guys, give yourself
a round of applause.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.850
[ Applause ]
