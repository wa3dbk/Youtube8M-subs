00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.250
Narrator
It is autumn in the Napa Valley of California.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.889
And the rush is on to harvest this year’s
bounty of grapes. Time is of the essence.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.400
Daniel Bosch-viniculturalist
When you’re growing grapes for wines, especially

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.830
reds, you’re very much on the edge in terms
of too much stress and too little stress.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.169
And so the push is always to do more stress.
But if the weather is adverse in terms that

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.050
it’s too hot or it’s too dry. You can
go overboard. And so the risk really is –

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.860
 because you’re on the knife’s edge –
 you can go too far.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.670
Narrator
Daniel Bosch knows the risk in the high stakes

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.670
business of vineyard production. He is the
senior viniculturalist for Robert Mondavi

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.329
wines, making crucial decisions for this 1500-acre
operation, one of Napa’s largest.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.910
But he also understands that water is the
key. Guessing wrongly about moisture beneath

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.370
the surface can lead to a bad harvest. If
the soil is too moist, the grapes grow fat

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.860
and flavorless. Too dry, they just wither
and die. What Bosch wants is the optimum amount

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.660
of H2O to produce tiny grapes bursting with
flavor- deep blue jewels that offer the most

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.520
delicious wine.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.830
Daniel Bosch
Soil really determines an awful lot in quality

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.270
of growing grapes. And the water relations
in the soil is really the primary way that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.750
soil is involved in wine quality.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.250
Narrator
But to date, determining soil moisture leaves

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.200
much to be desired. Growers sometimes dig
test holes to see below. This is spotty information

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.520
at best. They also check the moisture inside
the plant.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.990
Daniel Bosch
We use a leaf water potential machine in order

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.630
to test how stressed the vines are…it’s
a reflection of how much water is available

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.390
in the soil, It’s our major means in determining
when to irrigate and whether we need to put

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.070
more or less water on. Our current methods
are all point measurements. So it’s single

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.500
vines or a few vines.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.930
Narrator
But at the University of California-Berkeley,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.820
soil explorer Yoram Rubin thought he might
have a better method. He contacted Daniel

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.250
Bosch with a novel way to “see” below
the surface.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.229
Yoram Rubin-University of California-Berkeley
GPR stands for ground-penetrating radar. GPR

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.170
is a system that sends an electronic signal
into the ground and records it after it travels

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.170
a certain while. And we then take the recorded
signals back to the lab and we interpret them.

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.689
We had the instrumentation, but it had to
be modified for use in vineyards, and –

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:36.390
 more importantly – we had to develop the
methodology for interpreting the signal. It’s

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.849
high risk research. The technology that was
unproven when we started. It’s on the interface

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:48.849
between basic research and applied research.
What we found in CSREES is an openness and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.430
the willingness to take the risk. They, in
effect, allowed us to do it. There was no

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.799
other way.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.040
Narrator
Back in Napa, a prototype GPR device is put

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.370
to the test. Assembling the maze of cables,
connections and computers is left to the deft

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.519
hands of another soil explorer, Katherine
Grote.

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:10.519
Katherine Grote-University of Wisconsin-Eau
Claire

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.739
I was the primary data collector and processor
here. So I would come out on a typical day

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.430
and collect data. The great thing about radar
is you get real high density data.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.450
Narrator
As the unit is dragged across the surface,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.159
it sends a high-frequency electromagnetic
pulse down into the soil. The signal is then

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:38.439
reflected back to a receiver, and recorded
into a laptop computer. The speed of the transmitted

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.409
and reflected signals varies with the soil’s
water content. Pulses move slower through

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.370
wetter soils, faster in drier ones.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.279
Yoram Rubin
Here, very quickly, we actually monitor a

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:55.760
very large area and get a three dimensional
image of the soil –and with that get the

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.430
comprehensive image of soil moisture and control
the stress irrigation process.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.340
The second advantage is related to harvesting.
When they get an image or information of the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.150
soil moisture content – with that they can
control the irrigation. They can control the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.040
maturation of the fruit such that the fruit
from the entire block matures at around the

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.140
same time. They can send the crew just one
time. With the strong competition to California

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.870
wine coming from the New World wines – 
Australia, Chile, Argentina – there’s

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.150
no choice.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.090
Daniel Bosch
First of all, that really helps in understanding

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.690
how deep the roots are, where the water is,
how fast it’s starting to run out, and that

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.780
makes farming easier.
And the ground-penetrating radar, the GPR,

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.470
measures multiple points, so we can get sort
of a 3-D look of what’s going on rather

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.010
than just one-point
Having that picture allows us, to be more

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.410
efficient in designing so that we don’t,
after the fact, have to make adjustments to

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.010
how we planted.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.080
Yoram Rubin
Want to taste it, Dan?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.170
Narrator
The ability to better plan new vineyards is

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.700
a huge advantage for Bosch.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.150
Dan Bosch
Almost ready.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.210
Narrator
Napa is known for its rolling hills and varied

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.540
earth that rapidly change from loam, to sand,
to gravel. Over 30 types of soil have been

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.540
identified in the valley. GPR will allow viniculturalists
to efficiently match their plantings to variations

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.060
in the subsurface terrain. And there are environmental
advantages for California, a state that uses

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.020
more water than any other.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.520
Yoram Rubin
The larger the pressure on water resources…

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.440
there will be a growing pressure to control
irrigation. This is not just because we need

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.440
to save water, but because water can actually
percolate below the root zone and carry with

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.110
it pesticides deeper into the ground. So you
really want to irrigate as much as is needed

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.530
and not a drop more. And this you can do with…our
technology.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.780
Katherine Grote
Vineyard managers can irrigate preferentially

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.300
so that the dryer areas get more water and
the areas that are wetter get less water.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.520
And, of course, that improves the quality
of the wine grape. One of the big questions

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.660
now is, of course, global warming. And one
of the problems is that most of the data they

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.910
gather for that is satellite data with very,
very poor resolutions. You might have a kilometer

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.780
scale resolution. And we can use a GPR data
to sort of ground-truth the satellite data.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.810
I’m just very excited about the potential
of this technique. If you read the manuals

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.680
of how to measure water content, GPR is not
even mentioned yet. But as we develop this,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.650
say in 3-5 years, I think it has very far
reaching potential for both precision agriculture

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.050
and more traditional farming.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.060
Narrator
The future for the technology looks bright.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.970
Katherine Grote now uses GPR in Wisconsin
to determine nitrate content through electric

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.970
conductivity. This CSREES-funded research
helps Midwest farmers determine optimum fertilizer

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:43.690
applications for their fields. Yoram Rubin
is exploring ways to use the radar for monitoring

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:50.690
moisture below highways, with hopes of better
predicting road maintenance needs. And for

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.560
Dan Bosch, he remains on the land.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.700
Dan Bosch
The French have a concept of what they call

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.240
terroir. And it’s really a concept of the
place, of the environment, of the soil, of

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.640
the people, of the history. It’s really
all of those.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.640
A lot of it is experience. And we’re hoping
that with the techniques like GPR that we

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.870
can make some jumps ahead. And I think we’re
starting to see some of the same advantages

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.580
it took other people hundreds of years.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:29.670
With GPR, I can imagine at some point you
could attach it to a tractor and go down every

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.490
few rows and have a good understanding of
what your various parts of the vineyard are

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.750
doing.
