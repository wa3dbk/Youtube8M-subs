00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.509
 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.600
Joe Brody is the head scientist at a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.510
nuclear power plant in Japan and

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.170
how ironic we're dealing with these
issues in real life

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.360
meltdowns and accidents and this and that

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.390
and there is an anomaly in

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.610
in the normal structure that he can't quite answer and he's trying to

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.170
figure out what the problem is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.210
but noone will listen, nobody wants to
shut down the plant

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.720
for safety reasons and then it's too
late

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.120
and he realizes this is

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.500
there's something far bigger going on
here than what we initially thought,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.830
and so there is a tragedy at the plant

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.600
that he has to live with. An own
personal tragedy and it breaks him as a man.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.380
He becomes a mad scientist then hell bent on finding the truth

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.460
or else he might as well just go be a
homeless person he

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.119
he's so compelled and so anxiety-ridden

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.119
over his guilt that he has to find some
answers somehow

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.700
in order to survive himself now.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.900
I think that the most attractive
component to Godzilla

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.550
the most surprising thing in this version: was how

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.970
deeply drawn characters were

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.500
that I really cared about them reading
the script day

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.510
I felt for them I was curious about
their plight where they were going to go

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.400
if they were going to survive and how
they were going to manage to get back together

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.670
it was compelling for me so that was really

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.500
became the foundation of it before I even
read the script

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.520
the sensibility of Godzilla

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.250
it's almost overwhelming you know it's
as as overwhelming as Godzilla itself

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.800
so if it was just a monster movie about total destruction I wouldn't be interested

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.070
but this movie is more than, its more carefully crafted

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.700
and you have the epic battles and the action of a great

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.410
monster movie but you also have

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.870
a compelling drama played out with these
characters
