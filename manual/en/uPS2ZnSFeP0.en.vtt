00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.037
Your voice sounds so tired and done with life...

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.880
Oh...

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.500
Okay....

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.480
I'm sorry...

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.235
When will your next animation be ready? Greetings from Mexico!

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.740
It might be a little bit of time, but I do have one thing written and another thing in the process of being written,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.780
but right now I'm sort of working on something for other people. So, hold on.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.646
Have you enjoyed your life up to this point?

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.120
Yeah! No... no big complaints.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.080
It's good!

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.500
Do you like singing?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.060
Not in public.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.909
Do you like roller coasters?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.520
Yes.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.178
What's your favorite THAC.tv video? (You expressed that you liked them.)

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.320
Uhh, if I have to choose I guess- well... AH.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.780
It's gonna be... it's gonna be two choices:

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.720
One is Troy Shaves his Face,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.100
and then the other is the Time Opens a Present... series.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.547
What do you use for editing?

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:56.273
Adobe Premiere

00:00:56.273 --> 00:01:00.810
Have you ever thought of doing a 60fps animation? You know to challenge yourself in a way.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.080
See, the thing is about, like, framrates and stuff,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.200
I know for games 60fps is actually helpful because of reaction times and all that,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.860
but with animation, the amount of frames after maybe 24 becomes sort of redundant.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.240
Because you're basically doing more than two times the amount of work for something that's not really gonna look that much different.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:27.945
So, probably not.

00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:31.044
How many times did you go through puberty to get that awesome voice?

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:33.080
*MANLY* One time was all I needed.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.852
*LESS MANLY* Heehee!

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.680
Why do you never answer my questions?!

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.360
Well what was your question?

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.040
How do you not have more subscribers?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.388
I don't control the subscriber count, that's up to you guys!

00:01:44.388 --> 00:01:45.940
Are you the dayman?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.820
Dayman! AHHHHAAAHAA

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.160
Fighter of the NIghtman! AHHHHAAAHAA-

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.485
Why do you always have some freaky thing in all of your Q&amp;A's?

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.900
I have N͜ó̕ ̨͡i̡͠d͡e̛͜͠a҉͞ wh͠ą̢͜t͠ ̢ỳ̵ò́͘u͘͠'̷̡r̶̨é ̴͞t͢͜a̴l͢k̢͘i͏̶n҉g͏͞ ̨͡a̢͏bo̵͝ù̶̶t̸͡.̷̀

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.290
Have you seen your life change when you got more subs and how?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.060
Well change in the fact that I.... started... I guess "Youtubing" full time.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.640
Because, like, at the beginning of this year I had 26 subscribers, and I was just...

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.300
It was just a place to slap my animations on the internet to maybe share with friends and family.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.620
And.. now...

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.780
People, like, watch my videos and comment and enjoy them.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.080
And get inspired by them somehow, which is amazing! And all the fanart and stuff! It's like...

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.693
I never expected any of that to happen! But... I'm really, I'm really thankful it did!

00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:39.663
Hey Cranbersher, are there any projects you're working on you could shares with us?

00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:42.828
Or are you just working on things you've already publicized, like the How-To series?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.960
Well...

00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:45.576
*cough*

00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:46.618
*COUGH*

00:02:46.618 --> 00:02:49.473
How do make sure the character's mouths are always synced to the dialogue when you're animating?

00:02:49.473 --> 00:02:51.633
Your characters' dialogues always look spot on.

00:02:51.648 --> 00:02:54.540
Thank you! And.. uh...

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.580
Wait for it!

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.743
If you could do only one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be?

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.600
Animate.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.620
Can you make an acronymn for CRANBERSHER?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.560
Uhhhmmm...

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.440
Uhhh..

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.960
Colorful... Rabbits...Are...

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.160
Not...Being...Eaten...Regularly...

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.200
So...Have...Every...Radish...

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.180
...Yeah!

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.860
What is your name in real life?

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.910
EH...It's this:

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.612
Do you feel pretty awesome that Mark knows about you? Like more than any other animators?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.420
Well, I wouldn't say he know about me more than other animators per se...

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.825
And he's a cool and really nice guy and all, and he helped me out more than he probably should have,

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:48.085
and I'm really thankful that he actually did that, but I mean he's just a nice guy, playing games on the internet!

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:51.892
That being said I'm probably still gonna freak out if I ever meet him... DAMMIT.

00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:58.251
What's your favorite kind of jelly? (If you happen to not like jelly, substitute jam, preservatives, or other spreadable breakfast or toast condiments?)

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.160
Are you ready?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.240
Are you sure you're ready?

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.000
Marmite.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.320
*"OH GOD WHY?!?!" Music*

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.620
All right, that's it for this Q&amp;A!

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.278
Leave any more questions you may have down in the comments, and I will answer those in the futureeeeEEUHAUHAH-

00:04:23.278 --> 00:04:26.225
All right, thanks for watching and take care! Bye!
