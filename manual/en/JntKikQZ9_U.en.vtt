Hey guys it's Phil from smilinggardener.com
and I haven't made a video for a while so

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.080
I thought I'd just say hey!

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.790
I actually don't make videos so much once
the summer rolls around and I don't write

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.260
articles so much because I find then that
you guys are often onto other things, onto

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.379
whatever you do in the summer and I guess
I am, too.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.780
I get on to other projects often in the summer
and I just get on to other interests.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.900
I still garden, but I find the gardening at
this time of year since everything is planted

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.539
especially because this is becoming more and
more of a perennial garden that takes care

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.440
of itself, I just come in once a month and
I weed and I fertilize.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.130
So for weeding which is what I'm going to
be doing all day today, or I've already started

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.079
doing, is I just pull the weeds and I leave
them right on the ground in the mulch and

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.540
they have so many benefits as a mulch rather
than taking them away, and they disappear

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.809
within a couple of weeks and they become part
of the soil.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.989
So I'll be doing that today and then I'll
be fertilizing, and for fertilizing I use

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.469
my hose end sprayer attach a hose to it, it
makes it really easy to fertilize the whole

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.070
garden and as you guys know if you follow
me I have a few products I regularly use for

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.390
that so effective microorganisms or SCD probiotics
which is like bringing these beneficial microorganisms

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.859
into the garden and along with that some more
nutrition like more fertilizers such as liquid

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.009
seaweed and very concentrated ocean water
and molasses goes in here, too because it

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.929
feeds the microorganisms and makes them happy.

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.869
So I'll be spraying that today I'll put links
to all those things down below if you want

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.819
to learn more about them but I know a lot
of you are already using them.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.749
And then for the rest of the year it seems
like it's different every year I always get

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.859
into some kind of a new project or some kind
of a past project or something like that and

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:42.649
so this year I'm getting into a project that's
going to help you improve your health and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.759
your happiness ultimately and I'm not an expert
in any of that so I'm partnering up with people

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.849
who know how to do these things and can teach
me while I'm at it and so it'll be nutrition

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.599
and fitness and mind and I'll be talking to
various experts and I'll be telling you more

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.570
about it as I learn more about it because
it's evolving all the time.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.349
It's actually the continuation of a project
I started in the fall that some of you will

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.349
remember.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:10.170
It didn't feel quite right yet in the fall
and now it's starting to feel pretty exciting.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.240
So I'll be telling you more about that and
I actually have a question related to that

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240
today.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.970
I always love your comments that you post
down below, you ask such great questions about

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.630
gardening and I like to hear about your gardens
and today I really want to hear about these

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.860
other topics: nutrition and fitness and happiness
and mind.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.650
So I want to ask you a few things today, I
want to ask you for nutrition are there certain

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.800
guidelines you try to follow when it comes
to what to eat and maybe what not to eat so

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.580
much of and especially are there certain questions
you have about nutrition or things you find

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.090
youself struggling with.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.480
I'm especially interested in that because
I'm going to be interviewing naturopaths,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.720
and nutritionist and dietitians and I'd love
to have some questions to bring to them from

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720
you guys.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.540
And then the same thing with exercise, what
do you do for exercise, what do you do to

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.580
stay fit, to stay in shape to move? and what
kind of things do you struggle with there?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.920
and what kind of questions do you have for
people like personal trainers and physiotherapists?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.450
maybe chiropractors? but especially people
that are into the whole fitness world - I'll

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.410
be excited to interview them and bring you
questions from them.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.590
and then with mind, I've really learned this
year the importance of having a resilient

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.270
mind and being able to deal with stresses
in your life and anxiety, and also just how

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.200
to be happy in the face of adversity but even
just in general I think we all want to be

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.790
happy all the time.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.230
What do you do to be happy? and to relieve
stress? and to live a good life what kind

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.330
of practices do you do? and what kind of things
do you struggle with there? and what kind

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.560
of questions would you have for therapists
and psychologists and people who practice

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.970
mediation and all these kinds of things?

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.380
So, ya I'm really excited to hear about that
from you and hear how you deal with nutrition

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.470
and how you deal with exercise and how you
deal with your mind and I'd like to really

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.090
get chatting about that over the next couple
of weeks in the comments below and maybe other

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.091
people will weigh in on what you say and maybe
we can get a bit of a conversation going.

00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:02.260
And I think it's going to be a lot of fun!

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.940
So I would love it if you'd post down below
and I will respond to you soon!
