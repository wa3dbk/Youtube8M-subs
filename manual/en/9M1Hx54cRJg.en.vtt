&gt;&gt; Shannon Kearns-DePatto: Hi.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.660
My name is Shannon DePatto.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.550
I am the Pediatric Health Educator here with
the Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.500
with the Pediatric Trauma Injury Prevention
Program.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.299
Today we're going to be talking about car
seat safety, and proper installation in your

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.350
vehicle.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.400
It's important to remember that this proper
installation could someday save your child's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.890
life in the event of a crash.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.929
First of all we're going to focus on the infant
seat, which is the seat that you will be using

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.269
to bring your baby home from the hospital.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.710
When installing a seat, there are two different
ways to install properly.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.370
You can either use the lower anchor system,
which is at the [inaudible] your vehicle seat

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.920
here, or you can also use the seat belt.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.650
You never want to use both of them together,
it's either one or the other.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.040
Let's start by showing you the lower anchors.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.210
The lower anchors are attached to the car
seat, as you can see here, and this will attach

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.329
to the anchor in your vehicle.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.910
Once we have them attached, we need to make
sure this seat doesn't move any more than

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.730
an inch side to side.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.090
So we're going to pull the adjustor strap
to make it nice and snug by pushing at the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.400
same time.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.760
This will allow the seat to be nice and snug,
and not move any more than an inch.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.030
If your vehicle does not have the lower anchor
system, you will then use the seatbelt.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.140
The seatbelt and the lower anchor system are
never used together.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.700
You will either use one or the other.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.280
If you are using the seatbelt, the best way
to do this is to pull the seatbelt out as

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.430
much as you need, feed the seatbelt through
what we call the belt path of the infant carrier

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.080
base, and buckle in.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.820
Once you have that seatbelt buckled in and
laying nice and flat, you will then pull your

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.880
seatbelt out the whole way to lock it within
the vehicle.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.700
After you've done that, you want to let the
slack go back into the vehicle, and then pull,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.750
and push at the same time to achieve that
tightness, and less of an inch of movement.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.430
You will then check your seat at where the
seatbelt's going through the car seat to make

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.390
sure it's nice and snug.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.120
Once the car seat has been installed in your
vehicle properly, and is nice and snug, you

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.750
will then place the actual carrier in the
base, making sure that you hear a click to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.810
know that it is attached to the base.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.890
Once we have it attached to the base, we will
make sure that the baby is nice and snug in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.060
the actual car seat itself.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.590
Now that we have the car seat installed properly
in the vehicle, it's important now that we

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.370
place baby safely in the seat.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.290
Baby will be placed in the seat with the [inaudible]
pushed all the way back.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.310
Harnesses will now come over top of baby to
make sure they are either at or below the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.400
baby's shoulders.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.569
Once we have the baby in, we are going to
clip together the harness clip, as well as

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.560
the clip in between the baby's legs, making
sure that we hear clicks on each one of those

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.310
clips.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.200
Now that we have the harnesses together, we
need to make sure they're very snug.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.930
If you can pinch the harness straps together
like so, they are too loose, so it's important

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.320
to make sure that you pull the harness strap
adjuster on this particular seat to make sure

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.110
harnesses are very snug on the baby, and there's
no room for movement.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.540
Once you have them nice and snug, the harness
clip, one buckled, will need to sit right

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.560
at the armpit levels going across their chest
bone or nipple line of the baby to provide

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.880
extra support.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.200
You don't want it down too low on the belly
where there's soft tissue and could cause

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.209
internal damage in the event of a crash.

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.460
Sitting at that armpit level is very important,
with these harnesses nice and snug.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.950
The baby then will be buckled in between their
legs to keep their position safe, and not

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.400
have them slide down into the car seat.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.390
