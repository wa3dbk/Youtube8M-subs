00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.630
BFRB is a new umbrella term that is coming
into effect in our community.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.470
What does BFRB stand for?

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.790
Body Focused Repetitive Behaviour Disorders.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.170
But what exactly is a BFRB?

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.199
Summarising characteristics of a BFRB is quite
difficult, but I do have a short definition

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.869
here that may help.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.480
It's defined by the inability to resist an
urge to carry out a behaviour towards oneself,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.359
normally reflective in overactive grooming.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.500
It is more complicated than that but that
is a simple definition.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.500
What disorders are currently being held under
the BFRB term?

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.610
Trichotillomania, which is the disorder that
I spend most of my time talking about, it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.320
where the person is compelled to tear out
their hair strand by strand, resulting in

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.030
bald patches and this can lead to emotional
trauma.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.830
Trichophagia. Now this is a sub category of
Trichotillomania, this is where the person

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.579
tears out their hair and then eats it. And
this can result in the person having to have

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.040
operations to remove the hair balls from their
stomach. It is really serious and it can be

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.250
potentially life threatening.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.220
Trichotemnomania: where the person repeatedly
shaves or cuts their hair. One big example

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.150
is pubic hair shaving. This has been said
to be in the body dysmorphic disorder category,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.090
but all my research keeps adding this one
to the list so I've put it in here as well.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.550
Dermotillamania, which has been renamed to
Excoriation Disorder. Is where the person

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.490
compulsively picks at their skin. This can
result in severe scarring.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.200
Dermatophagia is the compulsive biting of
your skin, now this can be the insides of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.750
your cheeks, the bits around your fingers,
biting your lips. It's not the same, but it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.490
is similar to Dermatillomania and the next
disorder on my list.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.270
Which is: Onychophagia. Basically, that is
nail biting and it's probably the most common

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.210
of the disorders and the most accepted in
society. Most people have never heard of the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.890
name, but they are aware of nail biting.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.771
Onychotillomania: is where a person constantly
picks at their nails and tears them off. It

00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:06.900
is not the same as Onychophagia and Dermatillomania.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.260
Rhinotillexomania: and that is compulsive
nose picking and not just the typical nose

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.120
picking like that, full on really aggressive
nose picking that can cause severe damage.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.630
And the last one on my list, I have found
on so many websites but it hasn't got a specific

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.480
name, it might do, but I haven't been able
to find it - and it is: Scab eating disorder.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.310
It is important to say that all the disorders
that are being held under the BFRB term are

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.830
constantly changing and in addition to that,
the actual make up of the disorders - what

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.590
makes them what they are, is also constantly
being redefined and altered... by things such

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.590
as the DSM.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.580
There is a difference between OCD and BFRB,
there are some disorders that you think to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.410
yourself, they should be under the BFRB category,
but no... they are listed as OCD.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.709
For example: compulsive hand washing, exercising,
cutting, burning, addictions to plastic surgery

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.099
and smoking. There are more.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.400
Right now, as I make this video - everything
is up to date and current. But I can't guarantee

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.390
it will stay this way. It will most likely
change within a year.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.090
Erm, also I can't give general statistics
for all of these conditions because in some

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.470
cases, they just don't exist.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.480
What I can say is, that these disorders affect
millions of people. They're not as rare or

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.440
non-existant as so many people seem to think
when they discover them. The amount of research

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.720
into these disorders is very small and right
now there is no known cure. So we just have

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.910
to keep fighting and battling onwards. Whilst
it's important to promote the awareness of

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.590
BFRB's, please remember that all the disorders
I have mentioned are individual disorders.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.569
Just because a person says they have one or
a few BFRB's, it doesn't mean they have all

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.269
BFRB's. This is now the official BFRB ribbon
which is blue and green and just to say that

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.830
there are organisations out there that are
promoting awareness and helping people.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.170
Also to spread the message that 'you're not
alone'.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.069
This has been a very simple outline as to
what BFRB's are and I hope this explains a

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.950
bit more to some of you who knew nothing about
prior this video. It's all quite new, even

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.950
for me.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.910
Err, so thank you for watching and yes, check
the video description for links and information.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.870
Okay, see you soon everyone.
