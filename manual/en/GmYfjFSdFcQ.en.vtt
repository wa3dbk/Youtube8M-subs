&gt;&gt; AMERICA HAS 18 MORE
MONTHS OF ELECTION AWESOMENESS

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.507 align:start position:0% line:91%
YET TO LOOK FORWARD TO,
BUT IN BRITAIN THE BALLOTS

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.675 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARE ALL COUNTED.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:14.947 line:91%
SO I WENT ACROSS THE POND TO
SEE HOW THEY ROCKED THE VOTE.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.948 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHEERIO.

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:17.750 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEMOCRACY IN THE U.K.,
JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS ON

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:20.420 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ROAD TO THE-- WAIT,
THAT'S WHERE THE PRIME

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.255 align:start position:0% line:85%
MINISTER LIVES?

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:24.524 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE
JUST ENDURED ONE OF THE

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.793 align:start position:0% line:91%
LONGEST ELECTION SEASONS IN
THEIR HISTORY.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.594 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS OVERBLOWN, IN MY
OPINION.

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:34.300 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST GONE ON AND ON AND
ON.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:34.867 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IN FACT, I'VE STOPPED
LISTENING TO THE RADIO SINCE

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.035 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT ALL BEGAN.

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.136 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SAT DOWN WITH ELECTION
EXPERT KATIE GHOSE WHO MUST BE

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:39.539 align:start position:0% line:91%
EXHAUSTED FROM THE YEARS OF
NONSTOP CAMPAIGNING.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.942 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE FORMAL CAMPAIGN
KICKED OFF AT THE END OF

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:43.342 align:start position:0% line:85%
MARCH.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:44.343 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:47.680 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OUR CAMPAIGN PERIOD
LASTS FOR JUST SIX WEEKS.

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:48.714 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SIX WEEKS OF ELECTION?

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:49.648 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.218 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU SPEND $5
BILLION IN SIX WEEKS?

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.189 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, NO BODY WOULD EVER
BE ALLOWED TO SPEND $5

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.390 align:start position:0% line:85%
BILLION.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.258 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK THAT BRITISH PEOPLE
WOULD BE HORRIFIED BY THE SHEER

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.562 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SUMS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME
OVER WHICH MONEY IS SPENT ON

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.197 align:start position:0% line:85%
ELECTIONS IN AMERICA.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.700 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HORRIFIED MEANS GOOD HERE,
RIGHT?

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.571 size:78% position:39% line:91%
LIKE IT'S SICK, LIKE IT'S
TERRIBLE, LIKE IT'S DOPE.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.705 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT'S BAD.

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.308 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAVE QUITE STRICT
REGULATIONS ON SPENDING

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.442 align:start position:0% line:85%
HERE.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.145 size:88% position:44% line:91%
EACH PARTY WILL HAVE A TOTAL
SPENDING LIMIT OF AROUND $30

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:19.612 align:start position:0% line:85%
MILLION POUNDS.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.180 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; PER WEEK.

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:23.683 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; FOR THE FORMAL CAMPAIGN
PERIOD.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.484 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SERIOUSLY?

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:26.986 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S ONLY LIKE 15 MILLION
DOLLARS.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:31.457 line:91%
OR ABOUT ONE 50th THE AMOUNT A
SINGLE AMERICAN CANDIDATE MIGHT

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.525 align:start position:0% line:85%
SPEND.

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:34.694 size:81% position:41% line:91%
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU RUN A
CAMPAIGN WITH BULL [BLEEP]

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:35.795 align:start position:0% line:85%
MONEY?

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.197 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PARLIAMENTARY
CANDIDATE, MAAJID NAWAZ.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.532 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE LOOKING FOR

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.243 size:75% position:38% line:91%

JUST AS FAR AS YOU WOULD

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.211 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXPECT.

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:54.680 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M ROBIN, I'M MAAJID'S

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.749 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:58.551 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU MEAN YOUR DAD IS THE
CAMPAIGN ORGANIZER.

00:01:58.584 --> 00:01:59.285 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, I AM.

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:00.586 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE RUNNING THE
CAMPAIGN.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.022 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL, WITH THE HELP
OF THE LOCAL PARTY, YEAH.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:05.391 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU MIND IF I ASK HOW
OLD YOU ARE.

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M 23.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.093 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE 23.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.662 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT I'M A CANDIDATE
MYSELF AS WELL FOR AN

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:10.763 align:start position:0% line:85%
ADJACENT SEAT.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:13.432 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE A CANDIDATE FOR A
MUSTACHE FOR THE NEXT FOUR

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:14.366 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEARS.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.103 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS LACK OF RESOURCES
WAS HEARTBREAKING.

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:19.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, NOT A
KEEPER.

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:22.642 size:78% position:39% line:85%
MONEY'S TIGHT, THANK YOU.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.778 size:81% position:41% line:91%
 LUCKILY, IN AMERICA, WE
HAVE A LITTLE THING CALLED

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:28.114 align:start position:0% line:91%
FREEDOM, THANKS TO THE
SUPREME COURT'S RULING ON

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.383 align:start position:0% line:91%
CITIZEN'S UNITED MONEY IS
CONSIDERED SPEECH.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:33.186 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IT'S FREE TO EXPRESS
ITSELF USING THOUGHT

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROVOKING POLITICAL
ADVERTISING LIKE THESE

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:36.656 align:start position:0% line:85%
ACTUAL ADS.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.993 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO USE MY GLOCK TO
BLOW YOUR BALLS OFF.

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:44.163 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
POLITICAL TV ADS ARE BANNED

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.531 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN THE U.K.

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.568 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THE PARTIES MUST USE ANOTHER
WAY TO TAKE DOWN THEIR

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.169 align:start position:0% line:85%
OPPONENT.

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.538 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BILLBOARDS ARE ALLOWED IN
THE U.K. SO THAT IS REALLY

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.507 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE
NEGATIVE ADS.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.676 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,
THEY'RE GOING TO ATTACK

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.147 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THEIR POLITICAL FOES IN THE
SAME MEDIUM YOU WOULD USE TO

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.415 align:start position:0% line:91%
ADVERTISE CHER AT THE
HILTON?

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.183 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE ONE THAT REALLY
CAUGHT PEOPLE'S ATTENTION

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:07.186 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS TIME AROUND WAS ONE
PORTRAYING THE LEADER OF THE

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.090 size:84% position:42% line:91%
LABOUR PARTY ED MILIBAND IN
THE POCKET OF ALEX SALMOND

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:14.527 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE'S IS THE LEADER OF A SMALLER
PARTY -- THE SCOTTISH

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.129 align:start position:0% line:85%
NATIONAL PARTY.

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:18.263 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AND?

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:22.568 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S SHOWING ONE POLITICIAN
IN THE POCKET OF ANOTHER.

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.702 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS NEGATIVE ABOUT THAT?

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.737 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY FELT THAT THAT WAS A
REALLY NEGATIVE THING TO DO.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.005 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO ONE IS SUCKING OFF
HITLER IN THIS SITUATION?

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:26.806 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK WHAT PEOPLE
WANT --

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:27.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, YOU BASICALLY HAD A
PRIME

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.644 align:start position:0% line:91%
MINISTER WHO DID THAT,
AM I RIGHT?

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:32.878 size:78% position:39% line:85%
NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN SLAM.

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:35.147 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE WOULD NEVER HAVE
ANYTHING OF THAT KIND OF

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.115 align:start position:0% line:85%
NATURE.

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:37.183 align:start position:0% line:85%
I THINK THAT --

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:39.485 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GOD, IT'S LIKE THESE
PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN HEAR ME.

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:40.186 align:start position:0% line:85%
DAMMIT.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.988 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN FACT, NO ONE WAS
LISTENING.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.523 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT I KNEW THE BEST PLACE TO
TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT NO

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:48.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE WANTED TO HEAR IS ON
CABLE TV SO I WALKED THROUGH

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:51.731 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THE HALLOWED HALLS OF BBC
INTERNATIONAL TO KNOCK SOME

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.699 align:start position:0% line:91%
SENSE INTO THE BRITISH
PUBLIC.

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:55.268 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
ALL.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.068 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU
GUYS ARE MESSING IT ALL UP.

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:57.503 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:00.673 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU NEED SOME AMERICAN STYLE
POLITICS IN YOUR

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:02.174 align:start position:0% line:91%
BRITISH STYLE WHATEVER YOU
CALL IT.

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:05.511 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT WOULD YOU INJECT TO
IMPROVE WHAT WE'VE GOT?

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:06.679 line:85%
&gt;&gt; DOLLAH DOLLAH BILLS, Y'ALL.

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:07.813 align:start position:0% line:91%
OR I THINK YOU CALL THEM POUNDS
OR COINS, YOU NEED MONEY.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.049 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE FACT THAT THERE IS A

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:13.085 line:91%
POSSIBILITY THAT ED MILIBAND,
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION --

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:14.754 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT? THEY DIDN'T WANT TO
YELL

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:17.323 align:start position:0% line:91%
OR FIGHT OR MAKE IT
INTERESTING AT ALL.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:18.691 align:start position:0% line:85%
[BLEEP] THE BBC.

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:20.626 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WAS GOING TO GET THIS
MESSAGE OUT USING THE

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.165 align:start position:0% line:85%
 WE SHALL OVERCOME.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.500 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE BEING THE MONEY.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.403 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE YOU GUYS CONSIDERED LETTING
MONEY SPEAK IN YOUR

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.337 align:start position:0% line:85%
ELECTIONS?

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:36.175 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO PAY
ATTENTION TO.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:37.109 align:start position:0% line:85%
 LET MONEY TALK.

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:38.210 align:start position:0% line:85%
