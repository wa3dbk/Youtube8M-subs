00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.600
Today, I want to respond to a fan's question

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.100
If you don't have a teacher, what should you pay attention to?

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.420
I'm going to share some views with you.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.840
First, you need to choose a guitar that fits your body

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.400
beacuse it is very easy to buy a big guitar in the shops

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.560
I think the big guitars (dreadnought) are not suitable for smaller people

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.280
This kind of guitar easily makes your right shoulder tired.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.180
So I don't suggest that beginners use a steel string guitar to practice  

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.000
It's easy to buy an unsuitable big guitar

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.100
and you always need to change the steel strings

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.900
If you don't keep the steel string guitar well, it is easy for the guitar's action to rise

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.020
so it is difficult for the left hand to press

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.160
and easy to get tired.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.800
So that's it regarding the guitar; 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.020
now let's look at what we should pay attention to regarding self study.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.060
Because you don't have a teacher

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.160
when you hold the guitar, it's okay just to feel comfortable

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.220
pay attention that your shoulders don't become tense.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.640
The most common injuries are shoulders, neck and lower back.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.000
So if you don't have a teacher it's okay just to feel comfortable

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.140
What must you know for self study?

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.140
Two things are important.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.060
First you need to know how to read music scores.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.320
Usually beginners read tab, so I think it is not difficult to learn.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.960
Second, you need know how to read rhythms.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.340
Being able to read rhythms by yourself is very important

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.980
If you need to listen to every song before you play it

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.100
It is easy to be affected by others 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.100
so it is difficult to build you own style.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.900
Now I will show you how to read rhythms.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.980
Before I talk about reading rhythms, you need to know how to play the strings,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.060
you may watch my previous videos.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.860
Let's look at the score.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.960
Can you see the 4/4?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.240
What is the meaning of those two 4s？

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.260
The upper 4 means 4 beats for each bar, the lower 4 means each beat is a quarter note.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.620
Let's learn the simplest method.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.120
Look at my left foot

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.120
First we learn some simple rhythms.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.760
1，2，3，4

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.320
Look at the next exercise.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.940
The left foot taps the beat and the right hand plays the strings.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:29.040
1，2，3，4

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.680
the first exercise is easy.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.760
Let's look at the second exercise.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.800
This one is a little bit difficult.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.200
While the foot taps beat, we have down 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.800
and up

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.700
All together it's like this:

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.700
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.740
Let's try that.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.380
Look at the third exercise.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.480
This one is more difficult again.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.500
The easiest way to learn this rhythm is to use a word.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.220
Maple syrup, Pancakes

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.600
watch my left foot's timing,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.780
look carefully how I tap the beat.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.520
Maple syrup, Pancakes

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.480
Look at next exercise

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.120
i call it

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.520
Hot, cocoa

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.440
Look at my left foot

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.400
when learning this 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.540
you must know which note is on the beat and which is off the beat.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.720
Now for the last rhythm

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.580
Look at the score.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.600
A lot of music will use this rhythm.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.800
How should we learn.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.980
Most people listen and copy

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.920
But if you learn what I had just taught you

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.240
you can try this rhythm

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.480
you don't play on the 2nd and 4th beats

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.980
look at my demo.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.520
That's all for today.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.380
Remember, don't make your muscles hurt.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.400
Don't tense you shoulder

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.700
relax your body.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.740
If you forget how to do it, you may check my past video

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.460
If you want to learn well, and you have questions to ask, what should you do?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.400
one adrive for you

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.360
