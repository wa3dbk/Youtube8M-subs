Welcome Everybody!

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.299
My name is Przemysław Bągard

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.839
In this show I want to present you my game
engine.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.020
I do not use any existing engine here. Collision
detection and character controlling have been

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.539
done all by myself.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.539
I've designed also model and animation format,
though I've focused on integration animation

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.000
with engine rather than on animation and graphical
details.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:34.879
In the program I've put stress on arcade elements:
character can climb a ladder or catch hold

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.360
of the edge of a platform.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.020
We have here crack, which is big enough to
allow character to catch hold of the edge,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.740
but on the other hand, it is to small to allow
character for climbing up to the platform.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.740
Engine is designed to allow for adding new
elements such as vertical or horizontal rope

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.950
easily.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Character slides only on sheer platforms.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.300
(It is in description of Video)

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.400
Thank you for attention. Goodbye.
