00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.440
This next stretch is what I call the elephant
stretch. You just take your right leg and

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.949
you place it over your left leg, and what
this does is it creates stretches in your

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:20.160
hip--your hip flexor muscles I do believe.
And, although, those lower back muscles really

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.890
get stretched as well. Okay, so what we want
to do is we want to take our right leg over

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.369
our left. And we want to really stretch it
out. Stretch that hip muscle. Stretch the

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:39.160
hip muscle, stretch the lower back muscle.
You want to keep your arms extended. And this

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.199
is really great for basketball. Especially
in professional basketball, these stretches

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:57.399
are imperative to performing at a high level.
You want to stretch it out. As you can see,

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.780
sometimes you want to pull your leg up, and
just want to get that hip muscle stretched

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:13.050
really well, and in the process your butt
muscles will get stretched also. It's great

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:23.350
for running. You want to stretch it out really
good. And you should feel some tightness.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.780
Stretch it out, stretch it out. Now, see,
I really feel loose with this stretch, so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.960
that's letting me know that those muscles
are pretty loose. So then, when I feel that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:46.780
looseness, I want to switch legs. It's the
same procedure. Make sure--and you should

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.280
really feel some tightness on the opposite
side. We as pro athletes have one side that's

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.810
bigger than the other, and so therefore there
may be some tightness on the bigger side,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.640
and that's okay, you just want to stretch
it out. Once again, make sure your shoulders

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:18.530
are back, arms are extended. You want to really
stretch that hip muscle, the lower back, and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.340
butt muscle. Stretch it out. Those are the
areas that you really want to stretch. You

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.659
never want to play basketball at any level
without getting a good stretch. Remember,

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:40.970
injury prevention is imperative. Stretch it
out and then what I like to do, slowly bring

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:51.269
it out, one leg down, you bring your right
leg up to your chest, and you stretch it.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:03:00.230
You pull it up. You're getting a complete
stretch. Stretch it out. And then you switch

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.510
legs. Remember, come out of each stretch slowly
so you do not tweak any muscles in the process

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.489
of getting stretched out. You really feel
it--and you pull that knee back. I hold my

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:24.579
hand on my knee, hand on my shin or lower
leg. And you really stretch it out. Stretch

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.939
it, and then come out of it slowly, and up,
and that is what I call the elephant stretch.
