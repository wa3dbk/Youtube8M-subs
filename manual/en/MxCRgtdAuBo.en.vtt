00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.660
*Song playing

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.470
That's what you get when you hire a con man. 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.980
I can convince anyone of anything. 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.200
You see there's a science to getting people to trust you. 

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:36.955
I want in. 

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:38.735
With your current skill set, you don't. 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.760
Maybe... you could teach me. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.640
In your room... 

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:45.118
That is so bad. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.980
Is it? 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.260
Does it feel sexy on your face? 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.180
A little. 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.300
It does? Okay let's go. 

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:51.557
  We're about thirty strong. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.940
Everybody gets a percentage. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.400
Make it quick and get out. 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.220
Who's the girl?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.980
She's our intern. 

00:00:58.556 --> 00:00:59.756
You hittin' that? 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm right here. 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.020
No Farhad, I'm not hitting that. 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.900
You should hit that. 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.000
We never drop the con. 

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:09.407
Never break. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.520
Where are the black people!?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.680
I got this. 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.180
What?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.660
 Oh! Oh, sorry. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.880
Congratulations. You're a criminal. 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.513
You might be one of the best I've ever seen. 

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:27.076
So what about the big con?

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.700
I thought you were all big time. 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.894
You mean the one where we make so much money we all retire.  

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.260
This needs to be discrete. No holes. 

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.134
You seem trustworthy, but you don't know me. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.140
Is he your mark? 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.980
That's fantastic. 

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.466
He's not a guy you want to cross. 

00:01:55.478 --> 00:01:56.118
All of it. 

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:56.618
1.1 million.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.589
Nicky, that is my money too. 

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:01.536
For now, you make things interesting. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.780
There's no room for heart in this game. 

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:06.196
It'll get you killed. 

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:06.968
How does that feel?

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:07.460
Wooow

00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:15.193
There's two kinds of people in this world. 

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:18.135
There's hammers.... and nails. 

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:21.935
You decide which one you want to be.
