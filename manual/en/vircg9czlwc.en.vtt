00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.350
In this clip we're going to be talking about
the drawbars which is the main way that you

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:13.940
get sounds out of your organ. Each keyboard
has a set of draw boards that controls it.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.160
And you can see that they, you know, they
push in they push out and they go from zero

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.130
all the way up to eight. And the way that
these, the way that the sounds work on all

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:39.290
of these is they start low and they get higher
as they go. Now when you play them all, all

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.450
the way out it's going to sound really bad.
Well, to most people it's going to sound really

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.870
bad. So the key to getting a good sound out
of a Hammond is to use those drawbars, you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.790
know, to understand how they work together.
And these are basically just harmonics of

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.629
a pipe organ I believe. The same, they're
based on different length pipes within a pipe

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.159
organ. So this started off simulating a pipe
organ, it doesn't, it obviously doesn't sound

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.470
quite like it. But it does have it's own unique
things about it that make it sound pretty

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.510
awesome on in it's own way. Now on a B-3 or
a C-3 you'll see that there are five sets

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:25.170
of drawbars. One, two, three, four and five.
And four of these, you know all these together

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.400
except for this middle group are exactly identical.
They all do the exact same thing. And they're

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.110
basically just different sounds that you can
get for different keyboards. And we'll be

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.090
talking more about how you access those later.
This is basically the first two of each one

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.850
of these sets. And this set of drawbars is
for the pedals, which in rock and roll organ

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.799
you typically don't use. But they're there
all the same, and we'll just keep them like

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.090
that for now. So those are the drawbars. That's
how you get all the sounds. Every organ simulator

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.770
you've heard is basically simulating some
drawbar set and just play around with them.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.249
That's how you'll get comfortable with them
and you'll make them your friends.
