00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:21.200
The Elves and the Shoemaker

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.367
Retold by BookBox

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.533
Although Peter Schumaker

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.367
worked hard

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:33.783
and was kind to

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:35.033
everyone in the village,

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.033
he could never earn enough

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:41.617
money making shoes.

00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:42.700
On this particularly

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.200
cold and snowy day,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.367
all he had left in his workroom

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.033
was enough leather to make

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:50.783
one last pair of shoes.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:54.617
one last pair of shoes.

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:56.200
That evening,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.533
Peter carefully cut up

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.450
his precious leather

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.617
and laid it aside for the morning,

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:03.533
when he would sew them together.

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:08.533
when he would sew them together.

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.283
The sun rose the next morning

00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:15.033
and Peter was ready to start work,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:15.617
but to his great surprise

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.533
but to his great surprise

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.783
an exquisitely crafted pair of shoes

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:21.533
sat on his worktable.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:27.533
sat on his worktable.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.367
“What magic!”

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.117
said Cecilia, his wife.

00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:33.783
They quickly put the shoes

00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:35.533
in the shop window,

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.033
for the holiday shopping season

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.450
had just begun.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.283
As luck would have it,

00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:42.867
the shoes fitted the finicky

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:43.867
the shoes fitted the finicky

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:45.783
Mrs. Sniggins perfectly,

00:01:45.783 --> 00:01:47.200
and she paid a generous sum

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.283
for the fine fit.

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:54.283
With the money,

00:01:54.283 --> 00:01:56.450
Peter went to buy more leather,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.283
enough

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:00.783
for two more pairs.

00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:02.283
That evening,

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:03.617
he once again set to work

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:05.200
cutting his leather,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.950
and he left the pieces on the table

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.283
when he went to bed.

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:13.033
Hoping for a good design,

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.867
he fell asleep

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:31.367
dreaming of shoes.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:32.783
When he awoke

00:02:32.783 --> 00:02:34.783
early the next morning,

00:02:34.783 --> 00:02:35.283
he again found two finely crafted pairs of shoes

00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:37.450
he again found two finely crafted pairs of shoes

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.700
before his eyes.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.617
Customers

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:45.950
bought these up quickly,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.950
for they were masterpieces.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.867
for they were masterpieces.

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:51.533
Now

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.033
Peter could buy enough leather

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:56.117
for four pairs of shoes.

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:58.533
This magical business

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.200
went on for some time,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.033
and Schumaker’s name

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:03.367
became well-known

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:06.033
for the finest shoes in town.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:06.950
These days,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.450
life was much better

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.783
for Peter and Cecilia.

00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:15.867
One day

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:18.283
Cecilia said,

00:03:18.283 --> 00:03:19.950
“I wonder

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.950
who has been helping us

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.033
so much?”

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:26.450
Peter announced:

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.950
“Tonight,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.200
we will hide

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.867
in the workshop

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:33.617
and see what goes on there!”

00:03:33.617 --> 00:03:35.867
And so they did.

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:39.367
At exactly midnight,

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:41.367
two tiny elves

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:43.200
tiptoed in

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.950
and began to work,

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.533
swiftly making the fine shoes.

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:53.867
They were shabbily dressed

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.117
and weren’t even wearing

00:03:56.117 --> 00:04:00.033
shoes themselves.

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:02.033
Before daybreak,

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.450
they had already dashed off,

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.533
leaving several pairs of shoes

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:07.533
leaving several pairs of shoes

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:10.867
ready for sale that day.

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:12.533
Peter and Cecilia

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:14.367
were grateful

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:16.533
to these little elves,

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:18.783
and worried about them

00:04:18.783 --> 00:04:20.700
working so hard

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.700
in such cold weather.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.033
So

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.867
Peter set to work

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.283
making two tiny pairs of shoes,

00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:30.867
making two tiny pairs of shoes,

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:33.367
and Cecilia stitched two warm

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:36.617
sets of clothing for each of them.

00:04:36.617 --> 00:04:38.533
On Christmas Eve,

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:39.700
instead of

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.367
leather pieces,

00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:42.117
they set the little shoes

00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:43.783
they set the little shoes

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.033
and clothes out

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:47.367
and hid themselves again.

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:49.783
and hid themselves again.

00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:53.200
At midnight,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.617
the elves popped in

00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:57.367
and saw the new clothes.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:00.867
and saw the new clothes.

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:03.283
In a flash,

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:04.867
they had them

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:07.033
on their little bodies!

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:08.950
They were so happy

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.450
that they laughed

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.450
and chuckled,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.533
and danced right out the window,

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:17.117
and danced right out the window,

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:21.617
never to be seen again.

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:23.533
Peter continued

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:24.950
making shoes

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.117
everyday,

00:05:27.117 --> 00:05:28.867
and he and Cecilia

00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:30.533
lived a very happy

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:32.450
and contented life

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.450
for many years.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.200
As did the elves!
