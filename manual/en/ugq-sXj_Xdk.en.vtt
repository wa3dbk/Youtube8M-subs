00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:14.260
E.T.C.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.330
Electronic Throttle TPS Tests ...

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.630
The Electrothrottle diagnostic unit seen here
is an industry first.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.519
It allows you to diagnose and clean electronic
throttle control or E.T.C. units by actuating

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.329
or opening the throttle.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.270
That being said, you also need to diagnose
or prove the dual throttle position sensors

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.730
built into the modern electronic throttles.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:49.290
For the purpose of diagnosing the internal
TPS, we have created a new unit.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.930
It is called, the Blue Voltage Reference Voltage
Simulator.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.920
The Blue Voltage does exactly that, it simulates
the ECM provided sensor voltage.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:08.490
It is a rock solid voltage regulator unit.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.409
It is also short proof, so you can short the
Blue Voltage Simulator and no damage will

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.670
occur to it.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.260
The Electrothrottle and the Blue Voltage Simulator
are both used in conjunction with each other.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:29.719
Next, weâ€™ll show you how to use the Electrothrottle
and the Blue Voltage Simulator, together with

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:41.320
a common graphing multimeter or oscilloscope.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.350
First we connect the Electrothrottle to the
two motor control terminals.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:02:07.719
Polarity does not matter, as you will be able
to flip the switch and change it later.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:30.240
Next, we connect the Blue Voltage Simulator
ground and 5 volt reference terminals.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.400
These two also, for the purpose of testing,
can be connected regardless of polarity.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.470
WHat you are looking for is the signal output
from both of the TPS or throttle position

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.750
sensors.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.540
One signal will go from low or ground to 5
volts, and the other signal will do the opposite.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.290
So, connect the ground and 5 volt reference,
and do not worry about polarity.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.840
Lastly, you then connect your multimeter,
graphing multimeter, or scope, to one of the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.380
TPS signal outputs.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.900
A graphing meter or scope is the best option,
since it is hard to just look at the changing

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:19.540
digits on the meter.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:38.800
As you can see, as we turn or operate the
Electrothrottle knob, we see the E.T.C. electronic

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.050
throttle actuation in action.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:04:05.680
This is done with the engine and ignition
key off.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.240
We are now simulating all aspects of the ECM
engine control module.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.790
We are providing the sensor ground, 5 volt
reference, both using the Blue Voltage, and

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:40.100
we are also providing the electronic throttle
E.T.C. actuation commanded control signal.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.940
This is Bi Directional control at its best.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.540
Just remember that most E.T.C. throttle bodies
have at least two TPS sensors for redundancy.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:14.940
So, the two signal are going to be inverse
to each other.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.520
The Electrothrottle and the Blue Voltage Reference
Simulator is an unbeatable automotive diagnostic

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:29.070
pair, providing E.C.M. level regulated sensor
voltage and and actuation.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.360
Enjoy.
