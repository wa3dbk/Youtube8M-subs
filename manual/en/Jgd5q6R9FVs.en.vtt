My name is Jonathan Kis-Lev, and I am
delighted to introduce you to my painting

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.100
"Love for Two",

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.960
which will be auctioned at the
Montefiore Auction House

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.200
this coming spring, 2012.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.480
This painting is really one of my favorites.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.029
It was painted at a very crucial moment
in my career in 2008,

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.130
when I was changing my whole style of painting.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.420
Let me tell you a few things about this painting:

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.340
First of all, it was painted on black.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.290
Just about a year earlier I began
to paint on black,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.230
and you can really see underneath
everything the very

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.200
prominent layer of black.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.690
The thickness of the colors, the
amazing impact that they create,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.770
is simply due to the black underneath.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.900
So this was one of the earliest
paintings with a black background.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.000
When I painted this painting
I painted it upside down,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.590
so the sky, which you can see now,
was actually on the bottom,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.789
and the pomegranates were painted up here,

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:25.789
and the reason I started to do it back then
was in order to create this feeling of

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.200
"warpness", like things were a bit
like Edvard Munch,

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.689
a bit twisted.

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:42.050
The fact that I painted it upside down
is especially shown here in this chair,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.719
in which you can see that
the angle is just wrong -

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.590
the angle of this van-Gogh-style
chair is just wrong,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.459
which is part of the magic and
the beauty of this painting,

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.069
in a very naïve style.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.490
The painting is named "Love for Two",
resonating, or echoing,

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.490
what's in the painting, which are two chairs,
and two halves of a pomegranate;

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:09.800
together they are one pomegranate.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.930
So it's love for two, and in many ways
I invite the viewers to come

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.200
and join this beautiful scenery and
sit on these chairs.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.569
This beautiful landscape is painted
in Jaffa. My studio at the time was

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.760
very close to the Clock Tower,
which you can see over here,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.959
and I remember that oftentimes I would just
walk and look for inspiration around the clock

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.819
or around the Saint Peter's Church over here,
just at the very top of Old Jaffa,

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:55.500
and in many ways it kinda shows you
the old part of Jaffa and Tel Aviv.

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.879
Tel Aviv is in the horizon
and you can see all the towers,

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.140
especially my favorite one,
the first tower,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.049
the Shalom Tower, over here,
once again very crooked.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.110
And you can see the details of
the old clock and the old,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.319
over-one-hundred-years-old church,
the Saint Peter's Church,

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.170
so you can really see the difference,
or the tension,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.010
between the old history, the history
that we are trying to preserve,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.620
and the beautiful new Tel Aviv,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.400
the city that grew out of the sands and has
become the largest metropolis in Israel.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.620
The sky, as you can see, has
different colors:

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.939
there is cobalt blue over here, and cerulean
blue, and a bit of Prussian blue.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.590
All these hues create sky that is
very very intense in its colors.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.939
Another thing that's changed since then is
that I've kinda tamed myself a little bit.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.719
Back then I felt very free
with my signature, and big,

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.829
and I also signed both
in Hebrew and in English,

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.200
and the signature was with capital letters
without my famous line over here.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.599
Most of the paintings from this period, like

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.859
"Pomegranates in the Galilee"
or my famous "Romance in Jaffa",

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.229
have been sold, and this was one of the
only paintings that I've kept,

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.520
because in many ways
it was a turning point.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.150
It was then that I discovered
my very authentic gold line,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.150
that you can see if you go underneath everything,
if you go into the margins, into the outlines,

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.169
you can see this very thin gold line.

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.370
When one buys the original
oil-on-canvas painting -

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.970
not the mixed-media paintings
or the giclée paintings -

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.210
one really gets the benefit of the gold.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.340
As you move around the painting the
gold responds to you,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.120
and you feel not only the textures - the
thick thick textures of the oil painting -

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.600
but also the beautiful gold.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.680
It is now in my studio in Jerusalem,
and I'm really excited to see

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.810
who is going to be the buyer of
this painting at this coming auction.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.150
It's going to be my first auction at a
large auction house in Israel -

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.900
the Montefiore Auction House -
and it's a big honor for me,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.300
and I am very excited to see
where it goes to.
