00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.640
Ok we're getting ready to start the second
zig and before we remove our rubber band we're

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.309
going to want to part our next piece of hair.
Just to see where this one ends, we want to

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.830
kind of use it as our guide and I'm actually
going to start the part down here just so

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.970
I can see how wide I want to make it. I'm
going to use about that much hair and so now

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.289
we can work upwards towards. It's going to
be at an angle because at the beginning of

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.420
the hair line, that was at an angle. So we're
just going to keep going up until we reach

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:48.250
our original part and we're going to see where
that is, let's see. Keep my line straight,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.820
hold that back and check it. That's a good
piece of hair right there and it stays the

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:03.430
same the whole way up so we are good to go.
We're going to put our comb here to hold this

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:19.830
back and we will remove our rubber band and
begin our second turn. Just put that to the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.880
side. Sometimes when you remove the rubber
band your braid starts to loosen so just kind

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.610
of open it back up and just backtrack just
a little bit to keep it the way we had. Here's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:52.360
my three pieces, then go ahead and garb and
go under. Remember to keep on the inside of

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.640
the turn grab from this side, on the outside
of the turn grab from what is directly beneath

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.210
it to keep it turning consistently in a nice
direction and you don't have larger pieces

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.120
of hair coming from a different direction.
So grab from that hair on the side and cross

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.000
underneath. Grab from what's underneath over
here and we're going to get all this hair

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.060
in there to keep it nice and separated. I
love to wear braids it helps the scalp breathe,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.150
you don't have to mess with it, it's very
wonderful, it's my favorite thing. Just keep

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.050
crossing underneath, keep grabbing the hair
from under here and we're about to be finished

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:47.120
with the turn. Just keep this hair separated,
grab over here from this side to keep our

00:02:47.120 --> 00:03:00.739
inside turn going and we've got just a little
bit of hair right here and there's a little

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.749
bit of hair right here, I'm going to grab
that and our turn is almost done. We want

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:14.359
to see where our part is, make sure we keep
that established and separated so we know

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:21.249
exactly where we're going. So just keep grabbing
from along the top part that we made for our

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:28.689
complete section of hair and now we can start
grabbing from what's down here because your

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:35.090
braid is turned and now it's all underneath
so it's all good. Just keep pulling on that

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.840
hair to keep it smooth and then just keep
grabbing. That's how we do our second turn.
