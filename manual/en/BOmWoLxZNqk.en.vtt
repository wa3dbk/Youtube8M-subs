00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.699
String Theory "Currents"
String Theory

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.689
Cuts by DJ Tha Boss

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.380
Verse 1
Atrocious tactics to host the masses, behold

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.859
the madness
We roast the halfwits as cold as cats that

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.820
holster ratchets
With open caskets for these hopeless bastards

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.449
posed as rappers
Explosive tracks could make my pulse as fast

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.260
as ocean rapids
Traverse the unknown expose the atlas

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.320
My verses uphold subversive drum rolls to
mold the path with

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.409
Too bold to catch it, so you worthless clones
get shown what wrath is

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.920
And all below the average actors will get
blown to ashes

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.530
So watch me settle scores as I relinquish
the snobs

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.150
With english my linguistics could extinguish
a stellar core

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.760
A top physician could not incision these metaphors
That's why my efforts for impressive bars

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.930
is effin' raw
The lion that not even Noah could lift up

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.189
Got an aura like Jehovah from scripture paranoia
gon' grip ya

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:01.220
Rats hide before this flower come get cha
Raps tighter than a boa constrictor

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.439
(Nigga you know what the deal is)

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:04.549
Chorus
Yea, yo I'm that awesome force

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.390
That's sure to knock you spitters off your
course

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.390
Strong winds bring the tide in, to soak you
with the blend

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.960
we've been providing and flood the mental
state you kids reside in

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.960
Verse 2
I'm the poster child for the folks that wild

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.080
We invoke the crowd so get a close up now
before I ghost the style

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.280
The string theory smear sentences sincerely
'Til kids hear me and give me millions of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.620
spins yearly
You been weary I bring merely that bomb shit

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.390
You sing nearly in every song clearly theres
conflict

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.940
Really its garbage all that sob teary eyed
soft shit

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.640
Is nonsense I'm lost why do ya'll see me as
conscious

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.560
When I'm just a regular man on a secular plan
For grands trying to stay ahead of the lambs

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.979
Yo I'll be writing these incredible jams until
my skeletal sands

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.080
And niggas read my shit with retinal scans
This one goes out to unforgettable fans who

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.840
study my lyrics
With grit until they and sever all their cerebral

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.450
strands
I spin the globe to any sensible land and

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.119
rip a show
I'm fina blow just like a chemical plant you

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.440
niggas know

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.539
Chorus
Yea, yo I'm that awesome force

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.390
That's sure to knock you spitters off your
course

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.390
Strong winds bring the tide in, to soak you
with the blend

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.640
we've been providing and flood the mental
state you kids reside in
