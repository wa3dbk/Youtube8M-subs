00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.319
It takes precision and care to hang a drape properly. 
But with the right tools and technique, 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:17.319
it can be simple and straightforward to make 
your drapes look professionally hung.

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:20.319
Start by having all the right tools on hand: 

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:26.319
measuring tape, pencil, window hardware including a drape rod, 
finials, and mounting hardware, 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:31.319
drapery rings if you're using them, a handheld drill, 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:38.319
Philips head drill bit, or Philips screwdriver, a stud finder, 
and a carpenter's level.

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:42.890
To determine the size of drape rod needed, 
measure the width of your window,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.890
taking into account whether you'd like a wall mount, hanging 
on the wall above the window trim,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.890
or a turn mount, hanging on the window trim. 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.890
Allow one to three inches on each side of the window, 
for when the drapes are completely open.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.890
Rods are usually mounted four inches above the window.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.890
To add height to a room, mount the rod closer to the ceiling.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.890
Be sure to consider the extra wall space needed for decorative finials,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.890
as the rod dimensions to not include the length of the finial.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.890
For low light filtration, mount the curtain rod six inches above the trim,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.890
allow the rod width to extend three inches beyond the window's actual width.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
Once you have determined where you would like to mount the window hardware,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.890
use a carpenter's level, or measure up from the floor 
to ensure brackets will be level.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.890
Hold mounting brackets to the wall. Using a carpenter's level, 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
next to the bracket to ensure that it is straight,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.890
mark the location of the screw holes with a pencil.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
Prepare pre-drilled holes where you have placed your marks. 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.890
For drywall, insert plastic wall anchors with a Philips screwdriver 
and the pre-drilled holes.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.890
Align the bracket holes with installed anchors.  

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.890
Insert screws and tighten with a Philips head screwdriver,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.890
until the bracket is firmly attached to the wall. 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.890
For stud mounting, align the bracket holes with the pre-drilled holes.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.890
Insert screws and tighten with a Philips head screwdriver or drill,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.890
until the bracket is firmly attached to the wall.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.890
If using double or clip rings, slide these onto the rod without the drapes.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.890
Tighten bracket set screws with the included Allen wrench,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.890
to hold the drape rod in place.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.890
Attach finials to the end of each rod.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.890
Your drapes are now mounted securely and evenly to your wall.
