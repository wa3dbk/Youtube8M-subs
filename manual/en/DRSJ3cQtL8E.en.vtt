Hello guys and tanks!

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.840
Today we have received the first question from our community.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.040
Which is: why do tanks have no stereos?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.720
Can you actually install a stereo in a tank?.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.520
Our "tanktific" crew is going to research it.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.160
You can start, guys!

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.680
So, now we can test our stereo and see that it's not really needed in a tank.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.200
Usually people don’t install a stereo in a tank, because, well… it’s really-really hard to hear what's being talked about...

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.480
?????? ???? ????? pretty obvious,??????????,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.440
So, now it seems pretty obvious, isn’t it?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.520
Well, we have resolved another question.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.160
If you think something is really hard to do in a tank, send in your requests and we will see how it works.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.720
So, it’s better to listen to the real engine of a tank:

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.000
You don’t need the music for that.
