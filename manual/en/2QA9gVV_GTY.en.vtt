"My name is Amber Giles.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:28.730
We are at the National Institutes of Health
and in the Pediatric Oncology Branch.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.550
I am a researcher.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.680
I study cancer research and try to understand
how we can use the good cells in your body

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.550
to try to get rid of the cancer that you have.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.990
I grew up in the backwoods of Arkansas.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.160
My mother worked at a factory and my father
was a plumber.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.219
They raised me to be very independent.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.040
I had a lot of animals to play with.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.420
And I had always been interested in animals.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.429
My initial thoughts on college were to become
a veterinarian because I loved working with

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.899
these animals.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.340
It wasn't until I was in college that I started
learning there were other things that I could

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.860
do in science.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.500
Part of what fascinated me was learning how
much is unknown.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.420
I wanted to try to learn how to answer some
of the questions that were out there in the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.420
world.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.240
I plan my own experience so I have to think
about what questions I want to answer and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.829
then come up with an idea of how to ask that
question.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.790
Once I've done all this research I run it
past my peers and then I design the experiment.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.060
I do several different types of techniques
involving a culturing of cells.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
I specialize in fluorescent methods.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.720
So way to label it, make it bright and then
track that cell throughout the body.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.549
So we see them coming from out here.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.580
It's a little bit cleaner and they're moving
all the way through the tissue over to here.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.649
One of the nicest thing about science is that
it's a very collaborative field.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.079
We go out to have dinner, to have drinks.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.000
It's a very fun and engaging atmosphere.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.160
If I have a question on how do I ask this
question, I go down to someone and talk with

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160
them.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.520
And they often give me wonderful ideas.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520
EZ, hey.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.620
I was wondering if you could tell me what
do you like about the lab?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.010
speaker 2: Oh, it's very homely.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.860
Like I always come in here and I feel like
I've known everyone forever and...

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.110
speaker 1: And what's, what are you doing
here?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.980
I don't know that there's going to be a global
cure for cancer but I do think that we're

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.660
getting very close to certain types of cancer.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.670
Using your own body to protect you against
cancer, I hope that that, I think that's something

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.670
that's going to take root.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.780
It has wonderful promise and will hopefully
help to change how we view and how we treat

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.780
cancer.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.990
The questions that I ask have real answers.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.370
It takes awhile to get a solid answer to question.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.940
Just talk with someone in a lab.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.950
Most labs are very friendly and willing to
take on volunteers.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.960
And then you can learn some of the techniques
and learn what is done in a lab.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.030
And learn if you like that."
