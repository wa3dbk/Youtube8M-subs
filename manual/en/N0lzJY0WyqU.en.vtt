Hi my name is Lori with Figs Catering in Austin,
Texas on behalf of Expert Village today we

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.810
are going to show you how to make a entire
Thanksgiving meal. Now that we are going to

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.660
make our roasted garlic mashed potatoes I
need to prepare my potatoes. As you can see

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.070
some of the potatoes are different sizes and
that is going to mean different cooking times.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.750
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut
my larger potatoes to mimic the size to the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.630
smaller ones. Also the smaller that you cut
them the quicker that they cook so another

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.029
little tip. For our roasted garlic mashed
potatoes we are going to leave the skin on

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.870
cause we like the flavor and the texture of
the skin. However if you don't like the flavor

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.510
and the texture of the skin no problem just
go ahead and remove the skin before you do

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.870
this step. So I'm just going to go ahead and
cut it in half and set it aside. Because this

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:57.989
one is a little bit larger I'm going to use
it into 4 even pieces.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.539
Another thing to note while you are preparing
your potatoes to boil go ahead and make sure

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.659
that you got your water on and that it is
coming to a boil that would help save you

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:32.829
a little bit of time. And my favorite potatoes
to use for these roasted garlic mashed potatoes

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:39.279
is the Yukon gold potatoes they naturally
have a nice buttery flavor and a great texture

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:47.709
for mashed potatoes. You can however use Russet
potatoes. Now that we have our potatoes nice

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.130
and ready to boil I'm going to add them to
my boiling water and my water has been boiling

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.529
and it is to a boiling boil and I'm also going
to add plenty of salt. You want your water

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:00.989
to taste like salted water. I'm going to let
my potatoes boil until they are tender.
