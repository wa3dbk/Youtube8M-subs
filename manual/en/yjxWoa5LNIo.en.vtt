00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.440
A new champion approaches, Xerath coming to
PBE in patch 1.13 and incase you missed it

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.440
we've got a recap of the season 3 semifinals.
All that and a riot point giveaway right here

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.010
right now on the league update.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.730
Jinx the Loose Cannon debuted last week and
has already blasted her way onto the PBE.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.660
Jinx is a ranged ADC with a surprising amount
of versatility. Her passive gives her a massive

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.840
move speed bonus whenever she is involved
in killing an enemy champion or a tower. Her

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.051
q allows her to switch between fishbones her
rocket launcher and pow pow her minigun. The

00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:45.880
rocket launcher grants her increased ranged
damage and area of effect. while the minigun

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.600
gives her a stacking attack speed bonus. She
also has a skill shot slow and some mines

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.250
that root enemies, and then there's her ult.
Think of it as an ashe ult that without a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.250
stun that does more damage the farther it
travels. Hello kill secured. Tell me in the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.960
comments if you are excited to play Jinx and
why and you could win 20 dollars worth of

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.469
riot points.
