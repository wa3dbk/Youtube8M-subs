00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.210
G'day everyone.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.130
My name is Daniel O'Grady and welcome to another
Wasabicars video.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.290
Thank you all very much for joining me.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.050
Fingers crossed this is going to go smoothly
because I've been having some troubles with

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.760
this video.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.980
Today, it's a Honda Life.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.400
You know, what?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.980
I don't think I've ever posted a Honda Life.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.430
There was that Life pick-up, wasn't there?

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.960
Have I done a van?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.140
Maybe not.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.079
Anyway, this is the first Life 2-door that
I've ever done.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.079
So, there you go.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.520
And, the spec is GR.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.340
So, performance.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.340
What does that mean?

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.570
It means it's got.. hey!

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.879
I've got an idea.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.780
How about a bit of burlesque, guys?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.829
Now, what is that?

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:59.890
That'd be a bit of tease &amp; and a bit of reveal,
so check this out.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:22.180
Okay, so it wasn't too sexy.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.259
Still, I found it quite interesting.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.270
What he's done, he's got a sponge and he's
put it in pantyhose, and that's the air-cleaner

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.270
filament.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.270
So, pretty interesting.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.460
And, he's also raided the kitchen for something
else.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.900
Aluminium foil.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.860
He's used that for the chrome under the windows;
the side windows.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.700
Very creative and imaginative.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.759
I'm liking it.

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.000
Yeah, the condition is quite rough but hey,
Wasabicars.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.049
If I saw this on the side of the street, I
would've posted it straight away.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.289
Actually, I am posting this straight away
because I saw this car yesterday.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.109
I met the owner.

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.579
Super nice guy.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.409
Actually, a year ago, pretty much a year ago
to the day, I saw his other car.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.080
It's a Honda N360, Gun-metal gray, Touring,
and I did a video of it some time later.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.560
When I saw him yesterday... (sorry, I'm jumping
all over the place) But, when I saw him yesterday,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.950
he thanked me and said I did a good job on
that video.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.270
It was great to hear that.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.020
Yeah, super-friendly guy.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.220
A character.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.810
Really, great stuff.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.110
Let's check out the car a bit more one the
outside.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.230
What is it, orange?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.360
Yeah, vibrant, bright orange.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.720
Let's go back to the engine bay.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.610
I'm just loving it.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.080
Loving the style, basically.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.660
Geez, I wish cars were a bit more interesting
nowadays under the hood.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.970
But, it's all gray and metal and alloys and
blacks and wires.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.110
Look at that, guys.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.580
It's just fantastic.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.580
And, exterior.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.010
Yes, it is rough, and as I said, aluminium-foil
trim.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.220
It makes me laugh.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.420
GR badge on the quarters.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.220
Now, at the back.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.110
Let's check it out.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.500
Split bumper.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.700
Split-bumper, we've seen that before.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.690
Camaro, 1970 and a half.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.900
Split-bumper front on this car as well.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.500
Split bumper rear!

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.130
The Honda Z also had a spit-bumper rear but
there was a little door that popped out the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.690
spare tire.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.380
Not the case here, I believe.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.940
There's a little, mini-bumper with the reverse
lights.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.110
Interesting little set-up there.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.130
GR badge on the rear as well.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.430
We'll get to the interior next...

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.690
It's a little bit busy.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.560
It's well and truly lived-in which I'm just
loving.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.390
The cigarette lighter, it's being...

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.570
You know, they plug in accessories and stuff?

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.480
There's all sorts of stuff going on there.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.510
I can't even determine what that is actually.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.410
Yeah, whatever.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.120
Yeah, very lived-in.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120
I'm loving it.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.120
Awesome stuff.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.850
This is the first time I've done an interior
shot of a car and looked up.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.850
Oh, my god.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:08.850
There's something there.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.830
It's like a little center console.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.250
It looks to be inspired by the airlines or
those touring buses.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.810
A directional light, and a couple of switches
are there.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.810
That's pretty cool.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.310
I see a Honda emblem as well.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.310
Good stuff.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.310
Loving it.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.090
Now, back to the outside just to round things
off.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.270
Wheels, Watanabe, or another brand of those
similar type of wheels.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.710
The rubber is new-ish I'm suspecting.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.669
But, that is a cool car.

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:41.900
The owner is cool.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.560
I'm just loving it, guys.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.729
The turn out to this car show was abysmal.

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.759
And, I do not use the word abysmal lightly.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:57.810
There would've been 15 cars, there was space
for another 50 I'm guessing.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.699
Of interesting, classic cars, there was more
in the car-parks surrounding the car-show.

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.900
It was a real surprise.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.740
Anyway, there's a car show tomorrow...

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.300
I'm sure that's going to be a far better turn
out than the one that was on yesterday.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.710
Car-shows ahoy, right?

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.039
Excellent stuff.

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.820
Question of the day.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.719
Inventive.

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:23.860
Let's be all inventive.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.300
The owner used a sponge as an air-cleaning
filament.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.569
He used aluminium-foil for trim.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.650
Do you know/Have you heard any stories of
bush-mechanics?

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:42.490
Like, a quick, bizarre way to fix a car roughly
to get it back to a mechanic, or a quick fix,

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.490
or an odd fix.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.490
Have you heard of anything?

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.590
I'd love to hear it.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.050
Let me know in the comments below.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.590
Thank you very much for joining me once again.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.590
Take it easy.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.689
See you.
