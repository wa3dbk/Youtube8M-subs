00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:14.370
(Subbed by VocaloidLiveConcert,
any mistakes please inform us)

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:43.870
Rolling Girl always looked at unreachable
dreams

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:53.960
Making a fuss if you got inside her head
and disturbed, disturbed.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:13.400
“No problem.” Was murmured, but weren't
those words lost?

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.600
Fail again, fail again.
After ending your search for mistakes, it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.440
spins again!

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.230
Once more, once more.
“I'll also roll today,”

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.090
That girl says, that girl says,
Playing her words with meaning

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.690
“Are you better now?”
“It's still a ways off, I still don't see the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.050
point. I'm gonna stop my breathing, now.”

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:02.190
Rolling Girl is at the end of the ruins,
beyond unreachable colors

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.390
Overlapping voices with voices and
blending, blending.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:22.210
“No problem.” Was murmured, but those
words were lost.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:31.050
How are you going to turn out good?
Even the hill tempting me is making

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.800
mistakes now.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.080
Once more, once more.
Somehow I'm rolling.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.810
That girl said, That girl said
Repeating silent words with meaning

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.250
“Are you better now?”
“Just a bit more, and you'll see something

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.040
soon. I'm gonna stop my breathing, now.”

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.910
Once more, once more.
“I'll also roll today,”

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.560
That girl says, that girl says,
Playing her words with a smile

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.560
“Are you better now? It's okay now. Let's
go, you must be tired as well, right?”

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.800
I wanna stop my breathing, now.
