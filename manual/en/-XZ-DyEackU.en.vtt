Hello everyone, it's Leslie from The Glass
Shoppe and Builders Glass of Bonita.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.519
Today I am going to talk to you about how
to protect your glass.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:21.120
In recent years, I've noticed that all the
standard glass table tops come from China

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:29.619
and the prices are good, but the glass scratches
very easily compared to domestic glass.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.940
The problem is that domestic glass is more
expensive, and it can't compete with the prices

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.550
of Chinese glass.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.820
What I am going to do first is get the glass
all clean and then I am going to put a gel

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.829
coating that is going to make it scratch resistant
and in addition to being scratch resistant

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.219
this is something that you can use on a shower
door to prevent the hard water stains.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:06.020
So I am going to put my gel coat on a fiber
cloth, a microfiber cloth.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.290
I am going to rub it into the glass.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.930
You might be able to see the thick coating.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:31.619
What's great about this is it is thick and
you literally keep rubbing it in and it will

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.770
adhere to the glass.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.540
It will then create a protective layer.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:49.180
Once it's dry, you won't even know it's there.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.690
I used spray away glass cleaner to clean the
glass first, it is also recommended that you

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.030
use alcohol and water.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.710
I find the spray away works fine.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.920
It's my favorite glass cleaner.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.280
I have already treated one side of this glass,
but I decided to treat the other side also.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:24.590
If you are putting glass onto a surface and
don't use the correct glass buttons, the base

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.050
can scratch the underside of the glass.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.800
I can see that the gel is not rubbed in in
certain spots, so I keep rubbing and buffing

00:02:35.800 --> 00:03:33.420
it until all areas are clear.
