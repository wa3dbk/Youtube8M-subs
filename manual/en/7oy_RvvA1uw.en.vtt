00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.540
Hey, it's Bauer, and now I'm here 
at the Shure booth, at CES 2009.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.330
I'm standing with Chris Lyons, 
from Shure, and I gotta tell ya, 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.140
you know, I'm a Shure guy,
I own the ATR monitors, 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.530
I've used your recording mics before.
You know, it's a great company,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.720
and you guys have a couple of really 
cool new items you're showing off here

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.470
along with all of your 
other really great products.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.670
But what are these two things 
that you guys have going on here.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.500
We do. Well, we're really excited because first of
all we got a new pair of HD level earphones.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.470
ESU 115s which are 
just coming out in March.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.900
And I've gotta tell people, if they're not 
familiar with these in-ear headphones, 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.500
if they haven't used them yet, 
they really have to try some out. 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.830
Especially if you're a frequent traveler or 
somebody that wants to be able to listen to music

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.470
in loud si-... in 
otherwise noisy situations, 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.170
I will not get on a plane 
without these things.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.200
Because this is the only thing in the world that
 neutralizes screaming babies on an airplane.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.270
You know, you have the over the ear
noise canceling headphones,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.770
they're not going to cancel 
out a screaming baby,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.670
but these things, because they 
act as basically ear plugs

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.070
that channels sound into them, will take 
care of any noise problems.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.600
You know if better than I do. 
We should hire you.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.270
They go in your ear, like an ear plug.
They block out all the background noise,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370
so all you hear is your music,
your movie, whatever.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.230
You can hear it clearly without 
turning it up too loud,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.300
plus, they fit a lot better 
than standard ear plugs.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.970
They dont' fall out
if you're exercising.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.930
And, they're comfortable.
You can wear them for 8 hours at a time,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.570
if you wanted to, on a long plane 
ride, it doesn't start to hurt.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.720
They really are comfortable, and 
you make a great point

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.860
because you don't have to turn them up 
to be able to hear everything very clearly.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.100
You can keep them very low volume and still 
be able to hear everything fantastically.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.300
Now, one of the things that I think has 
probably kept people away from these 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.070
is you know, they're shopping, like, 
in the store and they look and go, 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.200
Oh my God, these 
headphones are so expensive

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.960
compared to these
 $15 ones I can buy.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.170
But these, you say, are 
a little less expensive.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.160
The new inch level models and they 
sound pretty extraordinary, right?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.970
Yeah, they sound fantastic.
They come with a whole bunch of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.700
different sleeves and different sizes 
so you can match the size of your ear,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.800
get a comfortable fit.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.230
These enter 
the market at $99.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.840
They come with an extension cable 
so that if you're using a lanyard player

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.560
you just use the short cable 
to plug directly into it 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.390
when you're working out at the gym.
And then it comes with an extension

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
that adds another 3 feet if you
 keep your player in your backpack,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.400
or on your belt, or 
something like that.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.500
We even make an 
interchangeable cable...

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.970
Now, how much 
are these coming at?

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.240
They come in all 
sorts of colors too.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.200
Like, that's kind of a new 
thing for you guys, isn't it?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.730
Because usually, you just kind of
 get them in the black or the gray.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.180
Well, we've done black and white before,
and a little silver and gray.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.260
But now we've got 4 colors.
Red, pink, blue and the traditional black.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.370
So you can, you know, choose your poison, 
you know, whatever floats your boat.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.740
But, the other thing that's really 
great is the sound quality of these 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.700
is amazingly realistic
and forceful and powerful.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.460
They've got great base. 
They've got clear mid range,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.170
nice distinct highs. Totally different 
than standard ear bud sound.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.170
So, if you're replacing ear buds, 
or you just want to take the sound 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.270
to the next level, you won't 
believe what you've been missing.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.760
It really is true.
I can't say it enough.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.370
Like, I sound... No offense, 
but these things really are, 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.940
like I, once I got a pair 
there was no going back.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.000
You know what I mean?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.360
Like, they're absolutely incredible, and 
it's cool to see you guys are coming out

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.920
with some that are even more 
affordable and sound even better than before.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.930
Which means, I guess I'm going
 to have to buy a new pair soon.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.930
Now...

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.610
I just heard something in a song 
that I've never heard before. 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.380
But I've heard that 
song 100,000 times.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.140
It's absolutely true and you guys also
have something for the aspiring 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.470
podccasters out here as well.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.200
Popular mics for the stage...

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.230
Like the KSM32, the SM58.
-Exactly.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.920
And now we've got 
some new microphones...

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.000
Voiceovers, or video projects, 
or just recording CDs or music... 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.510
Now we've got microphones 
that can plug directly into your computer

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.270
 with a USB connection.
-Oh look at that.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.560
Yup, so now it goes straight into your 
USB. Bypass the sound card.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.300
Because usually the sound card doesn't have 
very good sound quality.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.460
And on top of that, though, 
we've also solved a particular problem 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.730
with USB microphones, 
which is latency.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.160
With a USB mic there's often a delay when you hear
the sound coming back through your headphones.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.200
Yeah, very short delay but it can throw, 
it can very easily throw people off.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.350
If you're trying to sing along with a recorded 
track you've already recorded.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.200
It throws you completely off beat.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.900
So, we've got...

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.150
Monitor directly through 
the microphone.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.130
Multi purpose use. One with a USB, 
one without, and then another model

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.470
for voice use, specifically. One with USB,
 one with the traditional mic connection.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.870
We've even got an adaptor. If you've already 
got some microphones, like an SM58.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.870
An adaptor that converts a standard 
microphone, any type, into a USB 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.430
with the same high quality.
Well, that's incredibly cool.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.770
So you can convert any of 
your mics to a USB microphone,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.620
bypass your sound card.
-If you're in a band, you've already got 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.100
a whole case full of microphones 
you can use one of those with the adaptor

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.970
and take it right into 
the computer now.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.370
Now, how do these things sound,
these new USB mics, say, for somebody

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.870
that wants to do something 
other than vocals.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.900
Like, they want to 
record an acoustic guitar.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.070
Do they sound pretty good?
-Yeah.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.870
They can work on string instruments, 
cymbals, drums, percussion, 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.770
guitar, or anything.
Brass, woodwinds, flute, violin.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.330
So, it really brings out the 
details and the subtlety

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.860
of a lot of those 
instruments.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.730
Well, fantastic Chris. I appreciate you 
taking a couple seconds to talk to us about 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.070
some of your new stuff.
And, I'm looking forward to giving you guys 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.040
another couple hundred bucks of my money
 so I can get some of these headphones.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.360
No problem. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.270
Oh, I have to wait 
till March to get these?

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.260
I have a pair now, 
fooled again.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.660
No one gives me anything.
Alright, Chris, thank you very much.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.760
I appreciate it.
 -No problem.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.530
Have a good one.
