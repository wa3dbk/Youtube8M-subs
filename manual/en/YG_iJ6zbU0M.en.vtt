00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.350
Hi, I'm Sandra from
the DisneyCarToys channel,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.250
and as you can see I'm at the New York
City Toy Fair in the Mattel building.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.620
We have tons of new Barbies this year,
so let's look around and take a peak.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.340
In 2015, Mattel will be releasing
several new Barbie career dolls.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.430
It's pretty much part of
the Barbie I can be series.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.370
Here's a Barbie rocker.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.960
She comes with her own guitar,
and a really cool outfit.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.200
There's also this Barbie scientist,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.780
with a lab coat, protective goggles,
and a microscope.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.840
They also have some athletic Barbies,
like this tennis player Barbie.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.562
Also, a lifeguard, and a nurse.

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:46.050
One new play set I really like
is this Barbie optometrist set.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.560
Comes with a chair, and also this cute
little toddler Barbie doll in glasses.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.030
Now, these dolls I'm super excited about.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.540
It's kind of like me.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.930
This is the video producer Barbie.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.440
And, you can change her shoes
from flats to these heeled boots.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.180
And, this year, Barbie's got a new gig.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.760
She is babysitting twins this time.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.920
She's got a cute little outfit, this
place that comes with a little baby bath,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.480
and also two twins which
are color changing dolls.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.700
Now, this one's pretty fun.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.900
Barbie can hop on her
horse all by herself.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.340
I really like this new Barbie bicycle set,
because not only does it come with Barbie

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.760
and her bike, but also two little puppies
that ride on skateboards next to Barbie.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.370
The Barbie Dream House which
will be released fall 2015,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.830
has the first-ever garage
of a Barbie Dream House.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.830
We gotta make sure you've got
your Barbie convertible, right?

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.780
This house is three stories tall.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.350
On the side,
this little window area opens up for

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.900
a pool which is just such a cool design.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.720
There's tons of fun
features in the bathroom,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.680
that nice little Barbie lady
demonstrating everything for me.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.280
Right here is the elevator,
which brings Barbie up from the first,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.700
to the second, and even the third floor.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.790
Woo, there you go Barbie.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.140
There's tons of moveable pieces, and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.070
all of the pieces of furniture that you
see here come with the Barbie Dream House.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.110
The doll house has a lot of
unique pieces like this sink.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.000
If you press the button right here, it
lights up and it even makes bubbly sounds.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.130
The fish tank is my favorite.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.100
When you press the button, it spins,
and the fish swim round and round.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.870
And, there's even a working fan.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.160
And, on the third level,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.310
Barbie has this amazing bedroom
with a beautiful canopy bed.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.925
And, of course, Mattel is going to release
several new looks of Barbie here in 2015.

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:59.520
I love all the different styles, and of
course Barbie's got lots of new fashion.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.300
Check out all the new dolls,
and all their pretty clothes.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:14.300
[MUSIC]

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.382
But, probably the biggest release this
year will be this doll, Hello Barbie.

00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:30.430
This Barbie really talks to you,
and listens to everything you say.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.705
Here's a demonstration.

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:37.580
[SOUND].

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.850
&gt;&gt; Welcome to New York, Barbie.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.630
&gt;&gt; I love New York, don't you?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.840
Tell me,
what's your favorite part about the city?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.630
The food, the fashion, or the sites?

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.270
&gt;&gt; I like the fashion the best.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.722
&gt;&gt; Whether it is fashion week or
walking around Brooklyn,

00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:57.496
I'm always inspired by that
New York sense of style.

00:03:57.496 --> 00:03:59.646
What's your favorite accessory?

00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:01.659
&gt;&gt; Hm.
It is really cold outside,

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:02.905
boots definitely.

00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:04.365
I need boots.

00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:06.930
&gt;&gt; Boots are one of my
favorite types of shoes.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.150
&gt;&gt; Mm, yes, absolutely.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.390
We should go get some, both of us.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.185
But, we are on stage today to show all of
these lovely people how amazing you are.

00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:19.075
&gt;&gt; Being on stage is exciting, isn't it?

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:19.829
&gt;&gt; Yes, I love it.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.400
&gt;&gt; That's cool.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.640
I didn't know that about you.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.640
I like to be on stage too.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.810
&gt;&gt; So using that speech recognition,
she can recognize what I'm saying, and

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.110
then respond to it.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.050
Not only does she understand though,
she can actually remember it.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.290
So, over time, she'll get to know all of
my likes, she'll get to know my dislikes,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.260
and then she can incorporate
that into the conversation.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.530
&gt;&gt; And, of course, there's some brand new
Barbie Mega Bloks play sets this year.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.830
There's a lot of career Barbie
sets like this Barbie bake chef,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.540
Barbie teacher, ballerina,
little Barbie pet vet.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.830
And, there's going to be this huge
beach house set with dolphins,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.780
the little poodle, and
other fun pets for Barbie too.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.110
One thing I'm super excited for is this
new Barbie line, Barbie in Rock n' Royals.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.300
There's four new dolls.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.080
And, Barbie is pretty hip here.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.210
It's a band with Barbie and her friends.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.480
Here's the guitar player.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.660
She's got some funky hair.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.480
Check out Barbie, she has hot pink hair.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.360
She's a lead singer.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.290
Here's another one of her
friends with a guitar.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.570
She's got a pretty cool outfit on though.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.290
They all are dressed so nice.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.740
This is probably my favorite.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.660
She got like a little keyboard guitar.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.920
And, of course, there's some new
Frozen dolls with a singing Anna.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.490
There's going to be a brand
new Elsa ice castle, and

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.560
this cute little Frozen
tandem bike with Olaf.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.905
&gt;&gt; You have seen a lot of
new Barbie toys for 2015.

00:05:53.905 --> 00:05:56.990
My most favorite one is
this Barbie motor home.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.510
If you wanna see more Barbie videos, also,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.770
let me know which toy you'd like
me to film first, come this fall.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.510
And, give me a like, of course.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.960
Thanks for watching, and have a good day.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.220
&gt;&gt; Click on a picture to
watch another fun toy video.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.260
And, click on the question
mark to watch a mystery video.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.234
Thanks for watching, and have a good day.

00:06:15.234 --> 00:06:19.189
