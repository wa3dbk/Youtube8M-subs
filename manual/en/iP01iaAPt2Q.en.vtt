00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.929
Hi, I'm Dexter Coakley and Lake Ridge

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.929
is my community.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.130
When my wife and I decided to look for a place to live, what drew us to the Lake Ridge

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.039
area was

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.819
the beauty of the place,

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:31.519
We wanted to get away. Get a little bang for the buck as far as acreage, you know, Lake Ridge

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.420
was the answer. It's a beautiful place.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.280
We're not too far away from Downtown
Dallas, not too far away from Downtown Fort Worth.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.740
We're right there in the middle, in between.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.200
We're having a blast. We're proud of the decision we've made.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.880
It's been great thus far.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.480
We were looking into Frisco, looking in McKinney, we were looking in Flower Mound.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.830
Looking at all these places our North, and we

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.630
never knew that, in Lake Ridge, this existed. When we're out here, we

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.540
feel like we're away from everything, but
still close enough to everything, so

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.190
location is key. Lake Ridge has it all, you've got the natural beauty of the trees,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.270
the lakes,

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.010
the rolling hills, you know, we call them mini-mountains. You don't get that any place

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.080
else in Dallas, so it's a great environment,
a great community, we love it.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.700
it's just a great area to raise a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.140
family. You feel like you don't have to worry about the kids going outside.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.920
It just gives you a safe living environment, you know, we just love it, we can go out

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740
and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.100
each and every day

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.880
we can get a different view,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.060
and it's not the same old grind as living out north.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.730
 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.680
 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.940
The price; that was a huge factor in us coming to

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.100
Lake Ridge. It was the price. Obviously, you can get several acres

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.360
for what we were looking for, for just a lot-not even an acre-up

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.190
north. Obviously that was a huge advantage
for us. We wanted to get more

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.950
bang for the buck. You know, obviously we wanted to build the home of our dreams,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.270
but at the same time, we wanted to have
it on the lot that we wanted.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.160
We came out to Lake Ridge, that was all the things we were looking for.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.500
You get to pick your builder, you get to find your own lot, you get to build

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.610
when you want to build. You know, you can build when you're ready. You're not pressured.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.150
You know, when the time is right, you want to pull the trigger and get all your finances and everything in order,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.119
you can go forward with the process and that's what we enjoyed.

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:27.879
When we decided to pick the lot

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.039
at Lake Ridge, obviously location was key. We were looking for trees, we were looking for

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.139
rolling hills,

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.559
When the finished product was done at
the end, we realized that, you know what could have

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.849
picked a better place.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.269
You know, Lake Ridge allowed us that opportunity to get out there and really

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.169
feel as though, you know what,

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.659
pretty much you can have what it is you want. You can build your dream home, and

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.300
still be close enough to everything, where

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.279
if you want to get up and go downtown, you can go downtown, but to be honest,

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:03.279
we love it here at Lake Ridge. We don't have to leave for anything.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.560
You know, anyone that's looking for a great
area to live, to build a home,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.639
we have it here in Cedar Hill. We have the Tangle Ridge Golf Course, we have

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.829
Uptown where there's shopping, restaurants, eateries, there's endless

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.919
things that you can do. You know, we have the natural trails, where you can go

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.150
hiking if you're into hiking, bike trails, you know, you want to go to Downtown Dallas and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.099
experience an opera, go downtown, we
can do that, because we're less than

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.160
20-25 minutes away, if we want to go to Fort Worth, we can do the same, because

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.690
the distance is about the same. So, we have it all just being here in the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.129
center.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.779
Golfing is great. You know, we've got the Tangle Ridge Golf Course, it's great

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:49.049
Joe Pool Lake is great, we go to the Cedar Hill Rec Center, we'll

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.689
play on all the softball fields, the soccer
fields. You know, we have it all, we have the

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.829
shopping. We have uptown. You know, we have it all, so we don't have to leave pretty much

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.799
Cedar Hill for anything. If we want to go to a park, we have tremendous parks.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.439
We have natural trails. Just get out there and listen to the serenity out there. That's

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:15.439
part of living at Lake Ridge.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.310
Lake Ridge allowed us to have

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.870
everything we ever dreamed of. You know, obviously, family is important to us, and community is

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.509
important. We know our neighbors,
you know, we're comfortable

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.349
with, you know, the kids playing with
the neighbor's kids.

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.060
You know, we can get into the house and
play together as a family, and go out in

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.289
the community, and play together as a
community. So, you know, living out

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.500
here at Lake Ridge,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.900
it's been a blast, because, you know,
sometimes you go some places that you

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.889
don't know your next-door neighbor. My
kids are emmersed in the community, they

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.370
play with their friends.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.619
These are friends and friendships that they're making,

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:59.099
that's gonna last them a lifetime.

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.399
Playing in, you know, athletics at the professional level, you know, you wanted a place of

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:07.759
refuge when you're done. You know, you wanted to wind down, so home

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.470
meant the lot to me, you know,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.969
my family is my life, they're my world, you know, and

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.180
I couldn't ask to be in a better place.
