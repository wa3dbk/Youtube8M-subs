00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.060
Hi, welcome back. In this segment, let's discuss
how to deal with parents. Especially if you're

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.340
teaching children, parents are a big influence
on how you do it. And, what's really difficult

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.501
about the parent itself is that the parent
has goals and ideas and dreams for the child

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:26.510
that the child may not share and you may or
may not share. But, your job is to teach the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.860
child both into the principles of good music
and also into the goals of the parent. It's

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.920
a really hard balancing act. So they hear
you, they happen to come upon your lesson

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.240
and your already playing, and you're playing
something crazy and they're like, "Oh, I want

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.460
my kid to play that!" And it takes a little
bit of effort to be like, "that's not exactly

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.960
what's going to happen right now with this
child." So, you're goals have to be very clear

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.359
in your own mind, even if those are goals
that you do not share with the parents. And

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.490
by "share" I don't mean "have together," I
mean "express to the parent." So, one of the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.560
things that should be in you your list of
goals to accomplish is to get the child, as

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.270
we were talking, to read the music and put
it on the page. One of the goals that should

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.140
be is to get the child to hear the music and
put it on the keys. One of the things you're

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.890
trying to get is to get the child to articulate
or express himself about the music. One of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.040
the goals that you are not going to share
with the children, or tell the children is

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.140
that "yes, I want you to be a famous pianist,"
or "yes, I want you to be a famous rock star."

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.060
All of these things can happen. These wonderful
things can be in your goals for the kids,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
but this is not something I think would be
best if you share. You'll run into this problem

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.430
a lot when you pick out material for the kids.
So, picking out material to use is an extremely

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.450
difficult process. And it's actually a very
vital process; if you pick the wrong material,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.030
your child is put behind for a while. So be
savvy and be slow. If you're not sure that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.009
this is going to be right, don't take it yet,
don't buy it yet if you're not sure. One of

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.330
the things I suggest for piano teachers is
to have a plethora of music that they use

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.170
for themselves, just to try out on kids; to
see what's going to be best. So, that sort

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.170
of helps you deal with parents' concerns and
your own concerns on their own problem of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.560
music.
