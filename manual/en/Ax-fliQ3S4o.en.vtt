Hey guys, um, it’s my first maple news day,

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.200
um, yeah, maple news day, that’s what I
call it. But, today I’m gonna something

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.119
very serious is happening. A GM got hacked,
now, if a GM got hacked, he can do anything

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:22.830
with the body. With the avatar. So now, what
he’s doing is just banning people and just

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.619
not caring about it. Nexon is trying to find
out who is, who’s tryin-, who’s um, who’s

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.610
the hacker is. And, the hacker is a noob that’s
been trea-, I think he’s been treated but

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.930
um badly, this migh-, just is my guess, educational
guess, so, um, I think he’s been treated

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.370
badly, that’s why he’s doing it, but that
doesn’t really matter right now. So, what

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.600
he’s doing, he’s just banning people,
and when other GMs come to him, he logs out

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.440
and goes to another GM’s body. Um, now,
that’s very serious, now, he could just

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.000
like ban anyone who’s logged off, but he
needs your name. So, right now, everyone is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.170
having a banned shield except for people who
actually are hacking right now. GMs are putting

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.990
a banned shield arounds everybody’s computer,
so, you can’t really get banned, there’s

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:28.190
89% chance you can’t get banned, but you
can still get banned. There’s um, uh, there’s

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.760
11% chan-, 80, wait did I say 89 or 84? Well,
doesn’t matter, there’s a percentage that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.190
you can get banned, and that’s not good.
I’m, I, took a long time, it took one year,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.240
to get me to level 62, that’s amazing, that’s
just, that’s just hardcore. That doesn’t

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.290
matter right now, just be safe, you can like
play MapleStory right now, but like, um, the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.670
hacker is really unstoppable right now because
um, GMs don’t really know if that person’s

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.649
the hacker, like, you never know, he can be
who like any hacker, he can be, like, imagine

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.779
there’s the GM, who walks, bans peoples,
and then, he logs off, and then they don’t

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:26.359
know um, the that GM then, and that’s no
good. That’s not gonna, do any-, he-, not

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:32.379
really gonna do anything. So, i-if you have
anymore questions please comment and subscribe,

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:42.330
please, and rate, and, just be careful. Banned
shield does come in h-handy, but I’m not

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:51.469
sure, let’s just say 89%, the-, why it says
89% is that because um, this, the version,

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:58.739
these days, are usually very neat and everything,
but t-, this version, got a little mixed up,

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.819
um, they got the version 64 accidentally,
they did this by accident, version 64, version,

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:15.609
um, the new version 83, now they kinda mixed
 ???? together, so, the hacking, uh, the system

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:23.279
for version 64 is weaker than version 83,
so, um, it’s really easy to get, um, since

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:29.620
we have more hacks inside, um, maplestory
it’s really easy to, um, hack into the system,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.639
um, it’s just so really hard to like, play
without getting banned, so, if you see GM

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.069
just like walk away, do not talk to them,
do not do anything, just walk away because

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.483
he might be a, um, a fraud, and he could ban
you, but I don’t know, he can maybe a nice

00:03:47.483 --> 00:03:48.483
GM that’s trying to help you, so, just be
careful, okay, please subscribe, rate, comment,

00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:49.483
thank you.
