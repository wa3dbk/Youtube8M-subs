00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
The Line of 1000

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.380
This is the book for the year three programme

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.900
And these are the tools that come with it

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.920
Let’s see how the Line of 1000 works

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.160
THE LINE OF 1000 IS A MAP

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.920
Let’s take this little rectangle: 250 plus 80

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.060
WE HAVE TO LEARN OUR WAY AROUND

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.980
- 330
- Good

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.940
Let’s do 500 minus 230

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.060
- 270
- Good

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:09.760
Now let’s turn it over and do this sum, without the dots: 150 plus 70

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.100
- 220
- Very good

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.240
Do 500 minus 190

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.200
310

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:36.860
Now let’s see how this tool helps us learn our times tables and carry out divisions

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.160
I take 2 figures, 4 goes into 18 4 times with a remainder of 2

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.200
See here: 2 dots. Go on.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.460
- I bring down the 3
- Where is 23?

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.520
STUDYING TIMES TABLES (MEMORY) AND UNDERSTANDING THE PROCEDURES (FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND)

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.980
4 goes into 23 5 times with a remainder of 3

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.020
- I bring down the 4
- Where is 34?

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.640
34 is here

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.780
THE ALGORITMS ARE GAMES

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.780
4 goes into 34 8 times with a remainder of 2

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.940
Good

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.480
We can also use this tool to do multiplications when we are not too sure of our times tables. Try it.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.400
STRATEGY RECOMMENDED FOR PUPILS WHO ARE STRUGGLING

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.200
4 times 7 = 28, 8 and carry over 2

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:55.760
6 times 7 = 42, with 2 carried over - 44

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.180
- 4 and carry over 4
- Yes

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:09.720
8 x 7 = 56, with 4  carried over - 60

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.000
This is the tool for equivalences

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.960
We’ve got units, tens, hundredths, etc

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.080
And then we’ve got lengths

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.460
- So: How many decimetres?
- 50

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.600
- How many decametres? 
- 0,5

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.900
- And what about centimetres? How many?
- 500

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.720
WITH THE ANALOGICAL METHOD EVERYTHING STAYS STILL, I’M THE ONE THAT MOVES

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.460
What if I ask you how many hectometres...

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.240
EVERYTHING RELATED TO VERBAL COMPREHENSION TURNS INTO FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.800
Very good

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.000
Let’s have a look here: these are measurements of capacity

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.940
- How many decilitres?
- 350

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.480
- And how many hectolitres?
- 0,35

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.760
Correct! You learn straight away, don’t you?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.120
This tool is for learning fractions and decimal numbers together

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.340
- Have you ever seen this?
- No

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.060
Ok, we’ll have a look at it now. Do you know what this is?

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.340
Yes, one cent

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.720
2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, 1 euro

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.000
- What’s this?
- 1 cent

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.840
- And how is it written below?
- 0,01

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.120
- And here?
- 0,02

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.840
Etc. How do you write this?

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.660
- 1,00
- Now, the noughts don’t count

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.040
- Let’s have a look here. What’s this?
- 1 hundredth

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.440
And look at a different way of writing it

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.560
Read it

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.260
- 1 line 100
- We say 1 hundredth

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.540
Here we write the number as a decimal, on the line

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.500
Whilst here we write 1 above and one below, and it’s a fraction

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.680
DECIMAL FRACTIONS AND DECIMAL NUMBERS ARE CODES

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:34.200
- What’s this?
- 2 hundredths, 5 hundredths, 10 hundredths, 20 hundredths , 50 hundredths,  1 euro

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.360
1 euro. See, we say a whole. One euro and one whole are the same thing

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.800
UNDERSTANDING IS RECOGNISING THAT WE ARE DOING THE SAME THINGS
