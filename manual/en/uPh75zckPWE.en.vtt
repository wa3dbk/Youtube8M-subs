one, two, three, four!

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.160
Rev up your engines!

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.040
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.680
today I'm going to show you how to tell
if your shocks or struts are worn out on

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.250
your car, now in the case of this Dodge
it's pretty easy to tell that it went out,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.160
because when you go over bumps like this, hey,
the whole car just bounces up and down

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.890
and up and down, but many times it's not
that easy to tell, so if you drive and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.330
say forty or fifty miles an hour, and
your car runs straight, but then when you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.500
hit bumps, then you find the steering
wheel starts to shake until it gets not

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.120
bumpy, the struts are worn then too, or if
you're backing up and you hear a clunk

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.450
like this, coming from the back, then you
know that the back struts are worn and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.130
clunking, now the last way to check
struts is simple, just go under the wheel

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:10.610
well, pick up the top boot on the strut,
and feel inside on the rod, and if your

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.960
fingers come out oily like this, it means
the seal is wearing out on the Strut and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.500
it's time for a new one, now when I was
young and dinosaurs roamed the earth,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.290
suspension systems were easier to check
as most cars had just simple shock

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.580
absorbers, they did a bolt on the top and
the bottom that held them in place, and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.060
to check them on all you had to do is
push on the car, and if it bounced too

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.520
much it was worn out, but with modern
McPherson struts that most cars use, it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.560
often more complicated, because the shock
assembly is built inside it, but it has a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.270
spring, and even when it's worn out it
can still not bounce all that bad and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.510
that's why you need to test them fully
like I'm showing you in this video,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.720
because worn struts can make your tires
wear out faster, they can affect braking

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.369
and make it less safe, and they can
certainly affect handling, especially

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.640
when your cornering, now I've been
working on cars the last 47 years if

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.660
there's one thing I've learned, if you
want your car to ride right, do not go

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.920
out and buy the cheapest shocks and
struts you can get your hands on, because

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.640
I've had many customers over the years
come to me and say, what's wrong with my

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.019
car, and I say your struts are worn out
and then they say well we just had new

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.760
ones put on last week, and when I check
out what was put on the car, a lot of

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.270
times they were just cheap Chinese
knockoff,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.260
they didn't work even good as worn out
ones did, so when I do a strut job, I like

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.530
using these Monroe sensor tracks,
they're excellent shocks, and at a decent

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.780
price, and say if you're not planning on
keeping your car all that long, they also

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.340
have an economy range of struts you can
use too, but me I kind of keep my cars

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.350
forever, so I use the sense a tracks, if
your car isn't riding right because of

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.170
worn shocks and struts, now you know
what to do about it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.230
