00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.351
I'm currently wrapping up a
6-year CITA project in Uganda

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.975
where we're working to enhance rural livelihoods

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.100
with sustainable tourism.

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:18.600
Agriculture has always been the number one industry in Uganda,

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:21.475
but tourism is
a very close number two.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.142
The concept is that
by providing incomes

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:26.558
based on the wildlife capital
of Uganda,

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:29.433
the local people will generate income and therefore,

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:31.642
support conservation initiatives in the country.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.432
We currently have
3 community projects,

00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:37.142
they're in various stages
of development.

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:41.558
The first community that we defined the project for was

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.808
Ruhija in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park.

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:47.225
We were actually doing
an analysis in Winnipeg,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.267
trying to determine
which communities we were

00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:52.432
going to be working with, when we received a phone call

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:54.432
from Ugandan Wildlife Authority, letting us know

00:00:54.457 --> 00:00:58.432
that Ruhija was going to be opened up for gorilla tourism.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.017
It's really quite
an exciting opportunity,

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:01.600
really nothing quite like it.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.432
I think it's really important that people think, you know,

00:01:04.457 --> 00:01:07.432
why am I paying this amount
of money to see gorillas?

00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:10.267
Well, there's really, there's one gorilla on the planet

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:13.267
for every 10 million human beings, just to give people

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:15.516
a sense of how rare
they actually are.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.142
Ruhija had previously not
had any tourists,

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:22.309
other than
a few birders coming through.

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:25.392
Tourists didn't stay there,
and we knew that once gorillas

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.100
were habituated in the area,
and tourists started coming,

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:30.432
there'd be a bit of a land rush.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.934
So we immediately engaged
the community to say

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.392
what is it you'd like to do
as a tourism initiative?

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:39.432
And through a process of a number of community meetings,

00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:41.642
group workshops,
we came to the concept

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:45.351
that the first thing
we would fund

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:47.683
was a community tented camp.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.225
The largest is the Ruhija Gorilla Friends Community

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.432
Rest Camp, which was
the first one to be funded.

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:58.432
As a condition of funding,
20% ownership

00:01:58.457 --> 00:02:01.100
of the Gorilla Friends
Tented Camp

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.558
belongs to the community
at large

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:07.100
to help fund other initiatives in the community.

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.267
In Kibale National Park,

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:10.850
many of the communities

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:12.683
surrounding the park are agricultural.

00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:16.475
And Kibale National Park is known for its primate population.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.725
They're fairly clever animals, which frequently raid crops.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.017
So it sets up a fairly significant conflict

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.267
between local communities
and wildlife in the park.

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:28.767
But by developing income
based upon that wildlife,

00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:32.100
and having the people recognize that their income is coming

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.600
because tourists are coming
to visit the wildlife,

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.516
they become more tolerant
of some of these activities.

00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:40.683
There's a strong community champion Kemigisa,

00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:45.432
who really set the stage
for things moving forward.

00:02:57.457 --> 00:03:00.432
(Michael Campbell) Margaret has organized the community members,

00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:03.516
the women in her community, into craft development groups.

00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:06.850
She has over 250 women working in her group,

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.433
producing crafts for sale at zoos across North America,

00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:12.267
and for a very short
period of time,

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.975
in Banff National Park as well.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.100
(Margaret)

00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:43.432
(Michael Campbell)
The third project is occurring in Katanguru,

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:45.683
which is in Queen Elizabeth National Park.

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:48.683
It's actually right on the border of the park,

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.432
it's a small fishing community,

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:53.432
and it has very, very low educational capacity.

00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:56.975
Very few people in the community have completed even primary 6,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.433
there's only a few people in
the community who speak English,

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:04.432
and it's been a real challenge to develop a proposal for them

00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:07.558
that would allow them
to engage in tourism.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:14.225
Early on in our discussions
with that group, we were able

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.100
to work with Ugandan Wildlife Authority and got permission

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.392
for them to operate
a boat launch on the channel,

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:23.432
which had the potential to generate a lot of income,

00:04:23.457 --> 00:04:25.975
but would be very costly
to get started

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.432
and very difficult to bring that community up to the capacity

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:31.433
where they'd be able
to manage it.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:34.392
It's still there as a possibility for the future,

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:36.432
as they begin developing
other initiatives.

00:04:36.457 --> 00:04:38.184
But for the time being,

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:40.892
the women actually decided
what they'd like to do

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:43.432
and what they felt
comfortable doing was taking

00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:47.225
some of the land that they have been given by the park,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.975
rehabilitating it-- it's a
former sand and gravel quarry--

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.767
and turning it into a hostel

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.392
for Ugandan school children
who visit the park.

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:58.142
Which seems like a very good idea given the fact that they

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:00.975
speak the local language, the students from Ugandan schools

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.432
will be speaking the local language, and they won't have to

00:05:04.457 --> 00:05:08.392
raise the expectations in terms of what their deliverables are.

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:16.100
The Ugandan people are warm, open, friendly,

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:20.017
incredibly happy to see tourists in their country.

00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:24.432
The most recent statistics
from the Ugandan Tourism Board

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:29.351
show that about one million, close to a million tourists,

00:05:29.376 --> 00:05:32.267
maybe 800,000, 900,000,
visited in 2011.

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:35.432
And those numbers have increased

00:05:35.457 --> 00:05:38.475
almost tenfold since
the late 1990s.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.432
So numbers of tourists are increasing rapidly.

00:05:41.457 --> 00:05:46.059
Some of research shows, however, that a lot of those tourists

00:05:46.084 --> 00:05:48.184
aren't the typical
nature-based tourism.

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:52.392
About 50% of them are actually here as volunteers, working

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:55.516
in the country with NGOs, religious organizations, etc.

00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:59.267
And probably only about 25%
are actual nature tourists.

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:04.975
So what that says to me is that there's tremendous potential

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.808
to expand the nature-based tourism offerings in Uganda.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.905
