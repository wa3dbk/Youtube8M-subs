00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.513
Across the country, Food Trucks provide tremendous benefits to their communities.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.309
The serve up delicious new food, create jobs and help keep the streets safe.

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:19.133
The same is true for Buffalo.

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:22.129
I'm the owner and head chef of Food Truck, The Roaming Buffalo.

00:00:22.407 --> 00:00:24.497
People seem to really love our food.

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:28.375
I have a gentleman that visits my truck all the 
 time. He says, "It's the best burger in Buffalo."

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.698
My name is Renee Allen, and I own R&amp;R BBQ Food truck

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.763
Everybody loves it.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.117
The love all the Food Trucks.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:36.989
The love the food, they love the whole atmosphere of it.

00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.289
I'm Pete Cimino, co-owner of Lloyd Taco Truck

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.330
In an urban environment, foot traffic is really important.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:46.092
Food Trucks can bring that and they can bring 
 that at no cost to the city.

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:51.920
But despite these benefits, some Buffalo officials have been 
 slow to embrace these budding entrepreneurs. 

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:55.097
Often kicking them off of property for no justifiable reason.

00:00:55.098 --> 00:01:01.510
We actually started in the South Town, so we weren't in the 
 city of Buffalo at all and it was quite welcoming there.

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:05.666
Almost every town we went to, it was very easy. 
  People were really excited about it.  

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.869
We could go almost anywhere we wanted to and 
 we decided to move into the city 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.466
because there's more pedestrian traffic and it's a denser population.

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:21.014
But since we moved to the city, we've gotten kicked out of 
 a couple places, not really for any specific reason. 

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:25.473
We've been booted from property, kicked off property in a handful of locations.

00:01:25.474 --> 00:01:30.210
Primarily due to a lot of grey area 
 with the code that's written right now.

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:31.580
I have lost a lot of business.

00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:34.784
I'm going to places where I'm only making $100-$150 on a lunchtime.

00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:41.630
When I could go some place that's very well populated, might get 
 kicked out but I might make $600, $700, $800. 

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:45.950
When we're asked to leave, we always pack up, politely, and we ask, 

00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:50.150
"Why are we being asked to leave?", and we never get a legitimate reason.

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:54.490
The Buffalo Common Council is currently considering its first Food Truck laws.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.510
In an attempt to protect themselves from competition, a few brick-and-mortar restaurants

00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:04.880
are lobbying for anti-competitive laws that will keep 
 food trucks far away from their establishments.

00:02:05.388 --> 00:02:10.130
These private businesses want to use government power to protect themselves from competition.

00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:14.611
It's really going to hurt me, it really hurt my business, 
 and I'll probably have to pull out of Buffalo. 

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:17.530
I'll have to go to the south towns, where we're welcome with open arms.

00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:25.221
I think any sort of bad regulation that prohibits where we can and 
 cannot operate is going to be detrimental to our business. 

00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:27.451
Ultimately our plan is to be mobile. 

00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:30.951
And if we can't be mobile then we might as well just shut down.

00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:35.090
It's sad because there are only a couple of 
 restaurants in Buffalo that are doing this.

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:39.500
I've talked to many brick-and-mortar restaurant owners that love the idea.

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:44.280
All Pete, Renee and Christopher want is to serve good food to eager customers.

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:50.480
Buffalo should say yes to Food Trucks by rejecting anti-competitive 
 laws that will put them out of business.

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:54.571
We don't want to upset people, we want 
 to bring good things to the neighborhood.

00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:56.760
That's what we're trying to do.

00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.520
We want to go where the crowds are. 

00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:04.090
We want to bring great food at a great 
 price to where people are already walking around.

00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:08.570
If you look at other cities, Food Trucks and the 
 brick-and-mortars have worked very well together.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.140
Competition definitely is better for the consumer because all 
 it does is drive down prices, 

00:03:14.142 --> 00:03:18.140
it creates better quality, and it just makes me work harder.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:22.760
The time is ripe here.  We've had a 
 history in our city of being behind 

00:03:22.757 --> 00:03:27.080
and not being hip to things that are happening across the country.

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.190
This is something to bring jobs back to Buffalo.

00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:36.200
Support the Food Trucks by telling the Common Council to reject 
 protectionist proposals that limit where the Food Trucks can operate.

00:03:36.573 --> 00:03:38.150
We just want to run a legitimate business. 

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.593
We want our chance to compete.

00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:41.540
I don't think that's too much to ask.
