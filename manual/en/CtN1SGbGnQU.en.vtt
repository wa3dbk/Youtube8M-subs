ANNE MOONEY: Hi. I'm Chef Anne Mooney, also
the regular food writer for Simply The Best

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.650
Magazine out of Delray Beach, Florida, and
today I'm here on behalf of Expert Village.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.200
And we've talked about--we're going to talk
about crepes and we've talked about sweet

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.800
breakfast crepes, now we're going to talk
about a fancy, savory breakfast crepe. It's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.300
called a Breton crepe, and it starts out with
the savory crepe, which we've made and refrigerated

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:40.410
overnight so that it'll be all done. And then
we're going to do a sausage-and-leek filling,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:53.620
like so.
And once the filling is done, then we'll take

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:06.109
some and put it right in the middle there
of this crepe,

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:15.829
and then we'll take a poached egg that I poached
earlier and am holding in a little tub of

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:25.579
ice water. And we'll cut the messy parts off
of it, like so, and put this egg right here

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.039
in the middle of the sausage and then we'll
garnish the whole thing to give it some color

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:40.539
with some cherry tomatoes that have been cut
up. So here, and then, instead of folding

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:47.569
the crepe all the way over the filling, this
one just gets folded up kind of--if it will

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:56.299
do it, like that, so that it sits on the plate
and the--your guests can eat it almost like

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:04.229
a quesadilla. It's not acting like a quesadilla
but that's the idea. Check out my other cooking
