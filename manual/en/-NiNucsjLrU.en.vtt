"So my name is Julie, and we are at Gladstone
Institutes on the Mission Bay campus in San

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.770
Francisco.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.419
We're focused, we're in a basic immunology
lab and trying to mainly fit in more of the

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.680
HIV and AIDS goal of the institute.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:44.670
So I kind of feel like the goal of our research
is to really understand what kind of response

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.930
the immune system would need to elicit so
that we could develop a vaccine towards it.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.420
I think a part of science that's really cool
is that it's not a 9 to 5 job.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:07.329
It can sometimes- your day can be literally
all day from 8 AM to I don't know, midnight.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:13.179
It depends- it depends on what you're working
on, but the great thing about working in a

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:20.100
lab is there's a lot of flexibility for the
most part as long as you get your work done

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.819
of course.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:28.999
A lot of the time, I'm at the bench or I'm
doing a PCR, or I'm running flow.

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:36.619
There's a lot of management duties that I
have.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.670
I really actually really like the culture
of being in lab, and the community here is

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.250
just phenomenal, people are great, and just
the kind of things that we're looking at and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.849
trying to answer is really awesome, too.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:02:00.899
I actually grew up in Stockton, California,
and it's very low income for the most part.

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.021
There's actually a lot of crime.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:11.530
Kind of getting out of that and being where
I am today is really remarkable I think.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:22.220
My mom is actually a CFO, chief financial
officer, and then my dad is a counselor.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.780
Growing up, I didn't even know research existed.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.010
High school I didn't even know.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.030
I thought if you're a science major, you're
going to be a nurse or you're going to be

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.840
a doctor or some kind of medical profession,
but then, I went to Berkeley, and there was

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.950
this thing called research.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.090
I don't know why it didn't click to me that
there's other parts of science, but it kind

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.340
of opened up a whole new world I guess.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.840
I think what's rewarding sometimes and what's
kind of neat about research is that sometimes

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.010
for at least a second, you know something
that no one else knows.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.460
The potential of helping someone else is definitely
something that would be rewarding because

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:28.420
everyone is working towards a common goal
so even a little bit of what you trying to

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.790
answer could help someone else.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.450
That's definitely rewarding.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:42.090
That's the whole goal of biological research
is to answer questions that could help others

00:03:42.090 --> 00:04:12.990
for the most part.
