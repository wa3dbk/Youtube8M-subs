00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.780
Today, we&amp;#39;re going to be taking a look
at the Sportrack J-Style Folding Kayak Carrier,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.370
part number SR5513.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.470
The carrying capacity of this rack has one
kayak with a maximum kayak weight of 75 pounds.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.310
The maximum kayak dimensions are 17 foot long
by 36 inches wide.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.369
It&amp;#39;s made of a steel tube construction
with a gray powder coat finish that resists

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.019
rust and corrosion and comes with a limited
lifetime warranty.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.770
Now, the roof rack system that we have today,
we have a little bit of overhang that hangs

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.050
over the vehicle, which is going to be a great
combination with this J-Style Kayak Carrier

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.100
because it&amp;#39;s going to allow us to simply
just place the kayak up into the cradle and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.240
not have to lean up on the vehicle or get
a ladder.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.900
To install it, we&amp;#39;ll simply need to take
out some of our hardware.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.740
We&amp;#39;ll need two of these black bolts and
then one of the rubber coated black brackets

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.190
and we&amp;#39;ll need the black wing nut which
is going to secure the bracket to the bar.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.829
We&amp;#39;ll start off by taking one of the bolts
and going through the square hole here on

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:09.880
the steel tube.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.100
Now, you&amp;#39;ll notice there&amp;#39;s two holes
here, which are not designed for the bolts

00:01:15.100 --> 00:02:43.700
to go through.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:03:26.460
It 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:36.630
is 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:05:18.960
the square 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:47.230
holes that 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:06:29.919
are in 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:07:01.310
the bar.
