00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.830
One of the things to consider when you're
highlighting your hair is first the base color

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.830
of the hair.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.960
I feel like often I have clients come into
the hair salon and say to me, "Well, what

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.040
color is the base going to be and what color
are the highlights going to be?"

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.540
In order to highlight your hair, first you
choose an all-over base color.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.330
Once you've had the all-over base color, then
what you do is you mix up a lightener.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.059
You apply the lightener to the pieces that
you'd like to highlight.

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.879
The lightener is actually just transforming
the base color lighter and lighter and lighter.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.380
I guess what I'd like to say is there's not
a big bucket of base colors and a big bucket

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.789
of highlight colors where you choose one of
these and you choose one of these and you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.149
hope they go together.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.659
By choosing an all-over brown and then making
it lighter, you're able to stay within the

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.089
same family and it'll look the best on your
skin color.

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:08.310
One of the do's I think for brown hair are
sticking to shades that work with browns.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.770
I have a warm, medium to dark brown base color.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.780
This would be a perfect color highlight for
me.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.650
It's warm, it's rich and it's still brown.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.490
One of our don'ts would be choosing from that
other bucket we spoke about and maybe choosing

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.500
a color that's too light and too cool and
too yellow.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.860
It doesn't work very well.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.180
Very, very, very dark brown hair works great
with different auburn tones and lots of different

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.600
red tones.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:54.409
Black naturally has a lot of red tones in
the hair, so I tend to choose highlight colors

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.840
that are similar and can be found within,
such as that.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.700
When working with brown hair highlights it's
a great way to brighten a brunette's look

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.019
without having to send her into the blonde
category.
