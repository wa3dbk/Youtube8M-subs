00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.710
 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.860
I think the core of the value of a private school is to provide that individualized instruction.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.139
They’re learning in a smaller environment with smaller groups of people.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.620
It’s almost like a family,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.840
moreso a family.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.820
We’re talking about testing. We don’t test as frequently as is required in the

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.860
public schools.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.390
We believe in a progressive

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.610
type of education, which is

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.910
focused on experiential learning.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.190
The flexibility we have in curriculum, the way we’re allowed to teach, the way we relate

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.130
to kids is much different than in the
public schools.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.410
Not better or worse, just different.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.440
The reality is that children in private schools

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.480
are an essential element of American education. They’re part of the American family 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.480
and you cannot have a comprehensive picture of education in this country

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.700
without including those students.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.460
NAEP is the gold standard when it comes to providing a comprehensive picture

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.619
of student achievement in the United States.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.200
It tells a story, like all assessments, it tells a story.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.789
We know that our teachers and our parents want

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.820
to have a tangible way of looking at

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.920
the progress that their students are making and so we know that standardized

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.120
tests are important.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.179
And I think that it’s important for private schools

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.390
be included in what’s going on nationally.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.810
I think parents are hungry for it. They want to know how our children are doing with other

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.430
children across the nation.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.330
 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.170
I think it’s important for private schools to participate in NAEP

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.009
because it gives students an opportunity to participate in a national assessment.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.860
Another reason that private schools should probably participate in NAEP is

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.320
because you want valid results.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.409
And if you’re leaving out a population, you’re not really getting valid results.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.259
If all you did was private schools, you wouldn’t have a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.890
very good sampling. If all you did was public schools or suburban schools or

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.530
urban schools you wouldn't have a full sampling.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.080
If it’s a National Report Card,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.860
it's nice to be part of the discussion.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.500
We want to teach kids to be responsible

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.400
as citizens. And I think that this was a great way for my students to feel that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.930
they’re a part of something

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.430
that's bigger than themselves. 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.330
Why not participate?  Why not be a part of making a difference in the educational system of the future?

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.270
If students understand that

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.320
the NAEP assessment doesn’t really

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.730
single them out because their own individual scores wouldn’t be

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.420
reported, it would put them at ease to just go ahead

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.550
and do their best.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.720
My students knew that they would learn from this assessment

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.980
and they were excited to do it.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480
Our students did not miss a lot of class time.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.360
It was respectful of our

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.430
academic day. It was respectful of the teacher’s need

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.310
to make sure that the test went on and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.160
finished in a timely manner.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.420
It really was not a big deal at all. The whole process was really pretty easy and smooth.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.180
You want to be part of that type of assessment,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.560
because you represent a very unique

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.560
aspect of the educational experience here in the U.S.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.720
Policymakers can’t make good choices and good decisions

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.360
unless they have good information.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.360
I think participating in NAEP helps us shape the future

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.330
of America. What better way to make a difference in our educational system

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.520
than to take the time now to be evaluated

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.080
so that we can make it better.
