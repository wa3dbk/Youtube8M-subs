00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.280
I am wearing a unique piece from Patagonia.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.379
It is their men’s down shirt.

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:11.700
So you have got a lightly insulated piece,
a very clean, minimalist design.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.160
This certainly can be worn as a cool weather
outer wear piece.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.240
It is a really versatile option when used
as a mid layer.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.300
The down shirt ways less than 10 ounces.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.009
You have got an extremely light weight offering
here.

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.910
Both the insulation and the fabric play a
role in that design.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.810
So you have got 600 fill European goose down
insulation and not a whole lot of it.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.250
This isn’t meant to be your warmest of winter
jackets.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.840
That little bit of warmth, however, makes
it really... it has potential for year round

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.870
usage depending on where you are in the country.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.760
And, again, that little bit of bolstering
at the mid layer.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:03.690
30D recycled polyester face fabric certainly
maintains that light weight minimalist design.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.260
This piece certainly cut more like a shirt
than it is a jacket, so you do have a full

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.050
length zipper here on the front of the down
shirt and some elasticity here at the cuffs.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.100
No other real points of adjustability, however.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.770
There is a nice high cut collar.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.380
So when you are wearing this as an outer wear
piece, you have got some nice warmth, some

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.860
nice protection.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.150
But really I think the intent more often than
not is for this to be worn as a mid layer.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.140
You have got a nice, clean profile that expects
that you are wearing heavier layers over top

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.000
of it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.400
Just a quick touch on the pocketing here.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.170
Again, maintaining that clean design that
Patagonia has applied to this piece.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.320
You have got hand warmer pockets, but just
an opening on the side.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.560
There is no zippering, no closures to that.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.740
On the inside you actually can store some
things behind those pockets.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.000
So, again, almost a minimalist dump pockets
on the interior.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.250
The Patagonia men’s down shirt depending
on where you are at in the country, up high

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.470
in the mountain states or further north, this
could very well be a year round piece.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.760
For the rest of us or in warmer climates,
really as an outer wear piece this is a cool

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.980
weather, not a cold weather option, but a
really, really versatile piece to make part

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.640
of your cold weather layering system.
