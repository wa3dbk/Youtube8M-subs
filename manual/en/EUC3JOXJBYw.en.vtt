00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.360
Wow, look at you. "Mr. Inside Man."

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.120
You and Tommy trainin' together like nothing ever happened.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.520
It's unbelievable.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.880
Now I know what you're really doin' here.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.580
-What's that?  -You came to gloat.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.560
Oh I did not come to gloat! I came to get my son back.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.320
Well there you go!

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.880
There, you got your son back.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.980
No! I'm talkin' about you, Brendan-

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.220
You got your son back.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.120
You know,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.600
Ah, forget it.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.860
You know, I'll tell ya. Part of the reason-

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.800
Part of the reason I stuck around, is cause I thought I'd finally get you all to myself.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.980
But you didn't have any interest in training me. You thought Tommy was the one.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.120
Ah Brendan, I was a drunk.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.280
I mean, you know. I'm sorry.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.700
Ah forget it.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.200
You're always a front-runner.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.320
Never had any interest in underdogs.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.800
But I was your son.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.420
You are my son, Brendan.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.040
Am I?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.180
Yeah you are.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.580
I just- I'm just askin' ya if you can find-

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.560
A little bit of space in your heart to forgive me.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.080
A little bit-

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.380
Yeah.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.020
Alright, I forgive you.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.640
Okay-

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.220
But I do not trust you.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.780
Oh-

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.480
Listen, tell Tommy if he wants to see me, this is where I am.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.280
O- Okay.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.560
B- but they're not different things. You gotta trust to forgive,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.660
Night, Pop.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.980
Oh- my god! Is that Emily? She's grown, Brendan!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.140
Is that Rosie?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.140
-Daddy, who is that? -It's just a nice old man.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.380
How bout a, cup of coffee?
