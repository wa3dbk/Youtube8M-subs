00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.160
 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.730
Hi everyone. So this is Final Fantasy 14 A
Realm Reborn.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.520
It's a massive multiplayer online game. The second attempt by Square to actually

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.260
do this bearing in mind the first attempt was
a complete and total disaster for them

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.160
both technically, community wise, the
whole thing was just a disaster so

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.490
they went away and they've tried to rebuild
the game again and called it A Realm Reborn

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.309
and what I just cannot fathom is how
they could go ahead

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.400
and basically screw it up all over again the
second time. I know people say oh it's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.940
brilliant, it's so much better but

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.400
have you guys looked at the graphics in this
game? Have you seen how badly they built

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.110
this world?

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.120
It's atrocious and the biggest problem I really

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.430
have with Final Fantasy A Realm Reborn is  that it feels very lazily converted

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.280
to consoles, which is strange. I mean it appeared on PS3, I played it a fair bit on PS3

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.440
hated it. The graphics were rubbish

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.850
certainly compared to most PC games and it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.690
just felt like it was a thrown together game to attempt to fix what was broken

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.950
but actually the game engine itself

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.030
it's just not suited to what they're trying to do.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.420
One of the key things that I found quite
disgusting actually about the way this game

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.490
engine is operating

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.790
is have a look at the way that the lighting and shadows are

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.190
constantly flickering in the back of every scene. It's incredibly distracting.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.370
I saw the same problem on the PS3 version and the same problem on the PC version

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.940
so afraid this is engine related and
honestly it appears to me

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.430
that they've used some tricks to attempt to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.010
bring the resolution and the texture quality up and I think they might be using a

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.300
tiling system

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.760
because when the camera moves you can
see the texture levels dropping

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.940
on objects all around you, especially on things like character clothes as well.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.430
The anti-aliasing falls away and as soon as the scene kind of stops moving

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.290
then all of that detail kind of comes back
into sharp focus again and the textures

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.140
seem to improve.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.920
For me it appears to be a technical thing that  they went for with this game that

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.800
actually hasn't paid off. Certainly not as the game has then scaled up onto

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.470
next-gen consoles, etcetera. Gameplay
wise it's all pretty much the muchness

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.769
you know, it's an MMO but unfortunately
because of the controller

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.109
and kind of everything you're trying to squeeze into a controller where normally

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.959
you'd have a mouse and keyboard and menu options

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.999
it just feels almost overloaded really for an MMO

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.489
on a console. There are certainly better
examples, DC Universe in my opinion

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.819
gets it pretty much right.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.090
Everything that I really hated with the PS3
version is still here in the PS4 version

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.659
no great surprise there. But likewise, while they're calling this a beta,

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.680
guys bear in mind really it's a demo they're doing for this next

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.480
weekend and also again in April. They're really attempting to kind of say

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.489
to people hey, check out our game, you might enjoy it and if you play it for a couple of  days

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.010
maybe you'll go ahead and buy it. I'm
afraid

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.349
for a title that is boxed copy plus
monthly fee this game is an avoid.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.439
You might say that I'm jumping a little
bit too soon, it's still in beta on the PS4

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.510
but guys, played it on the PS3, played it on the PC

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.650
and it's the same game at the end of the day.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.329
The technical issues, some of the problems
with where characters are placed that you need to speak to

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:13.769
 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.209
these are not going to suddenly be fixed
because it's coming to the PS4. These are

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.870
inherent

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.129
issues with the game as it's been released. What we're really looking at here from a

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.760
beta point of view is a stress test with the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.439
servers more than anything else. I doubt very much there's going to be any major

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.299
changes

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.989
certainly I can't see them suddenly fixing
this disaster of a game engine they've got

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:31.639
going on here

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.109
that just makes the PS4 look like trash to
be honest.

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.010
If I was Sony I would be refusing this game a release on the PS4 because

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.549
it just doesn't show the PS4 in anything
else than the worst light.

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.669
Agree with me, disagree with me, hit me up
in the comments and let me know your

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:47.079
thoughts.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.659
This is not a Microsoft fanboy video or anything crazy like that

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.730
just before anyone starts. This is just a
personal opinion of what I've seen while

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.749
I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 on
the PS4. You're free to disagree with me

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.650
you're free to agree with me, that's the
beauty of YouTube comments. Thanks for watching.
