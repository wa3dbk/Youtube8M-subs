00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.289
Straight talk. That’s what I’m here to
deliver. Straight talk about wheelchair vans.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.780
We’re going to look inside, outside and
underneath. Even though it won’t always be pretty,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.740
I promise you, you’ll learn something. And that, I hope, will help you make the right

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.349
decision when it comes to purchasing a wheelchair van that works for you.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.960
Let’s face it; you probably think that if
you weren’t living with a mobility issue,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.560
you’d have countless choices when it comes to vehicle makes, models, and features, and so on.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.980
The truth is; you still have choices,
so it would be a shame to go on assuming that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.890
you have to compromise; you don’t.
Today’s technology makes it possible for

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.410
people with disabilities to drive and travel
anywhere their vehicle can go. 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.410
And as far as riding in style is concerned, even though you may need a van, the point is, 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.100
you can choose the make and van model that suites you. You just have to know where to look and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.800
what to look for. As with any significant purchase, it makes good sense to explore your options. 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.760
When it comes to vehicles, that means getting your hands on the controls,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.400
testing the features, taking it for a ride. That’s especially

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.540
important if you’re dealing with a disability
because adjusting to the vehicle after you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.229
bought it may not be an option. Features like ramp angle, control operation and placement,

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.880
interior space, head room, and how the vehicle feels and handles on the road may mean one

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.409
thing to a person dealing with immobility
in the lower limbs and something completely

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.670
different to somebody with limited upper body strength as well.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.530
The point is; you have choices, so take advantage of the opportunity to choose what’s right

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.760
for you. This series of short videos will
help you do that. We’ll explore things that

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.939
are easy to see, may seem obvious, but may not be. And perhaps more importantly, we’ll

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.000
explore issues that are not easily seen, but
are seriously important to understand before

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.670
you choose a vehicle that you’re going to
depend on. But more importantly, I’m going

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.280
to ask you not to believe anything I say.
I’m going to ask you to challenge my claims,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.950
to ask questions of the manufacturer you’re considering, to find out for yourself what

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.480
each manufacturer offers and why.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.440
After all, the choice is yours.
