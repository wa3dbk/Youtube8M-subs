[ Music ]

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.020
&gt;&gt; Nancy Myers: Our NICU is very closely
partnered with March of Dimes and from

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.460
that partnership grew a collaborative
relationship with Emerson.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.270
&gt;&gt; Vincent Langston: They had kind of a
brainstorming idea to where hey, we can --

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.600
we could have Cal State San Marcos
students coming over to Tri-City.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.530
So maybe with the March of Dimes
you guys can take some of that money

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.240
and channel it towards some scholarships

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.280
and we'll give the San Marcos students
an opportunity to get into the baby side

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.270
of being a nurse and triangulate it that way.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.700
&gt;&gt; Tara Naughton: The Emerson Network Power
Scholarship is a two year nursing residency

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.220
program at Tri-City Medical Center.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.660
It allows a rotation in labor and
delivery, a rotation in post-partum

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.980
and then a full year in the NICU.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.020
It additionally provides you
with a 10,000 dollar scholarship.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.550
&gt;&gt; Vincent Langston: It's good to be able to
take the pressure off of a student not to have

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.060
to work as well as study and so we can,
you know, help take the pressure off so --

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.810
where they can spend more time
studying and perfecting their craft.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.140
That's what we aim to do.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.190
&gt;&gt; Tara Naughton: You can look at it if you
want as being almost paid to work as a nurse.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.490
&gt;&gt; Vincent Langston: Just, you know, the fact
that you see a student that's reached their goal

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.240
and that smile and that heartfelt
thank you, you know it's just something

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.140
that you just can't replicate
with profits and a P&amp;L statement.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.950
&gt;&gt; Nancy Myers: And so it's really providing
them extremely unique view into an area

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.600
of nursing that they just, due to
circumstances of their academic program,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.910
they don't have the ability to learn about.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.250
&gt;&gt; Tara Naughton: You're working
alongside experienced nurses.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.170
When we graduate, we're going to have the same
top quality, you know, background knowledge

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.280
and the most recent research
findings and those kinds of things.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.000
So I think we can really make a difference
coming into it having that knowledge.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Myers: It's really
a win-win opportunity

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.980
because it's providing these nursing
students with incredible opportunity as well

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.510
as the nurse, level of nurses that we will
get upon graduation from Cal State San Marcos.
