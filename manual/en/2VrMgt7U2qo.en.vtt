00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.310
A famous frog once said, it's not easy being green.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.920
But, when it comes to living green, it sure as heck can be easy and can save you a whole

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.920
lot of mula too.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.910
Stay Cheap!

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.330
Hey, I'm Jeff Yeager the ultimate cheapskate and host of the Cheap Life.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.630
Americans make up just five percent of the world's population, but we consume thirty percent

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.730
of the world's resources. But you hear it
all the time. Sure I care about the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.070
environment.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.250
When it costs so much more to live green.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.840
Flummadiddle! Pardon the F word but the truth
is an eco-friendly lifestyle can

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.330
actually save your money if you do it
the cheapskate way.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.800
Walking or using a bicycle to get around are
two of the simplest and cheapest

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.590
ways to go green.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.060
Good for the environment, good for your health

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.790
and your wallet.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.830
You could buy an expensive new hybrid car
but why not keep their cash and take

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.910
public transportation instead.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.730
There's also some great car sharing
and bike sharing programs out there.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.730
Just look online for the ones closest to you.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.320
Carpooling is also an easy and

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.050
highly sociable way to save on transpiration costs.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.979
But you can't find someone to hitch a ride
with try slugging.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.040
No, not that kind of slogging what i'm
talking about is kind of like hitchhiking

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.130
only more organized and a heck of a lot
safer.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.680
Here's how it works:

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.030
Individual drivers who want to take
advantage of special carpool lane's and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.250
reduce tolls pull up to a slug line
location.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.340
The folks that need a lift, hope into each car as it pulls out.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.170
You'll find slug lines outside many
major cities during rush hour

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.210
it's really a win-win

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.520
that driver gets there faster.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.130
Passenger: and the passenger gets there for free.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.320
Did you know that in two thousand nine
car sharing cut global CO2

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.749
emissions by nearly half a million tons?

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:18.209
That's half the weight of the golden gate bridge.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.629
Organic food could be pricey but you can
save

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.769
green and go green by buying in season and local produce.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.569
You'll also find that the lower on the
the food chain you eat, the cheaper the chow.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.340
So eat less meat, and more grains
fruits and veggies, you won't believe

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.949
this savings you'll dig up.

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.939
Solar panels and energy-efficient
windows will save you energy and money

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.329
over the long haul. But the upfront cost
can be a real pain in your assets.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.319
Make your home more energy efficient with
simple do-it-yourself improvements like

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.680
the ones I talk about in this

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.569
video.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.919
Remember, the best thing you could do
for good ole mother earth, and your bank

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.890
account is to use things up,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.249
make things last, and in some cases, just do without. I'm Jeff Yeager for the Cheap Life. Stay green and stay

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.959
cheap!

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.939

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.569
