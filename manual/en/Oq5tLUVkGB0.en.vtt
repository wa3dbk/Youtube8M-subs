00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:09.476
Most people have experienced this: you create or select an object in a scene, 
and then select one of your Transform tools, Move, Rotate or Scale.

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:17.676
Instead of seeing the Transform Gizmo that makes it easy to constrain movements 
to an axis or two, you get a simplistic red ui element.

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.463
If you start wondering what's wrong with your system, Don't fret.

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:27.040
When this happens, chances are you accidentally tripped over your keyboard's "X" key.

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:31.408
X is a toggle that controls the visibility of the Transform Gizmo.

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:36.370
If you lose it, just press X again and you should be able to retrieve it.

00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:43.045
But why this hotkey? Why would anyone want to turn off a tool that makes 
working with constraints easier?

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:47.868
Well, in some situations, the Transform Gizmo can actually impede your work.

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:53.780
This is mostly true with objects that have Bezier Handles such are patches or splines.

00:00:54.528 --> 00:01:03.483
When you have Bezier handles that are aligned with a constrained axis, 
it is very difficult to move in any other direction than that of that axis.

00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:09.961
In this case the Bezier handle lies on the Y axis and you cannot move in X for example.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:20.083
So you have a couple of solutions: One is to use the - and + keyboard keys 
to make the gizmo smaller or bigger so you can freely move the handles.

00:01:20.408 --> 00:01:25.201
Use the main + and - keyboard keys and not the ones on the numerical keypad.

00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:30.069
The other method is to turn off the Transform Gizmo by pressing X.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:36.606
You can then control axis constraints using hotkeys: F5 for X, 

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:43.012
F6 for Y,

00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:49.283
and F7 for Z.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:00.512
To work on two axes simultaneously, use F8. F8 is a toggle between the XY, 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.860
YZ, 

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.158
and XZ planes.

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:20.490
When you are done editing Bezier handles, you can enable the gizmo again by pressing X.
