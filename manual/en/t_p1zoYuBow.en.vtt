00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:09.217
The next game is entirely new,
ladies and gentlemen. "5 Versus 2".

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:14.618
In this "5 Versus 2" we will have
Gregório and Dani, stand up.

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:20.145
And they will have the challenge
of creating a whole scene,

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:25.680
just the two of them, playing five characters!

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.842
And for that I will need someone -
who brought a book here tonight?

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:31.643
Yes, you're the one, could you bring it here?

00:00:31.643 --> 00:00:34.633
I walk half the way, you walk half the way...

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.258
Wait a sec, stay here.
What's your name?

00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:39.532
- Excuse me?
- Suellen.

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:44.519
Suellen is reading "The Vampire Diaries."

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.083
Cool. Who's the author?

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:50.142
- L.J. Smith.
- L.J. Smith.

00:00:50.142 --> 00:00:52.597
- Say a page, Suellen.
- 30.

00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:56.852
Thanks, Suellen.
Give it up for Suellen!

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:04.771
Page 30 will give us the title of our story.

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.946
And the title is...

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.395
"The girl swallowed hard"

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:16.456
"5 Versus 2". Go.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.334
It's so hard to be a virgin and to be lost
in Pennsyl... Transylvania!

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.302
No! I feel like I'm in a
L.J. Smith book!

00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:36.221
- Come here, I will do you no harm.
- No! No! I know you're a vampire.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.382
I can't come close and I have my medicine
to take, and there's no water here,

00:01:40.382 --> 00:01:43.451
- and all I wanted was a glass of water!
- A glass of water?

00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:46.053
Yes! Do you have one in your castle?

00:01:46.053 --> 00:01:50.377
Monster! Go fetch a
glass of water for her, now!

00:01:50.794 --> 00:01:53.254
Now!

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.636
- Just a minute, he will bring it to you.
- Where will he get this glass of water?

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:04.377
Inside my castle, astle, astle...

00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:08.721
He will be here at any moment now.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.432
Okay.

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:24.085
Monster, where are your manners?

00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:30.370
Invite this fair lady to go
into our castle, astle, astle...

00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:37.085
Go! Talk to her!

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:40.780
Hey, fair lady!

00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:45.765
Your glass of water, lady.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.018
But there's nothing in here!

00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:58.066
I forgot the water!

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.639
Stupid monster!

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.705
Go fetch more water for her!

00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:08.805
He's bringing it soon, okay?

00:03:10.727 --> 00:03:12.261
Okay.

00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:23.459
Master! There's a
vampire hunter coming here!

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.099
Oh no! Not a vampire hunter!

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:38.194
Hooray, a vampire hunter!

00:03:38.194 --> 00:03:41.756
Is this monster bothering you, fair lady?

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:45.926
- Very much.
- Hey, not cool!

00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:49.925
Where's your master, monster?

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.575
Is everything all right with you, lady?
Everything all right?

00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:55.842
I'm fine.

00:03:55.857 --> 00:04:02.419
Dumbass monster! He won't do this
anymore, really. He won't, lady.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:08.896
Master, come back...
Master, come back!

00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:12.167
I need you! Help!

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:16.622
Oh my god, a vampire!

00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:28.282
Run, lady! Run away!

00:04:28.282 --> 00:04:33.677
I can't run before I take my medicine,
and I can't swallow without water... Oh!

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.068
Another vampire hunter, but he's
bigger and fatter, he looks like a giant!

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:42.960
And with a nasal voice!

00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:56.600
Did someone call me?

00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:06.607
"5 Versus 2", ladies and gentlemen!
Amazing!

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.695
Gregório, are you tired?

00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:12.884
No, I'm fine.

00:05:13.842 --> 00:05:19.821
Guys, you get that he couldn't drink
because the title was "The girl swallowed hard".

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.044
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
