00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
&gt;&gt; STEVE: NOPE.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.190
&gt;&gt; WILL: DOUBLE NOPE.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.870
&gt;&gt; STEVE: SO MUCH NOPE that I’m calling
this NOPEFED.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.870
I’m Steve Zaragoza,

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.870
&gt;&gt; WILL: And I’m William Haynes.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.870
&gt;&gt; STEVE: And this is NOPEFED

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.870
[MUSIC]

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.570
&gt;&gt; STEVE: Man don’t you hate it when you
buy groceries and you get home and your bananas

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.410
are covered with the eggs of one of the most
poisonous and aggressive spiders in the whole

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.410
world?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.310
&gt;&gt; WILL: If I had a dollar for every time
that happened to me I’d say “No thanks

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.310
I already have a dollar”.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.310
But it actually did happen.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.310
The spider in question?

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.310
The Brazilian wandering spider.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.250
The location of the incident, Colchester England.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.619
The victim, Abby Woodgate.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.649
&gt;&gt; STEVE: Abby initially thought her nanas
were moldy.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.910
But after poking the spots, it turns out the
“mold” was egg pouches.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.530
The pouch then split open covering her floor
in spider eggs.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.530
NOPE!

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.530
FUCK.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.530
NOPENOPENOPE.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.909
&gt;&gt; WILL: The woman was then told my pest control
experts that she would have to BURN anything

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.949
that had come into contact with the spider
eggs, as the spiders are highly venomous.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.719
According to the Guardian, at deadly concentrations,
the venom causes loss of muscle control and

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.219
breathing problems, resulting in paralysis
and eventual asphyxiation.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.219
&gt;&gt; STEVE: WHY!

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:05.530
WHY DO THESE THINGS EXIST?

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.520
WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THESE HELLISH DEMONS
ON THIS PLANET?!

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.050
SO, Abby vacuumed up the eggs, and then promptly
INCINERATED the vacuum cleaner, along with

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.060
the remaining bananas.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.020
And in case you’re thinking, and don’t
live in England, “Hey, this was in England,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.950
these spiders can’t get to me!”

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.640
Think again!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.350
The Brazilian wandering spider, sometimes
called “Banana Spider” has a tendency

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.730
to hide in banana bunches and is occasionally
found as a stowaway within shipments…

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.240
ALSO, FYI, the spider is being used by scientists
for use in erectile dysfunction treatments.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.930
Because, quote, “The spider’s bite can
cause an erection that sometimes lasts for

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.380
up to four hours.”

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.680
Wow this story took a real sexy turn.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.810
&gt;&gt; WILL: So what did we learn today?

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.580
Never buy bananas again, and some spider bites
will make you go all night.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:09.660
&gt;&gt; STEVE: So what’s the worst thing you’ve
found in your groceries let us know!

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:20.780
