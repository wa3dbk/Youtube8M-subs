This episode of Dnews is brought to you by
Audible.

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.560
Cows are farmed, pigs are farmed, plants are
farmed… and there's a debate about the health

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.210
benefits of ALL of those things.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.770
So what about fish?

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:19.500
Is farming fish okay?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.290
We learned to fish long before we learned
farming or domesticating animals, and today,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.290
we eat so much fish, there's no way we can
catch all those animals and keep the practice

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.290
both sustainable and affordable…

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.910
So we farm them.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
That alone isn't terrible, but HOW it's done
can sometimes be.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.730
In 2012, global fish farming, called aquaculture,
passed global BEEF production.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.379
But have you noticed farmed salmon and wild
salmon look different?

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.809
The wild are orange-pink and the farmed are
light pinkish, not quite orange.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.190
Salmon are carnivorous fish.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.720
In the wild they eat smaller fish, so they
can't be fed grains or soya on farms, they

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.780
need to eat other fish to survive.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.720
Farmed fish don't get the same nutritional
input as wild fish, obviously.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.690
Salmon meat gets the orange-pink color from
eating tiny shrimps and other crustaceans

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.080
-- the shells of which contain carotenoids,
an antioxidant which is the same stuff that

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.860
makes carrots orange.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.770
According to Stanford's Center for Environmental
Science and Policy, one pound of salmon takes

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.210
about 2.4 pounds of other wild fish to produce
-- usually sardines, anchovies, mackerel,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.470
herring and so on.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.200
But since farmers have to make the feed for
their fish, they grind up the smaller ones

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.120
to produce fish oil and meal, and compress
it into pellets that can be fed to the salmon.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.890
Obviously, some carotenoids are added too,
because the fish need them for growth and

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.690
reproduction, as well as color.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.310
Since 2004, the World Wildlife Fund has worked
with salmon farmers to make the farming sustainable

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310
and fight disease.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.160
And, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch
program is taking note of improvements in

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.580
the aquaculture industry noting there are
a couple of places where salmon farming is

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.580
done right.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.260
But some farmers are replacing the fish oil
in the feed with vegetable oil, which is cheaper

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.370
and more sustainable.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.790
And a new study from Norway's National Institute
of Nutrition and Seafood Research has found

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.700
this practice might be harming the fish AND
those eating it.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.069
According to their results, Norwegian farmers
were replacing as much as 2/3 of the salmon's

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.720
oil with veggie in 2013.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.840
They were quick to point out, this was just
Norway, not everywhere.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.560
To see how this major dietary change would
affect the salmon and thus the people eating

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.109
it, they fed the salmon to mice…

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.450
Turns out, those who ate the fish-oil salmon
had a healthy balance of omega-3 and omega-6

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.799
fatty acids, and a healthy liver; even though
they ate a LOT of salmon.

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.489
On the other hand, those who ate the vegetable-oil
salmon did not have a healthy balance of fatty

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.950
acids and had an accumulation of fat in their
liver called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.049
So maybe farmed salmon isn’t quite as healthy.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.150
But wild salmon are still really expensive,
three times as much as farmed salmon in some

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.150
markets.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.310
However many farmers are banding together
to make salmon farming sustainable, affordable

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.819
and good for the fish and the future.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.040
The Norwegian researchers closed it best,
saying yes, the vegetable oil-fed fish weren't

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.029
as healthy, but "getting some omega-3 acids
are better than none at all."

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.030
How do you feel about fish farming?

00:03:29.030 --> 00:04:07.579
Better or worse than regular farming?
