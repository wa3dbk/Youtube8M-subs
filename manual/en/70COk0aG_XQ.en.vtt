00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.839
Murders, violent crime, robberies, and even
extreme weather conditions, are among many

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.780
factors that contribute to the, quote, “dangerousness”
of a city.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.080
Recently, the high crime city of Baltimore
made headlines after riots swept the area.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.300
But crime and other hazardous conditions plague
countless other US cities.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:27.400
So, we wanted to know, which are some of the
most dangerous cities in America?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.029
Over the last few months we’ve been working
closely with our friends at AJ+, and today,they

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.560
invited us in to their studios!

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.520
Stay with us for more of their coverage on
the Baltimore riots.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.989
So back to the question, which American cities
are the most dangerous?

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.420
Well, according to the 2013 FBI statistics,
the cities with the highest murder rates are

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.530
Detroit, New Orleans, Newark, St. Louis, and
Baltimore.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.989
Many of these cities also rank high in violent
crime, along with Memphis and Milwaukee, as

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.739
well as robbery with Cleveland and Oakland.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.420
It’s important to note, that many of the
cities with high crime rates are also some

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.360
of the nation’s poorest cities.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.870
Many used to be beacons for American blue-collar
industry work, and they have since declined

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.020
in productivity.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.750
Unemployment and poverty levels in these cities
are usually well above the national average.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.230
Many economists have noted that both these
factors often contribute to high crime.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.549
But criminal activity isn’t the only way
to measure a city’s dangerousness.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.540
Severe weather conditions can also pose threats.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.250
According to the Federal Highway Administration,
over a million car accidents are caused by

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.990
bad weather conditions.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.690
In cities like Boston and Washington DC with
severe snow and rain during the winter, fatal

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.909
car accidents are more common than in other
parts of the country.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.040
Also, coastal cities, like Miami, New Orleans
and Houston regularly experience deadly hurricanes..

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.990
So, really, almost everywhere you go in the
United States - be it Detroit or Miami - danger

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.540
is present.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.730
One final note about “ranking” cities
according to crime statistics -- The FBI warns

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.340
that crime rates can often be misconstrued,
without factoring in things like population

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.460
density and economic conditions.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.519
And although Baltimore is making headlines
as a high-crime city, there’s also evidence

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.619
of new growth and prosperity there.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.340
However, until underlying factors behind crime
are addressed, like systematic poverty and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.890
high unemployment rates, there will always
be “dangerous cities” in the US.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.000
If you want to dig even deeper into the underlying
causes of the violence in Baltimore, check

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.799

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.480
Dena was actually in our studios earlier this
week too!
