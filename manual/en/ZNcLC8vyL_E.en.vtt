00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.350
Now-a-days, games receive a lot of hype.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.250
You’ll see commercials, blogs and videos
online, all adding to the anticipation of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.750
a game fans are looking forward to.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.939
Backtrack 20 years with me, and you rarely
had that at all.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.290
In fact, besides hearing about a good game
from a friend, or visiting a rental store,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.020
the only way I remember knowing about games
coming out was from Nintendo Power.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.150
That’s where I saw this game and thought,
“hey looks pretty cool, I think I’ll check

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.150
that out”....

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.550
Oh man... it’s Robin Hood: Princes of Thieves
for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.100
Released in 1991 by Virgin Games, this is
an adaptation of the movie by the same title,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.610
another thing very common to do today, make
a game based off of a popular movie.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.680
Now while Robin Hood didn’t live up to it’s
hype in my opinion, it does fall victim to

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.010
the stereotype of games based on movies not
being all that great.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.680
So you start off in prison, much like the
movie and you are introduced one of several

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.930
game-play modes, the Zelda top down perspective.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.500
You move Robin around, pick up objects, and
interact with the environment through a menu

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500
system.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.390
Searching, looking, and taking to progress
through the game.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.970
Combat is much like Zelda again, attacking
with whatever weapon you have.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.530
You’ll fight guards off, explore castles
and forests and interact with NPC’s in this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.630
mode.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.810
It functions alright, not great.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.560
Robin moves like he’s on ice and made out
of rubber.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.950
Which can be kind of frustrating when moving
through narrow areas...

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.479
It’s not long before you encounter another
game mode, this 2D side scrolling duel mode

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.030
where you and one enemy duke it out.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.940
This mode comes up every now and then and
it’s kind of a abrupt change.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.510
Robin is much more mobile in this mode, but
it still it’s not totally flushed out well.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.150
Hit direction seems totally random and button
mashing and cornering, if you can, is really

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.940
your only strategy since a lot of the time
your opponents out reach you.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.180
There’s a 3rd battle mode, that is supposed
to represent large scale battles with all

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.080
of the merry men against some opposition,
usually guards.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.640
You’re now miniature versions of your party
fighting miniature versions of the baddies.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.270
It’s never really very difficult since everything
dies in one hit.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.730
You can switch between merry men, but again
no real advantage to that.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.450
One final mode, and probably least thought
out, is the horse chase where your objective

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.580
is to run, jump blue rocks... that’s it.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.230
I’m not even really sure why they added
yet one more different mode of play and it’s

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.860
probably the worse one of all of them...

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.090
Graphically, Robin Hood, is pretty awful.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.599
Everything is this brownish orange color the
whole time and the portraits are meant to

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.380
look like the movie characters, maybe.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.819
The sprites in the duel mode are half decent,
but that’s about the best compliment I can

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:19.819
give.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.620
This is a late NES title too, like released
after the Super Nintendo came out late.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.960
One of the reasons I thought this game would
be good, is the mix of some RPG elements.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.250
Each character has their own status page with
inventory and equipment.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.900
You can gain experience and level up as well.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.550
But, and this is the reoccurring theme of
the game, there’s no real substance to the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.540
whole experience and that’s the problem
with this game.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.040
It tried to do too much.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.760
Had the whole game been like Zelda and with
some of the RPG elements maybe, it could have

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.459
been much better.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.910
Honestly I don’t want to knock it that hard,
at least it was trying some creative things

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.900
to switch it up, but unfortunately that can
lead to some games that aren’t remembered

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.989
for how awesome and innovative they were,
but that they were kind of a let down.
