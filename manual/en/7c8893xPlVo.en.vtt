00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.210
Hi Besties,

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.050
So many of you have been emailing me

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.130
and while I don’t have time to respond to
everything

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.130
I’ve read

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.130
every

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.130
single

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.130
email

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.000
and clearly a lot of you have questions about
traffic.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.889
Especially about how to get free website traffic.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:15.889
Z!

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.090
Go get the answers to the besties traffic
questions!

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.910
I love answering bestie questions

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.680
While I’ve made several videos about how
to bring in traffic

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.970
I do have a lil’ bit of a secret weapon
I myself use

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.670
Do you want to know what it is?

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.500
Well I’ll tell you what it’s NOT

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.730
My secret traffic source is NOT

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.730
Pinterest

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.730
YouTube

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.730
Facebook

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.730
LinkedIn

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.730
Twitter

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.730
or any other social media site.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.730
Are you getting excited yet?

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.510
Let’s do a webinar!

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.129
In true Renae Christine fashion,

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.360
I’m going to host a one hour webinar to
not only tell you about my number one secret

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.450
source for traffic

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.450
but

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.379
I’m also going to give you a software that
I personally created just for you so that

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.460
you can use that secret traffic source.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.490
Totally free

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.939
But you have to show up to the webinar to
get it.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.250
but Renae, why does your traffic source need
software and why don’t other business analysts

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.250
talk about it?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.249
Other business coaches and analysts will NEVER
tell you about this new source of traffic

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:22.249
because.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.249
1.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.249
They aren’t web programmers so they don’t
understand it.

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:25.249
2.

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:26.249
They don’t get a commission on it.

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:27.249
3.

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.409
Even if they did understand it they would
have no idea on how to expain it to you.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.409
I, on the other hand

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.409
don’t care about commission

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.409
I’m weird like that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.799
am a web programmer so I DO understand it.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.999
And as a programmer I built something for
you so that you can use it just like I do.

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.799
You’re welcome

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.690
Now I don’t know if I’ll be able to post
a webinar replay so try to register and try

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.690
to show up on time.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.109
I’m only allowing 100 registrants this time.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.829
And by the way the last time I did a traffic
webinar like this

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:57.829
I had over 400 registrants.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:58.829
That was 6 months ago

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.829
and I’ve gotten a lot new besties since
then.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.529
where should we go renae?!?

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:11.610

woah.

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.360
Where did we move too?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.610
Oh you again.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.610
what?

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.340
You’re the one who locked me in the bathroom

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.900
no.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.950
You’re the one who escaped then locked me
in the closet

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.950
so?

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.160
You escaped and got me with one of Leilani’s
blankets

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.530
Yeah.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.549
I sure loved that blanket

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.409
Yeah it was really soft

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.409
Stay for outtakes?
