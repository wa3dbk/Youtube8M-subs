Hello and welcome to ComicDrake where I talk
about comic books and my name is Drake. Imagine

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.360
Tony Stark with all of his technical genius
and combine that with Hal Jordan and his Green

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.190
Lantern power ring, the most powerful weapon
in the universe. The end result? The Amalgam

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.630
Amalgam comic Iron Lantern!

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.970
Hal Stark is a billionaire playboy who runs
Stark Aircraft. He’s a genius inventor and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.670
one hell of a fighter pilot, but one day when
he was testing a stationary flight simulator,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.660
the machine somehow took off! The flight sim
was being drawn towards the wreckage of an

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.540
alien ship belonging to Rhomann Sur, an Amalgam
of Rhomann Day and Abin Sur.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.160
Uh… to the non comic readers, Abin Sur is
the one that gave Hal Jordan his Green Lantern

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.680
power ring and Rhomann Day is the one that
gave Richard Rider the Nova Force.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.690
So back to Iron Lantern. When Hal Stark’s
flight simulator crashes, his chest is impaled

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.579
by a shard of metal. Rhomann Sur died in the
explosion leaving Hal all alone, quickly bleeding

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.040
out from his wound. So acting quickly, Stark
crafted a suit of armor from the alien wreckage

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.470
in order to extract said metal from his chest.
At the core of this suit was a green lantern

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.079
shaped battery which granted Stark the ability
to create energy constructs of anything he

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.000
could imagine.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.320
Immediately, Hal Stark used this power which
is later discovered to fueled by Oa the Living

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.960
Plane, to fight the aliens that gunned down
Rhomann Sur. It was this battle that brought

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.260
Stark to the public’s eye where a local
news outlet dubbed him “The Iron Lantern”.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.630
With this public persona, Hal led a double
life. By day, he operated Stark Aircraft with

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.200
his associates Pepper Ferris, an amalgam of
Pepper Potts and Carol Ferris, Stewart Rhodes,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.229
an amalgam of John Stewart and Jim Rhodes,
and Happy Kalmaku, an amalgam of Happy Hogan

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630
and Thomas Kalmaku.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.200
When trouble rears its ugly head, Hal Stark
would take to his office and tell his computer

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.030
the secret code. “In brightest day!” This
activates the counter code “In blackest

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.210
night.” And finally “No evil shall escape
my sight!” This reveals Stark’s armor

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.430
that he donns and takes to the skies as Iron
Lantern to take on such foes as Madame Sapphire,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.880
an amalgam of Madame Masque and Star Sapphire
and Mandarinestro, the amalgam of The Mandarin

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.260
and Sinestro.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.240
That’s… basically everything we know since
the Iron Lantern comic is just bland… Really

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.140
really bland… If you want to see just how
strange it is for yourself, then pick up the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.219
one shot Iron Lantern comic. Trust me, it’s
at least worth a read for the novelty factor.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.739
But now it’s time to let your voice be heard!
If you want a video on the Superman/Captain

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.689
America amalgam, then click on Super Soldier,
but if you’d rather have a video on the

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.159
Man-Bat/Man Thing amalgam, click on Bat-Thing
here!

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.159
But if you want to know more about Amalgam
comics as a whole, I’d recommend clicking

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.769
this annotation right here for my video on
Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. or click

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.469
on this one for an explanation of what Amalgam
Comics is all about!
