00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.550
Windows 8 has two primary screens: Start and
Desktop

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.930
The Start screen contains tiles that are connected
to apps, folders, photos, and websites that

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.490
are alive

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.160
with the latest information.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.500
Use this screen to quickly open items that
you use often.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.410
The Desktop screen is similar to previous
versions of the Windows desktop.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.250
It contains a work area, taskbar, folders,
and icons.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.090
Use this screen to work with desktop software
applications.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.090
This video shows you how to customize these
Windows 8 screens to fit your needs.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.310
The display resolution determines how much
information appears on the screen.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.640
With lower resolution, fewer items fit on
the screen, but those items will be bigger.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.540
At higher resolution, more items fit on the
screen, but they will be smaller.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.049
To set the display resolution, open the desktop
screen.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.520
Right-click an empty area of the desktop and
select Screen resolution.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.530
If more than one monitor is connected to your
computer, select the number of the monitor

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.580
you want to adjust.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.500
In this example, we have only one monitor.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.360
The Resolution box contains a slider bar that
you can use to change your screen resolution.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.780
The Recommended setting provides the best
quality resolution for your display.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.370
To change the resolution, drag the slider
down to decrease the resolution,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.090
or drag the slider up to increase the screen
resolution.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.710
Click OK to save settings.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.620
In the confirmation box, click Keep changes.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.409
Note: For the best image quality on flat panel monitors,
use the monitor's native resolution or

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.640
recommended settings, which is usually found
in the documentation that came with it or

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.400
in the onscreen display menu.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.780
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.129
In Windows 8, you can change the Start screen
wallpaper and rearrange and resize the app tiles.

color, select the color from the Background

new location.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.290
For example, you can move the Weather tile
below the Sports tile.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.139
This allows you to group tiles to make them
easier to find.

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.870
If you want to name the group, select one
of the apps in the group, and then type a

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.809

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:34.459
