Some of the glues that we use here in the
shop are tight bonds. There's different ones,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.670
two and three. Some are waterproof. Some got
color to them. This has got a brown to it,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.769
which is kind of nice. It kind of blends in
to the surface when it dries. And it's much

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.859
easier on the finishing process. Strength-wise
they're about the same. It replaces the old

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.089
hide glues that were used. And we still do
use hide glue for certain areas, but for the

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.439
most part, this is what we're using. We put
it in a small bottle like this and it's much

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.329
easier to work with. Now back over here with
our furniture, we're going to cut into one

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:47.360
of these bubbles with a razor blade. Making
a little incision. Then we're going to go

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:57.249
to our glue knife. We're going to open up
that crack, squirt some glue in there all

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:08.080
along the crack and then work it in with the
knife.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.190
Push it back as far as you can, back into
the seams until you can feel the edge of the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.730
bubble. Once you think you've got it good
enough, you can see it coming out the crack

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.240
on the other side, we're going to use our
wet rag, of course, and clean off the excess.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:37.370
You may want to even work it out, too. You
don't want a big bubble of glue in there,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.401
because when you clamp it down, it won't sit
down smooth. So get as much of the excess

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:58.010
out as you can. Just push it on. Push it through
and push it out. And just continue this until

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.671
you get most of the glue out of the pockets.
You'll feel it with your fingers as the glue

00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:10.331
smushes around in there. Once you feel pretty
secure about that, that's all there is to

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:11.599
the glue process.
