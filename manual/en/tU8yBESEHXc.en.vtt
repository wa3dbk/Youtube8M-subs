Finally, Android 4.4.3 KitKat is out and can
be installed on your Nexus 5 either manually

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.449
or by updating Over the Air.
For root users I always recommend updating

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:19.350
manually by flashing the ROM via custom recovery,
so let's get started!

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.430
First things first, we need to download the
required files - the ROM itself and SuperSU

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.350
if you want to keep your root privileges.
So simply go to the XDA thread posted by a

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.030
recognized contributor named Vomer and download
the files.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.660
After downloading make sure you copy the files
to root of your device and you're ready to

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.660
move to the next step!

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.329
So turn off your phone and boot to the custom
recovery by pushing down the volume down button

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.890
and power rocker together at the same time.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.750
Now we have to wipe cache and dalvik cache,
so first lets wipe the cache. After that go

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.750
to "Advanced" and wipe the dalvik cache there.
Once it's done it is time to flash the ROM

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.380
itself so navigate to the location where you
copied the files earlier and flash the ROM.

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.859
It will take some time to finish the installation
so don't worry if it's still there after a

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.359
minute as personally for me it took a little
over 3 minutes

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.189
to finish installing the ROM.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.189
Alright, and after that you can now flash
the SuperSU if you want to have root access.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.200
Finally, you can reboot your system and enjoy
your new Android 4.4.3 KitKat ROM!
