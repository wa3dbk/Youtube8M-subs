Morning!

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:37.489
Today I'll show you how my hair in a basic
hime pouf.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:38.489
This is the style I do most often.
Brush our your hair.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.489
Mine was a bit dirty so I added a little scented
talcum powder.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.879
My version of this style is by no means the
best of only way to achieve this style but

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.780
it's what works the best for me.
Take a small section of hair starting at the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.370
top of your ears and moving up to the top
of your head.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:04.449
Clip it out of the way and too the side.
For this version you will need a rat" basically

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.030
that is something squishy in the same you
want your hair to be.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:23.119
Mine is a bandana wrapped in a hair extension.
Pin it to the top of your head behind the

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:34.200
section of hair you clipped out of the way.
I am using a darker colour so you can see

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.570
what I'm doing.
Pin it at the front, back and both sides so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.570
it's really securely in place.
Now unclip the front section and brush it

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.570
out.
Divide it into 3 sections: left, middle, right.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.570
Let the left and right sections go so you
are just holding the middle.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.570
Using a teasing comb brush the section straight
forward and tease the back of it so it will

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.570
hold the shape better.
Lay it back over the rat and pin at the base.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.570
Now spray it all over with hair spray and
smooth down.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:02:09.519
use your fingers to fan it out so it covers
as much of the rat as possible.

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:36.000
Take a section from the right and brush it
upwards.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:03:13.570
Tease the back with the comb and pull it up
the side and over to the opposite side.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.030
Pin it at the base of the rat and also pin
it at the top of the rat so the curve stays

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.030
in place.
Repeat it on the other side too.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.590
Pull the section up, brush through, tease,
pin top and base, spray and smooth.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.490
If you are unhappy with the shape just squish
it until you like it and spray again.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:31.190
To blend the bump to the bottom hair a bit
more just grab a section from the side, tease

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:41.650
and pin at the back.
Of course, spray it in place too.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.500
Repeat on the other side and you're almost
finished.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:04:03.450
That's the basic bump almost done.
From the back you can see there are a few

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:18.289
gaps where the rat can still be seen.
just fan out the hair with your fingers to

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:25.417
cover them and spray.
If you use a rat the same colour as your hair

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:26.417
it doesn't matter as much.
Time to curl the rest of it.

00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:27.417
I use a mini straightener for the curls.
Don't forget the bits pinned at the back too.

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:28.417
Add some accessories front and back and you're
finished!

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:29.417
I like to use long ribbons on the back so
it looks more impressive.

00:04:29.417 --> 00:04:30.417
If you feel your hair isn't big enough you
can tease thr roots for some extra volume.

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:31.417
I live by the motto that there's no such thing
as too much hairspray.

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:32.417
So now you're all made up you just need somewhere
fun to go and show it all off.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:33.417
I hope this was a useful video, please check

Thanks so much for watching.

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:34.418
Bye!
