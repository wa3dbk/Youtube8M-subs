00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.759
This is HotAir.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.480
The RSPCA is stepping up its campaign to criminalise
pest control.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.380
Both BBC and ITV News faithfully reported
an RSPCA press release about a corvid found

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.940
dead that had been shot by an airgun.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.130
Acting as a kind of quasi police force, the
RSPCA has asked for “anyone with information”

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.820
to contact them.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.520
India is stepping up its campaign for Olympic
airgun glory with a new airgun range in Hyderabad.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.090
Olympic bronze medallist Gagan Naran officially
opened the Gun For Glory Shooting Academy,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.829
with the support of local politicians and
sports star, opening the doors to around 10,000

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.539
local children who want to try out shooting.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.480
India is still looking for a guaranteed place
in the air rifle and air pistol events at

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.190
the Rio 2016 Olympics. China has won five
places, with Russia and the USA both with

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.280
two.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.510
Daystate is to cease production of its Mk4
airgun.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.729
The launch of the new Daystate Pulsar airgun
means production has now switched. Over its

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.410
colourful seven-year history, the MK4 has
seen many variants and types, from the Early

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.490
MK4 ST, the addition of the information screen
in 2009 and the limited edition Platinum in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.070
2010. The rifle received a full update in
2014 with the last DS series receiving the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.900
replaceable air cylinder from the Regal.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.680
A limited edition commemorative air pistol
sold out in just four hours at the ShotShow.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.330
Umarex USA and US Marshals Museum offered
a limited edition Colt Single Action Army

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.239
Revolver, also known as the "gun that won
the west”. Limited to 30 guns each, dealers

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:46.890
had taken all of them soon after the doors
to the ShotShow opened. They will be in shops

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.640
in the USA in May 2015.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.170
The world's biggest online airgun retailer
has announced its list of top-selling list

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.750
of 2014.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.350
US-based PyramydAir says that airgun manufacturer
Crosman is the big winner.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.860
In the airgun category, the Benjamin Marauder,
made by Crosman, is the winner, ahead of the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.720
Daisy Red Ryders. The Crosman 2240 is the
biggest selling air pistol. And when it comes

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.480
to ammunition, the choice of America is the
JSB Match Diabolo Exact King .25 and .22 calibres.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.140
The Fieldsports Channel Global Hunting Survey
is throwing up some interesting results about

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.480
airgunning.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.140
We asked for a safe range for rabbits with
a good quality sub 12ft/lb airgun. Just 7%

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.060
of airgunners would shoot it at more than
50 yards.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.030
The prize draw is over but we are keeping
the survey open for a few more weeks while

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.570
we work on a full report to be published on
28th February 2015. Visit the links on the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.570
screen.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.000
And finally, the grey squirrel has a new enemy:
the car giant Toyota.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.080
A motorist in London has suffered repeated
repair bills as local squirrels eat their

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.940
way through the biodegradable bits of his
Toyota Aygo. Tony Steeles, from South London,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.750
went nuts after his car was attacked by a
band of hungry squirrels just days after delivery.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.490
Toyota now uses plastics derived from castor
oil, which the squirrels find delicious. Billed

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.590
as an urban runaround, it is clearly not at
home in the British countryside.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.910
And rats also like Hiluxes, don't they Roy?

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.900
Aiming for accuracy - targeting the truth!

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.989
