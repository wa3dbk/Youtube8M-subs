00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.070
[TEACHER] ...and that's about it! 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.240
Youth For Understanding is more than

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.200
just an exchange program.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.380
It's an opportunity for your child to complete a transformative journey 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.260
not just for his own benefit,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.240
but to contribute to a cultural exchange

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.140
that brings our world a little closer together.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.040
What about you guys talk it over?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.380
I'll be back in a few minutes.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.000
We can go over the online application.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.020
[MOTHER] Whew. That is a lot of information to take in.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.500
[STUDENT] Need me to explain it again, mom?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.860
[MOTHER] No, smart guy...

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.420
Yeah, you'd better break it down for me.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.900
[STUDENT] OK, come on!

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.940
I can take plenty classes here at home

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.380
about language and culture,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.000
but only the experience of studying and living in a country

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.460
leads to true understanding of that culture. 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.960
You know, YFU, Youth For Understanding?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.000
[MOTHER] I got it.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.920
[STUDENT] Since YFU has placement in over 40 countries,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.720
I get a wide selection of cultures to learn from,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.460
even if I don't speak the language in a certain country

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.080
total immersion is the best way for me to learn!

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.899
And a more rounded education looks really good to universities, 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.179
and later, even employers.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.920
[MOTHER] South America, Africa, Asia, Europe...

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.220
Ooh, thank you.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.120
Looks like they've got all the continents covered, 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.340
except Antarctica.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.360
[STUDENT] Well, that's probably for the best.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.460
The point is, even if I don't get placed

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.420
in the country that's my first choice,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.940
there's a whole world of new places and cultures to discover.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.890
[MOTHER] It all sounds wonderful, but I still have so many questions.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.000
[STUDENT] Lay them on me.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.780
[MOTHER] Well, the big one is can we afford this? 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.200
It sounds expensive.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.700
And, what if you get homesick?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.200
Will you get along with your host family? 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.940
What if...

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.440
[STUDENT] Woah, woah, slow down!

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.380
There are over 250 merit-based scholarships,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.500
and plenty of fundraising ideas to pay tuition

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.200
so students, like yours truly,

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.650
can study abroad.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.030
[MOTHER] But, won't you miss me?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.350
[STUDENT] Of course, I will,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.170
but you don't want to solve all my problems 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.130
for me my whole life, do you?

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.200
YFU will help me to think on my feet,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.560
without my parents, 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.040
which is something I'm gonna have to learn how to do anyway.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.800
[MOTHER] I suppose so,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.680
but what do we know about this

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.900
"host family"?

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.520
[STUDENT] Mom!

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.660
[TEACHER] I think I can answer that one.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.720
[MOTHER] All right. 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.900
[TEACHER] Ready to start your application?

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.220
[STUDENT] Sure!
[Mother] Great.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.560
[TEACHER] Ooh! We better hurry, come on!

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560
[MOTHER] What?

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.670
YFU carefully screens every host family in every country.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.690
They undergo a rigorous application and vetting process, 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.410
that includes an in-home interview from a YFU representative.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.459
[MOTHER] I'm sure they're all great people,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.180
but what if my child just can't see

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.660
eye to eye with them?

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.220
In each partner country, 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.900
YFU has branch offices

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.840
with the same core mission and values as YFU USA.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.120
There is always a YFU volunteer available,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.400
so, even if your child is a world away,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.600
they are not alone.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.390
[STUDENT] All set.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.150
[TEACHER] Great! 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.490
We're almost there.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.340
[MOTHER] Where are we going?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.800
[MOTHER] Time to go already?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.360
[STUDENT] Yep.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.200
Thanks for the tour!

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.400
Thanks. For everything.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.900
Wellp.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.120
Guess I'm off to...discover me!

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.440
[MOTHER] When you find him, 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.860
tell him his mom misses him...

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.120
and hopes he'll make her proud.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.700
[TEACHER] You know, he is not just going to learn a lot  

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.260
from his host family,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.900
he'll also be teaching them everything he's learned from you.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.060
[MOTHER] I hope I didn't forget to tell him anything...

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.200
[TEACHER] Come on.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.760
[MOTHER] Hey, can we go back through France?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.600
I would like to get another cup of coffee.
