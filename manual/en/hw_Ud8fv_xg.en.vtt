00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.083
(male announcer)
Xfinity has switched
to an all-digital platform,

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:22.250
so that means that you''ll need
to install a digital adapter

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.333
if your TV
isn''t already connected

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.250
to a digital set-top box.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.250
Your self-installation kit
includes

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.667
your digital adapter box,

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:32.125
two coax cables,

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:33.166
a power cord,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.999
a remote control
and two AA batteries,

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.834
a list of remote control codes
to pair with your TV or adapter,

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:44.000
adhesive fasteners to store your
digital adapter out of sight,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.542
and our easy-to-follow
instruction booklet

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:47.875
and quick start guide.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.375
If you''re installing
an HD digital adapter,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.999
you''ll also find an HDMI cable,

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:54.333
number labels
to match your remotes

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.375
if you''re installing
multiple adapters,

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:00.625
and Velcro straps
to keep your cords organized.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:01.458
If you''re installing

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:02.999
a standard-definition
digital adapter,

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.000
your kit will contain
a remote control signal receiver

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
that looks something like this.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.750
With it, you can store your
digital adapter out of sight.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.999
Now you''re ready to begin.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:15.458
Your digital adapter
goes between

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:18.750
the cable outlet on the wall
and your TV.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.250
If this is the first time
you''re setting up Xfinity TV

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.458
and don''t already have a coax
cable connected to the wall,

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:28.792
use one of the cables that came
with your installation kit.

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:30.999
Attach the coax cable
to the wall.

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:34.625
Now attach the loose end to the
back of the digital adapter box

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:37.999
in the port that says "Cable In"
or "RF In."

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.999
Now you''ll need to connect
your adapter box to your TV.

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:47.291
For HDTVs, you''ll use the HDMI
cable that came with your kit.

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:49.417
Simply connect one end
of the HDMI cable

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:53.208
to the HDMI port on the back
of your digital adapter box

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:56.458
and connect the other end
to one of the HDMI ports

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.291
on the back of your television.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:59.417
For standard-def TVs,

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:03.125
use the shorter coax cable
that came with your kit.

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:05.375
Attach one end
to the To TV port

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.709
on the back of your digital
adapter box.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.041
Connect the other end
to the Cable In or RF In port

00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:14.000
on the back of your TV.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.792
Now, whether you''re connecting
HD or SD,

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:20.542
plug the power cord
into your digital adapter box

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:22.999
and plug the other end
into a power source.

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.959
Now you''ll need to make sure
you''re receiving a signal.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.834
Using your TV''s remote control,

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:29.999
turn your television on.

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:34.166
If you used the HDMI cable,
use your TV''s remote control

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:38.875
to tune your TV
to the correct HDMI input.

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:39.999
For standard-def installation,

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.999
set the switch on the back
of your digital adapter to 3

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.999
and tune your TV to channel 3.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.166
If you don''t receive a signal,

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:51.667
you might need to set
your adapter box and TV

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:52.792
to channel 4.

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:53.583
You''re almost done.

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:55.999
Now you''ll activate
your digital adapter,

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.375
which you can do
in two convenient ways--

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:02.125
visit us online
at xfinity.com/digitalnow

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:06.959
or call our automated
activation line at:

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:12.959
You''ll need your Comcast account
number and name on the account.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.917
You can find
your Comcast account number

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:17.542
in the instruction booklet
and on your receipt or bill.

00:03:17.542 --> 00:03:20.250
If you''re activating
more than one adapter box today,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.583
you''ll need the serial numbers
for each box handy

00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:24.583
before you call.

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:25.834
You can find the serial number

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:27.417
on the bottom
of each digital adapter

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:31.750
or on the outside of your
self-installation kit box.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.333
Please make sure
that you''ve connected

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.000
all the digital adapters
you''ve ordered

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.166
before you call us
to activate them.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.417
Now that your new digital
adapters are activated,

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:43.125
let''s confirm that your Xfinity
service is running smoothly.

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:45.000
After activating
your digital adapter,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.458
you''ll need to wait
a few minutes.

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:48.417
Now turn on your TV

00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:50.917
with your TV''s remote control
or Power button

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.083
and make sure the light on the
front of the adapter is solid,

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:55.125
not blinking.

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:57.667
If you see live TV,
your service is working.

00:03:57.667 --> 00:03:59.999
The final step is
to activate your new remote

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.333
so it will work with
your digital adapter box or TV.

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:04.999
Place the batteries
into your new remote.

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:08.999
Then visit us online
at xfinity.com/remotes

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.709
and follow
the on-screen instructions

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.291
for the remote control
that came with your kit.

00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:15.166
After you programmed
your remote,

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.917
you can use it
to control your TV.

00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:19.999
You know your remote
is properly programmed

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.667
when the On/Off, Volume,
and Mute buttons are working.

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:26.542
Now you''re ready
to start watching TV.

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:27.625
For standard-def installations,

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.458
if you want to place your
digital adapter out of sight,

00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:33.041
you''ll need to use your
remote control signal receiver

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:36.166
to pick up signals
from your Xfinity remote.

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.125
Just plug the remote control
signal receiver

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:42.875
into the R In port on the back
of your digital adapter.

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:46.625
Now place your digital adapter
in a more discreet location.

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:49.875
Use the adhesive fasteners
to keep it secure.

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:52.500
Next, place the remote control
signal receiver

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.500
in a clear line of sight
in the front of your TV

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.583
and test it to make sure
the signal receiver

00:04:57.583 --> 00:04:59.999
is picking up
your remote signal.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.083
Now you''re ready to enjoy
all the entertainment you love.

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:07.999
