00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.680
Hello, this is XboxAhoy and this is the tenth
episode of my Black Ops 2 Attachment Guide.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.060
In this episode we're covering Long Barrel.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.720
Analogous to Modern Warfare 3's range proficiency,
as an attachment Long Barrel is otherwise

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.660
a new addition to the Call of Duty series.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.510
In real life, a longer barrel does have some
ballistic effect: with the bullet spending

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.300
longer in the barrel, there is more time for
the expanding gases behind to impart additional

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.250
kinetic energy, and so a longer barrel can
yield a faster muzzle velocity.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.409
Of course, this is only effective up to a
certain point - and is calibre and cartridge

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.010
dependent: an excessively long barrel would
do more harm than good.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.720
In-game, Long Barrel is available for the
SMGs, shotguns, and the pistols.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.160
It is unavailable for the LMGs, assault rifles,
sniper rifles, special weapons - and the launchers.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.080
Long Barrel is compatible with most other
attachments, with the exception of the suppressor:

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.170
as Long Barrel and the Suppressor antagonise
each other's effects.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.750
Long Barrel's effect is relatively simple,
and the same across the board: it will increase

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.120
your weapon's range by 16 percent.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.160
This won't affect the number of shots needed
to kill up close or at an extreme range - but

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.070
will extend your reach with the weapon: increasing
the zone where you'll do maximum damage, and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.060
the distance at which damage drops to the
minimum.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.730
Long barrel is a universally beneficial attachment
that will extend your weapon's reach and often

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.380
result in fewer bullets needed to kill.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.810
As a result, it's ideal for weapons with a
slower fire rate, as these tend to be more

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.700
damage-focussed, reliant on stopping power
over volume of fire.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.700
At the extreme end, the pump action shotguns
such as the Remington and KSG benefit greatly

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.930
from the enhanced grasp: such weapons are
heavily reliant on a one hit kill, and as

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.680
such Long Barrel with often make a critical
difference.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.480
The attachment is much less useful on weapons
with a higher rate of fire, or lower differential

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.100
between their maximum and minimum damage:
weapons such as the KAP-40, Skorpion EVO,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.500
MP7 or Vector K10 are arguably just as able
without the attachment thanks to their elevated

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500
output.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.510
Of course, Long Barrel has no downsides, so
it's never a bad choice - but often there

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.370
are more useful options for these weapons.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.470
Still, it's always an option worth considering.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.840
Just remember: it's not the size of your barrel...

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.080
...it's what you do with it that counts.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.530
Thanks for watching, this has been XboxAhoy.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.550
Join me for the next attachment guide, when
I'll be covering Fast Mags.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.010
Until then, farewell.
