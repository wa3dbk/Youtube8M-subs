Hi, I'm Jay from Real Street Performance. Today, we're going to talk about correctly diagnosing your smoking turbo. "Oh look at that."

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.549
Often people misdiagnose a smoking turbocharger as having blown seals.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.639
The seal isn't a conventional seal like you would think. It's a small ring. Looks a lot like a piston ring.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.969
And it's located by the bearing system of the turbocharger. As long as the bearing system of the turbocharger is

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.419
locating the shaft of the turbo, the seal doesn't leak.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.620
Before you jump to conclusions and think that your turbo seals are bad,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.620
there's a few things that you need to look at: the oil feed,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.829
the oil drain, and the orientation of the

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.679
turbocharger in relation to the running oil level of the engine. The oil feeds job is to supply oil to the

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.749
turbocharger to keep it lubricated and cool. As a general rule on most small and mid frame

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.659
turbochargers, we use a - 3 feed here at Real Street.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.069
Assuming that you're oiling system of your engine is working properly, this will be just fine.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.989
The oil drain is important because if the oil cannot drain out of the turbo fast enough,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.040
it will fill the cartridge and then start to pressurize past the seals.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.269
So you need to have the correct sized drain. We generally use a - 10 line. And the drain needs to have a clear,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700
unrestricted path back to the engine.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.419
The best way to visualize that the turbo's orientation to the engine is correct,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.650
is that the oil can fall through the bearing housing back into the oil pan without restriction in the most vertical path possible.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.150
Some applications

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.539
don't loan themselves to a vertical turbo drain. If you have a rear mount turbo, a low mount turbo, or you sport front wheel drive

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.559
Honda guys, you could incur a situation where you must use a scavenge pump.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.320
Not to go to detail about the scavenge pump,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.199
but its role is to pull the oil from the turbocharger and push it back into the engine because there isn't a vertical drain available.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:08.159
To try to drive the point home, the oil feed faces up. The oil drain faces down.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.219
Only Gravity is going to return the oil back to the engine. So the drain path needs to be as vertical as possible.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.359
So in a turbocharged application, make sure you're venting the valve cover enough that you're not

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.440
accumulating crankcase pressure.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.029
Once the crankcase is pressurized, the oil cannot drain freely out of the housing. You can vent the crankcase through the valve cover. Generally

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.730
we use two - 10 lines headed to a catch can.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.609
Thanks for your time today. I appreciate you tuning in and watching these tech tips.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.680
I'll see you on Facebook or YouTube. Have a good week.
