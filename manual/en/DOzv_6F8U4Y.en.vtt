00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.800
Isla Sorna.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.209
Costa Rica lay to the east, a quiet neighbor,
to the west open water, and the

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.340
shipping lanes of the Pacific.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.290
1981.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.950
I stumbled out of the helicopter, already
beginning to sweat and looked around at the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.699
lush forest, the wet leaves.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:44.120
A forest this wild, this unknown has not been
seen by any human

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.089
since the great hunters of the early Pliocene.

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:59.059
The forest smelled of wet leaves, damp earth,
rotting wood.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.450
Cameras and seismic instruments in yellow
crates; they set them in the dust as

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.260
the helicopter rose.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:20.030
A few weeks after we landed, we went to the
summit to put up a crude

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.320
satellite link.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.090
We went by helicopter.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.100
Young technicians scrambled to set up the
dish as the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.159
wind howled.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:38.560
High speed uplink – state of the art.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.810
In May the rains came, the smell of the jungle
was everywhere.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.140
The jungle canopy hung over
us, there was an utter silence.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.229
Far away I could hear a jeep engine idling.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.560
InGen standard
safari vehicle – state of the art.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.750
As I journeyed south along the coast, the
air grew moist and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.750
heavy.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:24.420
Metal and concrete lay rotting in the sun
and the rain.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.800
A failed coffee plantation of the 1860s.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.190
Fields were marked out by stone walls, and
to the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.880
west, the ruins of the plantation house still
stand.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.410
The buildings followed a scheme I only
vaguely understood, marking seasons in the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:58.281
lunar year, and the movement of the stars.

00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:05.690
The sky at noon was like nothing in Europe;
hot, tropical, a new world.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:14.600
On the plain the heat
was extraordinary, like a solid wall.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.880
I stepped out of the jeep and stretched my
legs.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.950
The two
guards attended to the wheel and just for

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.940
an instant I stood alone, unprotected in the
Jurassic

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.940
wilderness.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.640
I felt the air currents around me, heard a
single tree rustle.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.731
I stood on the lip of the
cliff, the wind blowing my hair.

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:43.570
It might have been a morning in the early
Jurassic.
