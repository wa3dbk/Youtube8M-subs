00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:02.250
Hello. Welcome.

00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:06.250
ALLOTMENT ON YOUR DOORSTEP

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:09.291
My name's Eline Dias, I'm an
economist and am married to Felipe.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.792
I'm Felipe, Production Engineer.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.959
We live here in Gávea,
Rio de Janeiro,

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:17.166
in a 70 m² apartment
and yet have an allotment

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.041
with pumpkins, lettuce...

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:21.583
Watercress, tomatoes,
three kinds of lettuce...

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.083
-Cauliflower...
-Onions...

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.125
Carrots...

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.792
-Potatoes...
-Cherry tomatoes...

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:28.834
THAT HUGE ALLOTMENT?

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:32.125
IN AN APARTMENT?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.000
It isn't here.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:38.417
Our allotment is actually
on the hillside, where we share

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:41.458
a beautiful plot of land
with other Organic Club members.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:46.125
The Organic Club
is a project whose purpose

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.834
is to increase people's access
to organic foodstuff

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.500
through a model that is fairer
to the producer

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.792
and more sustainable
for the planet as a whole.

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:57.750
By joining the Organic Club,
you become an associate

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.458
and are given access
to a collective garden plot

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.000
that is located
on a land owned by market gardeners.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:07.583
In fact, you are paying
a market gardener to plant for you.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.083
I work on the land and enjoy planting

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.667
and taking care of the plants.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:15.959
It's better like this as the plants
turn out really green.

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:19.417
There is no contamination from
pesticides or anything like that.

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:24.291
You are financing the life of this man
and receive a part of the production,

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:28.417
which varies between 12 and 15 items
per week.

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:35.000
It's as if the plot was ours,
members can visit,

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:40.250
we get to know the producer, see how
things work and this creates trust.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:44.625
Apart from being visually
attractive, the taste is sensational.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:46.583
Eating organic foodstuff is different.

00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:49.291
Bye-bye, now!

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:52.834
