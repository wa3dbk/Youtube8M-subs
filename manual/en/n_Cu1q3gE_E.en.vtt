00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
(DOG WHIMPERS)

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.140
What's up boy? Scout has this amazing talent.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.170
He can actually sense when my tires are low.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.200
But, you don't need Scout, many cars now come with TPMS

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.920
or Tire Pressure Monitoring System.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.180
(MUSIC)

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.600
TPMS with it's little symbol is a big deal,

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.239
so much so that it's been required on every
new car since 2008.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.480
Just consider at any given moment there are
53 million tires rolling down the road.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.110
If a tiny percentage of those tires are over
inflated or under inflated,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.489
there is big potential for problems.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.950
What you need to know is what to do
when this light comes on your dash.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.390
First, it's probably NOT an emergency.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.220
So when it's safe, check your tire pressure.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.880
Hey, thanks buddy.  Thanks a lot.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.020
Here is how TPMS works:

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.620
The most common type is this little device,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.909
a wireless, battery operated sensor located
inside each tire.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.159
They usually last about 10 years.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.280
It measures tire pressure and sends a signal
to your dash when a single tire is over or

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.439
under inflated, usually by 25% or more.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.229
A few things to know about tire pressure:

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.590
Tire pressure will often rise and fall when
outside temperatures change drastically, more

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.330
often related to cold weather.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.049
If your TPMS light comes on and you know your
tires are properly inflated, visit your mechanic.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.950
Tires naturally lose pressure over time.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.720
Some TPMS versions show each tire and it's
current inflation.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.300
It looks like the left front tire is low.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.640
Hey, thanks buddy.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.119
Every year, 11,000 crashes are caused by problems
with tires.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.439
You can't tell by looking if a tire is under
inflated until it's 50-percent low.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.939
Wow, waiting can be dangerous.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.970
TPMS, tire pressure monitoring system.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.299
Don't panic, but don't ignore it either.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.490
TPMS can help prevent flat tires,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.190
but proper tire inflation also improves handling,
gas mileage and even extend the life of your tires.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.700
Remember, for quick tire information, check
your owner's manual or the inside of the driver's door.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.459
YOU are your car's best safety feature.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.000
Know More, Drive Safer, visit My Car Does
What Dot Org.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.530
Lots of great, easy to use information. So check
it out. Hey...

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.319
Oh yes, besides being able to sense tire pressure,

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.410
Scout has this not-so-extraordinary talent
of being able to know exactly what's in my pocket.  You are a good boy.
