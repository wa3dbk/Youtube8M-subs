00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.250
So loaded up with a freshly caught seafood
banquet, we head back to cook up some tucker.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.350
Chuck these on a fire somewhere hey?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.540
I start the fire the traditional way.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.920
The hardest part about making fire, is getting
enough breath after you have been drilling

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.750
it, to blow on it. We will make a little fire
here to get that fish cooked hey? How we going

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.840
to cook her up, boys?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.740
Just chuck them on the fire.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.460
Nothing fancy, just chuck her on the coals
hey? Generally when you cook the fish like

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.780
that, the meat stays a lot more moist, cos
it’s cooking in it’s own juices. All I

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.720
am going to do now is take them off the coals,
and stick them over here on a bed of leaves,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.380
bit of salt and pepper, tastes great. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.580
That is the secret to cooking on the open fire

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:18.080
like that, is too keep the scales on, skin
scales everything on, you just peel that off,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.940
and what is left is that beautiful cooked
flesh, straight from there into the coals.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.370
Nothing better.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.970
Richard leads us to look at some amazing Kimberley
rock art, left by his ancestors.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.420
This fella up here.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.080
This one?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.889
Yeah, the Wanjina.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.560
Ah that’s a Wanjina?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:58.600
It’s the rain maker, should have a serpent
with him, fresh water serpent. That serpent,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.670
look after the water hole. When he makes the
rain, the serpent has got to be there to,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.560
make sure the water going to be there all
year round.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.390
In the dry season?

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.900
Yeah in the dry season.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.780
That is why they would have painted it. So
your ancestors?

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.140
The spirit, still lives with us.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.460
You don’t know how old?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.200
No.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.500
That on there maybe, is that the head of the
serpent? Do you think?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.500
Which one is down at the bottom over here?

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.379
The wanjina, the mouth less face, with large
round eyes, is the protector of the water

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.489
hole, so when you see one it usually means
there is water near by. And of course water

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.530
gives life.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.769
So you live in Kalumburu, when you come out
here, cos it’s really hard to get to here,

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.599
unless you got big helicopter, how do you
feel when you come back to your country here?

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:19.559
Oh when I come back here? I look at all this,
I feel free. I feel happy inside. I feel light.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.551
Awesome.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.340
This region is fascinating because you have
got the Wanjina art, that dates back 4,000

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.360
years, as well as the stuff from what is called
the "clawed hand period", which can be 10,000

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.010
years or more. It’s the only place in Australia
where the 2 sit side-by-side, so this cave

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.050
has got so much history.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.590
So they're painting on the wall what they hunt.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.370
Yeah what they live on.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.300
What's one of the main fish they would have
caught through here, do you reckon? It’s obviously

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.430
spearing them.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.180
Plenty of mullet.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.340
Mullet yeah. That looks a bit mullet-y doesn’t
it. Yeah mullet would be easy to spear. We

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.769
saw heaps of those today didn’t we?

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:15.769
Heaps of mullet, queen fish. Thank you very
much, Richard, for showing us, me and Simon

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.920
and obviously the people of Australia as well.
Your homeland, and giving us the privilege

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:34.529
to be here with you. Look it’s a really
big thing for us. Because we don’t get to

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.069
come into this sort of country without your
permission, and I am glad that you give us

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:44.809
permission, come with us and help us to get
in here. It’s good, it’s a really good place.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.759
So we leave feeling grateful and also good
that we could bring Richard to this sacred

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.499
spot. It’s obviously affected him in a positive
way.
