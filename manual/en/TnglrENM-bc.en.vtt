00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.420
So we're going to go over some shoes you might
want for rock climbing. These are all technical

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.590
shoes over here. But you've got these which
are called approach shoes which you're not

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.220
going to use for the technical rock climbing.
But they're good if the approach, the hike

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.740
up to the climb is steep or slick. Often these
will actually have sticky rubber like the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.230
rest of the shoes we're going to go over and
they're basically just light hiking shoes

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.369
you can use to just get where you're going
more safely. So in the climbing world, there's

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.820
three basic types of shoes. The first one
here is lace up shoes. Now with any climbing

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.910
shoe, you've got the sole of the shoe is with
sticky rubber which is rubber that's been

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.520
formulated to have a higher friction coefficient
on the rock. Which basically means, it's going

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.320
to stick to rock better than your average
shoe sole. So the thing with the lace ups

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.309
is that when you put your foot in, you can
dial up the fit. You can dial in the fit.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.969
You can tie them as tight or as loose as you
want and in general with climbing shoes, you

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.950
want them tighter than any other shoe you're
ever going to wear. You want to think of them

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.580
like a second skin. So if you're just starting
out, lace up shoes are a good idea. Because

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.280
even if you get them too big the first time,
you can always lace them up tighter and they'll

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.200
work in the long run. Now we can move over
to a kind of a step up in performance often

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.740
is the Velcro shoe. For those of us too lazy
to untie our shoes after every climb, these

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.240
are a great compromise. Often they're a lot
more aggressive. Which means they're turned

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.520
in. When you put your toe in the shoe, it's
going to curl up in there and you're going

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.780
to be able to toe down on rock a lot better.
You're going to be able to, it gives you a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.131
much more concentrated power point to stand
on the rock. Same with the lace up shoes,

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:52.189
the Velcro shoes can be tightened or loosened.
Not quite as customizable, but often you get

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.070
them tight enough that you almost don't need
to Velcro them at all anyway. Now often the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.000
ultimate in performance is the slipper. People
get these so tight that it's extremely difficult

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.399
to get them on your foot. The nice thing about
these is there's no tying. There's nothing

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.739
to come undone. Once they're on, they're on.
So these are just like the other ones. They're

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.799
often very aggressive. Some shoes you'll see
with actually come out of the box like this

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.180
and you can imagine what that does to your
foot. But it's great for performance and these

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.079
are great shoes. I'll often use them for indoor
climbing or for bouldering, which is lower

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.519
climbing without a rope. All these shoes will
work. If you are just starting out though,

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.749
I do just recommend the lace up shoes because
in the long run, those are going to be the

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.019
easiest and the most versatile.
