00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:10.916
Norman McLaren, the great 20th century pioneer of animation technique,

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:13.793
once said, "Animation is not the art of drawings that move,

00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:15.854
but the art of movements that are drawn.

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:18.213
What happens between each frame is more important

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:20.423
than what exists on each frame."

00:00:20.423 --> 00:00:22.520
What did he mean?

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.352
Well, for an object to appear in motion,

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:27.354
it necessarily has to change in position over time.

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:29.643
If time passes and no change in position occurs,

00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:32.352
the object will appear to be still.

00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:34.398
This relationship between the passage of time

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:36.854
and the amount of change that occurs in that time

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:39.520
is at the heart of every time-based art form,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.187
be it music, dance, or motion pictures.

00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:45.159
Manipulating the speed and amount of change

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.353
between the frames is the secret alchemy

00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:51.271
that gives animation the ability to convey the illusion of life.

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:53.293
In animation, there are two fundamental principles

00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:54.936
we use to do this:

00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:57.461
timing and spacing.

00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.463
To illustrate the relationship between them,

00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:02.372
we'll use a timeless example: the bouncing ball.

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.534
One way to think about timing

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.686
is that it's the speed, or tempo,

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:08.639
at which an action takes place.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.140
We determine the speed of an action

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.602
by how many pictures, or frames, it takes to happen.

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:15.520
The more frames something takes to happen,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.187
the more time it spends on screen,

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:20.696
so the slower the action will be.

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:23.157
The fewer frames something takes to happen,

00:01:23.157 --> 00:01:25.490
the less screen time it takes,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.687
which gives us faster action.

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.045
The timing is about more than just speed,

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:32.913
it's also about rhythm.

00:01:32.913 --> 00:01:34.668
Like a drumbeat or melody only exists

00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:36.375
when a song is being played,

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:37.521
the timing of an action

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.545
only exists while it's happening.

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:41.047
You can describe it in words,

00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:44.966
say, something will take 6 frames, 18 frames, or so on.

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.604
But to really get a sense of it,

00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:47.793
you need to act it out

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:51.335
or experience it as it would happen in, well, real time.

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:52.641
Now, the timing of an action

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:54.436
all depends on the context of the scene

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:56.688
and what you're trying to communicate.

00:01:56.688 --> 00:01:59.441
What is doing the acting, and why?

00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:01.149
Let's take our example.

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.153
What makes a ball bounce?

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:04.404
The action we're talking about here

00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:07.169
is a result of interacting physical forces,

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.033
a moving ball's tendency to stay in motion,

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:10.701
or its force of momentum

00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.252
vs. the constant force of gravity

00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:13.996
bringing it back down Earth.

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:16.041
The degree to which these invisible forces apply,

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:18.208
and the reason why the ball behaves the way it does,

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:21.751
all depends on the physical properties of the ball.

00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:26.252
A golf ball is small, hard and light.

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:31.168
A rubber ball is small, soft and lighter.

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:35.501
A beach ball is large, soft and light.

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:39.857
And a bowling ball is large, hard and heavy.

00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:41.668
So, each ball behaves very differently,

00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:44.153
according to its properties.

00:02:44.153 --> 00:02:50.118
Let's get a sense of the visual rhythm of each.

00:02:50.118 --> 00:02:51.946
Each ball plays its own beat

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:53.120
and tells us something about itself

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:05.881
and the time it takes to travel across the screen.

00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:09.752
The visual rhythm of these hits is the timing.

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:11.418
Okay, let's start animating our ball,

00:03:11.418 --> 00:03:14.584
bouncing up and down with a simple cycle of drawings.

00:03:14.584 --> 00:03:16.167
We'll draw a circle here,

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:18.476
call it point A, our starting point.

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:22.084
We'll have it hit the ground here, point B.

00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:23.648
Let's say it takes about a second

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.985
to hit the ground and come back up again.

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:29.030
This is our timing.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.116
Our spacing is where we position the circle

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:33.918
in the frames between point A and point B.

00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:35.335
If we were to move our ball

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:36.417
in evenly-spaced increments,

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:38.502
we'd get something like this.

00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:41.668
It's not really telling us anything about itself.

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:44.880
Is it a bouncing ball or a circle on an elevator?

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.169
Let's look at our footage again

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.297
and think about what's going on

00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:50.218
as each ball bounces.

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:52.168
Following each impact with the ground,

00:03:52.168 --> 00:03:53.501
the ball's upward momentum

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.890
is eventually overcome by gravity.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.834
This happens at the peak of each arc.

00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.334
As things change direction,

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:01.104
the motion is slowest.

00:04:01.104 --> 00:04:03.146
We see here the successive positions of the ball

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:04.917
are close together.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:06.776
The ball then speeds up as it falls,

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:08.110
and is at its fastest

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.112
when it's approaching and hitting the ground.

00:04:10.112 --> 00:04:13.251
We can see here each position is further apart.

00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:14.993
The change in position between frames

00:04:14.993 --> 00:04:16.536
is the spacing.

00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:17.870
The smaller the change,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.497
the slower the action will appear.

00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:22.585
The greater the change,

00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:26.879
the faster it will appear.

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.381
For an action to decelerate,

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:33.265
each change in position must be less than the change before it.

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:35.648
Likewise, for an action to speed up, or accelerate,

00:04:35.648 --> 00:04:39.934
each successive change must be greater.

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:41.937
Let's change the mechanical spacing

00:04:41.937 --> 00:04:43.403
of our animated bounce

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:45.820
to reflect what we observed in the footage.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.960
Slow at the top, fast when it's hitting the ground.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.863
Simply by adjusting the spacing,

00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:54.564
we've succeeded in suggesting

00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:56.827
the forces of momentum and gravity at play

00:04:56.827 --> 00:05:00.151
and achieved a much more realistic motion.

00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:02.292
Same timing but different spacing

00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:06.377
gives us vastly different results.

00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:07.965
And in reality, as a ball bounces,

00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.005
the physics of gravity eventually defeat

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:12.549
the tendency of the ball to stay in motion.

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:14.376
You can see this here in the decreasing height

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:16.555
of each successive bounce.

00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:18.805
However, again, this decrease varies

00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:20.640
according to the properties of the ball.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.436
Even though these circles are the same size here,

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:25.686
they're each telling us a different story about themselves,

00:05:25.686 --> 00:05:30.152
purely in how they move.

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:31.902
The relationship between these principles

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:33.402
of timing and spacing

00:05:33.402 --> 00:05:35.324
can be applied in countless ways

00:05:35.324 --> 00:05:40.389
and used to animate all types of action:

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.874
a yo-yo,

00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:46.959
a punch,

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.587
a gentle tap,

00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:52.936
a push,

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:57.019
a saw,

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:03.019
the Sun traveling across the sky,

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:05.730
a pendulum.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.147
Animation is a time-based art form.

00:06:08.147 --> 00:06:09.980
It may incorporate the aesthetic elements

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.268
of other graphic arts,

00:06:11.268 --> 00:06:12.851
like illustration or painting,

00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:14.186
but what sets animation apart

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:16.018
is that, here, what you see

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:18.851
is less important that what you don't see.

00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:20.269
An object's superficial appearance

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.685
only tells us so much about itself.

00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:23.954
It's only when it's in motion

00:06:23.954 --> 00:06:27.954
that we really understand its nature.
