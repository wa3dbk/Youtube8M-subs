00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.883
first of all we must knw
 how right enter the trick

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.550
wich done in two steps

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.539
one...

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:29.294
...and two

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:35.144
first of all... while we will do b-twist

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.810
you must learn b-kick

00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:39.996
this is B-Kick

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.061
B-Kick is almost the same as B-Twist..

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:55.734
just B-Twist is done with 360 spin

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:57.436
we starts again with "enter"

00:00:57.774 --> 00:00:59.376
left leg..

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:00.959
right leg..

00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:04.758
and hands goes like that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.302

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.610
..spin..

00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:20.956
NO, bro ))

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:22.024
after B-Kick

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.069
we are going B-Twist

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:27.805
we should focus our attention on..

00:01:27.872 --> 00:01:29.474
how we bring our head

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:31.584
and how we fold our hands

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:34.420
so, lets begin as before..

00:01:34.798 --> 00:01:36.002
first step

00:01:36.703 --> 00:01:38.006
second step

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:41.963
this knee is slightly tilted

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:43.576
this knee is slightly tilted

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:45.482
and from here 

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:46.765
we move this hand

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:51.437
this hand is folded

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:52.424
and the same time

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:53.597
head goes down

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.626
not UP

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:56.795
so ,hand is folded
head goes down..
