LINDA BURCHELL: Hi, I'm Linda Burchell. I'm the manager of MDOT's Davison Transportation Service Center.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.610
I'm out at the M-25 over Harbor Beach Creek project that was completed this summer,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.750
just north of Harbor Beach in Huron County.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.820
This is a composite arch culvert system commonly referred to as a "bridge in a backpack"

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.650
that we used innovative technology funding to construct in 2012.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.980
The composite arch culvert system includes

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.950
a tube system that is inflated with a resin applied that are

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.430
connected in an arch formation over the previously installed substructure of the project.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.710
Once the tubes are in place, they are covered with a composite decking

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.660
which are then filled and covered by a concrete material.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.470
From there, the road section is constructed like a typical culvert section and open to traffic

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.680
sooner than a typical bridge construction can be.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.530
Part of the innovation relative to this type of construction

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.940
is the lack of use of steel, which is a benefit to long-term

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.030
maintenance for this project.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.210
With the tubes being filled with a self-consolidating concrete,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.900
they don't have steel in them which is corrosive and can deteriorate sooner than a concrete tube may be.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.650
This location was a little bit more tedious than other locations

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.320
because of the scar condition of the location,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
as well as the creek being unascew.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.520
Because of that, it required a more substantial substructure design

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.080
than typically may be required with this type of construction.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.880
As far as cost, this project was probably comparable to a typical one-span bridge construction.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.970
But with the innovations, contractors are not familiar with this type of construction

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.220
or the technology. It is presumed that the cost of this type of construction may be reduced.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.110
The contractor on this project was Milbocker and Sons.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.450
We had assistance through Advanced Infrastructure Technologies,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.710
which is the owner of this technology.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.660
I'd like to give a special thanks to the Federal Highway Administration

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.860
for their partnering through the development of this project, as well.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.910
In wrap-up, I'd like to thank Harbor Beach for their cooperation and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.780
understanding during our construction season,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.740
and I'm glad to be able to deliver such a nice structure for them.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.740
