CASEY CORMIER: Another rhythmic phenomenon
you might come across in your reading would

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:14.539
be a triplet. You might have seen these before.
Basically, three notes connected with a slash

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.670
and then a 3 written underneath, and you might
be like when you had seen it before but kind

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.210
of confused, but now will kind of explain
what that means. So if we look here, here's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.210
an example of an eighth note triplet. See,
we have three notes connected above as eighth

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.460
notes would be, but usually we would have
maybe four or two. Now it has 3 and we to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.610
put that 3 underneath to signify. This basically
takes up one beat, the three notes in one

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.190
beat, but within a measure where we are in
quarter notes, four quarter notes, so this

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:59.870
rhythm would sound [HUMS AND PLAYS RHYTHM],
but the way you're kinda--or maybe you would

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.009
even count it as one-two-three, one-two-three,
two, one-two-three, four, one-two-three, two-two-three,

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.540
three-two-three if they were all triplets.
Eighth note triplets are a little bit easier

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.869
to understand 'cause you can feel them as
being one beat. More difficult are the quarter

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.999
note triplets. Three quarter notes connected
as triplets take up the space of two regular

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:33.119
quarter notes. So this is almost serves a
function of metric modulation we would call

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.090
it, where you feel when you play this, like
you were playing in a different tempo. So

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.049
if we've played, pretending this measure right
here was all just quarter notes, one, two,

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:59.109
three, four then [HUMS RHYTHM], one, two,
one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.359
one, two. It is very difficult to hear it.
Sometimes you have to have a metronome to

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:18.730
help you out. So let us [TURNS METRONOME ON]
one-two-three, one-two-three, one-two-three,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.690
one, two, three, four, one-two-three. So you'll
notice, quarter note triplets are rare but

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.640
they're used to make that you feel like you
are out of time when you play.
