00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is already in the process of cooking...well, we are going to turn it over.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here, of course, everything depends on what we have.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here we are doing everything with all of the luxuries to start, right?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If we have more fat, you can put a little more on the other side when you flip it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Fat, oil, flour...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Because little by little it absorbs and evaporates...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
...so you can add a little.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The fat can also be taken out from anywhere.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If we have other ingredients, they can be improvised.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Take it out of a sausage, a salami, or a chorizo.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
As we can see, it rose, the dough rose a bit.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The good thing is making them a certain size [width], that serves also to fill them with something.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
At the same time, it can also be used to dry something...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
...to heat the water for yerba mate or something else.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It is not an issue of having the fire just to cook, but of course also to heat ourselves.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If we have, like in this case, a fire that gives air from above, it is better.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In the worst of the cases, if we see it burning out, we can do this [put it directly over the fire]...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
...but of course, we run the risk that it falls with something improvised like this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
