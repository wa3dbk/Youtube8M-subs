hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.019
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.119
Today I'm going to show you a cabbage dish which has fine influence of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:18.840
Mughlai.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.699
We're going to make cabbage kofta in a nice yogurt sauce. To make this cabbage

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.410
dish first what we need to do is;  we need to half cook the cabbage because you want

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
the cabbage to be soft that you can
convert into nice koftas.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.510
So to make it soft we're going to slightly  boil it. I've taken a small pan

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.399
add little bit water and then add finely chopped cabbage;  look at this how

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.750
finely I chopped them

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.940
I also boiled some channa dal, you should see this channa dal is almost seventy

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.940
percent cooked, so I'm going to add this also and cover it, so now let this both

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.379
steam together and we're going to let it
cook for the keys to five minutes then

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.890
the cabbage is very soft and this channa dal also is good

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.939
you want this cabbage and channa dal to be very well-cooked especially the cabbage

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.640
because it is not well done

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.970
you know when you make into koftas and fry, the koftas can break

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.330
so you want this cabbage to be very soft and cooked and then we're going to squeeze

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.979
all the water before we convert them beautiful koftas , add these

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.840
vegetables inside a muslin cloth and then you know we're going to squeeze out

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.710
the water

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.930
I've got one more tray underneath this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.650
now I squeezed out all the water;  don't
throw away this water

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.610
we're going to save this and use it in
the sauce and here I've got my cabbage

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.079
and channa dal

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.460
you know we're going to make nice koftas with this; add pinch of shahi jeera that is black

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.229
cumin, add a little bit of green chilli, salt a little bit of chili powder, pinch

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.000
of besan

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.259
that is gram flour;  this will act as a
binding and then just mix up everything

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.119
now you can see that this mixture is become like a dough

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.300
so now make it into small balls, these
balls are going to fry and use as koftas.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.080
If you have noticed I have used very little
dal, i used almost half a cabbage but

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.150
around three teaspoons of four channa dal now these koftas are ready

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.260
just put it into oil; do not fry it at a hot flame, use very slow flame so that these

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.200
koftas will get nicely cooked when you fry them

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.230
ok ok

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.370
do not mix this until unless you get nice little bit brown color

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.849
otherwise they will break very easily and then when the koftas are ready

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.360
just remove them

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.370
now let's make this gravy for this koftas; add little bit of oil, add

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.160
shahi jeera little bit and then add some
onions

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.380
and some salt

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.000
you know for this preparation you want
this onion to be slightly brown and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.570
then we're going to add some yogurt and
all the spices and make a nice yogurt

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:38.030
sauce. Add little bit of turmeric and half a teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:46.670
when the ginger garlic paste is nicely cooked, add this water that we squeezed out

00:03:46.670 --> 00:04:02.990
from the cabbage and channa dal; add chilli powder, add coriander powder and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:12.260
little bit of cumin powder and take some
yogurt mix it well and then add to this

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.630
and this is going to become a nice gravy

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.130
all we need to do is bring it to a nice
boil you know add seasoning and then

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.020
when the sauce looks right

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.720
if you want to add a little thickening I have little bit cashew nut powder

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.960
we're going to add in the last and then
you're going to add the koftas. See, you

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.430
can see little bit froth

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.150
even this froth will disappear that's when
you know this nice gravy is cooked

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.250
ok now i'm going to add some cashew nut powder, all I did is took some fried cashew

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.510
nuts made it to fine powder and then we're going to add this into this see

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.540
what this is going to do is going to
thicken the sauce

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.060
now if you notice the sauce is very watery but this cashew nut powder is

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.040
going to thicken the sauce really nice

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.030
now this sauce is slightly thickened and it
got a nice saucy consistency

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.940
all I'm going to do is add some mint powder you know if you have a little bit mint

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.400
just dry it up and you can use for such kind of preparations so instead of

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.419
kasuri methi we are adding mint to this dish

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.880
bring the sauce to a very nice consistency

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.460
not thick slightly thinner because once we add koftas also this sauce can get

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:44.780
thicker. So this sauce is all ready, so i'm going to add the koftas and do not mix

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.110
it too much just make sure that this koftas

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:56.450
soak in this sauce and reduce the flame
and the finish it off with some

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.770
coriander leaf

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.770
you know this sauce is ready let me try
this

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.060
this koftas literally melt in the mouth.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.110
wow..what a gravy,  what a taste, what flavors; nice mint, channa dal, the

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.860

there are so many nice flavors in this; when you try, you will have a very

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.740
pleasant surprise that the cabbage and
little channa dal can make a dish so tasty

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.630
