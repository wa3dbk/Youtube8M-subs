Hello, my name is Maya, I live in Adda on
Ffridd. I'm going to give you a little tour

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.090
around the site so you can have a little bit
of knowledge about where you might be staying.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.270
On this halls site, you get a shop so you
can buy any basics. There's a common room

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.690
right next to the shop. There's an onsite
bar called Bar Uno. The gym is accessible

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.250
to all students as well as the public. Washing
your clothes - there are no washing machines

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.980
inside the halls but there are laundrettes
on site. The security building is open 24/7

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.940
so if you need any help you can go to security.
Any time you have any problem, you can just

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.530
pop over there. Halls are always kitted out
for your personal interests so in the summer

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.570
time if you wanted a BBQ, they actually have
inbuilt BBQs for you. Bins for your disposal

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.700
as well so that's all good. Benches so that
you can study outside if you wanted to or

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.270
revise. If you wanted to bring your bike back
to halls also, there are covered bike shacks

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:23.770
as well as open ones. There are a few car
parks with these halls. So for these halls,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.299
you will not be given a standard key, you
will be given a key card. This will then become

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.509
your life! forget this and you cannot enter
your flat or your bedroom. The only people

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.549
with access to your halls is you and your
flat mates. But they can't get into your bedroom.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.459
Their keycards are actually different to yours.
The only pople who can get in your flat is

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:54.170
maintenance people, the bin man, the cleaner
and your warden. I'll just go and show you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.310
my flat. So, to each flat there are 8 people
living, so that's 8 people sharing

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.020
a kitchen. The rent covers pretty much
everything it's all inclusive so it covers

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:17.310
your heating, the water, electricity and wifi.
You get a microwave and two kettles, a toaster.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.799
You're aloud to bring your own electrical
equipment only if it's been tested. Cleaners

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:32.819
will come and clean your kitchen...but that's
the kitchen only. Your bedroom is your  own responsibility.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.340
They will not wash your dishes I'm afraid
either! You will have to bring your own pots,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.620
pans, plates, knives, forks, tea towels, kitchen towels
and everything like that you will need to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.189
bring yourself but there is no need to bring
any additional toasters or kettles. So the

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:58.760
rooms are quite big. This is only the standard
size room. You can also apply for a large

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.099
room and that just costs a little bit more
than the standard. In your room, you get a

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:13.140
standard single bed, desk, chair, three drawers,
heating, and you have plenty of plug sockets

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.689
and a double wardrobe. This halls is also
en-suite. You have shelving space as well

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:29.230
and a notice board. There's storage underneath
the bed also so if you wanted to have lots

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.280
and lots of shoes or extra clothes...it's
nearly the full length of the bed so you have

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.180
plenty of room to put your stuff in. So you
have to buy your own bedding, that is your

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.640
duvet, if you want a mattress topper, cushions,
pillows, towels, and the main one for your

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.819
bathroom is a bath mat ( a lot of people forgot
bath mats!), extra bin for the bathroom if

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.340
want and a toilet brush. So your en-suite
bathroom is actually quite big for an en-suite

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.930
and you'll be given a sink, toilet and a shower.
It's also a wet room so you can splash about

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.530
if you want, but not too much cos it will
leak through your door and on to your carpet

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.120
and that's not a good thing! So that's it
for your tour around Ffridd, I hope you enjoyed

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.070
it...and hopefully see you next year! Bye!
