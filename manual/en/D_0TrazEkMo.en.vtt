Welcome to TV Repair Made Easy, brought to
you by ShopJimmy.com.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.350
Visit www.shopjimmy.com to search the hundreds
of thousands of TV parts in our inventory.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.820
The power supply takes in and distributes
power throughout the TV.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.740
Part numbers beginning with 49 are followed
by 8 numbers.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.770
These part numbers are found printed at the
bottom of the barcode label, next to P/N,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.050
which is short for part number.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.600
Part numbers beginning with 55 and 56 are
followed by a dot, 5 characters, another dot,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.770
and 3 more characters.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.330
These part numbers are printed at the top
of the barcode label and can be printed with

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.510
or without decimals.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.540
Searching with or without special characters,
such as decimals on ShopJimmy.com, will still

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.190
return relevant search results.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:18.700
Part numbers beginning with 27 are followed
by a dash, the letter D, and 6 characters.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.920
Search your part number on ShopJimmy.com to
find a compatible replacement.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:31.090
Typically, your part number will match the
ShopJimmy Item Number.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.189
If searching your part number directs you
to items that have slightly different part

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.520
numbers, take a look at the product details
to confirm that your part number is in the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.179
Substitute Parts field.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.409
As long as your part number is found in the
Substitute Parts field, this item will be

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.070
a compatible substitute and will work in your
TV.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.219
If your part number is out of stock, be sure
to check the Substitute Parts field on the

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.810
product page for compatible replacements.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.969
These substitutes are guaranteed to replace
your original board, even if the part numbers

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.869
on the board do not match.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.310
