00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.220
i think it came as something of a shock

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.880
two southerners to realize that their institution
had not only been abolished but discredited

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.299
in the eyes of the world

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.329
and if that institution was discredited in
the eyes of the world

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.939
%uh then the confederacy itself

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.130
%uh would be discredited in the eyes of history

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.789
so it became a psychological necessity i think
for them to deny that the war was about slavery

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.900
that they were fighting for the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.690
preservation

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.630
%uh defense perpetuation

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.670
of that institution

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.940
and so they developed a a series of alternative
explanations

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.240
%uh for their

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.460
their raison d'tre

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.340
their reason for existence and states rights
became one of those

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.130
a kind of cultural nationalism

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.510
%uh

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.880
became %uh explanation for the south
was different

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.480
%uh it ought to have the right to govern itself

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.970
%uh and that they had fought for this right
of self government

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.080
and the desire to create a new kind
of %uh nationalism

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.950
in the twentieth century which was furthered
by the spanish-american war in eighteen ninety

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.460
eight when

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.880
actually two

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.040
former confederate generals one of them the
nephew of robert e lee became generals in

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.860
the united states army

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.970
%um it was furthered by world war one

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.890
%uh it was furthered by such movies as birth
of a nation in nineteen fifteen

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.820
where a southern director presenting a southern
point of view in this film nevertheless portrayed

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.280
lincoln as a hero and as the civil war as
the real birth of this new united northern

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.770
and southern nation

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.100
%uh so i think that that was the principal
reason

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.140
%uh why

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.390
through the last decade or so of the nineteenth
century and probably much of the first half

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.229
of the twentieth century you get this %uh

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.850
kind of consensus among northern and southern
historians

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.769
%uh that this was a noble moment in american
history and let's just forget about these

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.189
issues that might continue to divide us today

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.299
and %uh look at the positive parts of that
history

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.819
