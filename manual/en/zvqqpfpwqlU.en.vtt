00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:01.809
- We are camping.

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:06.667
(jaunty orchestral music)

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:11.990
- Good morning everyone.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.082
- Hi
- We're surrounded --

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:16.054
Hi, hi everybody, we're
going camping today.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:19.304
Hi everybody, what are we doing Parker?

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.196
Camping.

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:23.055
- Camping.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.158
- [Christopher] Camping.

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:25.400
- Yeah.
- [Christopher] Yeah.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.639
So there's -- look at
all the stuff in our car.

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:29.472
- Yeah.

00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:31.971
- We barely have room
for the children we have.

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:34.398
Today we're going camping,
we're super excited about it.

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:38.206
We are an hour late to the camp ground

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:39.181
and it takes an hour to get there

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:40.934
so we're gonna be at least two hours late.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:42.978
That's the plan and I think
we actually have to stop

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:44.429
at the store and pick up some of the food

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.512
that we're going to consume
whilst we're camping.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:51.419
- We are camping.

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:53.810
(excited calls)

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.699
Look at these guys setting up the tent.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.661
Jacob, what are you doing?

00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.088
- Setting up the tent.

00:01:02.088 --> 00:01:04.259
We need to watch out for bikes.

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.186
- [Jessica] Yeah, rogue bikes.

00:01:06.186 --> 00:01:09.170
- [Jacob] They're going down the hill.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.920
- [Jessica] They are.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.366
How are you doing?

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.199
- Camping.

00:01:20.605 --> 00:01:24.019
- [Jessica] Camping? You
got your camping helmet on?

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:25.171
- Yeah.
- [Jessica] Yeah.

00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:27.992
Keeping safe while camping?

00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:30.337
How were the strawberries?
- Good.

00:01:30.337 --> 00:01:32.729
- So this is Katie and
Crystal and we're camping

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.202
all together as families
and friends and its amazing.

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:36.223
- Woo

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:38.568
- Their husbands and kids are
all here and we're so excited.

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:39.892
- Lake Casitas, it's really fun.

00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:41.262
- Yeah.

00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:42.095
- [Crystal] Are you allowed to say where?

00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:43.132
- It's okay to say where we are.

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:44.356
- [Jessica] It's okay because
[Chrisptoher] We won't be here

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:45.631
- [Jessica] we're traveling,
- [Christopher] by the time

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.799
[Jessica] we don't live here.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.574
(cross talk and music drowns out Jessica)

00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:51.153
- If you put my name
in it then it's not --

00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:52.302
- And we live here.

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:53.324
- I live, my address is --

00:01:53.324 --> 00:01:54.473
(giggles)

00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:57.305
her phone number, her
personal number is --

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.360
it's not gonna happen, I'm new to this.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.531
- So, yeah, we're here visiting
Crystal, who lives here.

00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:05.025
- I live here, so come on over,
let me give you my number,

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:06.778
you can just text me anytime.

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:08.021
- Yeah
- Is that how is works,

00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:08.915
the vlogging? With the people?

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:10.401
- Yeah.
- You just invite them.

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.141
- Come on over.
- Great, that's how I roll.

00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:15.788
- This is our brand new tent,
it is a nine person tent,

00:02:15.788 --> 00:02:17.274
and there are five of us, so,

00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:19.712
we've got a little room to spare.

00:02:19.712 --> 00:02:21.244
Very spacious.

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:23.160
I'm filling up our air mattress right now.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.854
The kids air mattress is already set up.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.862
Ah, you guys are adorable.

00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:28.919
This is where Parker is going to sleep.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.846
That's Catherine, hi Catherine.

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:32.332
- This is where I'm gonna hug daddy.

00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:33.957
- [Christopher] This is Jacob,
hey, Bailey, I don't think

00:02:33.957 --> 00:02:36.477
we've shown them your camping outfits yet.

00:02:36.477 --> 00:02:41.469
This is what they thought would
be the best camping outfits.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.955
Very nice.

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:45.038
He is not going to sleep.

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.375
It's a little awkward.

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:53.343
(upbeat guitar music)

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:10.221
(music drowns out speech)

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.197
- [Christopher] Bailey,
look up at the sky,

00:03:14.197 --> 00:03:15.776
and tell me if you see a bat.

00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:18.331
Look, look where my hand
is, where my hand is.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.654
- Yeah.

00:03:19.654 --> 00:03:20.896
- That's a bat?
- [Christopher] Yeah,

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:22.766
you see the bats?

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:25.924
- Yeah.
- [Christopher] Pretty cool?

00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:27.886
- [Bailey] Bats.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:29.302
- [Jacob] No, that's a bird.

00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:30.660
- [Bailey] No, it's a bat.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.321
- [Christopher] It's a bat.

00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:33.818
- [Jacob] Is is?
- [Christopher] Yeah.

00:03:33.818 --> 00:03:34.968
- [Bailey] Bat.

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:36.373
- [Christopher] They're really nice bats.

00:03:36.373 --> 00:03:37.540
They eat bugs.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:42.352
Hi, lets talk about what we learned today.

00:03:42.352 --> 00:03:44.186
We learned that when you're camping,

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:45.928
it's important to be prepared.

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:47.425
(gentle guitar strumming)

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:50.792
Always pack your camping helmet,

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:51.709
for safety.

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:57.189
We learned there's gonna be a
big party at Crystal's house

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.106
and everyone's invited.

00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:04.144
And finally, I've just
got two words for you.

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.422
Camping swag.

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.185
Thanks for watching everybody.

00:04:11.528 --> 00:04:13.780
(giggles)

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.030
- Don't forget the noodles.

00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:20.455
(inaudible child talk)

00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:24.169
- Feathers are a nice touch.
