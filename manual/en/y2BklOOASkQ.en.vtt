00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.540
Hi, welcome to Ski Talk brought to you

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.620
by skis.com. I'm Kevin. Today I'm joined by K2 representative Joe Herzog.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.810
Thanks for having me, Kevin.
Sure.  We're going to give you a quick rundown

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.860
of an exciting new model from K2: the SideSeth.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.050
Joe, Seth is probably my all-time favorite skier. His skiing is really

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.140
evolved over the last couple years. He's been spending a lot of time in Europe,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.340
you know, more big mountain backcountry type terrain and this ski is an

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.390
evolution of his skiing, isn't it?
Absolutely, it is. It's a ski we've had in the line

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.580
for a while and it is a reflection of the way that he's changed style-wise.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.640
He's a great ambassador for the brand.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.810
A great ambassador for this particular model, I mean, this is his personal model. It's

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.870
built with his input so it's a direct reflection of what he's up to.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.050
Twenty years now with the K2 team. Pretty impressive.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.090
So, kick it off with Powder Rocker. 50% camber,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.270
50% rocker.
Yeah, exactly. It's got that blend that's going to work best

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.340
when you're in true, big mountain out-of-bounds conditions but then 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.530
when you're bringing it back, after all, you've got to access that type of terrain a lot of times

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.620
via the lift so we have to have a nice comfortable situation when we're on a groomed

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.820
situation. And that's definitely what this gives you.
Early season, you'll find Seth

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.880
shredding around Vail pretty commonly, right? And then

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.070
118mm waist and then we combine that, you know, that really makes a good

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.120
75% powder-type condition, 25% variable skiing.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.320
It's got that heft in waist width, okay, so it's going to support

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.370
out-of-bounds style skiing. Not too wide though.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.560
But then with that particular blend, you know that kind of thing,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.590
it really is a ski which transitions well into soft snow.
Nice.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.770
A unique feature of this ski is the powder tip.
Right, and that's really

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.860
what that's there for is to help with that transition.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.040
That little bit of thickening in the front of the forebody of the ski,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.130
that little fatter tip if you will, helps the ski float when you're in softer snow so

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.340
that you have a much easier time with it.
Nice. And then we've got a progressive sidecut

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.400
which has been on Seth's models for a couple years now.
Yeah, it's like

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.470
a K2 technology that we use on a lot of different models, that kind of thing. It's a simple blending of two

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.490
known different types of taper so that you get that perfect

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.690
blend on the ski so when you are using it in an all-mountain style

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.890
fashion, it's going to work well.
Nice. And then we go to a Hybritech

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.080
Sidewall Construction here.
Right. And Hybritech, after all, is all about,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.130
once again, giving you that one additional feature so that it's going

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.330
to perform better when it's in an all-mountain situation and, briefly, Hybritech

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.390
is where you have a little bit thicker, stiffer ski underfoot.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.440
We're talking about the sidewall after all. And then as it moves to the tail

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.620
it thins out, softens up, so that it initiates a turn or completes a turn

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.800
with greater ease.
For sure. So if you're a big mountain skier that likes to ski

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.860
backcountry, deep lines, whatever, definitely check out

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.050
the SideSeth from K2. I'm Kevin. This is Joe. Thanks for joining

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.070
us today on Ski Talk brought to you by skis.com.
