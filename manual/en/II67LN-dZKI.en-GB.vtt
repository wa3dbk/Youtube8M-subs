00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.160
Here's "Dont cry Eve" by the Polish rock band PERFECT

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.320
If you are Polish you definitely know the song!

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:37.356
The intro is played by 3 guitars

00:00:37.700 --> 00:01:07.880
This is what the first guitar plays A, F#m, E. All the chords played only on the top 4 strings

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.193
Here's the second guitar part

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:49.972
just two chords in the 9th position, they are actually the higher voicings of the chords played by first guitar

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.300
The third guitar plays a solo with some nice embellishements

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.740
I like to play together the first and second part

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.960
to create the feeling of 2 guitars playing at the same time

00:02:48.220 --> 00:03:05.940
So instead of playing part one and two seperately like this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:27.500
Here is how to connect them

00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:38.516
The key to it is the open top E string. You'd need some practice as at the same time I play a half barre on the 9th fret

00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:47.332
Without the open E it sounds like this

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.540
adding the open E on the top gives me this sound

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:23.980
F#m and again with the open top E

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:47.240
and now the E chord with the same voicings like A and F#m

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.860
Basic E chord in the 4th position

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.400
E sus7 ---&gt; resolving to E5

00:05:25.100 --> 00:06:00.240
I mostly pick with my right hand although for the E chord I need to use both the pick and my fingers, watch carefully

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.920
Good luck!
