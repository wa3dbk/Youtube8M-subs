Hey guys. Dr. Axe here.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.130
Today, I'm gonna be showing you how to stretch
out your IT bands and your glutes. And these

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.450
are two really common problem areas that a
lot of people—especially runners or people

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.720
that sit all day....

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.980
And a major issue if you have tight IT bands
and a tight...glute, like your piriformis

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.560
muscle, is knee pain. So if you have any type
of knee pain or hip pain whatsoever, it can

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.310
be caused from really tight IT bands and glutes.
And so these are stretches that can help.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.989
I'm also gonna show you how to use a foam
roller.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.250
You can just start out by stretching your
IT bands. You're gonna lean into a wall, cross

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.510
one foot over into another, and you're gonna
really just stretch into it.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.960
You should feel it in this entire hip area
right here—region—you're gonna lean into

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.370
it. You're gonna hold it for about 20 to 30
seconds.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.899
Come up. Then you're gonna do it a second
time. Lean into it like so. You're gonna move

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.140
your body this way, and you should feel it
in this entire hip region right here. We're

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.699
working the upper part. Stretching the upper
part of the IT band.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.899
The next thing we're gonna do is come over
and start stretching your glute. We're gonna

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.009
put one foot over your knee. You're gonna
lean back like this, and to really feel it,

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.109
you're gonna stick your butt out. Kinda tuck
those hips like so.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:22.179
And you're gonna really start feeling it in
this glute area. Come back up, stick it out.

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.810
And you're really gonna feel that stretching
there in that area. Next thing we're gonna

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.849
do is get down.

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.649
We're gonna actually...stretch your glutes
a little bit more. And so to stretch your

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.479
glutes, you're gonna get down like so, put
one foot over another, and just kinda lean

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.219
this way, stretching it.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.719
Another thing you could do is kinda hug it,
that leg, into your chest. Pulling it up like

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.499
so, feeling the stretching in the glutes.
And if you wanna target an area called your

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.639
piriformis....

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.959
If you've ever had sciatic pain or you're
feeling major glute tightness, you can actually

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.919
lean back on your back, cross your knee like
we did earlier, and start bringing this forward.

00:01:55.919 --> 00:02:00.999
And you're gonna feel that stretching in this
entire area. Again, grab right here and pull

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.630
forward.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.049
Now, this next exercise is used using a foam
roller. You can get a big foam roller. You

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.150
can find these easy on Amazon.com. Or, just
a small foam roller like so. You're gonna

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.700
start rolling out the IT bands as well as
the glute area.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.079
And to start really stretching this IT band,
you're gonna come on a form roller like so.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:28.079
And you're simply going to roll back and forth
like this, on one leg, all the way down.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.159
And by the way, this can be a little bit painful
at first. So at first, you may hold yourself

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.659
up a little bit more. As time goes on, you'll
drop down into it.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.950
And then you're really rolling out. And this
is gonna help in reducing the knee pain. The

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.290
other thing you're gonna do is come on top
here with your glute, this one leg out. All

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.730
pressure on this one side, and you're simply
gonna roll your glutes like this.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.260
By the way, a lot of times, tight glutes or
a tight low back—if you have low back pain—can

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.159
can also be attributed to hamstring tightness.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.849
You can also drop this down farther. And also,
really stretch out and roll out that hamstring

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:05.769
area.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.269
So again, if you can get a foam roller, again,
almost anywhere. Typically it costs anywhere

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.709
from ten to twenty dollars, you can really
roll out those areas.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.879
This is gonna help stretch..and reduce the
tension in your IT bands, reduce the tension

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:19.569
in your glutes.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.599
A few other nutrition tips: if you've got
a lot of tight muscles, make sure you stay

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.540
hydrated. Getting plenty of magnesium and
potassium in your diet...by getting more fruits

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.939
and vegetables is great.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.549
Coconut water and fruits loaded with potassium,
nuts and seeds and vegetables are full of

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.150
magnesium,
as well as organic meat products and wild

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.280
fish.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.769
Load up on those foods, do these exercises.
This is gonna help you eliminate knee pain.

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.180
It's gonna prevent injuries, help you stay
loose, younger, longer.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.849
Hey, I hope you've enjoyed this video on how
to stretch out your IT bands and glutes.
