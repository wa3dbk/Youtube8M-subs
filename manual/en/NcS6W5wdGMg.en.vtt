Hi, my name is Marlene Merritt and I’m the
owner of Merritt Acupuncture and we are a

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.330
full time Oriental medicine practice that’s
located in Austin, Texas. I have the privilege

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.769
of being able to work with my husband, Will
Mitchell, who is also a practitioner of Oriental

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.429
medicine here. And we have on staff here three
acupuncturists, we’re also full time herbalists

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.320
and we also have a massage therapist here.
As you can see we also have a full pharmacy

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.999
on site and we treat everything from cancer
to the common cold. I’m here to answer questions

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.980
about Oriental medicine, and if you have more
questions please visit us on our site which

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.480
is merrittacupuncture.com, and Merritt has
two R’s and two T’s. So a very popular

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.850
question is what is acupuncture and how does
it work. Well, acupuncture is based on a completely

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.440
different medical model than Western Medicine.
It’s based on an energetic model which means

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.390
that, for starters, the vocabulary tends to
be different which is why the two camps seem

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.690
to struggle a little bit when trying to speak
with each other. But Chinese medicine is based

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.870
on the understanding that energy should always
be moving freely throughout the body and that

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.739
when it gets stuck that’s when illness results.
And so illness will come up with different

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.580
symptoms and so when I’m talking to patients
about this it’s almost a given that when

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.490
people come in with something that they’ve
had it for almost ten years or if you’re

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.870
substantially older it might even be twenty.
The way Chinese medicine look at it is that

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.210
probably about ten years ago you had some
energetic shift that if you were a very skilled

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.520
acupuncturist you might be able to see that.
Like you probably wouldn’t have any physical

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.900
symptoms unless you’ve had this for awhile
and a few years go by and you might have some

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.340
symptoms that tend to be a little more fleeting.
You know, things that don’t register on

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.440
an x-ray is how I describe it. So you get
headaches, or you get a stomach pain when

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.760
you get stressed you know you have things
that aren’t measurable. So usually the way

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.870
medicine in Western Medicine, that’s not
something you deal with a whole lot, so people

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.010
just sort of hope that maybe it’ll go away
or that time will go on. They’ll end up

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.170
having more physical symptoms. They’ll wind
up with a herniated disc or they’ll end

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.210
up with an ulcer or they’ll end up with
a tumor. And that’s when they end up going

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.720
to see a doctor and this is you know what,
ten years later or something like that. And

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.879
the doctor, I always feel badly for them,
because they always end up working with something

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.379
and trying to shift something that’s now
much more physical and ten years ago it was

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.310
much more energetic and much easier to work
with. So we work with people in all areas

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.829
of that spectrum. We have people that come
in with something very physical and we help

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.910
them treat that as well as the root, which
started, you know whatever period of time

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.260
before. So being able to work with both of
those allows the person to get better for

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.430
the main reason that they are here as well
as being able to get healthy and then be able

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.079
to stay healthy which is really the focus
of Oriental medicine, being able to keep people

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.290
there. And that’s what we focus on.
