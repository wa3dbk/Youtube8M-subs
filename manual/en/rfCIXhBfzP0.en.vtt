00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.240
How to Get Iodine in Your Diet.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.790
Your body needs iodine for normal thyroid
gland function.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.049
If you've got thyroid issues or have a restricted
diet, there are many ways to get iodine into

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.049
your diet.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:24.580
You will need Balanced diet Iodized salt Seafood
Seaweed Milk Plants grown in iodine-rich soil

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.349
Soil testing kit Supplements Doctor Kelp tea
(optional) and kombucha (optional).

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.349
Step 1.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:37.710
Eat a balanced diet that contains a variety
of foods from the food guide pyramid to ensure

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.180
you get your body's daily requirement of all
essential vitamins.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.100
You can see the food guide pyramid at MyPyramid.gov.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.600
Step 2.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.970
Use iodized salt as a source of iodine.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.670
A quarter teaspoon of iodized salt provides
95 micrograms of iodine.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.600
Adults should get 150 micrograms of iodine
per day.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.600
The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences offers a list of recommended

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.650
daily intake amounts for infants, children,
males, females, pregnant women, and lactating

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.930
women on their website.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.250
Step 3.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.170
Add seafood to your diet to get iodine.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.850
Cod, sea bass, haddock, and perch are good
sources of iodine.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.960
A 6-ounce portion of ocean fish provides 650
micrograms of iodine.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.090
Step 4.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.520
Eat seaweed.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.660
Kelp is a rich source of iodine and is sold
in most grocery stores, but, if you can't

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.000
find it, go to a Japanese grocer.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.480
Sprinkle kelp powder or granulated kelp in
yogurt, soup, or smoothies, or mix it into

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.229
recipes for meatballs and meatloaf.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.010
Drink kelp tea or kombucha -- a blend of sugar
and fermenting tea -- to take advantage of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.270
the iodine content in seaweed.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.740
Step 5.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.440
Drink more milk to get more iodine.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.420
Iodine solutions are used to clean and disinfect
cows' teats and dairy equipment.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.420
The iodine then leaches into the milk and
milk products.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.300
Step 6.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.700
Eat plants and vegetables grown in iodine-rich
soil to get more iodine.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.030
If you grow your own vegetables, you can test
your soil for iodine with a testing kit available

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.830
from your local extension office of the USDA.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.160
Step 7.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.471
Take iodine supplements -- available at pharmacies
and health and nutrition outlets -- to get

00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:22.471
more iodine.

00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:26.210
Check with your doctor, though -- too much
iodine can cause hyperthyroidism.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:34.020
Did you know Large quantities of iodine-129,
a radioactive isotope of iodine, were released

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.250
in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on April
26, 1986.
