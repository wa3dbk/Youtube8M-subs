Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here. Today on 
 the show for the Southern Queen of Vegan Cuisine Project

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.609
We will be making Ham Biscuits. Here we go.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:14.381
Vegan ham Biscuits Recipe - Breakfast Food

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.818
We are going to start this recipe by 
 preheating our oven to 450 degrees F.

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:21.088
Next we are going to grab a bowl and whisk together our dry ingredients.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:28.228
We have whole wheat white flour, raw sugar, baking powder, and salt.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.231
Whisk that all together before adding in your wet ingredients.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:37.437
I have some non-dairy milk. Gently stir that together. Then I 
 am going to add in some frozen vegan butter.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:42.175
Plop your biscuit batter onto a baking sheet. I am 
 using an ice cream scooper again today

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:47.214
just because it releases the dough and you don't have to spoon 
 it out of the spoon and it just be a mess.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:52.352
Bake that for about 12 minutes until it is golden brown. Now I 
 am just going to place a few piece of vegan

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.989
ham into the oven to warm up, because they 
 came out of the refrigerator.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.090
I was able to find this at my local grocery 
 store, it may be hard to find and international

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.061
you may not be able to get it, 
 but I really enjoy the convenience.

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:10.200
If you can't find it or you are opposed to 
 vegan faux meats, you can skip this recipe.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.539
I have so many recipes on my channel that don't call 
 for specialty ingredients, that you can just skip one.

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.276
Just skip it, you know, just skip it.

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:25.849
Or just make the biscuits and add some liquid smoke, some 
 salt, some maple syrup and you will be in business.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.853
Now you are going to add you vegan ham to 
 your biscuits. Mine did not rise that much,

00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:35.292
so I am just going to fake it till I make 
 it with baking skills and use two biscuits together.

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:37.928
One on top of the other. Lets taste it.

00:01:37.928 --> 00:01:40.960
I kind of already knew this would happen 
 so lets start with the biscuits.

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:46.830
They were good. Once you get past that hearty wheat flavor, they 
 are sweet, they have a little bit of salt,

00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:51.240
they are soft. It is a good biscuit. I really did like it.

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:56.980
I will probably make it again. In fact, I am remaking 
 it already because I made it before on this channel.

00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:03.050
But the vegan ham, I am like this with most faux vegan meats, but 
 I like to keep trying them just to stay up to date

00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:06.500
in the vegan market. It is kind of where I live.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.960
It was good I guess. It taste ham-my and pork-y.

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:18.100
They really nailed that on the head. Ham-my, 
 pork-y, it pulled like a deli meat.

00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:23.170
All of that together just really upset my stomach.

00:02:23.173 --> 00:02:29.250
I knew it was going to induce gagging and if I 
 took more than one bite, it would induce vomiting.

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:36.190
If you are looking for a ham pork deli meat, just 
 like ham that come from oscar mayer or something,

00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:43.030
buy this brand. It nailed it on the head. It is good 
 for that, but it is not good for me.

00:02:44.662 --> 00:02:51.130
Thank you so much for watching my video today. I will 
 be here tomorrow. So just come back, you hear. Bye.
