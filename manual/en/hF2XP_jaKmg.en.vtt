00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.120
Okay.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.250
Now, I would like to show you about bow direction,
and bow arm movement.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.580
In previous segments, we touched upon drawing
the bow in open strings, and we said that

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.950
it was very important to curl our fingers
on the bow arm.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.810
And then we also said it was very important
to stay in lane two, like this.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.070
But something else is very important, in order
for the bow not to slide, you know, like this

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.710
because that won't give you good sound.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.070
The very important thing that you also have
to think about, besides staying in lane two,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.800
is how your bow arm is moving down and how
is it moving up.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.969
I like to think of it like this.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:10.930
When your bow is at the frog, you sort of
make a little triangle with your arm, your

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.350
body, and your instrument.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:24.220
And then when you pull the bow, and stop at
the middle, you're making a square, four sides,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.440
right here.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:34.160
And then when you reach the tip, you are making
a big triangle.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.460
So it's the small triangle to the square to
the big triangle.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.460
And that will give you a beautiful straight
bow as well as thinking about these other

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.460
things.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.600
So here it is.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.700
Okay.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.460
Those are the shapes of your arm that is important
to know when you're doing bow direction.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.550
T

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.700
here's also something you need to think about,
in terms of your elbow.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.989
Your elbow is going to pull back.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.849
And then, when you get to the middle, and
then, it's going to pull forward, push forward

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.670
when you get to the tip.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.940
When you go back to the middle on the up bow,
your elbow is going to go back again.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.700
And then when you get to the frog, it's going
to come forward.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.549
All of these things work in conjunction with
each other, but it is a good idea to practice

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.709
all these step separately.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.389
And then you are comfortable with one, you
can then add another, or do them all separately,

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.569
and then sort of join them together.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.040
And this will help to get your beautiful sound.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.340
And so that's my thoughts on bow division,
and bow arm movement.
