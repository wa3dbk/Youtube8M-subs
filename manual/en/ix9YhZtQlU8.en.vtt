00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.950
there are certain types of private
information that cell phone providers

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.000
keep and they keep it first

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.160
specific period of time and it differs
from one provider to another okay but i

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.929

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.639
we're noticing that isn't uh... these
things called national security letters

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.979
where the f_b_i_ decides that they're
going to write a letter to themselves

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.670

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.990
virgin mobile will keep it for me to
three months

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.990
yeah in argument for virgin mobile

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.840
first of all the latest in a nut ansi
mobile are are the two that don't feed

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.479
the information for too long

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.060
she that's already mobil's monster

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.030
slash totally random

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.950
with it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.280
five so uh...

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.960
this is that first

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.690
but the main lately is that we we've
lost the fourth amendment is just

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.010
doesn't exist anymore

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.070
and it's amazing because

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.520
there was ever any really fight over
like

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.580
then in the funny thing is i was just
with some tea party folks and they did

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.739
they give this whole huge feel about the
constitution

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:06.320
and how much uh... people and he party
favor the constitution

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.130
i might have at the fourth amendment
ought to be fair the tea party what does

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.229
what he has patriot act so they are
consistent on that

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:17.239
the great majority of the country it's
like ok now they can just to get our

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.539
records without any probable cause
without getting a warrant

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:24.589
you know who cares of the constitution
says this is done it's got a look at the

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.019
other day like this where we executed
two american citizens without any due

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.349
process we shouldn't be surprised
straight

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.379
but we lost such a huge chunk of the
constitution

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.709
and nobody even knows

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.309
and it was really scary is this
information is being collected and it's

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.790
being you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.450
spy stories in the name of national
security right andy anytime a

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.670
governmental official tells you that
they're trying to keep you safe get

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.959
ready because they're about to take some
of your constitutional rights away and a

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.390
lot of people buy into that right
because they buy into the fearmongering

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.069
that they see in the mainstream media
they think well they wanna keep us safe

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.150
what's wrong with that i'm not hiding
anything so sure so that you don't cling

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.520
greenwald wrote a great article but this
is a long today where he said the great

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.509
genius of the american political career
are chrissy these days

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:07.769
is that

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.009
they have people cheer as you take their
rights away so i want to gets killed

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.709
today

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.010
he's a u_s_ citizen no trial no due
process not even then we execute of rain

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.709
uh... by driving a bomb on his head

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.239
an interview with your life that's
already

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.549
we don't know that in trials

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.229
ads great

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.190
and so they sure over this was able to
be saved

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.630
but look we've covered a million of
these stories are just give you one

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.870
great example

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.930
did not do need to keep you safe

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.669
uh... when they find out why what people
were actually spying in on

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.459
things for example was we spied in on
our own troops in iraq

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.969
and what they do did they listen for
connections outfit up of course that you

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.309
know they listen to the phone
conversations

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:51.659
for phone sex

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.559
and all the guys would gather around
who's doing the secret snooping and when

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.689
the guys got on wii with their wives or
their mistresses

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.069
and include some of the top police
recipient cannot be in the military

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.159
project

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.909
everybody would listen in as they grow i
was a good photos that that's what

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.560
they're stupid enough you know why

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.129
he said he would be it

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.609
and if you let him in beings have all
this power

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.809
without any checks

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:15.519
that's why they that's what they do

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.369
that's why the founding fathers

00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:18.939
wrote the constitution

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.070
the was perfect supposed to provide a
check

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.080
unfortunately

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.530
now apparently no one cares anymore
