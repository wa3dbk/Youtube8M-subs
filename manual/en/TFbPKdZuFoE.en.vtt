Hi, I'm Amelia and I'm going to show you how
to create a prom hairstyle. When doing this

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.320
at home, you always want to start with clean,
dry hair. You don't have to have just washed

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.160
it, but it does need to be dry. I find the
best way to start and the easiest way to start

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:28.439
is with just a simple ponytail. I always like
to use a little bit of hairspray, just to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.930
catch all of the extra hair. Now, this particular
look is better if you've got all one length,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.840
but if you do have some layers which most
people do, I'll show you how to take those

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.430
into account. But, by starting with a quick
ponytail, you can go just about anywhere from

00:00:45.430 --> 00:01:01.170
there.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:14.670
Then at this point, use a little product to
help smooth that. Take your flat iron, I like

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.540
a flat iron because it keeps it, it smooths
it out nicely and you can still curl with

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:44.490
it a little bit. Just smooth out the ends.
Create some barrels or some twists, to add

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.590
some dimension and some interest, because
a ponytail isn't very interesting. I like

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:01.890
to use hairpins, I find they grab more hair
and their easier to hide, than a bobby pin.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:30.900
So, just some twists and flips, make it a
little bit more interesting.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.930
Another thing is you're always going to want
to think about your dress, what you're wearing,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.400
your jewelry, all of that, and your just,
your personal style. Hair accessories are

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.989
a great way to hide pins, so if you can get
those pins that have got like the rhinestones

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:55.030
on them, or any combs or clips, that's a great
way to hide some of these pins and clips.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:07.010
So, this one's going to be a little bit more
funky. And, again really all I've used is

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:19.370
a rubber band, and some teasing and a few
hair pins, it's when you can add a little

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.091
hairspray. Now, these pieces in the front,
that you just figure out kind of what you

00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:42.200
fee like doing there. I'm going to smooth
them out, and it's a lot easier if you can

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.769
either have all of your hair curled prior
to pulling it up, or all of it flat ironed

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:55.280
prior to pulling it up. The less work for
yourself at this point, the better. So, this

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:37.300
you can kind of twist back and into that ponytail
back there. It's always good to have a lot

00:04:37.300 --> 00:05:01.690
of bobby pins on hand. So, there you've got
a quick hairstyle that you can do at home.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:09.570
It didn't take much time at all and that's
how you can create a quick prom hairstyle

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.879
at home.
