- Beautiful Things -

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.010
This melody [mÃ©lodie] that you dearly loved...

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.410
A harmonica resounding throughout the skies

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.650
The canvas [toile] on your windowsill, embraced by angels...

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.420
Hey... is that landscape painting [paysage]... beautiful?

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.890
That is [C'est]

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:32.330
Carried by the wind... the light petals... the remembrance of spring...

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.240
What a beautiful sound... the singing girl [Monica]...

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.500
the chirping of birds... the clock's hand moves-

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.540
That is [C'est]

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:54.150
Connecting azure... the flowing clouds... the remembrance of summer...

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.700
What a beautiful sound... the singing girl [Monica]...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.850
the showers of cicadas... the clock's hand moves

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:16.080
I won't forget... the scenery you said was... beautiful...

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.640
In order to gather... "Beautiful things"

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.030
Life [people] comes to be

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.240
The short season [saison] you embraced...

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.900
All while pelted by the rain of pain...

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.150
"Don't worry"... you said while smiling...

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.150
I'll never forget that visage of yours...

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.330
That is [C'est]

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:31.430
Smiling down at the windowsill... the moon at night... the remembrance of autumn...

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.710
What a beautiful sound... the singing girl [Monica]...

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.140
the buzzing of the bugs... the clock's hand moves-

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.320
That is [C'est]

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:53.160
Covering the ground... the napping snow... the remembrance of winter...

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.660
What a beautiful sound... the singing girl [Monica]...

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.350
the cold wind of time... the clock's hand moves-

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:15.570
How beautiful... I will never forget... the scenery you've lived through...

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.040
In order to gather..."Beautiful thing"...

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.080
Life [people] passes away--

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.240
The dazzling season [saison] that you ran through...

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.670
All while being burnt by the flames of sickness...

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.090
"Ah... how beautiful"... you died while smiling...

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.080
I'll never forget that image of yours...

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.180
The morning of your birth...

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:27.980
I was still a crybaby... though I was small, I became a big sister-

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.510
I was so happy... and slightly embarrassed...

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.340
But so very proud...

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.870
The fields of life filled with suffering

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.500
We roam them in search of "Beautiful Things"

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.810
The sleeping face of yours when you set off towards the boundless horizon

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.730
I thought that was more beautiful that anything else...

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.810
This melody [mÃ©lodie] that you dearly loved...

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.230
A harmonica resounding throughout the skies...

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.520
The canvas [toile] on your windowsill, embraced by angels...

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.400
Hey... is that landscape painting [paysage]... beautiful?

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.080
"I saw... the most beautiful flame "Light" in this world.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.810
I'll hold that flower to my chest, and sing for Laurent as well."

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.030
"Can Roman be found here?"
