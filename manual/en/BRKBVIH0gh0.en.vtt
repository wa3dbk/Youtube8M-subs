Hey guys, Sean Nalewanyj here, BodyTransformationTruth.com,
and today I wanted to answer a really common

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.009
question that people ask, which is how to
consistently progress in weight on smaller

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.619
isolation exercises.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.710
They’ll say things like, you know, “obviously
you can’t just keep adding 5 pounds every

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.339
few weeks to exercises like side lateral raises
or bicep curls, so how am I supposed to achieve

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.750
progressive overload on those exercises”.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.050
So, this is a good question to ask, but as
far as I’m concerned there’s really no

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.670
big difference between the basic concept of
progression when it comes to small isolation

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.430
exercises in comparison to big compound lifts,
your primary focus is still to just gradually

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.640
increase the weight that you use over time,
and assuming that you’re training and eating

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.950
properly, you should be able to achieve consistent,
ongoing progress as long as you continue training.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.740
However, there are two very important things
to keep in mind here.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.250
First off, an isolation exercise only involves
the use of one single muscle group and so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.700
obviously the overall rate of progression
is going to be a lot slower and more gradual,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.390
and because all of the stress from those exercises
is being directed at just one muscle group,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.590
small increases are still going to be very
significant.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.130
I can’t give a direct parallel here, but
for example, you could say something like,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.740
maybe 2 extra reps on a tricep extension is
going to benefit your triceps in the same

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.370
way that 5 extra pounds on a deadlift would
benefit your back and legs.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.130
So you really have to lower your expectation
for how quickly those isolation exercises

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.840
are going to increase in weight and recognize
that any progression at all, even if it’s

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.020
just a single rep or even half a rep, that
still is significant, again because you’re

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.610
only using 1 single muscle group.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.000
And the second thing to remember is that any
time you increase the weight on an isolation

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.039
exercise, you’re going to feel that increase
way more heavily because it’s a much bigger

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.750
percentage jump in comparison to increasing
the weight on a compound exercise.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.691
For example, if you’re performing side lateral
raises with 20 pound dumbbells and then you

00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:28.299
increase to 22.5 pound dumbbells, you’re
increasing the total weight lifted by 5 pounds

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.350
which is actually a 25% increase, whereas
if you were performing deadlifts with 200

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.019
pounds and then you added 5 pounds, the increase
there would only be 2.5% which is 10 times

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.019
less.

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.329
So let me give you a couple of tips on this
particular issue.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.390
First off, if jumping up to the next set of
weights on an isolation exercise feels too

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.510
heavy for you, then what you want to do is
focus on increasing the number of reps that

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.419
you’re performing first and foremost before
you try to go ahead and add more weight.

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:05.240
So instead of trying to increase the weight
on for example a dumbbell curl once you reached

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.811
maybe 8 reps with a certain weight, try bumping
that up to 10 reps or even 12 reps, and then

00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.150
increase the weight from there.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.709
Or if you get to 10 reps on a side lateral
raise and you try to increase the weight but

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.010
it feels too heavy, then bump that up to 12
reps or even 15 reps before increasing.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.920
Another option that you can use to get stronger
with a given weight before going up is to

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.299
decrease the rest time in between sets, or
to just make the exercise itself more difficult

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.820
by pausing for a longer timein the fully contracted
position, slowing down your negatives or just

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.450
adding some more volume by performing an extra
set or two.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.239
And one more point that I’d add here is
the concept of “microloading”, which is

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.919
to try and find ways to decrease the overall
amount of weight that you add each time so

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.510
that the percentage jump isn’t as big.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.190
For example if you’re performing a machine
isolation lift but the weight stack only goes

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.970
up by 10 or 15 pound increments at a time,
then depending on the machine you could rest

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.620
a small dumbbell on top of the weight stack,
or you could even hang a 2.5 pound or a 5

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.930
pound plate off the pin like you see here,
this is something that I personally do all

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.200
the time.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.600
Or with dumbbells you can actually purchase
small magnetic micro plates that attach onto

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.790
the ends of the dumbbells, or you could even
wear really light wrist weights depending

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.150
on which exercise you're performing, these
are just some ideas to play around with, and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.530
if you get creative then there are all sorts
of different ways that you can increase the

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.010
weight on isolation lifts by only 2.5 pounds
at a time as opposed to 5 or 10 pounds.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.770
So, bottom line here, progressive overload
is the single most important factor when it

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.930
comes to gaining muscle size and strength
over time, and you should strive for continual

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.780
progression on small isolation lifts in the
same way you do for compound lifts, except

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.700
that the increases are going to happen a lot
more slowly, and that’s totally fine because

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.500
even small increases on isolation exercises
are still very significant in terms of gaining

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.770
muscle size and strength because you’re
only utilizing a single muscle group.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.270
