00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.910
I think that a lot lately about tribute bands
and asking the question

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.770
do tribute bands somehow hold

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.529
the key, or one of the keys, to rock's future. It
seems like a strange idea but

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.259
let me tell ya a little bit about what I've been
thinking. My wife and I this summer when

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.269
out to see a lot of concerts in our area.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.880
Groups from the fifties or actually the sixties
and seventies that we've always enjoyed: 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.390
Ringo Starr and his all-star band,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.148
Yes, Poco Harem, Jethro Tull, Peter Frampton.

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:30.340
 We enjoyed those concerts immensely

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.799
as did a lot of the other people our age
who who went to the concert clearly

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:38.180
there's still a market for this kind of music
especially as performed

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
by the original artists. In the case of Ringo's group though

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.700
but he brings with him a number of other players.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.540
This year it was Edgar Winter, Rick Derringer,
Gary Wright all of them were part of the band

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.970
and the way it goes as they play some of Ringo's songs,  some of his Beatles tunes, 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.739
some of his solo tunes. And they play hits by the other members

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.570
of the group.  So it really is a kind of a Ringo
Starr and his all-star cover band. Or you might  

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.000
even say Ringo Starr and his all-star

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.340
tribute band. Now

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.230
a lot of tribute bands focus on the music of a
single artist. And some go so far as to actually

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.860
impersonate the artists themselves - wigs,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.110
they put on the same costumes of course they
often will use the same instruments.  Even 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.850
put on accents on stage and imitate some
of the in between some patter that the original

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.460
artists use.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.350
But a lot of other tribute bands just play
the music and just try to do it in the most

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.999
historically accurate way they possibly
can. In fact tribute band musicians

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:36.490
are very good students of the styles that
they imitate.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.750
And the popularity of these groups
over the last decade or so really causes you

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.940
to wonder

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.600
exactly what's going on in that case.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.240
In the world of rock music being a tribute
band is really being at the very bottom of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.950
the prestige ladder. Music journalists usually
think of

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.479
tribute band musicians as being

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.530
hack musicians with nothing really that new to
add,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.500
really living off the luster of
somebody else's fame.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.630
But as it turns out a lot of performing groups
in the world of music

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.029
play the music of other artists. Symphony orchestras
for example play classical music

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.319
nobody expects Beethoven to actually be present
when the

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.780
Fifth Symphony is performed. Jazz groups
oftentimes play charts by famous musicians.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.640
Duke Ellington's arrangements are particularly
pupular, and nobody expects Duke Ellington to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.880
be present when one of those is performed. But
somehow in the rock world

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.450
you have to have a special reason for doing
somebody else's music.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.869
It has to be sort of a special song, or you have to do something

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:42.060
very different with it or maybe you found
a kind of an old B side

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.319
hopefully

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.269
you want to breathe some new life into.
You can't really get out there and perform

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.279
the tunes the way they were on the record.
It makes you wonder

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:53.049
what's going to happen when original
musicians who play the music can no longer perform

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.360
them? Are we not going to be able to hear them
live anymore

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.410
the way we're used to hearing this?

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.589
There's the problem with rock music, and I think
that's where the tribute band

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:07.529
comes in, in many ways the tribute band is
a kind of a halfway point. In fact what probably

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.449
will end up happening in my estimation is that

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:15.120
groups will begin to form, there are more like
what I would call 'rock reperatory ensemble.'

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.269
Tribute bands in the sense that they're trying to
get the music historically accurate,

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.719
the same way that maybe classical musicians might try
to get the performance of a 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.159
Bach piece or a Handel piece.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.669
Historically accurate using the right kinds of instruments
and the right kind of ornament.  The same thing

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.839
happens in rock music but these rock reperatory ensembles would play a couple a number of different

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.200
groups, even maybe groups from different eras.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.439
This is the way I can see forward

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.120
for the continuation of the live performance
tradition

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.530
of historical

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.770
rock music. What's ironic about it

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.340
is that, as I said before most rock journalists

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.260
do not give tribute band musicians

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.479
very much respect. 
It may turnout in the end

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.909
that tribute bands

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.290
have more to do

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.999
with rock's future

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.549
than the music journalists themselves will.
