00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.740
Feast your eyes on this.
It's the brand new Lenovo IdeaPad Y530.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.060
One of the most connected 
notebooks out there right now.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.950
Because this has built-in YMAX.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.690
YMAX, one of the technologies that
is being deployed nation wide.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.040
Which is basically like one giant
hot spot. You get broadband internet speeds.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.360
And we are not talking about 
the wireless broadband

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.200
that you get with your 3G card
or something like that.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.870
We're talking real deal,
full speed, wireless broadband

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.840
that's being deployed nationwide 
as we speak right now,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.820
and it's integrated into this 
 Lenovo IdeaPad Y530.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.680
It also has a Core 2 Duo processor,
 2.13 GHz Dual Core processor.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760
It's got 4 GB of DDR2 RAM,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.530
Vista Home Premium's 64 is on board,
so you're going to be able to use, of course,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.160
all of the memory that's in this thing.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.540
It's got a 15.4 inch screen,
and that's 1280 X 800

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.670
is the native resolution
you're going to find on this.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.300
Being driven by the Intel GMA X4500
graphics chipset.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.920
It does, like I said, have YMAX.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.290
It also has YFI.
It's got Wireless a, b, g, and n.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.260
So you're going to be able to connect to 
any type of hot spot that is out there.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.000
And of course it has that legendary Lenovo
 build quality that people like so much.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.330
It feels like an absolute solid notebook.
And I'm not saying it's heavy,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.830
because it's actually not,
but it is...

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.640
just feels like a very solid notebook.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.840
Up here in the bezel of the screen

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.240
you're going to find that it does have
a 1.3 Megapixel Webcam, right here.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.730
Below the screen you're going to find
a couple of stereo speakers, right down here.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.260
And then, below the speakers you're
going to find some capacitive touch controls,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.660
all along here and these are 
for controlling all of your media,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.800
you've got some quick launch buttons,
they're kind of difficult to see

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.270
because unless you activate them they don't
light up, but they're there.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.010
Over here you do have physical control
for your volume,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.540
as well as backing up your computer,
which is very nice.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.250
Down here you have a standard 
full sized keyboard.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.510
Uh, touchpad, and a couple mouse buttons
down here.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.150
Along the front is where you are going
to find your memory card reader,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.850
which is right here, and of course
that will take MMC,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.020
it will take memory stick,
it will take SD,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.360
it will take SD Pro,
XD, all of that right there.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.700
You do have a IR Receiver 
here as well.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.430
And a physical switch for 
turning your Wireless on and off.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.700
Over here, look at that, we've got
your headphones, microphone, USB,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.170
Firewire, and your DVDRW drive
right here as well.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.810
It does have an integrated modem

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.280
for when you don't have YFI
or YMAX or Ethernet,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.150
you can always fall back on that,
you got your modem.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.260
Over here we're looking at,
here we go, your VGA,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.160
you've got USB, 
you've got HDMI,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.360
and you've got another USB 
right here.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.810
Now, right above that you're going to
find your Express 54 Slot, for expansion.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.340
You can throw any Express 54 device
in there.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.240
And then, over here on the other side
is your Ethernet Port and your power.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.710
It's got an interesting hinge on it.
If you take a look here,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.850
you see the hinge is sort of
articulated like that,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.850
which means when it is closed
it gives this very solid feel,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.130
it really feels like just nothing
 can happen to this thing.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.280
Nice textured top, not glossy, 
not going to look filthy

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.030
after handling it for a while,
which is rather nice,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.370
if your not into glossy things.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.210
And it's got a nice silver top
around the keys,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.340
so the whole package looks
really really sharp.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.420
And it happens to be a great value,
it's not an ultra expensive notebook.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.090
But it does have all kinds of
very cool features,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.720
including what you're looking at right now,
which is the VeriFace technology,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.800
which allows you to log into Windows
by simply using your Webcam.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.830
Simply put your face in front of that thing,
it will verify your face,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.430
and immediately take you into Windows

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.830
without having to type in 
username or password, which is cool.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.770
So, simply a solid notebook,
very fast,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.540
very high quality,
and is going to treat you well.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.240
Definitely can't go wrong when you're 
picking a Lenovo like this one.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.620
It's available right now, it's the
Lenovo Y530

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.890
specifically it's the
Y530-7343U2.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.460

Lenovo IdeaPad Y530
