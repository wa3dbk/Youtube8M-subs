00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.140
I really hate you

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.840
Stop getting in my way

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.800
I lost my patience

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.060
When are you gonna decay

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.100
I want to throw you out

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.120
Just like my broken TV

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.900
If you'll come back once more

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.920
It will be painful you'll see

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.140
I hope you die in a fire

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.960
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.560
hope you'll get shot and expire

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.540
Hope you'll be taken apart

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.700
Hope this is what you desire

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.980
It's almost over

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.560
Why can't you just let it fly

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.780
Don't be afraid

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.880
It's not the first time you'll die

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.900
Your machical parts click

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.440
Sounds like when I broke your bones

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.760
Once I get my second chance

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.900
I won't leave you alone

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.840
I hope you die in a fire

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.640
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.360
hope you'll get shot and expire

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440
Hope you'll be taken apart

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.160
I hope you die in a fire

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.080
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.960
hope you'll get shot and expire

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.880
Hope you'll be taken apart

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.680
Hope this is what you desire
