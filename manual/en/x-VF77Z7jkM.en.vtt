00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.600
Live frogs back at the American Museum of
Natural History, species from around the world

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.100
are delighting visitors every day.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.690
We actually have twenty six species that are
in the exhibit at the moment, we have a lot

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.190
of interactives in there, so it means that,
for example, families with young children,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.970
there's a lot of hands-on things, we have
video cameras in there that you can control

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.430
to get close-up views of frogs.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.750
They're are interactive kiosks you can play
back different frog calls, or see frogs feeding.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.100
We wanted to bring frogs to the Museum for
a showcase for the environment and the fact

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.180
that things like frogs are very sensitive
to environment change.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.750
We have to maintain the frogs daily, so it's
a real labor of love and we have several staff

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:10.680
members which are in there every day feeding
the frogs.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.060
We usually feed the frogs the pinhead crickets
and two different sizes of fruit flies.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.569
A larger one and a smaller one.

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:30.070
They're actually bred to be flightless, but
they do run pretty quick.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:38.710
Every morning we give the tub a mist, a spritz
down to make sure all the plants are getting

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.890
enough water and also just to help clean it
down as well.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.140
We have seventy four frogs in here.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.420
Just make sure that there are flies sprinkled
pretty much all over, moving around so everybody

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.470
gets the chance to get some.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.400
And you can see immediately that these ones
have started to move, follow the flies.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.520
Then we have more crickets, the crickets tend
to be bigger, so they'll eat less crickets

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850
than they would flies.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.890
It really varies.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.270
We really wanted to show the diversity of
frogs, for example, some species there will

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.820
be familiar to people, such as the bullfrog.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.970
We wanted to showcase, really, unusual, bizarre
frogs, species that people probably won't

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.760
be familiar with.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.800
The poison dart frogs are there from a tropical
perspective, and then we have other species,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.080
for example, that are entirely aquatic.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.950
Frogs, a Course of Colors, runs at the American
Museum of Natural History through January

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.500
3rd.
