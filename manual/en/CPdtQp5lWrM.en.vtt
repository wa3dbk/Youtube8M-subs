KJELL: Hi, my name is Kjell.
DOTTIE: And I'm Dottie

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.120
KJELL: And we're NASA
astronauts.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.170
DOTTIE: As astronauts, we spend
a lot of time in the gym

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.040
working out and preparing to go
into space.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.420
KJELL: For each mission,
astronauts spend 2 hours a day,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.500
3 days a week in the gym and
classroom

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.830
until they fly into space.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.830
DOTTIE: The cool part is that
most of the training we do here

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.080
in the astronaut gym you can do
too, wherever you are.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.120
KJELL: For astronauts in space,
good dexterity and hand-eye

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.290
coordination let you do
important tasks like repairing

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.330
satellites or conducting
experiments.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.170
DOTTIE: Today, we're going to
share an activity that will

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
help you improve coordination
while practicing communication

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.000
and problem solving skills. Get
ready! Crew Assembly

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.420
will help you Train Like An
Astronaut.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.540
YAMIL: Before you begin the Crew
Assembly Activity,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.880
you will need to gather and
prepare the materials.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.620
You will need a 25-piece puzzle,
two pairs of gloves

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.040
for each crewmember, two pieces
of cardboard, and a stopwatch.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.330
Assemble the puzzle on top of
one piece of cardboard,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.210
and then lay the second piece of
cardboard on top

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.040
of the assembled puzzle. Gently
flip the puzzle upside

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.170
down and remove the top piece of
cardboard.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.920
Label the outside pieces with
the letter "A,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920
then mark the inside pieces with
the letter "B.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.040
Crew Assembly is a team
activity, and each team is

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.460
divided into at least two crews.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.540
Distribute the puzzle pieces
equally to each crewmember,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.120
making sure that all the same
letter pieces

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.710
go to the same crewmember.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.880
They should also put on 2 pairs
of gloves, one over the other.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.750
The assembly area should be set
up about 3 meters away.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.710
Like astronauts on an
extravehicular activity,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.620
crewmembers will leave home base
for the assembly.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.710
Start the timer, and the
crewmembers with "A pieces

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.750
will go to the assembly area and
put them together.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
As soon as they return,
crewmembers with the "B puzzle

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.670
will go to the assembly area to
complete the puzzle.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.580
When they complete it and
return, stop the timer

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.330
to finish the activity. Putting
the puzzle together

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.880
while wearing 2 gloves is
challenging.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.750
It requires good dexterity, and
hand-eye coordination.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.710
Astronauts use these skills in
space especially during EVAs.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.080
Suit up and the Crew Assembly
Activity

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.540
will help you Train Like an
Astronaut.
