00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.000
How to Be a Storm Chaser.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.270
Don't feel like hiding out in the cellar?

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.700
Head outside and be a storm chaser, instead!

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:22.150
You will need Portable VHF radio Vehicle Maps
Navigation equipment Partner Caution and camera.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.080
Chasing storms is extremely dangerous -- obey
all law enforcement instructions and posted

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.530
signs.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.750
Step 1.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.900
Between April and June, head to a location
in Tornado Alley, a swath of land in the central

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.659
U.S. known for its active storm season.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:39.680
Step 2.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.690
Go online to find the frequency for your local
transmitter of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.510
Administration's Weather Radio All Hazards,
or NWR.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.830
Then, listen for updates about severe weather
nearby.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.650
Check online for additional information on
developing weather systems.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.930
Step 3.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.400
When you hear of severe weather nearby, head
toward the storm.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.330
Keep listening to NWR to stay abreast of the
storm’s direction and use maps and navigation

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.820
equipment to approach the weather system.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.530
Rely on at least one other storm chaser to
share driving and navigation duties.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.010
Step 4.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.720
Approach severe weather cautiously as a storm
chaser: flash floods, hail, and lightning

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.740
can all prove hazardous on the open road.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.480
Take extreme care when driving towards standing
water, which can cause you to hydroplane and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.690
lose control of your vehicle.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.220
Keep an eye out for downed power lines.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.450
Step 5.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.030
Found a storm to chase?

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.450
Ride alongside it.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.980
If you can do so safely, pull off the road,
put on your hazards, and document the weather

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.920
with a camera.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.700
Head away from the storm when lightning starts
striking every 15 seconds or hail begins falling

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.810
in a sheet.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.380
Stay inside the car while you’re shooting
to protect yourself from being struck by lightning.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.540
Step 6.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.190
Once you’ve called it a day as a storm chaser,
visit a National Weather Service branch online

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.700
or in person and submit your record of the
storm to promote an understanding of severe

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.860
weather systems.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.019
Then, take a deep breath and revel in the
thrill of the chase!

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:15.270
Did you know In 2009, the U.S. National Weather
Service recorded 1,156 tornadoes in the U.S.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.549
and Puerto Rico.
