00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.460
Introducing the smallest, sleekest, and lightest
way to mount your HERO3 camera. The Frame

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.600
Mount is the first mounting system that allows
the HERO3 camera to be mounted without using

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.190
the traditional housing, allowing for more
versatility when capturing life's most memorable

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.310
moments. The Frame is compatible with HD HERO3
cameras, most GoPro mounts and harnesses,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.590
and our latest BacPacs.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.570
The Frame Mount comes with two frames, designed
for use with and without a BacPac attached

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.550
to the camera, a quick release thumbscrew
for attaching the camera to the included flat

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.550
and curved bases, and a lens cover, for protecting
the camera when not in use.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.989
Start by selecting any GoPro mounting base
that uses our three finger mounting system.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.380
Align the shutter button on the frame with
the shutter button on the camera. Flex the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.780
frame open, and slide the camera into the
frame. The frame will automatically align

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.780
with the camera edges. Next, insert the frame's
attachment fingers into the selected three

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:18.929
finger mounting system and insert and tighten
the quick release thumbscrew. This automatically

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:25.929
secures the frame around the camera.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.179
Because the frame attaches directly to the
camera without the use of a camera housing,

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:36.029
it does not provide waterproofing or protection
from sand and dust. Only use the frame in

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:40.849
conditions that will not damage the camera
or its lens. The Frame Mount is designed to

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:46.389
work with our latest BacPac products, like
the LCD Touch BacPac and Battery BacPac and

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:55.400
will not fit properly with older cameras and
BacPacs. The Frame from GoPro is the lightest,

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.060
sleekest, and coolest looking way to mount
your HERO3 camera. To learn more or get help
