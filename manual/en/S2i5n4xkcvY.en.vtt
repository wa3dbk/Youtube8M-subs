00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.880
&gt;&gt;SOFIA is an observatory, observatories like
it to be dark, so when it's summer back home,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.600
we come down here where it's winter, and we
get the long nights, and get to see stuff

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.980
in the Southern Hemisphere sky.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.520
&gt;&gt;We were able
to observe Eta Carinae.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.000
I've never seen that target,
so you learn something new on every observation.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.240
&gt;&gt;One of my favorite objects that must be observed
from the Southern Hemisphere, is actually

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.351
what's called the Large Magellenic Cloud. This is
a dwarf galaxy that's a satellite to the Milky

00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:06.760
Way. A lot of astronomers consider it a great
laboratory for studying star formation.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.681
The four instruments that the SOFIA telescope
brought down for the deployment is really

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:20.128
necessary in the sense that each instrument's
detector is sensitive to a different part

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.941
of the electromagnetic spectrum. When you're
trying to conduct observations for different

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:32.079
science needs, you wanna be looking at light
of, essentially all wavelengths, because how

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.450
much light the object is producing at each
wavelength tells you something about the physics that's

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.560
going on in that system.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.640
[Music]

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.280
&gt;&gt;We just finished
the occultation of Pluto with the FLITECAM/HIPO

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.510
instrument set, and today we're installing
the FORCAST instrument. FORCAST is the Faint

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.550
Object infRared CAmera for SOFIA Telescope.
When it comes to changing instruments, the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.180
off going instrument, there's a long procedure
that gets followed. They kill all the power,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.210
uncouple all the electrical connections, and
they have a long process to de-torque all

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.200
the bolts in a certain sequence, they have
to pass it down one side of the airplane that

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.340
has a reinforced floor. When we go to install
it, it's the reverse process. You bring it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.760
to the telescope flange, align it with the
guide pins, and then torque it in place.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.141
The avionics team attaches all the cables and
fiber optics. They do a power check to make

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.720
sure that everything is plugged in to the
right connectors. And then along comes the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.080
cryogens team, they fill up the liquid nitrogen
tanks, and then the helium tanks.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.759
And then the science instrument team will come out,
check their instrument for calibration and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.961
optical accuracy.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
&gt;&gt;Trying to nod to A again.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520
Yep, and that's done.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.520
&gt;&gt;OK, that's good.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.880
&gt;&gt;FORCAST is a mid-infrared camera and spectrometer. It's a really great

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.840
tool for studying the process of star formation.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.720
Today we conducted a functional checkout.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.621
The functional checkout serves to help us
understand how the science instrument is performing

00:03:21.621 --> 00:03:25.381
right before we go off and fly a ten hour
science flight.

00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:32.320
Today's check was actually successful, and
we are ready to fly on the next FORCAST flight.
