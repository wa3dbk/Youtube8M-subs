00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.580
WHY DOES RAINBOW HAVE 7 COLOURS?

00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.904
Yeah! It has stopped raining.

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:21.651
We can now go out and play.

00:00:22.263 --> 00:00:24.600
Professor, can we please go out and play?

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.457
Yes children, you may.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.244
Look, a rainbow.

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:37.482
Oh, it is so beautiful.

00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:40.237
Look at all the different colours.

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:43.573
Pity we canâ€™t see a rainbow every day.

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:45.685
We only see it when it rains.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.659
Why is that? Professor,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.291
how is a rainbow formed?

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:52.995
Ordinary white light like sunlight

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.288
is made up of many different colours.

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.186
But we cannot see the different colours

00:00:58.187 --> 00:01:00.372
as sunlight appears colourless.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.480
But if we pass the white light

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.955
through a prism or a piece of glass,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.712
the white light splits into a band of colours.

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:12.675
This band of colours is called a spectrum

00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:15.514
and it contains all the colours of the rainbow.

00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:17.080
But Professor,

00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:18.722
I still donâ€™t understand

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:20.752
why a rainbow is formed after it rains.

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:22.296
When it rains,

00:01:22.297 --> 00:01:25.616
the raindrops act like prisms of glass.

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.620
When sunlight passes through the raindrops,

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.704
it breaks up into its spectrum

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:33.626
and we see all the colours of the rainbow.

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:36.212
Now, who can tell me

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:38.489
the 7 different colours of the rainbow?

00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:42.213
Okay Dog, you tell me

00:01:42.538 --> 00:01:44.672
the colours of the rainbow are

00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:50.383
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.856
Very good.

00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:55.316
Now kids, you can all go out and play.

00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:57.163
But make sure you do not play

00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:59.577
in the puddles and dirty yourselves.
