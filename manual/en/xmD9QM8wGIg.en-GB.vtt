00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.939
Ah, seems like it was yesterday. They were
good days, they were!

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.290
Regardless of the season, or wherever you
may be riding, there are a few rules we feel

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.490
you should follow to ensure you maintain sartorial
integrity whilst riding your bike. The list,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750
although non-exhaustive, is simply what to
avoid at all costs.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.640
Top 10 things not to wear on a bike.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.660
No socks

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.250
The correct sock height, length or colour
are subjects perpetually debated in the world

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.660
of cycling. However, in order to even have
the debate, you have to have socks in the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.030
first place. Newbies might be tempted to go
sockless to save embarrassing tan lines, but

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.680
you need to get over this. Tan lines are like
a tattoo to confirm your membership into the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.410
cycling world. Ride without socks, and you’ll
remain part of the amateur gang as well as

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.820
risking some nasty ankle and toe chafing.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.629
I tell you what Matt, this is chafing a little
bit. You got any plasters?

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.690
I think I might have some back in the car,
Si.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.100
Full face Helmet

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.280
Riding with a helmet is compulsory in our
book, it goes without saying. But, riding

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.470
out on the road with a full face helmet, unless
you’re planning an off road descent, or

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.880
pumping round the local BMX track, just doesn’t
cut it. It looks distinctly dodgy for one,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.729
your head will cook for two and finally we
think periphery vision is an absolute must.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.729
It also inhibits the intake of fluids and
banter with your training partner too.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.610
[Muffled conversation]

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.180
Compression socks

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.640
Quite the opposite of no socks are compression
socks. On, or even off the bike, they will

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.280
make you look so strange that the stress of
your self-consciousness will negate any performance

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.810
benefit. Actually, we take that back - if
you’re wearing them, you probably don’t

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.600
have any self consciousness anyway.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.329
Superheroes.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.479
Time out on the bike is precious, especially
if you’re training around a job or your

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.570
studies. So the last thing you want to happen
whilst out on your favourite loop is to have

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.319
to save the world from impending catastrophe
and doom at the clutches of an evil genius mastermind.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.519
A tip then, fly under the ‘superhero responsibilities
radar’ by not dressing as one.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.659
Simon my friend, I will fight crime until
the end of it's days!

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.940
National Championship Jersey

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.680
Although fertile ground for debate, we feel
there is only one situation where you are

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.099
allowed to wear a World or National champion's
jersey. And that situation is if you are the

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.669
current World or National champion.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:57.080
Yes! Oh what a day it was!

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.879
Oh jesus, Matt. It was 16 years ago, take
it off!

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.309
I have to get electrical tape. Absolutely
ridiculous.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:08.169
You can, if you’ve been a national champion,
continue to wear the stripes on your arms.

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.529
Can someone give me a hand?

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.689
Bib shorts only - no jersey.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.939
Since he started working out, our very own
Simon Richardson is probably the only person

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.620
who could get away with what is normally considered
as a cycling fashion faux pas.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.260
Cyclist’s traditionally weedy, pasty-skinned
upper bodies are things best left under wraps

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.940
and filed under ‘specialist websites only.'

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.600
I tell you what, you are looking quite buff.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:37.419
Thanks mate.

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.439
Pretty ripped at the moment.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.769
How often do you work out, anyway?

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.829
I reckon probably about once a decade.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.149
I did it once.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.300
Suits.

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.939
Tally ho!

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.359
Rather than look like an accountant with a
driving ban, keep it practical and avoid commuting in your suit.

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.659
You're looking well, anyway.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.299
Yes, I got the all clear last Friday and now
I'm enjoying life!

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.139
Checking your portfolio on the move is also
a definite no-no. We’re unsure if brogues

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.060
come with cleats too.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.909
This just isn't working. Fancy a spurt instead?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.320
Rockstars

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.479
Here at GCN we have actively encouraged you
to sing on a bike as a way of motivating yourself,

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.659
which is fine.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.940
But, we implore you not to ‘method sing’
via total immersion into the persona of your

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.319
favourite rock star whilst out riding.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:48.079
People try to put us down / talking 'bout
my generation / Just because we get around...

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.750
The image of The Who's Roger Daltrey on stage
rocking double denim is an iconic one that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.920
should not be tainted by trying to replicate
it on a bike.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.300
...my generation baby...my generation! My
generation baby...

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.800
The Onesie

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.280
Whilst reluctantly conceding they are indeed
*coughs* a global fashion phenomenon, these

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.240
monstrosities should perhaps firmly remain
the preserve of teenagers, students and the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.919
sartorially misguided. Unless of course it’s
one that makes you look like your favourite

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.879
wild animal out in it's natural habitat, as
we're rather fond of doing here at GCN.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.660
What have you come as Matt?

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.860
I've come as a monkey. Always been fond of
monkeys since I was a child.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.680
Speedos

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.780
Not only do Speedos offer very little protection
for your manly or womanly bits, but they also

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.349
look...wrong. Yes, it’ll prevent you getting
farmer's tan lines, but no, that’s not a

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.669
valid excuse. If you want to do group rides
without everybody trying to drop you, steer

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.189
well clear of Speedos - leave them for triathletes.
You are far less likely to end up being

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:57.550
arrested for indecency or severely reducing
your ability to start a family. Plus no-one

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.099
wants to ride behind someone with a severe
case of the munchies.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.920
I thought I was going to **** my lyrics up,
but I did it alright.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.020
National champion you know!

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.530
What awful wind!

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.020
We'll be making bloody feature films soon!

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.680
Got off on an appeal last night.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.980
That was a weird accent, wasn't it?
