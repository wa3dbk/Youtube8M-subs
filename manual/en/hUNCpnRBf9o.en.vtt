00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.867
The President:
Here are the details
that every American needs

00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:04.266
to know about this plan.

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:08.100
First, if you are among the
hundreds of millions of

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.533
Americans who already
have health insurance,

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.166
nothing in this plan will
require you or your employer to

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.667
change the coverage or
the doctor you have.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.400
Under this plan, it will be
against the law for insurance

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.934
companies to deny you
coverage because of

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:23.066
a preexisting condition.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.900
As soon as I sign this bill,
it will be against the law for

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.600
insurance companies to drop your
coverage when you get sick or

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.600
water it down when
you need it the most.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.300
They will no longer be able to
place some arbitrary cap on the

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.200
amount of coverage you
can receive in a given

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.767
year or in a lifetime.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.200
We will place a limit on how
much you can be charged for

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.100
out-of-pocket expenses, because
in the United States of America,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.633
no one should go broke
because they get sick.

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.967
And insurance companies
will be required to cover,

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.500
with no extra charge, routine
checkups and preventive care,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.967
like mammograms and
colonoscopies --

00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:56.734
(applause)

00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:59.834
-- because there's no reason we
shouldn't be catching diseases

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:03.500
like breast cancer and colon
cancer before they get worse.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.266
If you lose your job
or you change your job,

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.400
you'll be able to get coverage.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.467
If you strike out on your own
and start a small business,

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.567
you'll be able to get coverage.

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:17.033
We'll do this by creating a
new insurance exchange -- a

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.300
marketplace where individuals
and small businesses will be

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.767
able to shop for health
insurance at competitive prices.

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:26.166
Now, for those individuals and
small businesses who still can't

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.600
afford the lower-priced
insurance available in the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.133
exchange, we'll
provide tax credits,

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.533
the size of which will
be based on your need.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.934
For those Americans who can't
get insurance today because they

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:39.800
have preexisting
medical conditions,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.934
we will immediately offer
low-cost coverage that will

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.367
protect you against
financial ruin if you

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:47.166
become seriously ill.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.633
This was a good idea when
Senator John McCain proposed it

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:53.133
in the campaign,
it's a good idea now,

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.400
and we should all embrace it.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.367
(applause)

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:59.000
But an additional step we can
take to keep insurance companies

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.367
honest is by making a
not-for-profit public option

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:03.934
available in the
insurance exchange.

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:04.834
(applause)

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:05.767
Let me be clear.

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:09.533
It would only be an option for
those who don't have insurance.

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:13.333
No one would be forced to choose
it and would also keep pressure

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.233
on private insurers to keep
their policies affordable and

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:20.667
treat their customers better I
will not sign a plan that adds

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:24.166
one dime to our deficits --
either now or in the future.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.967
(applause)

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:28.800
We've estimated that most of
this plan can be paid for by

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.567
finding savings within the
existing health care system,

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:35.066
a system that is currently
full of waste and abuse.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:38.767
The only thing this plan would
eliminate is the hundreds of

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.500
billions of dollars
in waste and fraud,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.233
as well as unwarranted
subsidies in Medicare that

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:46.500
go to insurance companies.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.834
And we will also create an
independent commission of

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:52.800
doctors and medical experts
charged with identifying more

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.934
waste in the years ahead.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.033
(applause)

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:59.633
These steps will ensure that you
-- America's seniors -- get the

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:01.433
benefits you've been promised.

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:04.333
And we can use some of the
savings to fill the gap in

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:07.300
coverage that forces too many
seniors to pay thousands of

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.333
dollars a year out of their own
pockets for prescription drugs.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.900
Many in this chamber --
particularly on the Republican

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.934
side of the aisle -- have long
insisted that reforming our

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:20.500
medical malpractice laws
can help bring down the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.934
cost of health care.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.000
I know that the Bush
administration considered

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.700
authorizing demonstration
projects in individual states to

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.400
test these ideas.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.567
I think it's a good idea, and
I'm directing my Secretary of

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.400
Health and Human Services
to move forward on

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.266
this initiative today.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:38.934
The time for bickering is over.

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:40.033
(applause)

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.633
The time for games has passed.

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:43.867
(applause)

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:46.867
Now is the season for action.

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:50.734
Now is when we must bring the
best ideas of both parties

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:54.567
together, and show the American
people that we can still do what

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.200
we were sent here to do.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.633
Now is the time to
deliver on health care.
