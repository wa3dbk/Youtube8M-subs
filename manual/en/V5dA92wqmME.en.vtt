00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.640
Good morning!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
Doctor Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.620
may I speak with you?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.520
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.520
I am, yes.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.360
May I see your credentials?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.180
Certainly.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.700
Closer, please.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.580
Closer!

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.140
That expires in one week.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.260
You're not real FBI, are you?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.220
I'm still in training at the academy.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.660
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.720
Yes, I'm a student.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.640
I'm here to learn from you.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.280
Maybe you can decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified enough to do that.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.900
Mmm.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.480
That is rather slippery of you, Agent Starling.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560
Sit, please.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.700
Now then, tell me:

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.480
What did Miggs say to you?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.980
Multiple Miggs, in the next cell.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.680
He hissed at you... What did he say?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.000
He said: "I can smell your cunt."

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.600
I see.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
I myself, cannot.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.340
*sniffing*

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.600
You use Evyan Skin Cream.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.540
And sometimes, you wear L'Air du Temps,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.400
but not today.
