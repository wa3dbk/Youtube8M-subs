00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.980
Many people argue Half-Life 2 was one of the
best games ever released.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.230
But if I did have one complaint, it was the
ending was a little underwhelming, and left

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.040
me feeling somewhat unsatisfied, having me
aching to return to City 17 and continue the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.879
adventure of Gordon Freeman.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.760
Thankfully, a little bit later Value gave
us the chance in the first part of an episodic

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:58.420
trilogy.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.979
The game picks up literally right after the
end of Half-Life 2.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.820
Gordon and Alyk are pulled from the rubble
my D0g, and soon take on a mission of going

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.330
into the Citadel to shutdown the reactor and
save the people.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.960
This is just where it starts but it is more
than just a one location expansion.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.190
While being only the first part, Episode One
actually does some things that really help

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.240
the series.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.500
There is still the great Half-Life way of
storytelling, where everything is seen through

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.610
the eyes of Gordon, who doesnâ€™t say a word.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.260
But something kinda new is the addition of
Alyk being a full on co-op partner.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.670
Much of the game is played with her right
by your side, which does help things as she

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:47.900
can more than handle herself in a firefight.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.160
This is a major highpoint for the game.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.890
Alyk feels so real, you would swear someone
was literally controlling her.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.560
It makes the action even better with a partner
by your side.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.299
And that is what you will be doing a lot.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.729
The game goes through sections where it feels
like a hollywood action movie, with bullets

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.119
flying everywhere and not much time to take
a breath.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.030
But these are separated by large physics based
puzzles, that can require some time to figure

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.030
out.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.810
The gravity gun returns in a big way here,
quickly getting an upgrade where now it can

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.900
do even more damage.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.030
No need to pick up saw blades when you can
pick up combine soldiers themselves.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.840
It is something that just never gets old.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.650
Everything that made Half-Life 2 so good is
here, and even improved upon.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.500
The impressive AI, perfectly balanced gameplay
of shooting and thinking, and the characters

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.859
that come off as more human and artificial,
makes for a game that could be said is better

00:02:46.859 --> 00:03:02.750
than its original.
