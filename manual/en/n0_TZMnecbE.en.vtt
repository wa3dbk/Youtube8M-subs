00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.509
Hi, I'm Martin from Claremonts.com. This time,
I'm gonna run you through

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.039
how to play Roulette, some strategies,
some basic principles of the game

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.579
and a little bit of history as well along the way. The
game of Roulette then.

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.070
What we have here; Roulette wheel with 37,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.449
37 different numbers, the 0 and all the
numbers through

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.220
to 36. And what we're gonna be doing, is teaching
you and showing you all the different betting

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.850
scenarios in the game of Roulette.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.280
Now Roulette is a game of chance, it's also,
what I always say, it's a game of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.850
risk and reward and I will teach you the
risky bets,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.390
I'll teach you the in-between bets and I'll teach
you the very very safe bets as well.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.549
In the game of Roulette, you can play
riskily, or you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.710
can play a little bit more aggressive,
let's look at the very safe bets first,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.129
these are the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.189
outside chances. Outside chances mean, that by
placing a chip on maybe

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.900
1-18, or maybe red, or maybe odd numbers,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.430
you're giving yourself 18 of the
different numbers on the Roulette Wheel

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.040
here, 18 of the 37 different scenarios
will be winning ones for you.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.490
Obviously, that's not a very big risk, so
we don't give you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500
 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.700
the biggest of rewards. If you look here,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.300
low numbers, 1 to 18, if the number, it's in the wheel at the moment it's 15,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.700
You bet four chips, you win four chips. it's as
simple as that.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.300
If you bet again, if it's a black number, if you bet 3 chips on black, black comes in, you double it up. It's as simple as that.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.770
The only thing to watch out for when you do these outside bets, they're very safe bets,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.400
but the 0 is not a winning bet on the outside chances.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.960
Lower risk, lower return, a nice way to
start playing the game of Roulette

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.260
is the low risk bets.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.430
The outside chances we call them, 18 numbers in your favour,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.520
you get paid even money and double your winnings if you
have a winning return on the wheel.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.150
Following on then from those outside chances where you bet 
18 numbers with one chip,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.000
The next least risky way of playing, fairly safe, is to do something like this; it's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.840
called a dozen,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.350
or the cousin of the dozen, which is the column bets that run up the table.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.430
Now, by doing these bets, what you're
doing is you're giving yourself 12 of the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.200
different numbers

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.569
on the wheel in your favour. In this case, there it is,

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.139
first 12, very much self-explanatory.
You're betting all the numbers here 1

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:19.680
to 12,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.040
If you're gonna do the column bets, the column bets here run all up the table, the twelve numbers that run up the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.639
table there.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.260
If you have a winning chip, a little bit
more risky than betting 18 numbers on the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.189
outside, you're only betting on 12 this time,
so we're gonna pay you a little bit more,

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.700
rather than being payed once, when you bet a dozen you get a triple return

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.230
if you're a winner. Again, on the column there, each one you bet,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.569
you win two more. Betting the columns, betting the dozens, 12 numbers in your favor.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.510
If you win you get payed at 2/1 odds.
