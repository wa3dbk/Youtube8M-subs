00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.859
Let's learn about Muscle Tissue.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:30.570
There are 3 types of muscle tissue
Skeletal cardiac and smooth

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.740
Skeletal muscle tissue has a definitive structure.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:49.309
It contains long red cells containing myoglobin
and multiple nuclei.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:01:00.920
Skeletal muscle also contains striations giving
it a striped appearance.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:11.200
The striations are produced by overlapping
protein filaments.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:25.650
There are 2 kinds of filaments.Thick filaments
called myosin and thin filaments called actin.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.220
The filaments are arranged in an overlapping
structure.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.700
They form contractile units called sarcomeres.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.950
The sarcomeres form the striations.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:53.590
The striations can be seen under a microscope.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.060
Cardiac muscle is only found in the heart
and is similar to skeletal muscle in that

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.980
it also is striated.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:17.580
However the cells in cardiac muscle form branches.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:28.780
Cardiac muscle also contains a structure not
seen in skeletal muscle.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.270
This is the intercalated disc and is a type
of intercellular junction.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:56.560
Smooth muscle contains actin and myosin but
is not striated.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.599
Smooth muscle is found in many places in the
body including the blood vessels

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:11.819
Urinary bladder respiratory and digestive
tracts the uterus and the eye.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.670
We hope youï¿½ve learned something about muscle
tissue and see you next time.
