00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.280
[Narration]
For more than 100 years, Camp Fire USA has

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.940
been involving young people in the outdoors
and in their communities.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.160
In Central Texas, an annual fundraising effort
took on a new twist when the group swapped

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.570
candy sales for service work.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.020
Texas Parks and Wildlife has this report about
how one project is helping a state park deal

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.020
with the drought.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.830
[Inks Lake State Park, Burnet Texas]
(kids playing in tree)

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.830
“I’ve been camping about four times.”

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.130
(other boy) “This is my first time.”

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.780
[Narration]
These kids are here for the same reason.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.620
(girl in tree leans into camera) “Bacon
rules!”

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.820
[Narration]
To share their love of bacon and to roll up

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.890
their sleeves and work.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250
(Carol Adams – Inks Lake State Park)
“I’m so happy that you are here today

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.100
and so happy you are going to do a special
service project here at Inks Lake.”

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.110
[Rebecca Benz – Camp Fire USA Balcones Council]
“Selling candy as a product did not really

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.310
mesh with our values and was not really a
good message related to children’s health.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.470
So we converted back to Camp Fire’s motto
– Give Service.”

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.659
(Camp Fire girls 1940s TV PSA)
“Sing around the campfire.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.619
Join the campfire girls…”

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.619
[Narration]
What started out in 1910 as an organization

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.969
for girls has evolved into an organization
that involves families of all kinds in camping,

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.780
cooking and community service.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.549
(Rebecca) “This year, it’s called ‘Absolutely
Incredible Kids’ where children give service

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.701
to the community and in particular water conservation.

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:28.701
We’ve committed to water conservation for
the next three years.”

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:32.679
(Carol to group) “Well we want to have a
butterfly garden here but guess what?

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.009
There’s no rain, it’s a drought!”

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.639
[Narration]
So the kids spent part of their camping trip

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.619
restoring a donated water tank.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.579
[Carol Adams – Inks Lake State Park]
(Carol to kids) “No not that kind of tank

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.579
– bang, bang, bang, bang!

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.649
It’s a water tank.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.929
It holds 1,000 gallons of water.”

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.350
(Carol to group) “I’d like you to meet
Inks Lake Water Collection Tank.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990
This is it right here.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.429
(kids – Yea!)

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.149
“What is this yucky stuff on this tank?

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.149
(kids – Rust.”)

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.040
“We have to sand off the rust with sanders
… do not sand your face or your friends’s

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
face.”

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040
(kids pretend to sand each other’s face)

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.729
[Naration]
Once the sanding and painting are complete,

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.030
there’s still time for more tree climbing…

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.580
[Eric Hollas – Camp Fire dad]
“There’s something about the outdoors

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.840
that just makes us all human I think.”

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.890
[Narration]
Nature watching…

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.510
(bird in nest – boy says) “Awww, I even
see a little chick.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.720
There’s an actual bird in there.”

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.460
[Narration]
And a Camp Fire song.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.860
(group singing) “…hold fast onto health
and your work glorified and you will be happy

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.460
in all of Camp Fire.”

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.510
(clapping)

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.730
For Texas Parks and Wildlife, this is Lydia
Saldaña.
