00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.090
just one month after the newtown
connecticut shootings the n_r_a_

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.180
which has been blaming

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.489
movies and video games has released of
shooting game ab

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.619
with targets the target some people are
describing them as coffins

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.470
other people describing these are not
the targets by the way which are on the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.789
on the screen here other people
describing the targets as being uh...

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.310
crude representations of the human body
with the red

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.009
bull's eye over where roughly the heart
would be

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.190
this is that the height of hypocrisy in
this this is an even as far as it goes

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.740
the n_r_a_ also did in addition to
blaming violent movies for gun violence

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.560
as opposed to accessibility of gods

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.430
uh... just after that they did a
hollywood guns exhibit glorifying

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.530
firearms in movies

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.660
and then after saying that video games
are the problem

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.130
they are doing this uh... video-game ap
with the goal is to shoot people for

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.570
ninety nine cents ladies and gentlemen
you can upgrade your gun two on the back

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.540
and join and ko eleven sniper rifle for
ninety nine cents lewis and others

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.740
appeal to everybody but he doesn't
option and i guess that is the the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.450
freedom of choice that the n_r_a_

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.620
what you said before uh... the n_r_a_'s
jim burke commerce for car manufacturers

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.860
and it's their job

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.570
make people looking every other
direction

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.250
at themselves i think there's two levels
here

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.770
one one there's this this some level of
insensitivity here where the n_r_a_'s on

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.600
one hand going out and claiming that
they feel bad about what happened in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.480
newtown but at the same time releasing
this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.210
and then the other layer is just that it
is hypocritical because it goes against

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.710
what they say if it is movies and video
games that are causing the problem we

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.130
now have the n_r_a_ on the record as
being part of the problem putting out

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.310
the shooting game as well as glorifying
guns in this hollywood guns exhibit and

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.920
that is their any can we mitigate this
anyway i'm i missing anything either

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.100
anything else to be explored

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.320
uh... something segment time date would
you want to weigh in on this analysis

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
yeah i don't know i mean my opinion of
of this whole situation with the n_r_a_

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.430
is what we've been saying which is that

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.780
this is that they're not even
representative not even representative

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.139
of their own members i mean the
representative of the gun lobby

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.919
that's where seventy four percent of the
money comes from

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.669
and um... the fact that the keep on
doing these insensitive things at the

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.340
most insensitive times

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.780
is kind of proof that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.189
it doesn't matter

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.729
what happens at the gap continue saying
the same thing

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.949
and the other thing also louis is that
when you think about

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.049
people say well look the n_r_a_ must be
doing something right because they've

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.349
gained like a quarter million members
since the newtown connecticut shooting

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.589
i don't think that that that there's any
bolivia to that any issue based group

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:45.609
is going to gain members aware that
issue is out there now there's there's

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.589
more than a quarter million people
who'll before words

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.340
were casually not members of the n_r_a_

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.330
and now are very acutely not members of
the n_r_a_ rate and and again because it

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.660
isn't issue group there are just two
hundred fifty thousand uh... these two

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.450
hundred thousand people who have decided
to become members are don't think we can

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.300
really point to the fact that they've
been issue group is gaining members when

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.119
the issue is in the news as evidence of
anything

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.910
right is the argument that

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.480
they they must be on the right side of
the issue the correct side of the issue

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.379
because they're getting all these
numbers

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.749
no it just means that uh... perhaps they
have a clever way with words and uh... i

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.309
don't think it's ads are negative
recruiting people their issue is in the

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:31.249
news says when you but people say all
that i care about this issue what

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.880
organization casual and it's the n_r_a_
essentially if you are

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.330
uh... if you if you are in favor of
people having guns and so on and so

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.980
forth you think it and you think of the
n_r_a_ with it but they're sending

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.999
different messages

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.659
on the night in nineteen oh when you go
to the n_r_a_ website which have never

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:45.959
been to you

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.419
it's probably all the stuff

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.310
people who love the second amendment
that people who think americans should

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.189
own guns the people who do our own guns
want to hear and so they automatically

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.219
uh...

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.499
the arrest that resonates with them
pressure but do you know it's a very

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.409
different message of the sentences a lot
of media outlets no question about it

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.659
yet
