00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.189
As vocation directress I help women who are
discerning to really seek where God's will

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:23.349
is for them in their lives and to help them
find what path He is calling them to and to

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.860
help them hear His voice and really just help
them discern and direct them in the path that

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.200
He is choosing for them.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.530
So a women would first write to us or call
us and we'd have a time of communication and

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.620
then she would come and visit and see what
our life is like.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.379
And so we have Come and See weekends and sometimes
to come for a whole week and visit us and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.679
really participate in our way of life a little
bit.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.910
And then, if she feels called to us and the
community discerns as well that she is called

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.760
to this community, then, she would request
to apply.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.570
And then, if she is accepted to enter our
community, she would begin as an aspirant.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.729
And the Aspirancy lasts for three months.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.700
And the woman that comes, she stays in her
lay clothes for these three months.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.310
It's just a more intense time of seeing what
our life is like.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.500
She lives in the novitiate house as well,
and she has some classes learning about, just

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.759
basic things about our history, and the history
of the Franciscan Order, and then also working

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.020
and praying with the Sisters.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.500
After those three months, if she feels that
she is called here, she would request to enter

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.119
the postulancy.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.789
They wear a white blouse and a black skirt
and they receive our community crucifix and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:01.070
they take classes on the history of the Franciscan
Order, more classes on the history of our

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.259
community, as well as classes on the Catechism
and various other classes.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.400
Then after the postulancy, if the women still
feels that she is called here she would request

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.340
to apply to the novitiate.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.450
And once you become a novice, you receive
our habit and a white veil, that symbolizes

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.030
that she is a disciple in training.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.019
The first year of the novitiate is what is
called the canonical novitiate and this is

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.080
what is required by the Church.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.430
And it is one year and the woman doesn't go
out on any ministries.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.200
It's like a cloistered year.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.100
And then, after the canonical novitiate, it
is what is called the apostolic year.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:51.530
And so she'll go out and experience our ministries,
and help on those in a limited way.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.709
And she continues with her classes.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.440
And then after that, if it is discerned that
she has a vocation here and she feels that

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.540
call as well, then she would request to make
first profession of vows.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.629
So this begins the time of temporary profession.

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.629
And the temporary professed Sisters, they
have more responsibility in the community.

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.400
They have less study time and less classes,
although they still have them, but they are

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.489
working more in the community.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.239
They are going out more doing ministries and
then, so this time of temporary profession

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.910
lasts for about 4 years.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.610
It could be extended according to Canon Law.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.519
And then after the time of temporary profession,
the woman who is in temporary vows can request

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.360
to make perpetual vows.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.209
And the blue band symbolizes that the Sisters
has made final vows, because we make a special

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:50.090
consecration to Our Lady at our final vows.
