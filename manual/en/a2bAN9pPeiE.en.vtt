00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.940
Here's an idea--
"Super Mario Brothers"

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.747
is the world's greatest
piece of surrealist art.

00:00:04.747 --> 00:00:06.655
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:08.070
[DING]

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.200
Mario might not seem
that weird to you

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.100
because it's such a huge
part of our culture.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.225
But let's say that you had
to explain it to someone

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:15.820
who'd never heard of it before.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.900
You can eat a flower
that lets you spit fire.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.110
Walking mushrooms.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.160
There's a guy who throws
armadillo-type things

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.040
from a cloud.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.240
There are turtles that
throw hammers at you,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.030
and they are called
the Hammer Brothers.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.095
Sometimes, you can ride a
dinosaur that poops eggs.

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.720
This doesn't sound like the work
of savvy Japanese businessmen.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.250
It sounds like the
ravings of a madman.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.770
I might as well be saying stuff
like, we're in the desert,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.440
and the clocks are melting.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.940
It's raining businessmen.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.700
There are elephants, and they
have sousaphones for trunks.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.330
Wait.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.700
This level of nonsense
is exactly why "Mario"

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.210
is a surrealist masterpiece.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.390
It's a little complicated.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.629
But surrealist artwork is based
upon the idea of non-sequitur.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.920
Non-sequitur is kind of like
when you're having a dream

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.960
and your dad is a lawnmower and
your house is made of cheese

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.330
and you go back in time to
visit George Washington.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.940
But for some reason, it
all kind of makes sense.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.920
A giant mechanical
elephant made of a boiler?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.499
Of course.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.290
Why not put a headless
woman in there, too?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.500
Big stone castle on a
floating rock in the sky.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.430
A very unfriendly-looking,
winged, wooden battleship.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.010
You go ahead and
you try to tell me

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.843
this stuff doesn't look
like "Mario," really

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.070
the only difference being
that you can play "Mario,"

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.020
but you can't really
play a Dali painting.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.630
When surrealism began, these
ideas were really radical.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.710
Now, non-sequitur is just
a part of our culture.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.094
It doesn't even
phase us anymore.

00:01:28.094 --> 00:01:29.760
Maybe we have "Mario"
to thank for that.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.610
For instance, we don't
even bat an eyelash

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.470
at using a slingshot to launch
birds at buildings built

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.330
by pigs or using a gigantic,
sticky ball to pick up

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.634
objects for the space king.

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:41.050
Because video games
are constantly

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.690
challenging our ideas about
what's normal or even possible,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.690
maybe we have them to
thank for some of our more

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.260
insane accomplishments.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.010
At this point, it seems
like we might even

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.450
live in a surreal world, thanks
to a tiny, Italian plumber.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.770
What kinds of stuff has
"Mario" inspired you to do?

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.560
Let us know in the comments.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.450
Keep it PG.
