00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.300
Are you okay?

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.940
Yes.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.940
Here, come over here

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400
I still think we should have stopped at that biker bar

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.380
Shown 'em your hog (laughs)

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.380
Why?

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.860
Are you trying to set some sort of record

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.860
of how many times I can get beaten up in one night?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040
You know if we were fencing you would have been in serious trouble

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.220
I still would have punched you

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.260
Sorry I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
think that people around here are getting the wrong idea about

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
you and me

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.680
what idea is that?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.700
that we're involved

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.560
Which we're not

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.080
no

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.220
definitely not

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.380
because you hate me

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.780
yes, very much

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.320
Why? What's wrong?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560
Nothing. No. Absolutely nothing

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
Which is why I am going to walk you to your door

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
and bid you goodnight
