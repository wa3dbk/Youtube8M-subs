Hi, I am a practicing Eye Care Professional,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.380
and I would like to tell you a little bit
about the latest scientific information on

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.860
dry eye - an eye condition that affects millions
of people. Everyone s eyes produce tears.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.810
In healthy eyes, these tears help keep the
surface of your eyes well lubricated for blinking,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.160
maintain a smooth and clear surface, bring
nutrients to the eye tissues, and also protect

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.700
against bacteria, infection, and airborne
dirt. In the case of people suffering from

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.790
dry eye, their tears are not produced in adequate
amounts, or the tears don t have the right

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.840
ingredients and therefore do not work properly.
Dry eye can be quite debilitating and patients

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.880
with this condition may experience dryness,
burning, itching, scratchiness, fluctuating

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.650
or blurred vision, and heightened sensitivity
to light. Some patients experience excessive

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.050
tearing because the tear-producing glands
are trying to compensate for the eye s abnormal

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.689
production of tears. If left untreated, chronic
dry eye can damage the surface of the eye,

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.880
interfere with vision and limit day-to-day
activities such as driving, computer use and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.270
reading. New research has linked dry eye to
the activation of the body s immune system

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.109
on the surface of the eye. This immune response,
or inflammation, takes place on the part of

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.249
the eye responsible for producing tears. Normally,
inflammation arises in the face of a toxin

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:32.939
that the body is trying to remove, however
inflammation around the eye can be triggered

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.229
by a number of other factors, such as environmental
conditions, use of certain medications, some

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.719
surgical procedures, hormonal changes during
menopause, autoimmune disorders, contact lens

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.929
use, and more. When the tissues of the eye
become inflamed, this affects tear production;

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.799
either the amount of tears is decreased or
the quality of the tears is poor. As the eye

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.700
gets drier, it becomes more inflamed and starts
into a downward cycle: increasing dryness

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.440
causes increased inflammation which affects
the quality and quantity of tears which in

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.250
turn leads to more dryness and so on. In light
of the new research on the role of inflammation

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.610
in dry eye, doctors are now focusing more
on getting at the root of the problem by targeting

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.030
inflammation rather than only managing symptoms
with artificial tears. If an eye doctor believes

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.120
that inflammation is playing a role in your
dry eye, they may prescribe a medicated eye

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.310
drop that works differently than artificial
tear drops to help treat the inflammation

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.110
and break the cycle. By getting the inflammation
under control, the irritation will decrease,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.210
leading to healthier tear production, and
long-term symptom relief. Default Absatz-Standardschriftart
