00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:03.004
(soft music)

00:00:08.868 --> 00:00:10.874
- Hi, I'm commercial
photographer Tony Roslund.

00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:13.708
I specialize in product, food,
and architecture photography.

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:15.264
I'm in the Pacific Northwest.

00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:16.475
I'm going to walk you through

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:19.725
what you can expect from this tutorial.

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:24.203
I'm going to cover all the equipment,

00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:26.552
cameras, lenses, lighting, modifiers,

00:00:26.552 --> 00:00:27.999
and other essential tools onset

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.997
that you need too create images

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.956
to move your product or service.

00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:34.847
I'm not just talking
about modern-day DSLR's,

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:36.662
Nikons, Canons, and things like that.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:38.733
We also get into point-and-shoot,

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.904
micro four thirds, Sony cameras,

00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:42.867
we get into medium format cameras,

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:44.233
we cover all of the equipment

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:47.893
that's available on the market today.

00:00:47.893 --> 00:00:49.306
We go through elaborate sets, we go

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:50.923
through simple one-light sets,

00:00:50.923 --> 00:00:53.395
we cover all kinds of
stuff in this tutorial.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:55.208
You get to see my mistakes,

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:56.606
you get to see my successes,

00:00:56.606 --> 00:01:00.023
and you get to see everything in between.

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:03.383
After I take each photograph, we're going

00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:04.942
to analyze it onscreen to find out

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:07.037
what I like and what I don't like.

00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:08.201
You're going to be with me as we make

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.080
the adjustments to tweak each image

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.718
into what we had in our head

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.453
before we even started the shot.

00:01:13.453 --> 00:01:14.913
You're going to see how
it all comes together

00:01:14.913 --> 00:01:17.830
and learn how to do that, yourself.

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:22.240
We're going to be covering
four different types

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.217
of photography, starting
with catalog photography.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.573
This is a type of
photography you would use

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:28.363
in a website or a print catalog.

00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:30.526
We'll go from there into
editorial photography,

00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:34.447
which is more stylized shot,
would be used in magazines.

00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:36.760
Then we'll move into a
segment for startups,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.532
for those companies that want to do

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.829
their own photography in-house.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.228
Then we'll finish it off with big-budget

00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:44.311
advertising-style photos.

00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:49.796
We spent several months
building a curriculum

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:52.152
that we spread out over 12 photo shoots

00:01:52.152 --> 00:01:54.929
that cover those four
genres of photography.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.475
I've broken it down into four categories

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:59.017
because the process, equipment used,

00:01:59.017 --> 00:02:01.480
and my approach to each
of those is different,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.612
and you're going to need to be familiar

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:04.148
with all four types if you want

00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:07.481
to be a successful product photographer.

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:09.845
I've watched a lot of tutorials

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:11.248
on photography in my day.

00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:13.531
The problem is that they're
all missing something.

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.776
They take you through the photo shoot,

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:16.019
but not the post-production,

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.352
they take you though the post-production,

00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:18.863
but don't show you how they shot it,

00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:20.329
or they show you the finished images,

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.141
but they don't show you
how they created them.

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:26.600
We're going to cover all of
that here in this tutorial.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.869
Whether you're brand new to photography

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.748
or you're a seasoned veteran, I've got

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:31.833
something in this course for everybody.

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:32.666
I'm going to walk you through

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.608
the very basic principles and fundamentals

00:02:34.608 --> 00:02:36.223
of product photography.

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.245
I'm going to share with you some

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:38.772
of the tips and tricks that I've learned

00:02:38.772 --> 00:02:40.303
along the way, and hopefully
you can implement those

00:02:40.303 --> 00:02:43.025
into your photography workflow right away.

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:45.033
This tutorial is also for businesses

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:47.601
that want to get their
photography in-house.

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:48.898
If you have a product that you need to get

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:51.697
on the web or into a
catalog, marketing materials,

00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:53.791
this is the perfect course for you.

00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.651
In addition to the videos, we also have

00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:57.443
a private Facebook group where myself

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.336
and the other EDU instructors

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.084
can interact with you and give you

00:03:01.084 --> 00:03:03.489
critique, feedback, and advice.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.261
We want to see the images that you create

00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.266
using the techniques that we give you.

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:08.712
This community is there to help you

00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:10.210
improve your photography.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.429
I'm there to help you
improve your photography,

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.523
all of the other EDU
alumni and instructors

00:03:14.523 --> 00:03:17.143
are there to help you
improve your photography.

00:03:17.143 --> 00:03:18.757
You're also going to get an audio podcast

00:03:18.757 --> 00:03:20.133
where I sit down with Gary Martin

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.600
and Rob Grimm of RGG EDU and we discuss

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.326
pricing, marketing, and
other business techniques.

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:28.455
This is a very casual conversation

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:30.203
during the podcast with the three of us

00:03:30.203 --> 00:03:31.861
just talking about things that have worked

00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:33.998
and haven't worked for us in business.

00:03:33.998 --> 00:03:36.208
When I first started out
in commercial photography,

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:38.321
there was nothing like this on the market.

00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.400
There was nowhere I could turn

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.995
to get information about
pricing, negotiating,

00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:44.774
dealing with clients, SEO, social media.

00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:47.001
All of that stuff is in this podcast.

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.054
It's like having a mentor on your iPad

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:52.105
that you can fast-forward
and rewind any time you want.

00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:53.289
And finally, you're going to get

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.115
an interactive iBook that you can use

00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:57.824
as a reference guide or
a tool when you're onset

00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:00.277
working through your
product photography images.

00:04:00.277 --> 00:04:02.358
You could spend semesters in school trying

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:04.869
to learn this stuff through
a photography program,

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.281
or you can spend a few hundred bucks

00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:08.429
and walk through 12 different photo shoots

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:12.639
with a working photographer
right here at RGG EDU.

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.785
I can't wait to see what
you do with the information.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:16.118
Let's get to it.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.663
(breezy music)
