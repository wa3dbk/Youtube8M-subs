00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.930
Can anyone catch Real Madrid at the top of
La Liga?

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.840
20 successive wins by Real Madrid in all competitions
now, it is an astonishing record but their

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.080
4-1 win against Almeria on Friday night did
flatter them a little bit. Of course they

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.050
have got tremendous potency - the third goal
by Cristiano Ronaldo which clinched the match

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.589
was a thing of collective beauty put together
with Karim Benzema, Bale and Ronaldo reminding

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.060
us how good that front three is. But I think
Almeria showed why they are a bit better than

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.539
their league position suggests and why there
are a few people who are a bit sad to see

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.010
their former coach Francisco go recently.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:50.860
This would have been quite a point given El
Real's recent record, they had a penalty saved

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.129
by Iker Casillas and it was a really vital
save with Barcelona dropping points and Atleti

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.829
losing in order to stretch that lead a little
bit further.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.150
He's the latest addition to Villarreal's illustrious
canon of Argentinians down the years, and

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.110
Luciano Vietto has been excellent since arriving
in summer. We had an acknowledgement of his

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.860
roots before Sunday's game at the Calderon
against Atletico as he shared a hug with Diego

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.960
Simeone, the man who gave him his first professional
contract back home at Racing. He then thanked

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:36.220
his former gaffer by scoring a stylish winner
to set the seal on a high quality match and

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.210
end Atleti's 27 match unbeaten run at home
in La Liga.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.789
Neither Real Sociedad nor Athletic Bilbao
have set La Liga alight this season, but Sunday

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:55.170
night's derby was pleasing in terms of intensity
at least under - of course - rainy skies at

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.840
Anoeta. David Moyes had the perfect start
when Carlos Vela (who has scored all La Real's

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.200
goals since the Scot arrived) gave them the
lead early on but the visitors came back strongly

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.800
and equalised with a superb Oscar De Marcos
volley. If it wasn't an indisputably authoritative

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:33.250
performance by La Real, it was encouraging
enough against up-for-it opposition and should

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.220
give Moyes enough of the credit we talked
about last week to move forward.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:48.180
Athletic v Atlético - Athletic are starting
to put a good run together after a patchy

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:59.430
start to the season, only losing once in the
last eight, and have Europa League football

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.860
to look forward to after the Xmas break. Atlético
haven't done too much wrong this season but

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.310
with the relentless pace set by Real Madrid,
they need to cut the (already) 7 point gap

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:32.890
at the top while the leaders are off at the
World Club Cup. Slip up here and Ancelotti

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.620
and company will be laughing into their tagines.
