Now I know that there are a lot of ladies
out there that has become really popular out

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:07.900
there and there are a lot of places out there
where they are doing a lot of really fun vintage

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.211
or pin up photography and some really cute
pieces that you can look for when you are

00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:18.670
going for that. First of all, you can never
go wrong with fishnets. They'll look great

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.960
with your dresses and when you do the pin
up photography they'll add a real nice classic

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.310
touch and you can find them everywhere. Obviously
you are going to want to get some new pairs

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.489
and you can go on E-Bay and again, around
Halloween time a lot of stores will sell them.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.989
Leg Avenue is a really popular line and they
make some nice hose for ladies and they have

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.309
a great great assortment. They have all kinds
of vintage replica hoses that are really nice.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.500
This one has a classic stripe on the back.
As you can see, this one I guess they call

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.250
it the Cuban foot but it just adds real nice.
You know back in the days you always saw the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.019
ladies with the hose with the line up the
back and they are really nice and classic.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.820
These hose here are fishnet with a little
more detailing in them but you can find these

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.430
at a lot of modern day stores; Victoria Secret,
Macy's, you name it. They are a great staple

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.960
when you are doing some fun retro pin up photography
and what not and when you are at the thrift

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.860
stores, go and look in the section where they
have like the bras and the lingerie. I don't

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.211
want to go buy some used stuff like that.

find some of these designs. It might just
look like some poo poo thing sticking out

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.090
