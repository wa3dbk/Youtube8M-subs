00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.300
Fiquane3 asks

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.050
Can you tell us the story how you came to find 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.520
and own your new adorable kitten?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.750
For those of you who don't know

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.700
We've got a new kitten

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.020
Dr.Meemersworth

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.870
Dr.Meemersworth

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.690
This is Dr.Meemersworth

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.290
She's a kitten, she's full of energy 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.640
She's like "I'm a kitten"

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.580
She is like everywhere

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.510
She's coming to my shoulder

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.310
she has claws and I'm not wearing a shirt 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.860
so...

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.500
Hmmm mum!

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.070
Why does the kitten have the Spudgy voice?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.980
I think she's going to make a ...

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.550
OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.340
Can you just grab her?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.520
So four years ago, when we moved to Korea there were

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.450
Four years ago~~

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.960
She's just like running around and hitting things

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.230
So when we moved to Korea four years ago

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.020
there wasn't really a big pet culture, right?

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.840
Not at all

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.360
At the time when we adopted Spudgy,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.070
we rarely saw any dogs in our neighborhood

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.090
In fact, people seem very inexperienced with animals

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.820
lot of people who saw Spudgy was deathly afraid of him

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.320
For those of you who doesn't know Spudgy

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.700
He's our little Pekinese dog 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.560
and he's like this big 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.030
and we spoke in Korea and explain it to people 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.100
that he doesn't bite and he's really friendly 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.850
but people will actually try to like 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.460
scale walls and climb elevators

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.260
trying to get away from him 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.930
One of our neighbors actually was

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.310
when we got in the elevator with Spudgy 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.980
she actually physically try to climb up the side of the elevator

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.520
OH NO NONONONO

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.290
And Spudgy, after a long walk, and was exhausted

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.950
and lies flat down on the ground 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.300
he's not threat to anyone

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.520
I wanna give an impression 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.300
I'm gonna be Spudgy, 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.670
what Spudgy looks like in the elevator with that woman, ready?

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.240
I'm gonna give an impression what that woman looked like with Spudgy

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.640
In fact, one time I'd got really annoyed with her 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.410
I'd pick up the Spudgy and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.440
"OH~Gi yeob da !!"

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.460
which means cute and like

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.370
"OH~ BBO BBO HAE~!"

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.490
which means you should kiss, and she was like

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.510
oh~~ no...

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.060
and we waved his little paws to her

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.490
and Spudgy was like this the whole time

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.910
I'd never saw her again in the elevator afterwards

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.340
I think she just decided to take the stairs of the 13th floor from then on 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.560
Don't jump!!

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:04.760
You can't make that jump!!

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.470
Aham! Where were we?

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.790
And even with cats, people are like deathly afraid of them 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.520
Our local coffee shop have 2 cats in it 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.940
and they are really friendly people cats

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.070
all they wanna do is lie in your warm laptop 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.970
and have you pat them 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.090
People who comes to the shop first time 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.820
will like smashed against to the glass door 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.130
and when cat jumps up to the table 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.940
they are like

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.770
they actually physically cowardly go to the corner

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.290
and the people in the coffee shop will explain them the cats are ok

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.610
and the cats are sitting there like this

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.740
That's right be afraid of me, human

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.070
I think the point that we are getting here is that

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.690
people in Korea aren't comfortable with pets yet

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.330
as in are in Western countries like North America or England or Europe

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.440
I think that they haven't been exposed to it in households 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.060
when they see an animal

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.370
think as if it's a wild animal 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.910
rather than something like loved, snuggled and dancing in Kpop video 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.610
If any of don't you 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:03:08.190
So speaking of Spudgy we actually got Spudgy in an animal shelter in Korea

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.690
We did a video about it long time ago 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.630
we're gonna link to it so you can check it out that as well

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.540
But don't if you are sensitive because you're gonna cry

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.970
I'd cried the first time when I saw the video 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.090
and I was in the video 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.510
and I cried the third and the fourth time, it was very moving

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.320
Dr.Meemersworth in the other hand

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.840
we didn't get her from a shelter

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.260
But we didn't got her from a pet store

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.970
and we didn't get her from a kitty mill

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.290
We actually don't support that kind of establishment

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.510
so we don't buy any products from there 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.110
we don't buy animals from there either

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.040
Now we were thinking of originally adopting a cat from an animal shelter

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.190
but we've introduced to cats that are fully grown 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.970
they handled being around with dogs a little bit worth

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.070
Now we didn't get a cat from a shelter

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.490
when we tried to introduce Spudgy to older cats

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.610
Spudgy was ok

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.910
he was like, I'M THE SPUDGY

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.340
But cats that were exposed to dogs that weren't grow up with dogs

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.760
they were so uncomfortable 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.690
We actually took care of our friend's cat for a month when they went back to the States

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.620
And she really didn't like hanging out with Spudgy

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.330
I don't know why, he's such a chilled dog

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.440
But it was pretty funny 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.060
because Spudgy will be lying in the room 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.870
and she would be like

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.490
So we decided to get a kitten instead

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.920
for hopes that if the kitten grow up with Spudgy

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.940
she would be a lot more comfortable with a dog

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.170
now the second problem was that we really wanted to get a Scottish fold kitten

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.540
because we heard that they were really relaxed with other animals 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.140
they really have a chill attitude 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.470
We thought that breed will be the best hanging with Spudgy 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.610
They sound like the exact same animal 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.620
My animal experience is lazy, what's yours?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.940
LAZY~

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.010
We should be best friends

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:51.570
We were really super lucky because 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.890
since we didn't wanna buy a Scottishfold from a breeder

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.710
we happened to have our Korean friend find online 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.240
a super normal Korean family who had a Scottish fold

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.260
happened to have kittens 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.970
and they are not breeders or sellers or anything

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.890
They couldn't have so many cats in their house

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.490
so they were getting rid of their kittens

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.740
So we were looking for a cat looking like this like a long time

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.240
and as soon as our friend said that

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.770
"This is the perfect place for you to go"

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.290
We've got in a taxi right away 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.640
and picked up Dr.Meemersworth instantly 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.960
And the home was really great 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.170
they raised her really perfectly 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.540
We were really sad to see her go

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.770
They gave us a little snuggle blanket and some food for her

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.170
and she already loves us so much 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.190
Snuggles in my head in night time 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.810
and she nibbles my ears when I try to sleep 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.440
No seriously when you have a cat sleeping in your head the entire night

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.970
I actually would have a warm blanket on my head

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.170
than my ear gone in the morning

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.810
Hey when I wake up, she hugs my entire pillow

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.120
Here's like my pillow and here's my head

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.860
kitten wants to snuggle 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.590
I don't have any real estate in my pillow 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.510
Kitten in my pillow 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.540
There's a kitten in my pillow, 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.440
puppy in my feet 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.170
and a giant manthrowky man warrior

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.010
And I have this much bed space left 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.210
You so fuzzy and cute

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.820
You so fuzzy and cute

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.370
And that's my cate meowing

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.820
Isn't that heart breaking?

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.740
Please get me in the video again

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.160
That's it for this week's TLDR

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.570
and if you have a question for next TLDR

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.010
leave your question on the comment section below

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.220
Or check out the questions that are already asked

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.330
and if you see a question that you like

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.140
you can thumb it up

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.470
and if we like that question 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.370
maybe we'll answer it 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.010
And lastly don't forget to subscribe for more TLDRs

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.160
where we won't be talking about that much more about our kitten

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:32.290
but will probably ruining our video 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.790
I'm a doctor you idiot

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.123
DR, Stop speaking in Spudgy's voice
