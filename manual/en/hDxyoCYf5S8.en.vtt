00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.911
The idea of having a festival like this in Saint-Emilion is great!

00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:24.596
There are a few festivals that mix wine and jazz...

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:29.074
But it's the first time that it takes place in the Wine Mecca! 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.500
That's what's important, because, the Saint-Emilion village

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:36.049
and Saint-Emilion is known worldwide!

00:00:36.913 --> 00:00:40.828
Wine is an art! Winemaking is really

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:44.286
something artistic: the relation, creation,

00:00:44.473 --> 00:00:48.983
tones, mixtures, taste, the air,

00:00:49.222 --> 00:00:53.176
silence... everything! It's a pure product...

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:56.298
and music is pure, it's there and it disappears.

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:58.339
Wine, it's there and it disappears...

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.809
Everything is here...

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.555
This is why I love this village : this promontory,  

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:08.379
is, I think, one of the world's most beautiful balconies.

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:10.420
This is why I love Saint-Emilion :

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.897
the vineyards, the village, stone, the King's tower.

00:01:15.648 --> 00:01:19.283
But let's go and see some places of the festival...

00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:21.787
and wander around in the streets...

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.682
The Dominicain's room which is a showcase for the festival...

00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:34.518
Currently, there's a concert of piano with Edouard Ferlet.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.560
We are going to go towards the Palais Cardinal's moat

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:43.240
where the big concerts take place...

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.220
And of course, the value of wine, here, goes hand in hand

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:52.990
with love of music... I think!

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.670
People that like the good wine, they like the good music!

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.710
So it's a very wonderful event in an incredible place,

00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:04.990
so I'm very much happy to be here!

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:11.490
I think that wine and music are very interrelated

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:18.790
because it's a very relaxing experience

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:23.270
to sit with a glass of wine and listen to nice music!

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.640
We are now going to proceed with the inductions.

00:02:26.708 --> 00:02:29.100
We are particularly pleased to welcome you.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.640
It's always a pleasure to come to Saint-Emilion.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:53.710
This village is magical, the word isn't too strong...

00:02:54.147 --> 00:02:55.290
it's beautiful!

00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:59.400
I think the mix between wine and jazz is unique.

00:02:59.837 --> 00:03:02.560
This is the festival's second edition, I'm well informed,

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:03.690
I think it's a great idea!

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:06.840
We have a wonderful evening, a lot of people...

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.690
The moat is going to fill up and host 1300 people

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:13.070
since tonight is sold out...

00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:15.770
for the concert of Chic and Nile Rodgers...

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.620
Every Chic song goes good with wine...

00:03:37.012 --> 00:03:39.060
there is not one that doesn't go perfect!

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:40.950
It depends on the type of wine!

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:47.180
So... with Saint-Emilion, that would be...

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:50.350
probably, one of our more classy song...

00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:53.430
something like Good times would be good...

00:03:53.872 --> 00:04:04.910
because it's a classy and classic but still feels good...

00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:07.770
so it could be a serious song...

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:10.750
but it can also be a festive song...
