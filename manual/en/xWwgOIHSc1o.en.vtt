00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.299
What's up with the color color colors of Chameeeleons,
they come and go.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.529
They come and go!

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.059
Changing color is a rarity in the animal world,
and also a mystery, until now!

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.770
Hey everybody thank you for watching DNews
today.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.020
I'm Trace and I am right here on our brand
new set!

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.279
Chameleons change color so well, and are so
well known across the planet for doing so,

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.160
that their name is synonymous with someone
who is good at changing their look, behavior

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.610
or opinions as their situation changes.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.230
Most people think chameleons change color
for camouflage, but that's not it at all!

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.790
Only the males can change color, and they
do so to communicate danger to other nearby

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.550
chameleons, or for a mating display.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.550
Ladies.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.550
*wink*

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.870
It's a pretty dramatic show when a chameleon
swaps its green for bright red, and thanks

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.890
to new research, we now know HOW they do it.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.460
Researchers from the University of Geneva
looked at the skin cells of chameleons to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.420
observe how they change color.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.710
Within their skin, it turns out, chameleons
have cells called iridophores.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.080
Suspended within those cells are tiny guanine
nanocrystals which are formed into a lattice.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.290
When relaxed, the chameleons’ iridophore
lattices are contracted, and mainly reflect

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.860
blue light, but when excited the chameleon
expands and three dimensional lattices expand

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.390
along with them, reflecting different wavelengths
of light!

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.750
Below that layer, there's a layer of skin
with even larger nanocrystals which reflect

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.600
near-infrared light; providing "passive thermal
protection."

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.880
Which is great, because these cold-blooded
animals can't change their body temperature;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.421
changing that base layer may be one way they
can affect how much near-infrared light, and

00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:44.570
therefore heat, is absorbed into their body,.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.979
Camouflage is also called cryptic coloration;
or a color and pattern that makes an animal

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.140
difficult to discern from its surroundings;
concealing it.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.580
The ability to CHANGE colors isn't unique
to chameleons -- some fish, frogs, insects,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.280
crustaceans, cephalopods, and other lizards
can do it too, but they don't have nanocrystals…

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.950
this research is the first time that's been
seen in reptiles.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.979
And other animals use different methods of
color shifting.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.700
Cuttlefish, for example, can also change their
colors at will; but rather than crystal-filled

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.090
iridophores, they use chromatophores.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.480
Chromatophores are sacs of a single pigment
of color surrounded by muscle.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.670
The cuttlefish has learned to widen or constrict
that sac to show more or less of that color.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.010
Invertebrates like cephalopods use these chromatophores
too, and for more on that you can check out

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.200
our video exploring how the disco clam can
reflect light like a disco ball!

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.180
Over time, evolution, mutation and simply
breeding with others can cause changes in

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.290
the colors of species, humans included -- all
blue-eyed humans descend from a single mutated

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.290
ancestor.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.380
Usually because those animals which have these
colorful adaptations tend to survive better.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.170
Zebra stripes confuse predatory eyes, helping
to disguise individuals and making the herd

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.069
look more massive; background matching camouflage
helps both predators like tigers blend with

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.040
their environment; as well as helping their
prey hide by resembling it's surroundings…

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.349
but these adaptations take many generations
to develop!

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.370
Active color change is pretty rare in the
Animal Kingdom.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.349
Before this research, scientists believed
chameleons changed color the same as cuttlefish

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.709
or octopuses, but once they put the skin cells
into a super-magnifying electron microscope,

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.739
they were able to see this unique and super
cool system for reflecting light!

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.630
How do you think humans camouflage into our
surroundings?

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.630
Do we?

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:40.810
Why or why not...
