hello namaste

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.609
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.340
Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to
make chicken chimichanga, this is very

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.980
easy to make you know here I've got some chicken which I have boiled in my

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.120
chicken stock

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.820
ok and all you need to do is just shred the chicken for the chimichanga and this

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.410
chicken is very nicely cooked so it's
very easy to shred them out the chicken

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640
is all shredded and this is what i'm going to use in my chimichanga because

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.300
this is cooked in the stock it's very
flavorful and rest of the ingredients are

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.379
allready so we are ready to make chimichanga. For this just put this refried

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.390
beans you know if you want to make your
chimichangas thin you can make little you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.630
can add little less but I want my chimichangas to be nice and fat here on this you know

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.330
put this shredded chicken you know whenever i'm making it for myself at home a lot

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.950
of chicken goes into making my
chimichanga and now on this put guacamole

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:41.670
haha you know spread it and wow this is
good on this add some salsa in this add

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.430
some sour cream just fold it in the
center like this

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.729
ok lot of people don't even add egg
white but I love to make sure that this

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.070
is sealed properly you know they just
roll it and put it in hot oil and they

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.229
feel somehow I don't feel comfortable
doing that so I'm just going to apply a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.200
little bit of egg white on this so that
this seals the chimchangas properly then

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.160
fall it and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.590
here here just press the stuffing inside
and put this top tortilla and pull it

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.210
back and because there is egg white here it's going to seal properly

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.270
this is nice and round chimichangas in the  hot oil and we're going to cook till

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.870
they're nice and crispy; these chicken
chimichangas

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.370
Wow mm-hmm

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.620
what a stuffing what a stuffing wow make this tortillas fresh as I've shown and your chimichangas

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.780
