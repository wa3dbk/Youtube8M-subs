00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.170
Hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder from cars dot com
everyone knows

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.420
what rolls royces they know it stands
for ultra-luxury

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.390
and prestige but they don't know is what
a current rolls-royce looks like it's

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.710
not this will be old-fashioned looking
thing

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.349
the current rolls-royce looks like this
well

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.439
actually does look like girls yet now to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.890
the sky might look like the flagship
rolls-royce phantom

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.910
its actually 8 2010 ghost

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.829
it a little bit smaller and instead up
300 eighty thousand dollars it starts at

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.270
a mere

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.030
two hundred forty five thousand dollars
it's the roles for the rest of us

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.399
as you might expect a rolls-royce has
lots of tricks and frills

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.000
starting with the doors Star Trek number
one apparently it's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.820
rainy in Great Britain not only do you
get a umbrella

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.440
in both on front doors you get the
nicest umbrella you ever touch

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.760
this umbrella is too good for me Star
Trek number two

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.019
back door opens this way it's a coach
store

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.280
Star Trek number three push this button
here

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.350
i like it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.329
our cars option up to three hundred five
thousand dollars this panoramic moonroof

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.250
is seven thousand dollars front and rear
ventilated seats that heated and cooled

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.479
thirty five hundred dollars front
massaging seats

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.740
eleven hundred dollars rear massaging
seats another

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.689
eleven hundred dollars these so-called
picnic table 6 with a little extension

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.500
for your laptop

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.329
twenty-eight hundred dollars now right
above the picnic tables

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.259
the rear feeder configuration has two
large screens 19 inches diagonally

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.780
in play DVD the usual stuff now you can
fit three people in the back seat

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.520
but with the individual see
Configuration six thousand dollars you

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.820
get all sorts of control

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.430
%uh either side gets backrest adjustment
bottom question adjustment there's

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.270
a lumbar control I have to mention even
though this car shorter

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.259
from bumper to bumper than the short
wheelbase phantom it's actually roomier

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.330
inside it's a totally different platform
and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.420
it actually has a much more powerful
engine with more than 560 horsepower

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.400
does 0-60 in less than five seconds

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.110
pretty impressive for a car that weighs
two and three-quarter tons

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.120
but this is not a sports car this isn't
trying to be

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.440
what's on the competitors are from from
Porsche and Bentley

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.540
cetera it's all about isolation and
comfort

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.690
it's exceptionally quiet comfortable

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.209
luxurious inside the wood all comes from
the same tree

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.220
so it has matching grain in it ages the
same a collar stays the same

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.730
across the car there are no fewer than 8
leather hides used

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.950
in one car our car actually has an
extended leather

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.180
and door pocket lighting package for
twenty one hundred dollars

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.170
a little more leather and when you put
your hand into a pocket like here in the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.659
door

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.890
a light comes on only when your hand is
in there

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.890
