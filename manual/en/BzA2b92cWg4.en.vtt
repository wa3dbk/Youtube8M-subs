[Opening Music]

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.800
Hi, my name is Kevin Castle.  I'm one of the wildlife veterinarians for the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.800
National Park Service. Our role is to help protect the health of wildlife

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.800
that people enjoy in our national parks. Usually when you think of wildlife, you think of

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.800
things that are pretty obvious, like deer or elk. But we also are involved

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.800
with protecting the health of things that aren't quite so obvious, like bats.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.800
When we do take a closer look at bats, what we see is something that's very disturbing.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.800
There's a fungal disease called White-nose  syndrome, that is affecting bat

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.800
populations across the country.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.800
[Tom Rodhouse:] White-nose presents a tremendous challenge to the agency,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.533
to the National Park Service is particular, because bats are so common.

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.499
They actually are very widespread, they show up in buildings 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.766
and in bridges, they're in natural structures like caves... 

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.766
[Elaine Leslie:] The park service really cares about bats, not just because

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.766
of their importance as far as ecosystem services,

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:05.766
but their importance as far as species that we're mandated to take 

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.766
care of, to steward for the next generation.

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:13.766
[Pat Reed:] They are a major part of the system that they

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:19.732
live within, particularly when it comes to eating insects. They eat millions of insects on a daily basis.

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:23.733
[Paul Cryan:] These are free pest control service

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:27.733
that farmers are benefiting from all over the continent.

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:33.266
Without those bats, the cost to agriculture could be really substantial.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:37.266
[Shawn Thomas:] There was a study last year that indicated that bats

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:41.266
actually provide billions of dollars worth of ecosystem services.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:45.266
They actually prey on a lot of agricultural pests.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:49.266
And they reduce the need for farmers and other people working in 

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.732
agriculture to use pesticides.

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:58.166
[Paul Cryan:] Bats are just amazing animals, and there's nothing else like them on earth.

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:02.166
[Tom Rodhouse:] Here in this covered bridge we've got bats roosting up

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:06.166
in the rafters there, squeaking away, you might be able to hear them.

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:10.166
Just the one of many examples of how versatile bats are, and how they can take

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:14.166
advantage of many kinds of features, including those that we provide them.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:18.166
[Elaine Leslie:] So bats have such an important role in the ecosystem for

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:22.166
so many reasons, and not just natural, but cultural as well.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:26.166
That it is our job, it is part of our stewardship

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:31.799
responsibilities to make sure that bats are here for future generations.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.800
[Vickie Carson:] The very mission of the park service is to preserve and protect

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.800
and provide for enjoyment, so we're supposed to take care

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.800
of the resources that are here in the park, but also help people understand them

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.800
and appreciate them and learn about them.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.800
[Kevin Castle:] Even without White-Nose Syndrome, some bat

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.800
populations have been struggling recently. National Park Service provides

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.800
a great way to keep an eye on some of those species.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.800
[Steve Thomas:] Here at Mammoth Cave we have two species of endangered bats, 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.300
one species is the Gray Bat, and the other is the Indiana Bat.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.300
[Pat Reed:] It's particularly important, as them being a threatened and endangered species, 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.366
that we protect those particular species.

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:18.366
[Tom Rodhouse:] National Park Service over 300 park units that are scattered across the country,

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:22.366
widely representing different kinds of habitats, different

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:26.366
species of bats, different hibernacula types, and environments.

00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:30.366
[Shawn Thomas:] They have different needs at different times of the year.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:34.366
During summer, a lot of our bats form maternity colonies. They're raising their 

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:38.366
pups and they like to be closer to entrances in warmer, drier spots.

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:42.366
In the winter when they transition to hibernation, they need areas

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:46.366
that are deeper and colder so they can drop their body temperatures 

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:50.366
and remain in torpor. And so there is a whole different set of caves in our park that 

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:54.366
they can choose to meet those particular needs. 

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:58.366
[Tom Rodhouse:] These animals are worth saving, they're worth fighting for.

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:03.899
They're really an important part of our collective natural resource heritage in this country.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.900
[Kevin Castle:] Bats are obviously an important parts of ecosystems and they need our protection.  

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.233
In the next part of this series, we'll investigate this emerging threat -- White-nose syndrome.
