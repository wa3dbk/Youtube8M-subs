00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.850
Okay so our repair is going to start

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.130
with this is 
consider very severe scratching which

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:29.039
we've done with a 200 grit diamond pad
as you can see the scratches through the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.290
Quartz and the resin okay so we have a
nice circle. See the scratches? See it's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.980
definitely hazy? Okay so we're going to
bring this up I'm going to quickly go

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.530
through the steps just to show you where
you need to be in order to start with

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.819
the Quartz Renew. Okay so the
scratching that we have in the quartz

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:04.409
top is 200 grit level, we've done some
quick polishing with that 200 soma pad

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.490
and we're going to work our way up from
here so I'm going to the 400 grit pad

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.430
and I'm going to lightly mist my area
I've already traced around the haze that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.640
was there with the China pencil you know
whatever works for you China pencil

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.060
works great but does help you keep
focused on the area that you're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.870
polishing without making your area too
large. So and using the soma pads we

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.050
are going to use a slightly higher rpm
than we would with a resin pad. Resin pad

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.870
we would go love, very low rpms and at 7 or 800
range.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.450
I'll go slightly higher with this with
wet but I want to go much over a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.050
thousand as we do not have a water feed
and primarily the reason for keeping the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.509
RPMs low is so that your water is not
evaporating  you know so quickly that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.190
you can
keep the top wet, so we keep a low rpm,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.420
low feed rate, water will pretty much
stay on the surface and you don't have

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.120
to mist the top every couple seconds to
keep it wet. As soon as the product gets

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.990
as soon as the area gets dry so you have
a high potential of burning  the resin

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:39.360
on the top very quickly. So when you're
lower low rpms, plenty water low feed

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.400
rate.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:56.190
Okay so we're at the 800 grit level
now with the Soma pads and we've

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.980
removed our damage but as you can see
during that process as which happens

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.020
with quartz is the Snake Skin has been
removed, or at least partially removed

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.750
during the process. So trying to get a good
shot here where you can really see the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:28.680
difference in the Snake Skin between the
factory level which is here, and where

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.430
we've been polishing which is right
there. and this is my black color and as

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:44.940
you notice they react quite differently
to polishing okay but pretty much the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:56.180
same effect with my black piece as you
can see it's my Snake Skin back here and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:04.170
kind of a glass-like finish on my my
polished area. Okay it's really no

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.040
Snake Skin at all.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.810
Okay so we worked our way up through the
800 grit level with the Soma Pads and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.170
now we're going to do the last step of
polishing with the pads. This is 1500

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:29.720
grit the polishing we've been doing up
to this point has been a low rpm, slow

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.610
feed rate and to get a nice even finish
1500 while traditionally the resin pads

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.950
would go for 3,000 this stops at 1500
and this would be completely dry. All the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:54.380
previous steps we did wet and the last
step will have to be dry the pad is such

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.690
a fine grit that if you do it wet it
will gum up immediately and you won't

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.910
get good results. So this will be
completely dry and higher rpm. We're

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.510
going to run around 1800 rpm and this
makes pretty quick work of it. This will

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:19.000
be the last step like I said and it will
it will pop the color pretty quickly and

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.160
we will also move across the surface
quickly as well.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:50.380
A 1500 grit Soma pad polishing and as
you can see there's a little bit of

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:58.840
residual hazing at this point, our
Snake Skin is definitely gone, mostly gone

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.790
in our repair area, as you can see in the
forefront there the Snake Skin is pretty

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:09.910
prominent, that's the factory finish.
So the Quartz Renew™ will definitely take

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.780
it from here and so I wanted to
basically do this to give you a visual

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.290
to understand where you need to start
with this with the Quartz Renew™. Okay we

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:35.410
finished our 1,500 soma polishing,
we've removed all of our damage and you

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.730
know brought our gloss level up so that
as much as we can go with the pads. So

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:48.220
show you on each piece here. There's the
black you can see the Snake Skin has

00:06:48.220 --> 00:07:01.960
been removed and most of our repair area.
Our sheen is is almost there. The Quartz

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.080
Renew™ should be able to take it from
here without too much struggle, but you

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.980
can see when I mentioned that there's
residual hazing and that's what the

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.820
Quartz Renew™ addresses, this is what I
mean

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:24.970
and so our color you know I would say
is about 80% so that's a point of

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:30.160
reference. The black is obviously
probably the hardest color to work on so

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.330
that's why I want to show this as an
example, and here's a typical color, this

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:41.800
is probably 80% of the colors out there
and the states anyway or this type of

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:49.060
color and it's definitely a little more
forgiving but as you can see the

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:55.320
Snake Skin is also gone  in our repair area here and you can

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:06.770
see from that level. So the Quartz Renew™ will
definitely take it from here.
