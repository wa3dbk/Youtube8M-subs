00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.080
I went to study abroad in Troyes.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.770
It's two hours away from Paris. It made me realize that engineering is universal.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.490
Like, you can take any engineering class in any country

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.199
and still you can succeed in it and do well.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.029
The program lasted for six weeks

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.680
but I actually met, the people I met

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.800
but I actually met, the people I met

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.439
on the study abroad program, we did the Eurotrip together

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.539
for extra five weeks.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.050
So overall it was over two months, like, spending it backpacking in Europe and stuff. 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.890
The day after I graduated, I hopped on an airplane and flew to Germany

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.490
and I was there for about a week and from
there

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.520
they flew me out to China and then India

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.870
then back to Germany then Hungary then Poland

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.199
and back to Germany

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.860
and then I finished off the project with a week in North Carolina. 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.800
It was an internship and the company I worked for was Borg Warner

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.430
and they, they're an automotive supplier company.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.390
Some of the skills that 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.850
it definitely gave me were

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.010
the ability to keep track of a lot of time zones
at once.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.170
I was in Peru for two weeks

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.780
and we volunteered in a village called Chipani

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.470
This village was at a very high elevation in a very remote area.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.979
So we got there by hiking. The way the women
would cook food was

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.729
just burn wood in the house

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.810
and that was very bad because it was a very small, enclosed area

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.869
and it was basically very unhealthy and equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes a day. 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.760
We built stoves for them with chimneys 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.770
that, you know, got the smoke out

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.360
and then we had the chimneys high up so that

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.880
the embers wouldn't catch on to the straw and burn the hut.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.409
While we were there

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.490
that actually happened. One of the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.460
the kitchen of the school caught on fire because of the stoves that they had

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.060
so it actually validated the project that we were doing.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.940
I went to Imperial College London. It's in the UK. 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.690
I went to Imperial College London. It's in the UK. 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.710
We were researching about this particular

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.720
nanoparticles and their responses to cells.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.590
I'm from Indonesia so being here

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.890
in the US is sort of like a study abroad, so being in the UK

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.770
it's sort of like another study abroad for me. Just being there,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.900
being exposed to different countries, well, different people from 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.769
different countries. It's not bad that we are different. It's like we are

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.719
we are complimenting each other.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.029
I went to Hong Kong and I studied at the Hong Kong 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.019
University of Science and Technology. I was there for four and a half months.

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.540
I think I learned

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.249
how to communicate better with people
that have English as their second language.

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.019
I might become fluent in Mandarin but I very
well

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.239
in my profession am going to be talking to people in English and

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.659
almost all the time over there you're talking
to people

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.679
that English is their second language.

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.419
The most meaningful aspect was

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.489
every day to be, you know,

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.469
on the other side of the world.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.269
Just to have that experience and

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.249
to come to a company and say

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.749
you know, I was put outside all my friends,
all my comfort zones. It was just overall

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:03.319
such a great opportunity to, you know, be immersed 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.839
in something that's so different than the US and just be challenged

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:08.089
you know, on a daily basis.
