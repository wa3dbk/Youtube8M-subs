00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.760
Motorola MOTOSURF A3100.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.390
It seems that Motorola is keen to put a poor
2008 behind them with the launch of some interesting

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.590
products at the beginning of 2009.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.699
Chief amongst these is the new Motorola MOTOSURF
A3100, a 3.5G touchscreen device which is

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.460
one of Motorola's most powerful handsets to
date.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.760
The MOTOSURF A3100 is a Windows Mobile 6.1
smartphone with support for 3.5G data and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.050
wi-fi.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.670
The display is a 2.8" 240 x 320 pixel touchscreen
- to put that into perspective, it is the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.990
same size as the non-touchscreen panel in
the Nokia N95 8GB and Nokia N96.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.379
We have criticised Motorola recently for not
shipping phones with 3G, but the MOTOSURF

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:10.380
A3100 comes with tri-band 850 / 1900 / 2100
MHz UMTS with support for HSDPA and HSUPA

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.110
high-speed data.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.330
The A3100 also has quad-band GSM, GPRS and
EDGE support.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.000
With built-in wireless LAN connectivity, this
means that you should always be able to get

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.070
a high speed data connection wherever you
go in the world.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.160
Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional is a pretty
familiar operating system these days but Motorola

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.350
have enhanced the A3100 with a customisable
home screen that can display RSS feeds, shortcuts,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.780
the weather, calendar events or one-touch
access to social networking sites.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.860
The MOTOSURF can work with a stylus or finger
on the touchscreen, or alternatively there's

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.100
a rollerball mounted underneath the display.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.590
On the back is a 3 megapixel camera with autofocus,
plus a secondary VGA resolution camera on

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.880
the front for video calling.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.670
It's not the greatest camera in the world,
but for some reason Windows Mobile handsets

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.970
suffer in this respect.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.170
It's certainly a better camera than the one
on the iPhone, however.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.020
As you would expect, the Motorola MOTOSURF
A3100 also supports microSD expandable memory

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.360
(up to 32GB), stereo Bluetooth 2.0 and USB
2.0.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.280
The MOTOSURF also comes with aGPS, so you
can use it with your favourite personal navigation

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.400
or mapping system.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.470
Inside is some sort of Qualcomm MSM 7201A
processor combined with 128MB RAM.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.220
Maximum talktime is quoted as 6.8 hours on
GSM with up to 12 days standby time.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.240
Inevitably, the MOTOSURF will end up being
compared with the iPhone.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.480
One obvious difference between the two devices
is the display - the 2.8" panel on the A3100

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.690
is significantly smaller than the 3.5" unit
on the iPhone, but then the Motorola device

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.319
is smaller and lighter than the Apple and
altogether more pocket-friendly.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.010
The MOTOSURF may lack the "wow factor" of
the iPhone when it comes to looks, but it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.319
is clearly quite an attractive mobile phone
in its own right.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.910
Our biggest complaint?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.590
Well, it's that we have waited so long for
Motorola to produce a handset like the MOTOSURF

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.330
A3100 in the first place.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.680
Motorola could have done with the A3100 in
their line-up twelve months ago.. still, this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.430
looks to be a very capable and appealing device
and hopefully it is an indicator of great

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.980
things to come.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.730
A higher resolution display would have been
nice though.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.180
There's no word on pricing or exact availability,
although Motorola do say that the A3100 should

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.800
be available during Q1 2009 in "multiple regions"
including Asia and Latin America.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.980
There's no reason why the MOTOSURF won't work
in Europe and North America too, so we very

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.460
much hope to see this phone worldwide.
