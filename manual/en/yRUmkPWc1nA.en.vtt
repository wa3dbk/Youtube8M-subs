00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.060
We're going to help you learn your New Zealand
Road Code using the mock theory tests at www.drivingtests.co.nz.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.850
This will make it easier for you to get your
learner licence. Today we'll look at the theory

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.140
section. There are 27 questions in total.
These are the second nine questions.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.269
What is the maximum distance a load may extend
in front of a car?

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.060
This is kind of a trick question. There's
no answer in terms of the distance in front

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.770
of the car because the measurement is taken
from the front edge of the front seat and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.960
your load can extend 3m in front of the front
edge of the front seat. If you have a very

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.100
long bonnet then that might not be very far
in front of the car. If you have a very short

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.300
bonnet it's obviously going to be a lot further.
So the answer to this question is B: 3m in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.300
front of the front edge of the front seat.
Who can legally stop you and perform a roadside

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.329
check of your vehicle. Check all that apply.
Only a police officer can legally stop you

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:16.329
and perform a roadside check of your vehicle.
What's the maximum legal speed limit for a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.780
car towing a trailer on the open road?
When a car tows a trailer its stopping distance

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.119
is increased and its cornering ability is
reduced. Therefore the maximum legal speed

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.130
is also reduced and the answer is 90kph.
Who is responsible for making a passenger

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.549
15 years of age or over put on their safety
belt? It's the passenger's responsibility,

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.530
if they're 15 years or over, to put on their
safety belt.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.530
If the passenger was under 15 years then it
would be the driver's responsibility.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.770
If you have a restricted licence, when can
you carry passengers? Check all that apply.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.340
If you have a restricted licence then you
can, at any time, carry a passenger as long

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.580
as your supervisor with a full driver's licence
who is sitting in the front passenger, seat

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.580
agrees with it. And also between 5am and 10pm
as long as your passengers are your own children,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.780
spouse or de facto partner.
Can you be fined if your vehicle is on the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.209
road and not up to Warrant of Fitness standard?
When you get your Warrant of Fitness, your

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.909
car, at that moment, is roadworthy. But what
could happen the next day is that you have

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:02.909
an accident and suddenly your car isn't roadworthy,
or something could break over time. Therefore

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.349
it's your responsibility to keep your car
roadworthy otherwise it can be a danger to

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.280
other road users. Therefore if a police officer
stops your car and finds that it's not roadworthy

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.280
they may fine you, even though you have a
WoF. So the answer is yes.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.430
Note also that if you have modified your car
you may have invalidated your WoF, too.

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.709
What is the maximum distance a load may overhang
your car behind the rear axle?

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.870
The answer is 4 metres.
However, if the load protrudes more than 1m

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:05.480
behind the rear bumper, you must tie either
a white, red, yellow or orange fluorescent

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.480
flag to it. The flag must be at least 40cm
x 30cm in size and the load cannot drag on

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.280
the ground. This is so that the load is visible
as other vehicles are following you. If another

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.470
vehicle gets too close a protruding load may
hit their vehicle -- it may go through their

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.470
windscreen, for example.
What should you do before any modification

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.639
is carried out on your vehicle?
There are all kinds of modifications you can

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.800
do to your car. You can change the exhaust,
you can lower the suspension, you can put

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.169
a roll cage in the car, you can put a body
kit on the car. Some of these modifications

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:58.169
will require certification from LVV, and others
are perfectly fine. To find out which ones

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.960
are OK for you to do you need to talk with
a WoF inspector first.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.970
Who is responsible for making a child under
15 years old (0-14 years old) use a safety

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.279
belt or safety seat in a vehicle?
The answer is the driver.
