00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.160
THE FIMBRIATUM DENDROBIUM NORMALLY

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.960
PRODUCE SEEDLING IN DRY PSEUDOBULBS

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.420
AS YOU CAN SEE WE 4 SEEDLING THAT WE ENJOY

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.480
WE CUT WITH ONE BULB FOR EACH PLANT

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:36.460
ALWAYS WITH STERISE SCISSORS

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.140
AND HAVE 4 OF SEEDLING FIMBRIATUM DENDROBIUM

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.500
FOR SMALL SEEDLING WE PLANTING

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.720
IN MOSS WITH CRUSHED STONE MIX IN PINE BARK

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.400
WITH CHARCOAL AS SHOWN IN OTHER VÍDEO

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.240
AND PUT THE SAMALL CHANGES IN A VASE

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.980
AND THIS ONE READY PLANT

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.740
WE PUT IN A VASE LARGER

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.120
PUT CRUSCHED STONE FOR GOOD DRAINAGE OF  WATER

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:21.020
AND PLANTED WITH MOSS AND PINE BARK

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.020
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.060
SEVERAL SEEDLING WE CALL VASE COLLECTIVE.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.720
AND PLANTED THE SECOND  SEEDILING

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.000
AND THIRD SEEDLING

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.400
IT IS ONE WAY TO SAVE SPACE

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.340
BUT WITH HANDICAP

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.580
AND THE ONE PLANT GET SICK

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.460
MAY TRANSMIT THE DISEASE THE OTHER PLANTS

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.960
AND WE HAVE COLLECTIVE WITH 3 ORCHIDS

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:23.940
AND 1 VASE ONE MAKES ONE IDEAL

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:37.420
ALSO WE CAN SOME DRY PSEUDOBULBS

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.040
AND LEAVE LYING IN TRAY

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:55.020
WITH MOSS IN BRACKGROUND

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.480
SEE EXAMPLE WITH PLANTS SPROUTING TRAYS

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:15.120
IT IS ANOTHER WAY  OF MULTIPLING FINBRIATUM DENDROBIUM
