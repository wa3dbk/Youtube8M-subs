bring the car to halt press Start an

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.890
angle to UGG online

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.229
public session should just go start
online play GTA online

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.339
and then just take bill works much
better this way so

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.949
once you have got to despite your safety
cars you've gone to GT online from being

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.420
trapped air works best but rather

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.909
an you were loaded into an online public
session

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.680
which I'm going to be doing here at this
point all you want to do is grab any car

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.510
off the street

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.900
and make sure at this point that you
have nor

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.260
money so if you've got a second
character give the second character

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.170
all the money getting the Holden hansi
got no money in the bank because

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.530
basically you need to be able to buy an
upgrade at Los Angeles

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.180
by you can not afford so drive the car
into a sinus customs and just repair an

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.950
image damaged

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.910
and then all you want to do is go over
something that you can afford like an

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.210
engine upgrade a bumper

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.490
grid whatever you want so I'm gonna go
over to restrain chrome because it's

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.370
quite expensive

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.150
so click and hover over this Press the
stop button and hold it down for about

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.340
