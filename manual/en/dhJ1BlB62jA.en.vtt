Welcome to twominenglish.com. Teaching you English through two-minute lessons.

00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:12.660
In this lesson we will learn about phrases that you 
 can use to discuss weather conditions with others.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.753
Hey Dreck, how are you doing?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.916
Hey Monty! It’s nice to hear from you. Tell me what’s up!

00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:28.243
Well, I just wanted to tell you that we’ll be visiting you this weekend.

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:31.821
That’s great! How did you suddenly decide to see me?

00:00:32.663 --> 00:00:36.581
Well, the kids really want to visit their uncle, 
 and Jody wants to see how you’re doing.

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:42.085
You sure did pick the right time. The weather 
 is awesome over here. It’s sunny and breezy.

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:47.486
Good to know that. It’s not so good in 
 here. It’s been raining non-stop since three days.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:55.585
It’s so cold in here!

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.463
I know. I am freezing. Gawd! I hate winter!

00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:02.090
Do you think it’s going to get warmer soon?

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.470
I don’t know. The weather report is saying 
 it’s actually supposed to get colder .

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.238
I think I will die if it gets any colder!

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:16.611
Oh come on! Our ancestors survived winters like these without any heating.

00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:25.703
It’s such pretty weather outside. Isn’t it?

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:27.813
Yes, it is indeed.

00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:30.155
Let’s go out somewhere.

00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:33.997
That’s a great idea! But, where do you think we should go?

00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:35.897
Let’s go for a long drive.

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.865
What if it starts to rain?

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:41.340
The sky looks clean. I don’t think it will rain today.

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:51.650
It hasn’t rained today. I have to go out. 
 Do you think I should take my umbrella?

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.150
I think you should. The weatherman said it might rain today on the television.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.720
In that case I am sure I won’t need my umbrella.

00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:01.600
Why not?

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:09.110
The weatherman said it wouldn’t rain yesterday and it rained. Today he 
 is saying it will rain, so it most certainly won’t.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:13.690
Your have amazing logic Sam, but take the umbrella anyway.

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:20.250
The weather is awesome over here. It’s sunny and breezy.

00:02:23.614 --> 00:02:25.670
It’s been raining non-stop since three days.

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.630
It’s so cold in here!

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.360
Do you think it’s gonna warmer soon?

00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:40.110
It’s such pretty weather outside. Isn’t it?

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:45.250
It hasn’t rained today.
