00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:16.965
Today I will be doing a review on the JVC
HA-FX1X in ear earphones. As you can see,

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:25.785
the design of these earphones are fairly unique
and the distinct colour choice will please

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:30.675
most people. They have branding on the back
in the form of a double X which stands for

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:36.864
Xtreme Xplosives. What's noticeable about
these earphones are the large in-ear sections.

00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:42.745
Inside you will find 10mm drivers which is
what separates these earphones from, say,

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:47.835
your apple ear buds.
They deliver a deep, powerful bass and keep

00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:52.454
in mind, although they might be big, they
are certainly not heavy so you can definitely

00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:57.274
wear them for long periods of time without
discomfort. Despite having sound quality that

00:00:57.274 --> 00:01:03.685
could rival expensive earphones, the JVC Xtreme
Xplosives are only £10 on the UK amazon and

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:10.535
just $22 on the American Amazon. For half
the price of the competitor Klispch S4 (CURRENTLY

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:17.505
£40), these earphones are extremely affordable.
The 3.5mm headphone jack is gold-plated and

00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:23.025
the cord is pretty thick so I don't see it
breaking anytime soon. Along with the earphones

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:26.845
themselves, JVC include a plastic carrying
case and 3 pairs of ear tips.

00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:33.845
The sound quality of these earphones are comparable
to much more expensive earphones and is impressive

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:39.405
for this price range. Whilst the punchy bass
is definitely worth buying these for, it can

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:44.645
sometimes overpower the trebles and highs.
However, I found that this wasn't noticeable

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:50.185
in most types of music and isn't enough to
stop anyone buying these. Overall, if you're

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:57.185
looking for budget earphones that can deliver
in bass and sound quality, the JVC HA-FX1X

00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:04.475
Xtreme Xplosives are the one for you.
