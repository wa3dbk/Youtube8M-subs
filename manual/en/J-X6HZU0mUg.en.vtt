00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:11.985
now, let's take out the pins

00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:17.145
the first thing to do before joining the pieces

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:22.755
is make a little hem at the neckline

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:27.940
you'll decide if you want to sew with the over machine, or just a folding

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.268
in this case i'll do a double folding

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:41.602
as small as you can, can can do it with over, it's easier

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:09.473
and then we iron it for a non wrinkled finish

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.971
now, it's time to join the pieces

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:25.925
we join the shoulders first
10
00:01:23,582 --&gt; 00:01:16,925
we're going to start by the shoulders, remember it has to be in this position

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.004
is has to be open like this 

00:01:34.622 --> 00:01:41.772
this is the shoulder, when we fold it's like this

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:51.387
this is the other shoulder, we fold as well and then pin it 

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.319
this is the frontward of the blouse 

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:10.305
we're going to make a double fold at the backward neckline 

00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:16.173
before we sew the shoulders

00:02:33.627 --> 00:02:38.386
ok, this is the hem for the back neckline

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.567
if you want to put a bias you can do it as well

00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:44.762
it's your choice

00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:53.906
ok, so now we're sewing the shoulders, i have already folded the shoulders

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:00.267
we just put frontward with frontward, facing

00:03:04.948 --> 00:03:15.147
we're going to join it just at the middle, where is the corner we join backward with frontward

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.229
and with the frontward of the other side, we're going to cover

00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:35.515
now we sew with half inch away

00:03:54.421 --> 00:04:00.757
in this case one side is longer than other, it doesn't matter beacuse it's on bais, and the fabric stretches

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:04.711
well, now the shoulder is totally covered

00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:08.115
we do the same at the other shoulder

00:04:56.848 --> 00:05:04.660
we sew the sides with french seams, or straight seams and over

00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:53.351
we make a double fold for the hem

00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:45.793
we put a bias at the armhole, we can sew with over and do it

00:06:53.974 --> 00:07:04.565
