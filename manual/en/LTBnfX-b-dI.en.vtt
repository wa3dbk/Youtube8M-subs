00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.680
i needed to take a second,
and i wanna do apologize to anybody that i

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.620
might have let down last night.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.789
this is, this is kinda hard to understand
but sometimes you can try so hard at something,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:31.099
sometimes you can be so, so prepared and still
fail.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:41.190
But every time you fail, it's painful, it
causes sadness.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:51.760
and especially as i saw last night, it causes
disapointment.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.290
i've often said a man's character is not jugded
after he celebrates a victory by,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.170
but about what he does when his back is against
the wall.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.020
so no matter how great the set-back, how surveer
the failure,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.050
you never give up, you never give up, you
pick yourself up,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:34.179
you press yourself up, you push forward, you
move on,

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.609
you attempt, that is what i believe.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.749
so, there are those that saw a ferment in
my actions last nigh,

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:55.390
you might have lost faith in me.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.170
i absolutely respect your desicion to do so,
but i'm not talking to them,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.820
i'm talking to those people who still believe.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.820
tonight, i speak to those, who still, proudly,
stand in my corner.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:32.810
you have not given up on me and i will not
give up on you!

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.540
WW-Universe is all i got.
this is my everything.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.900
so i'm not gonna say tonight that i'm gonna
wark harder,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.310
i'm gonna be more dedicated, i'ma put more
time in the gym,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.660
that's impossible.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.390
what i'm gonna say to all of you tonight who
listen,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:01.439
is what happened to TLC will never happen
again!

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:12.599
it is time to set the records straight,
my road to Wrestle-Mania starts RIGHT NOW!

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.849
everybody here, everybody in Austin,
i won't be stopped, I CAN'T BE STOPPED!!
