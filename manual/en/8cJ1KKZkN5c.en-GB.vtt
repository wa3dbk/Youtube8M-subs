00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.210
Hello.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.570
Today I am reminiscing about my Prom.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.610
*Prom*.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.510
Prom was a stressful event to prepare for
and endure.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.929
There was the formal attire to find.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.559
The stress over travel arrangements.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.809
Oh the friendship group problems.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.230
And then there was the hair... HAIR.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.330
My Prom coincided with my first experience
of severe noticeable Trichotillomania.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.180
In the weeks leading up to my Prom, my year
group and I were taking out GCSE's and during

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.380
that period, I lost hair my hair.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.390
It was a new experience that happened so fast
and my family and I were so unprepared, it

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.760
just caught us off guard.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.980
So I ended up going to Prom with the hair
I had.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.780
There were no fancy hair cuts, or wigs, just
THAT.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.899
On the morning of my Prom, my Mum took me
to a hair salon to have my hair styled.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.770
I wanted to have a different hair style from
the "Beckie0 dead straight signature hair".

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.820
Ringlets was my dream.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.949
Anyway, I wasn't nervous going to the hairdressers,
at that point (in my life) hair dressers didn't

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.030
scare me as much as they do now...

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.649
...but yeah, my Mum and I soon felt uncomfortable
and upset.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.049
The hairdressers didn't know how to "deal"
with me.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.250
"How can we cut her 'air when she's 'alf of
it's missing?"

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.360
They did say that.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.200
I remember feeling guilty that I was making
their job difficult and I had put them in

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.759
this awkward situation.

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.079
I know that as a hairdresser, you need the
hair to do the hair that I require, but at

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.850
the same time, please don't make me feel bad
because this wasn't planned... I didn't plan

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.759
to lose my hair.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.360
Those types of feelings were going on inside
my head.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.030
The result was: they changed my parting to
the middle and they tried to curl and hide

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.720
the baldness where they could.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.700
Afterwards I felt good about myself, I felt
happy and pretty, but the happiness and the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.700
hair didn't last.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.409
Within one hour, it had flattened and looked
like an absolute mess.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.560
I guess it was due to gravity, the lack of
hair in the first place and the fact that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.250
I couldn't stop touching it and tearing it
out.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.950
So naturally, I started getting very upset.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.930
And my self confidence plummeted with my curls.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.170
Look, its already flat and I'm not even at
Prom yet.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.689
My neighbour came to the rescue and restyled
my hair and did my makeup.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.629
It involved a lot of hairspray, back combing,
I dunno what happened, but something happened.

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.340
She was like a fairy Godmother.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.610
The result wasn't quite like what I wanted
and I didn't look anything like I dreamed

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.210
I would.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.290
We had problems with the dress as well, because
I'd lost a stone in weight (with stress

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.610
as well) so the dress didn't fit.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.640
But I think we did rather well with what we
had at the time and for that I was grateful.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.480
Anyway, THE PROM.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.580
I didn't enjoy Prom for a variety of reasons:
I wasn't popular, the social phobia, anxiety,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.280
I didn't like the music.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.610
The Prom experience like an exhibition of
beauty and popularity.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.530
The hair fiasco just made everything ten times
worse.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.290
It was hard to be surrounded by 150 girls,
who all resembled Disney Princesses.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.310
Just seeing their hair on a regular basis
makes me jealous, let alone seeing it all

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.220
in lovely styles.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.720
"Why didn't you wear a wig?"

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.780
Wigs weren't an option for me at 16.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.680
I hadn't experiences such severe hair loss
that I needed wigs

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.200
or had even considered wigs.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.080
As for other accessories, I just didn't think,
I was thinking quite traditionally, the long

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.050
lovely hair.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.650
But also, I wasn't as confident then as I
am now.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.710
(Now) I would embrace the baldness.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.520
Back then, I was only just starting to experience
it and the reaction was to try and hide it.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.200
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.690
I just wish back then, I'd been less serious,
that I had enjoyed myself more, despite the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.150
hair and my social problems.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.040
Prom is just one party.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.020
For me, it was an exaggerated school disco.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.570
But that's easy for me to say now, back then,
it was serious event.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.500
I am still proud of myself for going despite
the problems and upset.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.030
WELL DONE PAST REBECCA.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.510
If you have Prom this week or next week and you're getting stressed

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.910
I
understand and I know how you feel.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.750
And for that, I'm sending you hugs, big hug.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.320
Try and enjoy yourself, because it only happens
once.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.310
So yeah, this was my bamble on Prom, so I
shall see you soon. Bye.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.120
Rawr, hello.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.640
This has been a bit rushed in the sense that,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.040
it's a bit late, cause I've not been very well, but also because

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.820
as I'm vlogging, I'm losing my voice.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.200
I could mime like the little mermaid if I wanted to me.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.600
Oh my gosh, it's gone now.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.420
Meow.
