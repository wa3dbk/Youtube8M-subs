00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.350
There’s a lot wrong with the world at the
moment, isn’t there? Can we agree on that?

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.230
Let’s not get into the specifics of what,
for God’s sake – well, not necessarily

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.750
for God’s sake or Allah’s sake or gods’
sake – ess apostrophe – or the sake of

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.720
human decency or nature or the power of crystals
– or even for all of our sakes as there

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.640
are some of our sakes that some other of our
sakes consider worthless or objectionable.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.660
That’s one of the things that’s wrong
with the world, in my view.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.580
But I suppose in their view, the view of the people who think other people are worthless

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.520
my thinking that their thinking that's one of the things that's wrong, is one of the things that's wrong. 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.640
 Actually, that's probably another focus of consensus. We can all agree that one of the things that's wrong

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.560
  with the world is other people's mistaken idea of what's wrong with the world.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.440
And consequent problem causing attempts to, in their view, problem-solve. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.840
We're all of a 
mind until we get into the difficult territory
of whom we mean.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.140
So let’s not. And let’s not invoke any
idea or person or entity’s sake because,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.590
as soon as we do that, let alone specify any
particular problem, the consensus is lost.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.960
In fact even by saying the consensus is lost,
I’ve probably lost the consensus as some

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.840
people would probably assert that there are
problems over which there’d be unanimity

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.409
of regret. “There are loads of things that
we can all agree on!” they’d say, disagreeing

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.040
with my point that there are very few things
that we can all agree on. But my failure to

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.930
achieve consensus on even the point that consensus
is hard to reach must surely amount to some

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.450
kind of argumentative victory.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.600
Let’s just stick to “There’s a lot wrong
with the world at the moment”. More than

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.710
ever, in fact. No! Lost it again. Not necessarily
more than ever. Possibly less than ever. Or

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.950
possibly somewhere in between Depends how
you look at it. There are more people than

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.110
ever – so that might imply a greater sum
of human pain – but they’re living longer,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.049
on average, which implies a lower mean level
of human screwedness. But then there are those

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.369
who’d say that measuring what’s wrong
with the world in terms of the mean level

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.299
of human screwedness is fascistically homo-sapiens-centric.
So let’s not compare things to the past,

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.490
the probable future, or any ancient pre-Jurassic
ages of magma when all the molluscs and lichen

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.640
had a hell of a time. And just stick to basics:
“There’s a lot wrong with the world at

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.700
the moment.”

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.000
And let’s hope things improve. Oooh, careful.
Ice thinning. Would serial killers agree with

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.770
that? Depends. Some of them probably think
that, by serial killing, they’re improving

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.990
the world. That the scourge of whomever they
seek to slice up is being addressed by their

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.640
public spirited murder spree. So they wouldn’t
see a hope that the world improves as in any

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.680
way conflicting with their chosen profession
– I suspect I may have stumbled on the premise

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.280
of Dexter. But others – I’m going to call
them the nice serial killers – probably

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.030
sometimes feel bad about all the serial killing.
And on some level they’d know that one thing

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.720
that would improve the world is if they stopped
doing the thing they’re madly driven to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.010
do. So it might be harder for them to get
totally behind my whole hoping things will

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.530
get better campaign without making hypocrites
of themselves, and I can't imagine a nice

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.410
serial killer wanting to do that. Consensus
lost again.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.069
So let’s get back to “There’s a lot
wrong with the world at the moment” and

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.239
not get into the choppy waters of what and
whether vacuous internet videos are part of

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.319
it. Thank you.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.790
And, if there’s one thing I can be confident
of it’s that, having stuck rigidly to saying

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.489
things that everyone is agreed on, all of
the comments posted below will definitely

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.949
express approval.
