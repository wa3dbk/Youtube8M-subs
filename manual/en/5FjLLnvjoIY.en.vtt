00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:31.760
Now the hour has come at last
The soft and fading light

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.510
Has crossed the west horizon
And has bidden us goodnight

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:53.390
And what a lovely night it is
To walk a moonlit field

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.020
To see the softer shades
That are by starlight now revealed

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.554
So why is it that now,
When all is quiet and at rest

00:00:58.554 --> 00:00:59.554
When candles glow and all the world
Is at its very best

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:00.554
The ponies of Equestria
Should lock themselves away

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:01.554
To shun the moon and wait instead
For Sister's sunny day?

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:02.554
In umbra Luna est (the moon is in shadow)

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:03.554
Am I so wrong to wish that they
Would see things like I do?

00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:04.554
And am I so wrong to think
That they might love me too?

00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:05.554
Why shouldn't they adore me?

00:01:05.554 --> 00:01:06.554
Is it not within my right?

00:01:06.554 --> 00:01:07.554
I'll not be overshadowed!

00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:15.799
Mine is not the lesser light!

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:50.829
I've waited long enough now
For them all to come around

00:01:50.829 --> 00:02:09.663
And though the Sun may plead and threaten,
The Moon will stand her ground

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:10.663
And all will know the wonder
Of my dark and jeweled sky

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.663
When all the world is wrapped
In an eternal lullaby

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:12.663
So say goodnight at this,
The final setting of the sun

00:02:12.663 --> 00:02:12.671
Tomorrow dawns in darkness
The nighttime has begun!
