Hi, I'm Sean with expert village. And I am
going to show you how to make some paper airplanes.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.980
This plane is actually the world record holder
for most time spend in the air. With any plane

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.980
try to get your folds as exact as possible.
It doesn't have to be perfect. But, the most

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.995
exact it is, the better balance it will be
and the better it will fly.
