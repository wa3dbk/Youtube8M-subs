00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.019
the next technique will be doing is
sponge painting - 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.999
but this is different than any other sponge painting that you may have done in the

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.929
past

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.509
now if you look closely at my sponge
roller it's got big chunks missing

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.609
from it

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.820
the reason why - this creates the
variation

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.329
you should take the sponge roller and
pull pieces out to create a random

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.010
pattern which is desirable on the wall
surface when you're painting -

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.740
pay particular attention to your edges
making sure that those harsh lines are

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.390
left jagged when you're finished pulling
the sponge pieces out -

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.840
Before you begin, you will need a base coat of a satin finish paint on your wall - 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.380
in order to create this look you'll want
to apply glaze to the surface using a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.380
roller

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.150
the most efficient way to get
professional looking results is to ask a

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.360
friend to come and give you a hand by
rolling on the glaze -  while you finish up

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.230
with the the sponge roller to create the look -  in
this situation i've got my friend julie - 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.100
Julie will apply the glaze to the surface - 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.220
she will roll in "columns" so that the glaze will stay wet - 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.220
we don't want the glaze to dry before I can use the sponge roller to blend.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.230
while Julie is continuing to apply the glaze, I will follow behind her doing the blending.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.240
I begin by rolling a pattern through the glaze - I create 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.119
a pattern by rolling through cutting
through the glaze i'm going to roll back

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.259
and forth

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.009
to create the look - 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.109
keep in mind the more you roll

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.289
the softer the look. -

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.089
so if you're looking for a real muted
look, you will roll more - if you want a 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:24.379
Jagged and crisp look, you'll roll less.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.919
you can go ahead and blend

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.760
until you're happy!

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.969
now as you're working on your surface

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.429
the glaze is actually transferring from
the wall to the sponge roller - when

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.039
you're sponge roller  get saturated - 
 you don't need to wash it

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:45.939
out - just simply take it to a soft
cotton cloth or paper towel -

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.809
preferably lint-free and download some
of that glaze - then we're gonna need to

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:55.209
go ahead and continue on the while julie
will go ahead and finish up by applying

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.679
the glaze to the surface - 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:02.739
again - like I said - keeping a couple
columns ahead of me

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.919
and while she's continuing down the wall -

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:11.479
I'm rolling as well -

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.040
one thing that is different as i've
mentioned before - The Sponge Roller

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.139
is different from the kind of sponge
painting most of us have done  - 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.910
in my opinion it's a very sophisticated look - 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.739
i think it's beautiful

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.999
so have fun painting with the sponge
painting roller

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:31.479
thanks for watching
