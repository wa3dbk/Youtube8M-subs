00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.920
The only two major measurements

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.840
that we made where there was a
consistent effect across all subjects

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.480
was the average speed they travelled
which was slower

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.200
and their tracking ability, their
ability to stay within the lanes.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.040
The simulator is set up
to measure how accurately

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.880
people stay in the lane
that they're in

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.880
and drive as normally as they can.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.280
And the more they weave about
in that lane,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.800
this is the measure
of the effect of cannabis

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.680
on what we call
their psychomotor performance.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.280
And cannabis
has a significant effect on that.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.160
That was a consistent effect
across all subjects.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.720
The tracking test shows cannabis
does affect hand-eye co-ordination.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.400
The simulator test measures the more
complex decision-making processes

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.320
involved in driving.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.520
The computer records all this data
60 times a second

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.720
and turns it
into a graph for analysis.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.440
Here it took the participant
1.3 seconds to react

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.160
by braking in response
to the programmed event.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.840
The conclusions here,
generally speaking,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.600
were there were some instances
of differences in behaviour

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.640
in the various measures being used

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.240
which suggest that
the higher the dose of cannabis,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320
the more cautious perhaps
they're going to be as a driver.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.400
More cautious on the one hand

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.320
but on the other hand
they can't react as quickly.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.920
So anything sudden that happens

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.520
or if there's any control skills
that are needed fairly urgently,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.760
then they'll have more difficulty.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.440
So, overall,
alcohol makes you more confident.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.960
Cannabis, it seems,
makes you more cautious

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.360
but not necessarily a safer driver.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.680
So how reliable
are these conclusions?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.360
And if they're reliable,
how relevant are they

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.040
to what happens in the real world?

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.920
We've conducted a lot of trials
over the years now

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880
using the driving simulator

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.960
and an important element of that

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.920
has been to validate
the test tool itself.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.400
We've done that in a variety of ways.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.800
Mostly we focus on speed choice,
distances from other vehicles

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.960
and lane position.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.560
And we've observed those
in the driving simulator

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.880
and out there in real life.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.080
Those results have shown two things:

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.200
firstly, that the driving simulator
produces results

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.800
which are very close to real life,
however they are different

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.160
and most importantly,
they're systematically different

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.080
to those
which you observe in real life.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
So we don't just get more variation,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.680
we tend to get,
for example with speed,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.280
people will drive slightly quicker
in the simulator

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.640
than they will on the real road,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.520
particularly
in motorway environments.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.640
However, it's systematic,
that means it's repeatable

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.480
and it's always
in the same direction.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.600
When we know that, basically
we can take the sort of data

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.520
which we get
from the simulator and scale it

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.360
and make our predictions
about what's going to happen

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.200
out there in the real world.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.800
The testing techniques, the tracking
task and the driving simulator

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.680
prove to be valid and reliable
measures of performance.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.440
What's been less successful
is the premise that participants

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.800
who regularly smoke cannabis can be
given different doses of the drug

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.520
or none at all and not notice
the difference in the effect.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.160
It's probably impossible
in any sort of trial

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.880
when something as strong
as alcohol or cannabis

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.920
is having an effect on you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.360
not to know
whether it's a placebo or not

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.360
but I don't think in any
sort of experimental situation

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.960
we could have actually done better
than we've done.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.920
Even in a carefully designed
experiment such as this

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.200
there are some factors
you simply cannot control.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.400
In this case it's the fact
that the participants

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.760
know how it feels to take the drug.
