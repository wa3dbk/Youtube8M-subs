00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.069
Welcome to the five paragraph essay
format,

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.310
and the purpose

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.229
of this video lecture

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:10.220
and its accompanying text lecture

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.209
is to explain to you how to structure

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.149
your essays for this course. All the
essay are five paragraphs, which is the department standard, and 

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.120
it's the same thing we use for the final
examination.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.760
Remember the final examination's worth
thirty three percent of your final

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.779
course grade,

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.740
so it's important that you get a handle

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.529
on the five paragraph essay format as
soon as possible.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.210
And again,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.110
it's what you should use in all the
essays for this course.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.320
First of all, we're dealing with three
paragraph types: the introductory

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.970
paragraph,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.040
the body paragraphs, and a conclusion
paragraph, so let's begin with the

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.480
introductory paragraph.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.190
Just like the name, "introductory," it
introduces

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.160
the essay topic to your readers.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.260
Let's say, for example, that we're talking
about a comparison contrast essay;

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.030
none of the comparing

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.450
and contrasting

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.490
should go on in the introductory
paragraph. That's not its job.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.320
It should simply introduce the topic

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.610
through sentences that

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.450
narrow and narrow the topic until
finally we get to the thesis statement.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.520
As a silly visual aid, think of an
upside-down pizza slice or an

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.450
upside-down triangle.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.170
That would represent the structure of

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.800
the introductory paragraph. . . sort of. . . you
know... like this

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.530
(If I can get that straight)

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.270
What happens is. . .let's say, for instance, I
was writing a comparison contrast essay on

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.310
city living

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.070
verses

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.960
country living. That's not one of the topics
that you have available for your

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.439
comparison contrast essay, but for the
sake of an example,

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.530
let's say it was city living vs country
living.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.060
What I might do in a case like
that is I might

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.560
open it up. . .that essay, meaning the
introductory paragraph, with a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.869
beginning sentence that made some
statement about how the United States is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.429
a very culturally diverse society.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.039
I would move on to a sentence that
discusses the fact that

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.470
people in the United States

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.099
have very different lifestyles. I might, then, have a third sentence where I 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.390
suggest something about how

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.760
everyone's professional lives, their social lives,  and their private lives

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.059
are different.

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:31.769
And then, i would bring up the idea of
city and country living.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.589
The following sentence, which would be
the final sentence. . . I would then

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:39.189
have my thesis statement. Everything
leads up to the thesis statement as the

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.859
final sentence

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.670
of the introductory paragraph.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.769
Remember that for all your essays,

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.189
the thesis statement must be the final
sentence of your introductory paragraph.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.219
So do you see what happened there?

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.880
Each sentence got progressively
narrower. I started off rather broadly:

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.480
the U.S. is a culturally diverse

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.699
society. . .

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.480
We all have different lifestyles (iIve
narrowed it to lifestyles), then i said

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.279
something about professional,

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.079
social, and private lives (a little more
narrow now).

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.140
Finally, I got to the topic of city and
country living,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.739
and i finished with the thesis statement, which is
even more narrow.

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.080
and the example that i've given before

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.360
is the purpose of this essay is to
explain

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.720
the similarities and differences between
city and country living the purpose of

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.219
this essay is to compare and contrast
city and country living.

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.849
So that's the job of an introductory
paragraph; it simply introduces your

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.459
topic to your readers

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.660
and finishes with

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.149
the thesis statement.

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.500
No comparing or contrasting went on there.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.220
Now, if it was an argumentative essay,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.599
well, it would be the same thing,

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.409
but we would finish with a little bit of a different thesis, and I

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.680
could talk about that,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.729
and i will,

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.620
in a future

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.939
video on some of the 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.519
argumentative-essay-assignment prompts.

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.219
Okay. . .

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:06.079
next, though, we should talk about the
body paragraphs, so in terms of structure

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.459
one introductory paragraph at the
beginning. . .

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.529
at the end, a conclusion paragraph. . .

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.780
in the middle, you have three body
paragraphs.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.600
So

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.500
the three body paragraphs: that's where
the business of comparing and contrasting

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.749
takes place.

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:26.030
If it were an argumentative essay, that's
where the arguing would take place:

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.729
in those three paragraphs. Now, in a
comparison contrast essay, for example,

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.330
you get to do all your comparisons and
contrasts:

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.149
the way in which city living is 
different

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:42.330
from country living. . . the way city
living is similar

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.770
to country living,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.100
and so that's where the comparisons and
contrast would take place.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.370
In an argumentative paper, that's where you
would be advancing your argumentative

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.639
points to persuade us over to your point
of view.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.270
Now, the conclusion paragraph:

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.340
Sometimes students have trouble with
conclusion paragraphs. I'll give you one

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.699
very simple formula for a
conclusion paragraph that works.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.439
Conceivably, you would have written
the first four paragraphs already,

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.550
so look back, and look at what you've
written.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.519
Choose one key point

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.840
from each of the previous paragraphs,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.580
and you restate it,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.120
but in completely different wording,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.560
and then you can revisit your thesis as
well, and restate that again.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.740
Right there, that suggests five sentences,
and so if you're someone that has a

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.889
little bit of difficulty making
the conclusion paragraph long enough,

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.789
follow that formula you'll end up with
at least a five sentence conclusion

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.639
paragraph.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.060
Well, I hope this helps,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.389
and don't forget to review all the
lectures, and in particular,

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.190
Lecture Two. Always pay very, very close
attention to Lecture Two.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.249
Again, I hope this is helpful. Thank you.
