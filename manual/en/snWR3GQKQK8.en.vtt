00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.370
This is what a single brain cell, or neuron,
really looks like.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.350
It’s pretty crazy we can take a picture
of it.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.029
But… for a long time we couldn’t see and
didn’t quite understand that tangle of neurons

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.949
inside your head.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.260
And some people thought we didn’t need a
brain at all.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.019
Back in Ancient Egypt, people believed the
brain was just stuffing to keep the skull

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.150
from caving in.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.470
During mummification, brains were often removed
and discarded while the heart was taken with

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.020
you to the afterlife.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.250
Ancient Egyptians believed the heart was the
seat of consciousness – an idea called the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.579
cardiocentric hypothesis.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.969
In Ancient Greece, Alk-me-en dissected an
eye and discovered the optic nerve.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.780
He thought there were connections from our
sensory organs to the brain.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.030
So Alk-me-en proposed the cephalocentric hypothesis,
that the brain was the seat of consciousness.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.090
He believed that animal spirits ran through
the body, just like we know neural signals

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.390
do today.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.100
Others, like Pythagoras, Plato and Hippocrates
were also on team brain.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.310
But some, like Aristotle marched to the beat
of a different drum, and continued to favour

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.880
team heart.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.579
Aristotle believed the brain and lungs were
cooling devices for the heart.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.200
Skip forward almost one thousand years and
French Philosopher Rene Descartes thought

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.730
our nerves contained fluids, where animal
spirits would flow through our nerves to our

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.900
muscles to cause movement.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.159
This theory, that muscle movement was caused
from inflation by air or fluid, was known

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.040
as the Balloonist theory, but like those before,
it soon deflated.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.729
Then in the 1820s, the theories of Franz Joseph
Gall shaped Phrenology.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.479
People thought the mind was composed of distinct
faculties – think self-esteem, benevolence

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.790
or agreeableness – that had a separate area
in the brain.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.280
And since the skull takes it’s shape from
the brain, it was pretty widely accepted that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.090
the surface of the skull could be read as
an index of your psychological aptitudes and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.090
tendencies.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.820
Phrenology was practiced until the 1840s,
and the British Phenological Society was disbanded

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.930
as late as 1967.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.290
As Karl Popper said, “Science must begin
with myths, and with the criticism of myths.”

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.790
If we didn’t once believe that we have animal
spirits flowing through our veins or that

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.730
your brain was just stuffing, we may not have
developed the knowledge we now have about

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.260
the brain.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:06.659
Or what we'll learn about your brain in 
the future.
