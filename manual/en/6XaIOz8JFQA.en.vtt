00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.089
here we're gonna apply science something
very useful medium and fall for you now

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.160
obviously we're targeting this are the
are cautiously from her campus dot com

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.670
is targeted at using science to attract
man for women

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.349
but a lot of stuff could as easily be
used if you're a man so

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.849
um... the first is to use body language

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.119
because under the title of paramount's
herein is also a little things like

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.800
uh... signals of interest like

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.880
so i can sing your hair and things like
that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.759
um... these are things that the brain
sort of understands means that someone's

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.390
interested conscience taken just as easy
when something as simple as we talk

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.870
about how i'm when you're interested in
someone you blink more often

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.360
and so you can force yourself to blink
more to show someone i think that if

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.830
that sounds disasters two numbers is
that often since we have all of these

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.690
are potentially disastrous like if you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.210
using heart that's why i offered a cease
and since both the potential benefit

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.699
with interest insulted are still in this
context

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.130
you are leading the guy no

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.410
that you are attracted to him gap but
how do you get him to be attracted to

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.420
you know but the idea is that these are
things that will clue hint in that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.790
you're interested in possibly make you
make a mover some pricing britain's

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.250
using for months you might not want to
shower

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.259
you might want to wear underwear for few
days in a row something like that

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.689
in harness the power of that to drive
and then okay so human that doesn't work

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.990
as well for athletes are are other
things on this list that john will get

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.020
to know i can't help myself after jump
in

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.000
in my experience with communicating with
men

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.100
to do is look to keep busy do you like
ain't said things like that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.930
does not work retiree straight forty-six
house move on

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.219
cosmo is lara flynn induced by the way
because we're out of the stuff

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.410
doctor strange cities with

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.260
independent might be some sort of
natural bend the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.210
but usually you should just be
straightforward with guys and let them

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.140
know what you want

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.640
right cell and i know that's difficult
to do especially if it's that guy that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.860
you're interested in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100
you sell them like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.979
let's get coffee

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.579
the tenancy of

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:10.759
and i think that

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.890
and there are a designer and attracted
to that like out that they can pick and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.660
put someone off like right

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.679
certain guys were changed to

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.229
many of you know if they're going to the
bar or something like that but your

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.749
medium in class everything if you come
on too strong in might keen might have

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:24.570
sex with you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.989
yet another began

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.640
so these are things to sort of like try
to develop something more long-lasting

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.820
yeah on the second in the so i think
it's so funny is that they think the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.109
copycat with the basically saying is
there's

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.080
quite a bit of science says that people
like

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.090
people who would do certain mirroring
techniques with people who talked

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.160
similar to them

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.309
where you similarly expressions or hand
motions and things like that

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:51.159
this is actually lampooned in and at the
sort of the office where his andy was

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.799
like trying new like near high his boss
and didn't work well for him and i

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.669
imagine is another one whereas the
senate bill horribly wrong

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.309
if he is a certain expression in you use
the same expression that could make him

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.909
feel more comfortable more familiar yes
but if you notice is that that's gonna

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.849
literally that patent

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.419
instead have mimicking that person or
copying his or her seiler speaking style

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:20.639
whatever it is maybe it's a good idea to
find common interests so if it's a

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.390
television show for instance

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.129
and you find out like the like we like
in the front and look at a later we're

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.180
good friends of mandela right but if i
were trying to will resign

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.510
maybe i would bring that may have
constantly like pages you want statement

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.460
of that sort of rocky cool at the
fastest but you know it's it's a you

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.209
find a common ground he did talk about
your friends will

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.470
mhm

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.790
so you has no ending like find that
common ground and the old on that and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.870
that sort of a similar figures
explicitly like physical and scientific

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.879
right bets

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.209
and not really a nice real quickly
closes someone's interesting in you and

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.400
they sell up to work wearing that shirt

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.339
later something similar to that

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.489
fit well maybe eleven eleven oh one
person's company who would wear this

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.029
particular sure i'll have an equally
difficult

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.089
i don't want first we're going to think
of all the news media etc

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.899
if a girl expressed interest in black
t-shirts i might be into that elkins
