Hi everyone!

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.990
This video is going to be my second video
in my personal tidying journey series

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.780
where I'm showing you how Iâ€™m actually going
about tidying my life the KonMari way.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.490
So after clothes, the next categories are
books and papers.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.669
And if you guys haven't checked out my tidying
categories cheat sheet,

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.689
you can check it out: PDF link is below.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.380
The first step when tidying books is you have
to take off all of the books

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.820
off of the bookshelf or wherever they are,
and put them all on the floor.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.090
And so what I did was: I used this dolly to
kind of load all my books into so I could

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.090
move it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.970
into the central living room area so that
I can sort them out there.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.670
This dolly made it super convenient to transport
books.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.670
I think, without it,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.460
I would've been a lot more tired in this process.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.830
Here's my bookshelf before I started tidying.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.370
I haven't really organized this bookshelf
in years,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.150
and on the bottom I have a bunch of children's
books that I just kept from my childhood

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.619
and we had no reason to throw it away until
now.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.869
I also keep photos and mementos

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.390
on my bookshelf so I had to sort out the mementos
and keep them for tidying later,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.789
and just focus on the books.

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.869
Do not get distracted.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.340
Here's my dolly and I also had this box for
recycling whatever I find.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.729
The dolly wasn't big enough for all of my
books so I had to make multiple trips

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.889
to collect all of my books.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:32.049
Also I made sure to check all around the house

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.810
for any random books lying around, because
we keep books in separate areas.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.179
So I made sure to gather all of the books
from different areas of the house onto the

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.100
living room.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.979
Here are all of the books that I've laid out
on the floor.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.240
After sorting for a few hours, I came up with
three piles of books in the end.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.219
The first pile is for the books that I'm going
to discard and recycle.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.549
The second pile are books that are in better
condition and I'm going to try to donate

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.659
to a local library.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.220
And the final pile are the books that spark
joy and that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.770
I'm going to put back on my bookshelf.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.970
Books that I like.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.780
Reference and some other books I like.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.220
And some yearbooks and books that remind me
of childhood.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.220
Yay!

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.740
Alright moving on: the next category is papers,
and I think I tidied papers about a week

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.190
after I tidied books.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.830
Papers was an interesting one for me because
I am sentimental

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.720
about things and I like to keep my old notebooks
and things from high school and college.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.890
Here's my bunch of papers.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.590
Most of them are from high school, college,
internships,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.610
studying abroad, and miscellaneous.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.020
The process begins with picking one up and
asking,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.780
"Does this spark joy?"

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.950
Obviously I have to look inside to see what
it is.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.810
And every time I look inside I kind of get
lost and if it sparks joy, I know immediately

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.620
because the notebook brings back good memories,
and if it doesn't,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.290
I know that I can easily let it go.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.990
I found blocking for my dance team

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.500
which makes me really happy so I'm going to
keep this notebook.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.160
Look at all this blocking.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.990
What was really helpful for organizing loose
papers was getting this accordion file folder,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.890
and it also helps me limit the amount of papers
I could keep

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.990
because there were only so many tabs.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:05.180
In the end, here is my recycle and discard
pile.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.900
And here are the papers, folders, and notebooks
that I'm going to keep

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.680
because they spark joy and make me happy.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.440
Alright, I hope that video was helpful.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.780
You get to see my process in tidying books
and papers.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.120
To be honest, clothes was probably the most
difficult category for me

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.840
because I had so many clothes and I just don't
like to discard my personal things.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.720
Clothes feel very personal for me.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.660
But books and papers were easier to get through.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.900
I feel like the rest of the categories are
a little bit easier until you get to mementos

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.150
at the end.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.590
So hopefully by mementos, your intuition is
strong enough that you know

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.840
what you want to keep and what you don't want
to keep.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.880
I will let you know when I get there.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.630
So next video will be on the miscellaneous
category.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.650
I've already started tidying

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.460
miscellaneous so I will keep you guys updated
on when I finish it and post the video.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.100
In the meantime: happy tidying, good luck,
and I will see you guys in the next one.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.820
Bye!
