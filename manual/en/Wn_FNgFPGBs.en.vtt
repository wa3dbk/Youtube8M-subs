00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:02.666
&gt;&gt; Welcome back to
Southwest Yard and Garden.

00:00:02.726 --> 00:00:03.696
I'm Curtis Smith.

00:00:04.186 --> 00:00:07.696
As summer moves into fall
and fall into winter we begin

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:10.116
to think of how our gardens
are burning out outdoors

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:12.696
and how our winter
gardening season's beginning,

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:16.476
gardening indoors and we need
to know which soils to use,

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:19.666
what containers to use and we'll
be talking about that right now.

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:22.776
We've got several options
as we're gardening indoors.

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:25.156
Sometimes we have difficulties

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:27.016
because gardening
indoors can be a problem,

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:28.976
but we also have
certain opportunities,

00:00:29.306 --> 00:00:30.846
and one of those
opportunities is

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:32.986
in customizing the
soil to the plants.

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:34.856
When we're gardening out
of doors we're working

00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:37.806
with New Mexico soil; we
may add compost to the soil,

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:40.526
we may add different
amendments to the soil,

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:42.136
we may add fertilizer
to the soil.

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:45.256
When we garden indoors
inside a container,

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:46.336
even if we're gardening outside

00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:48.446
in a container we
customize the soil,

00:00:48.446 --> 00:00:51.146
we use that which we
develop especially

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:53.626
for growing plants
in containers.

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:56.736
We can use a store-bought
product which may have all kinds

00:00:56.736 --> 00:00:57.746
of things added to it.

00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:02.226
We can use homemade compost
added to garden soil and sand

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:04.656
and other things, so we can
design the soil the way we want

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:07.216
it, and we can design
it to be what we want.

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:10.206
Sometimes though we find
that the soil is dry.

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:14.796
I went to my compost pile this
morning to get some compost

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:16.896
to use and it was
dry and powdery

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:19.606
so I put it inside this
bag, put some water with it,

00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:21.896
have let it seal up and
soak up the moisture.

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:23.526
It's now ready to use.

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:26.296
Sometimes though we'll also
have potting soil or compost

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:28.296
which is dry; we can use
an old can with a lid.

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:30.926
We put the water in with it
and let it sit with that.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.756
We'll have some nice moist
potting soil or compost

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.086
and it stays this
way for a while here.

00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:38.176
Now you don't want
to leave it too long

00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:40.376
or it'll begin composting
more inside here

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:43.876
and in a sealed container that
may not be a good thing to do.

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:47.656
After we have chosen the
soil we begin to think

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.726
about how we're going to use
the soil and might say well

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:52.526
for some plants I want the
potting soil the way it is.

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.076
Perhaps I've got something that
likes a lot of organic matter

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:56.566
so I'll grow it in
straight compost,

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:58.006
but that's not always
a good idea.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.316
Sometimes we'll say
though I want to blend it

00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:03.156
so I'll blend it with
soil or with sharp sand.

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:05.676
If I'm growing cacti
or other plants

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:08.046
which like well drained
soils I'll mix a lot

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:09.136
of sand with the soil.

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:11.126
If I'm growing something

00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:13.276
that needs more moisture
I'll put less sand in it.

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:16.896
I can add perlite, I can add
small gravel; there are a lot

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:19.906
of things I can add to the soil
to tailor that soil to my needs.

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:21.946
And once I've done
that I also look

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:23.266
and say well what am I
going to plant it in?

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.176
Well I can use the flower pots.

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:26.986
Now this is one that
has been used before.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:31.056
It's important to clean it, wash
it out very well and a good idea

00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:33.646
to rinse it with a 10%
chlorine bleach solution,

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:36.416
which means you take one-part
chlorine bleach nine parts

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:40.656
of water to make a solution,
then rinse this very well,

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:43.786
take it out and let it dry.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:49.866
But wash it in the chlorine
bleach, rinse it to take any

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:52.226
of the chlorine bleach off
of it, set it aside to dry,

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:53.326
then you're ready to use it.

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:56.516
We can use the round pots,
we can use the square pots.

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.536
We find that things we
bought plants in earlier

00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:02.706
in the year we can use
them; they're fairly flimsy

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:04.836
but for starting new
plants, which we'll put

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:07.386
out in the garden in the
spring, that's a good choice.

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:09.516
We've got all different
kinds of this.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:11.436
This one's a four pack;
here's a six pack.

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:16.106
And then we can go to
even the smaller things

00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:17.476
if we want a very small plant,

00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:20.576
we've got a very small space
there's small pots we can use.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:25.126
And sometimes I like
to recycle things,

00:03:25.126 --> 00:03:28.066
so I'll use Styrofoam cups;
there's one that has a hole

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:30.996
in it, I was eating ice cream
and I got a little industrious

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:33.146
with the ice cream so I've
already got the drainage

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:33.646
in this one.

00:03:34.656 --> 00:03:36.746
With this one there's
no drainage so I'll have

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:39.106
to make holes in it;
that's an important part

00:03:39.106 --> 00:03:40.886
of container gardening,
make sure you have a hole.

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:44.076
With the Styrofoam it's real
easy to use a blunt pencil.

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:48.646
Sometimes we have other
containers that we buy

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:50.896
at the store, there are a lot
of different things we can use;

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:55.636
yogurt, cottage cheese,
sour cream containers.

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:57.636
This one you probably
want to use a hot nail.

00:03:57.756 --> 00:03:59.426
I like this one because
it has the clear lid

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:02.426
so as I start seeding
inside here I can cover it

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:03.526
to hold the humidity in.

00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:09.546
Sometimes at a fast food
place we'll find nice little

00:04:09.546 --> 00:04:11.516
greenhouses all for our use.

00:04:11.976 --> 00:04:14.206
We can use soil, or sometimes I

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:17.276
like to get this Jiffy Seven
pellets, which I can place

00:04:17.276 --> 00:04:19.496
in what used to be
the lid, add water,

00:04:19.556 --> 00:04:22.346
let the Jiffy Seven pellets
swell up, plant the seed

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:25.576
or cutting in that,
put the lid on

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:26.786
and I've got a nice
little greenhouse;

00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:28.166
things will grow very well here.

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:33.126
And here's a handy little device
I found in a fast food store;

00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:35.156
a hot dog came in this one.

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:38.656
I can use this as a
greenhouse or I can use it

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:40.726
as two planting trays,
so I've got a lot

00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:41.956
of flexibility with these.

00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:45.586
So as we look we've got soil
and containers to work with.

00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:49.026
We can be creative,
we can reuse things

00:04:49.026 --> 00:04:50.206
that we'd otherwise throw away

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.926
so we can get extra use
out of these things.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.596
And let's not forget
that we need

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:56.476
to put something underneath the
container, as we grow things

00:04:56.476 --> 00:04:58.366
in it we want something
to catch the water

00:04:58.366 --> 00:04:59.686
so we don't ruin
our windowsills.

00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:03.506
We can always work with
our regular garden tools

00:05:03.506 --> 00:05:05.476
when we're working
with indoor plants,

00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:07.456
our full-scale garden tools,

00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:13.166
but you know you can also get
some smaller more focused type

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:14.416
tools that you can use.

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:16.726
I've got two sets that
were given to me as gifts

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:20.876
that work perfectly for indoor
containers and I especially

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:23.346
like this one when I'm working
with some compacted soil

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:25.036
in a pot, replanting
something in there.

00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:28.626
And so we've got some
nice tools we can use.

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:31.696
This was made especially
for working in terraria,

00:05:31.996 --> 00:05:34.096
but it works in pots as well.

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:37.696
And so we can find a
lot of interesting tools

00:05:38.056 --> 00:05:41.076
and if you've got a gardener
friend who likes to garden even

00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:43.376
in the winter you might
consider these as gifts.

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:45.500
