00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.200
Today we are going to show you how to install
a simple DIY built in robe using plasterboard

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.170
and a steel framing system and its going to
look like it's always been there.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.960
Using an electronic stud finder we mark the
position of the top frame of the wardrobe.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.810
We then mark and cut the ceiling and floor
tracks which will hold the upright studs in

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.169
place.

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.739
The stud channel is simple to use.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.989
It cuts easily with aviation snips.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.469
We then measure and screw the floor channel
into position using pan head screws.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:51.030
So now we're going to put the wall frame on,
drilling into the wall, safety glasses.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.030
Got yours?

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:01.879
Checking for level we then fix the metal stud
to the walls.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.870
We then position the top frame and mark the
fixing points for pre drilling.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.650
With the ceiling, floor and walls frames in
position, the wardrobe begins to take shape

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.850
quite quickly.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.100
We then use a piece of track for the top of
the door frame.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.630
We cut and bend a flap in each end to act
as a bracket that we can screw into.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.220
We then add some small upright frames to support
the plasterboard above the door.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.450
Then we begin to mark and cut the plasterboard
sheet ready for fixing.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.210
Plasterboard is a really user friendly material.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.450
It cuts easily with a standard trimming knife
and then breaks neatly along the cut.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.320
I then use a piece of cornice to mark the
cut-out on the plasterboard.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.770
It makes for a neat fit and less filling.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.970
Using stud adhesive and bugle head screws
we are going to fix the inside sheet first

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.010
the we will come around and do the outside.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.810
Ill just get these last couple on.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.019
Right, up we go.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.379
Having precut the plasterboard we then use
adhesive and then fix it into position.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.670
The adhesive dries fairly quickly and the
combination of screws and adhesive ensures

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.269
the overall strength of our built in robe.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:36.129
Once the plasterboard is all on, we use a
metal corner moulding for extra strength.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:46.109
We also apply paper tape to where the plasterboard
meets the existing wall.

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.260
We then fix the cornice into place using cornice
adhesive.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.040
Before the adhesive goes off give it a good
clean-up with a sponge, it saves a lot of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.049
time later, right Dene?

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:05.310
Our split door frame is a great idea, you
put it in in 2 parts and it screws together

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.900
beautifully.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.870
We've pre-painted the frame and the doors
so we fix the into position and the wardrobe

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.749
starts to look great.

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.999
Perfect, Beautiful.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:24.469
All you need to do is just dress it up inside
with whatever you want, shelves draws or pigeon-holes

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:25.469
or whatever and that's it.

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.480
And it wasn't too difficult, it's something
you can do at home.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.930
It looks like it belongs there.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.059
A coat of paint and it's done.
