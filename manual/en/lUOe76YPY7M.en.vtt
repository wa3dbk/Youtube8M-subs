I am Chris Kelley and we are here with Expert
Village. Wheelies are an important aspect

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.119
in these races where you bring your front
wheel up and also if you are going to get

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:22.210
into stunt riding. It is an aspect that you
need much clutch and throttle control. With

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.300
your feet out, a wheelie position you are
going to want to stay in your attack neutral

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.820
position but you are going to want to get
a little bit of weight back. You are gonna

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.390
want to get back on the seat a little bit
and kind of what they say pop the clutch.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.190
But you donâ€™t just let it out. You are going
to let it out until it starts to grab and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.640
then you will get ready to apply the throttle.
As you let that clutch out, you are going

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.470
to get on the throttle with a good amount
of speed to pick the front wheel up. This

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.280
is where your balance comes into play. Once
you get that bike up it is a matter of your

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.731
throttle and your rear brake. If the bike
starts tipping a little too far to the back

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:07.930
you are going to want to tap the rear brake,
put a little foot on that and that will bring

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.150
your bike right back down. A good rider with
a wheeler can ride a long distance because

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.890
they can bring that front wheel up, they will
get it to a balancing point and they will

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.530
use the throttle to either bring the bike
back or the rear brake to bring the bike forward

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.030
if they feel like they are starting to tip
over a little bit too far to the back. So

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.530
that is the main key on wheelies is just to
be able to lift that front wheel up. When

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.220
you get it up be in a position where you can
send it over the bike and also if you start

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.690
feeling it go a little too far back, that
rear back will bring you forward. And that

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.220
throttle when you start dropping the front
wheel down, the throttle and clutch will be

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.270
able to bring you back up.
