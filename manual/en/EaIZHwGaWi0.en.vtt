00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.830
Is the iPhone 5 the beginning of the end for
Apple?

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.320
It's an incendiary, polarising question that
seems to raise the spectre of the impossible.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.320
Surely not..

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.039
Apple is the world's biggest company by stock
market capitalisation, the iPhone is the biggest

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.540
selling smartphone in the world, customers
love their iDevices.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.300
So what can possibly go wrong?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.710
Perhaps if we want to look at the potential
dangers, we need to go back in time five years

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.460
or so when the first iPhone was launched.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.750
Back in 2007, Apple was the upstart challenger
and Nokia was the market leader that was looking

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.050
a bit stuck in its ways.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.880
When Apple designed the iPhone they started
with a blank sheet of paper.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.649
They didn't have to worry about backwards
compatibility.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.040
They didn't have to worry about alienating
existing customers.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.600
They could do what they wanted and they created
a handset unencumbered by restrictions or

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.890
baggage, which appealed to customers precisely
because it was refreshingly different from

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.920
what they had in their pocket at the time.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.810
In 2007, Nokia's response was slow and half-hearted.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.240
As far as they were concerned, they were still
the market leader and by the time that Nokia

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.469
realised that the world had changed it was
almost too late for the lumbering Finnish

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.289
giant to change direction.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.670
Five years on, the situation is almost reversed.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.649
Apple is now the market leader, and it now
has to worry about all the things it didn't

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.710
have to worry about in 2007.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.170
Apple can't mess around with the formula too
much, so later generations of the iPhone have

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.409
been pretty much straight upgrades to the
previous one.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.579
The iPhone 5 is really just a bigger, faster
iPhone 4S.. and the iPhone 4S was just an

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.829
upgraded iPhone 4 and so on.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.799
In 2012 though, Nokia is now the challenger.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.229
Last year, Nokia hard rebooted the company
and joined forces with Microsoft.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.330
Nokia's first generation of Windows Phones
were so-so devices that couldn't compete with

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.300
the best in class, but the second generation
Lumia 920 certainly is competitive with the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.160
very best rival devices, and it shows what
a company can create when it stops worrying

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.700
too much about what it did in the past.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.470
In almost every respect the Lumia 920 outclasses
the iPhone 5.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.200
It has a bigger screen with the same pixel
density as the iPhone, a much better camera,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.220
NFC support and wireless charging and it looks
great with a modern take on classic Nokia

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.870
designs.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.750
Yes, the Nokia Lumia 920 is a massive device
which is 65% heavier than the Apple.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.740
And the Nokia's Windows 8 operating system
is so new that there are no applications available

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.930
for it yet.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.350
But customers have shown that they don't mind
larger smartphones (witness the millions of

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.710
Samsung Galaxy Notes that have shipped) and
the applications will surely start to come

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.980
when developers can get their hands on the
devices.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.150
Nokia has all the advantages of starting with
an (almost) clean sheet.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.210
Apple does not.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.490
But what's worse for Apple is that it is also
being squeezed by Android devices which offer

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.230
a much greater choice.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.620
The result of this lack of room to manoeuvre
is the iPhone 5.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.390
Although it is undoubtedly a good device,
it packs no surprises.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.930
A bigger screen?

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.060
Well that was inevitable.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.700
A faster processor?

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.700
Of course.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.700
Upgraded software?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.700
We wouldn't expect anything else.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.430
Yes, it's better than the iPhone 4S, but we
can't see that people are going to be trading

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.690
in their Galaxy S IIIs to get an iPhone instead.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.230
So who is actually going to buy the iPhone
5?

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.670
Well, mostly existing iPhone customers.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.760
Yes, that's a lot of people, and that should
produce some decent sales figures.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.260
And the BlackBerry market is looking soft
at the moment, so Apple might pick up some

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.380
figures from there.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.960
But by and large, the iPhone 5 doesn't have
anything to tempt existing Android users away

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.430
(where the Lumia 920 does) and it really looks
like Apple will just end up recycling its

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.870
own customer base rather than wiping out the
competition.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.610
The path of sales success followed by decline
has been trodden many times before.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.020
Nokia used to be the clear market leader but
is now struggling, RIM ignored warning signs

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.639
and stuck with its aging formula for too long.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.919
Before that, Motorola nearly killed itself
off with the original RAZR.

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.340
Big companies such as Apple tend to become
risk-averse.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.509
They have to worry about shareholder value,
and if they're not careful they end up being

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.550
run by accountants.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.909
But consumers demand more choice and new ideas,
and that's the sort of thing that the late

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.360
Steve Jobs was good at nurturing.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.189
Can Apple ever regain that sort of spirit?

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:05.620
People who are familiar with Apple's history
can see that this has happened to Apple before.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.479
Perhaps the critical step will be Apple's
next generation of iPhones.

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.470
The challenge for Apple is to come up with
something better and more radical during 2013.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.039
Just producing more of the same is just going
to lead to decline in the long term.

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.840
And yes, we truly believe that unless the
iPhone 6 can recapture the spirit of the original

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.599
iPhone, then Apple will be facing a long-term
decline against strengthened competition.

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:38.289
So, to paraphrase Winston Churchill: Is the
iPhone 5 the beginning of the end for Apple?

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.289
Possibly.

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.809
But it is certainly the end of the beginning.

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.240
Oh.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.210
And by the way, according to Betteridge's
Law of Headlines the answer to any headline

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.599
with a question in it is generally, simply:
"no".
