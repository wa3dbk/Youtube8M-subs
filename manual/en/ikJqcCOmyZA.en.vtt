00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:10.350
Ya know one of the things in fishing is a
theory called, just fish it all.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.799
Ya know and that’s what we are trying to
do here.

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.310
We start on that open water flat, fished a
bunch of crankbaits, no bites and no grass.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.510
So we just kind of made a move over to this
corner and there’s marina docks and so when

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.200
I’m practicing and in that search mode,
I really do try to fish everything.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.420
You look over and if you see something that
catches your eye, go over and fish it.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.440
Give it 10 or 15 minutes.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.550
A lot of times docks are real good areas this
time of the year when your in that funny transition.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.100
Ya know docks are like ladders so when you’re
coming out of the deep water and heading shallow,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.079
a lot of times these docks will act like ladders
and they will follow these ladders up to the

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.079
spawning area.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.859
So we are just going to kind of are gonna
run through these docks real quick.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.250
Switch from the crankbait and I’m actually
pitching now, I am pitching a brand new bait

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.110
by Berkley that’s called a Havoc bait.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.580
This is a shape that Skeet designed called
a Pit Boss.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.340
It’s just a really cool bait, got a lot
of great action to it.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.390
Let’s cover a little water here just to
see if we can get any kind of more clues as

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.140
to what’s happening.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.690
It’s got no clues right now.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:02:02.979
Zero information.
