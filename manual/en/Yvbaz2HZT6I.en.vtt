Hey everybody, Arkadian here back with another episode of Tips 4 Bronze

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:22.400
This weeks topic, Champion Select

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:25.535
Tips 4 Bronze

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.769
So this week I'm going to be focusing on

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.034
champion select and some of the things you might not really think about but are definitely important

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:36.160
and should help you climb

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:41.788
So let's take a step back

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:42.654
before you even hit that play button

00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:43.260
and think

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.200
are you even ready to play this game?

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:51.015
Firstly, if you are tired, hungry, distracted or dazed

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:52.475
you won't play as well

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:57.214
you'll be more easily frustrated and that might just make you say or do something

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:59.569
that could set off another player of put you on tilt

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.494
Make sure you have time to play the game

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:06.573
League of Legends isn't a 30 minute or even 45 minute game

00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:10.840
You should make sure you have at least an uninterrupted hour before you queue up

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.670
because that's just how long it takes

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.636
and then you have to think about champion select, queue dodges, loading screens

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:20.335
all those things take time 

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:23.375
Don't play on tilt

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:29.235
tilt is when you are down or feeling bad about the last game or the last few games you've played

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:33.796
if you go into a game with a negative attitude you might as well throw your LP away

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:40.875
Something to help avoid tilt is to realize that losing is an unavoidable truth of this game

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.275
even the best players lose 50% of their games

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:48.540
so just remember that losing happens it's just a matter of playing each game to your best 

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:49.436
as it comes

00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:54.034
but if you do get down, because it does happen to all of us, just take a break

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:54.560
dont play

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.580
Think of playing ranked like gambling

00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:01.695
you literally are betting the system 25-30 LP that you will win the next game

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.700
and if you do win, you get the LP but if you lose, you lose it

00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:14.171
now you wouldn't gamble if you had a terrible hand in poker, so don't gamble your LP if you aren't holding all your aces

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.500
Now that you know are ready to play, you've queued up and are in champion select

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.695
lets meet your allies

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:27.615
The way I think about it is that I have no idea who these people are 

00:02:27.954 --> 00:02:29.794
what kind of day they've had

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:32.680
if they are on tilt if they are angry or frustrated

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:39.175
so it's just better to assume that they're all on the verge of losing their minds and AFKing

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:44.480
now whether you like it or not the Riot overlords have paired you with these four other individuals

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.140
and these are the four people you have on your team which will make the difference between winning and losing

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.295
you've already got five enemies on the enemy team

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:55.696
you don't need anymore on yours

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.360
this being said and knowing that a happy team = the elo dream

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.980
its time to employ the super nice guy tactics

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.400
and just be as cheerful and positive as possible

00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:10.875
as much as you may hate it or as insincere as it may be

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.994
this is a strategic play that will increase your chances of winning

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.415
just like Baron or taking Smite to jungle

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.460
It's also good to get people talking 

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:24.568
let people know what you prefer to play

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:27.180
while also letting them know if you can fill anything

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:30.373
but open with your preference incase you get it

00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:36.494
however if somebody ends up saying "Mid or Feed" or "ADC Only" 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.260
but you really want to play that role

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.695
look up their summoner of LoLking or Op.gg

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.380
see how much they play that role, can they only play that role? and if so just let them have it

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.356
It will keep them happy and it will help you win the game

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.874
even if you are better than them at that role

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:59.974
Also respect pick order, but others ecpect your allies to do that same

00:04:00.503 --> 00:04:06.743
If somebody two picks below you says "Top or AFK" and you think you can pick Tryndamere because

00:04:06.743 --> 00:04:08.354
it's all good because you're second pick

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:11.274
don't be surprised if he insta locks Teemo 

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:16.154
if you want to climb you need to adapt, accept that some people will be stubborn

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.340
it's your job to get the best outcome from that

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:24.975
Now you've sorted your team out and hopefully know where you are going to play

00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:29.535
It's time to pick a champion, now a lot of people believe they have a better chance of winning

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:33.826
if they pick the OP champion of the month they saw in LCS

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.360
or the top meta picks

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.940
this simply isn't true to be honest the meta that exists in the LCS rarely ever even applies to SoloQ

00:04:43.374 --> 00:04:44.894
let alone in lower elos

00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:50.114
Yes it is true that some champions can be really strong with buffs and nerfs 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.540
but its almost always to play what you enjoy

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.896
play what you're comfortable with

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.854
if you have a 150 games on Darius and know him inside out

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.000
but Maokai is the current OP champion

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.995
play Darius because your skill will always outweigh a slightly overtuned champion

00:05:12.418 --> 00:05:16.658
That being said you should never criticize other peoples picks

00:05:16.658 --> 00:05:17.240
if somebody is trying a champion who is out of meta or weak

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.180
them them play what they are comfortable with

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.774
its the people who pick random champions who usually surprise you and the enemy the most

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.540
Nobody knows how to play against an AD Malzahar 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.500
Lastly, i cannot stress enough how important it is that you can play every role with at least one champion

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.414
People say that you should never just play one champion to climb but I disagree

00:05:39.414 --> 00:05:43.740
Because the best way to get better at this game is play against better enemies

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.480
and the fastest way to get there is be the best you can be

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.720
Playing just one champion can increase your chances of climbing greatly

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.715
but you also need to recognize you won't get your role in every game so you must be able to fill

00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:04.354
a general rule of thumb is to be able to play at least one champion in each role well

00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:07.755
as you get more comfortable you can expand your pool

00:06:09.615 --> 00:06:13.695
Did you know that you can use search terms in champion select?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.480
you can type things in like "Ahri|Vi|Fiora"

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.275
to show just those champions

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.580
or "^SH" to show all the champions that start with those letters

00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:29.115
or all the champions that end with "i" by using the "i$" 

00:06:29.115 --> 00:06:35.695
I'll leave a full list of commands in the description  but this can be really handy to get all your champions ready to pick

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.520
just in case somebody is taking awhile to choose

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.014
when you enter the lobby, throw up a funny YouTube video or joke to lighten the mood

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:47.654
talking in champion select can easily cheer people up and maybe throw them off tilt

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.760
people associate talking with positivity and winning 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.754
Keep track of what your allies say

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.820
if someody says they can only play Hecarim and have 1000 Hecarim games

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.520
then the queue dodges and he isn't on your team anymore

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.020
Maybe it's a good idea to ban Hecarim so they enemy team can't play him

00:07:06.313 --> 00:07:08.073
So that's all for this week

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:10.060
I hope you learned something and I hope you enjoyed

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.140
