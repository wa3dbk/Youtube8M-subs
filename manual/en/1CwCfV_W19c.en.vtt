00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:07.149
Now let's learn the last Chinese word in this
part for clothes. That is school uniform.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:25.510
In Chinese, it is xiao fu.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:36.199
Okay, very easy to understand. Fu means wear
or clothes. And xiao means school. Like in

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:46.519
English, the uniform we'll wear at school.
It's xiao fu in Chinese. And the right part

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:59.429
of xiao is its pronuncitation part. Because
it's pronunciation is xiao and jiao. Very

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:11.770
similar. And fu here. Okay, let's come to
xiao fu again. This is a short right. This

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:25.579
is a short long dot. Okay, then left, right.
Left before the right strokes here. Okay,

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:36.799
xiao fu, school uniform. And in the part of
the clothes names we have learned something

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:52.440
fu, as in xiao fu. Something yui as in mau
yui. Something gong as in nun gong. So you

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:02.710
can tell now that fu yui gong are three characters
that mean clothes and they appear in many

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.420
clothes names in Chinese.
