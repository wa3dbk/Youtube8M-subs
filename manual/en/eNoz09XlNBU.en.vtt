Hello Everyone and welcome to this the second
of my vlogs I would like to tell , talk to

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.469
you today about choosing and using a white
cane.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.500
There are three types of white cane available.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.410
There is the solid cane which is just one
length of wither fibre glass, aluminium or

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.420
wood which you then carry with you and use
to find your way around.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:42.920
There are telescopic canes which as the name
suggests fit together like 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.920
a telescope.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.800
Then th there is also the folding cane.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.789
I prefer a foolding cane.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.739
This is my cane one of my favourite canes.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.499
I actually have three canes.

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:03.859
I would advise you to buy several canes of
your own so you have a choice when you go

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.360
out.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:16.020
Also they do fail with these folding canes
is the bungee chord in the centre sometimes

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.360
wears and frays and will snap.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.619
This means that the whole cane falls apart.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.020
If you haven't got a backup then you can have
serious problems.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.490
There are two types of tips which are generally
available there is a solid tip which allows

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.200
you to tap your way around.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.130
Or I like these mushroom tips.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:48.670
It is a roller which moves left to right and
freely rolling and this allows you as you

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:58.149
walk you can roll the ball along the ground
and you can hear and feel the ground you are

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.609
walking on so if you are on the sidewalk or
pavement you can hear the construction whther

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:11.971
it is tarmac or concrete slabs you can hear
the click as you go over any gaops you can

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:21.040
also hear one of the things I have found is
in my local area the corners often the sidewalks

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.660
sound hollow as I get to the roadside so I
can generally detect that I am coming up to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.700
a road junction.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.720
Just by the sound of the roller on the pavement.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.410
When you are buying your cane it is important
to decide which type you would like.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.160
The full length cane or telescopic or folding
cane.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.650
Now I like the folding cane over the telescopic
because I have found with the telescopic canes

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:02.370
as you go in and out of buildings or restaurants
you close up the cane then you leave and you

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.450
can't always find what length the cane was
before so you are continually adjusting the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.980
length of you cane and adapting yourself to
the cane.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.200
With this type of cane , the folding cane,
you buy it in a set length.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.550
This one is fifty four inches long I am about
five feet ten inches tall so that is around

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:39.550
sixty two inches you then measure the cane
from the chest area down to the floor.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.580
So it goes from roughly the top of your collar
bone you feel like an indent on the top of

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.000
your collar bone down to the floor.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.330
That is about the right length of cane for
you.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:04.510
Some people prefer it up againt their nose
but I prefer it just below my chin.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.930
By my chest when you stand vertically.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:21.280
With the folding cane you simply click like
that and it makes one solid cane.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:34.930
You can see this is how it looks If I come
to about the right distance from the camera.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.630
This is were it comes on me.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:48.539
In order to hold the cane I hold it with my
hand open and keeping the wrist straight as

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:57.520
I can then I just flick the cane from side
to side using my thumb and ring finger I am

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.199
left handed so I use the cane in my left hand.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.439
You can use the cane in your right hand.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:09.259
That is just a simple movement I don't really
move the wrist very much.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.479
That can cause cramping in your wrist if you
are walking any distance.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.749
After a while you happily feel thr rolling
of the cane back and forth.

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:23.460
With your thumb and ring finger.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:32.169
Then the weight of the cane is also very important
Try if you can to personally go and choose

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.259
a cane.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:44.330
I have bought canes online and I find it very
difficult at times to get just the right weight

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.280
of cane.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:54.270
With these mushroom tips the cane tends to
be tip heavy it pulls the cane down onto the

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.849
ground which is a good thing.

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.189
It means that you don't have to hold the cane
down onto the ground.

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:02.529
as you walk.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:12.090
If the cane is too heavy itself the length
of the cane acts as a lever and so it can

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:19.710
get very very heavy and very tiring if you
are just walking with a cane and then you

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:29.289
need to rest more often and it is rather disappointing
if you need to rest your thinking more about

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:38.469
actually finding somewhere to sit rather than
enjoying the walk.

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:47.249
Well that's all about buying a cane I hope
that you will be able to enjoy using your

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:54.840
cane going about around your hometown and
visiting new places.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.749
I hope that some of this advice has been useful
to you.

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:01.569
Thank you for your time.
