00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.259
Good afternoon RVing friends.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.410
My name is Keith. I've been selling the
RV Awning Travel Lock on this site for

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.440
over five years.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.139
I just finished looking at the
statistics and

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.680
found that I had a lot of visitors
yesterday and today---

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.300
Valentine's Day and Saturday the
day after---

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.430
and most, well not most, but many, many,
of them came from the RVing forum iRV2.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.179
 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.930
and I appreciate those (garbled) people at
the site.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.450
I noticed three or four comments
there that I would specifically like to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.329
comment on.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.710
First is that one person commented that

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.020
a well-designed and manufactured

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.059
RV patio awning or any other owning
should not come unfurled

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.770
and I would absolutely agree with that.
Unfortunately

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.789
they do come unfurled. I know it

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.320
and many many other people know it and ahh

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
its it's unfortunate.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.869
I would think that they would make their
products so that it doesn't come

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.280
unfurled but they still make them

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.439
such that they do come unfurled.
Therefore some kind of preventive

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.520
measures have to be taken to keep it
from coming unfurled.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.860
First of all, you might go through years and
years of RVing

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.020
and never have one come unfurled. If
you do

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.470
you're lucky and a I'm glad for you.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.270
If you have had one come unfurled you
will never want it to happen to you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.860
again,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.189
I can assure you of that. The next
comment

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.729
is that many people still believe that

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.930
strapping or securing the the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.310
upright post together prevent it from
coming unfurled.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.170
It simply does not work that way!

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.740
If, if you've been using those and it
hasn't come unfurled it's been, as some

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.560
other poster commented, it's because
you're lucky, not because they're

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.280
effective.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.329
What has to happen is that the roller tube

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.940
must be secured so that it cannot rotate

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.599
because if it can't rotate then the
awning can't

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.590
come unrolled or unfurled while
you're driving down the road. Another

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.530
comment is that some people

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.569
believe that electric awnings don't
come unfurled.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.610
Unfortunately, they do come unfurled.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.840
We've had

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.830
a lot of them come unfurled and even
one manufacturer says that theirs won't come

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.220
unfurled but it does.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.560
So it's important to try to secure

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.730
those also. Those are the main points I
wanted to cover.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.730
I really thank those

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.239
participants at the Forum who

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.140
who comment on particularly the RV
Awning Travel Lock

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.260
and leave a link to it because that's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.849
very good advertising for me and it
helps other people

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.040
not have their awning unroll. Anyway
thanks a lot,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.849
enjoy your RV, and take care.
