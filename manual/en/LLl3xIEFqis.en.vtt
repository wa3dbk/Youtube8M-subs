00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.400
one of the greatest things about working at
a diverse university

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.040
like at San Diego State is that you're constantly
presented with

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.830
different points of view having those
different perspectives

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.820
allows you to you see the world through a
different lens and potentially come up

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.270
with the best solution that's why it's
important to our faculty and staff

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.360
that's why it's important to our students

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.640
SDSU is

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.730
in particular a really exciting dynamic
place

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.870
I love that about SDSU I love that about my
work I love that

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.050
you know students are coming through the
system and teaching me something new

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.320
every day the face of the world is
changing

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.780
everyone dances to a beat of 
different drum

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.989
but I think SDSU recognizes that when
you bring

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.190
those people together even though we're dancing
differently

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.280
the drums are beating differently when we
come together there's harmony

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.000
harmony and the music sounds good

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.700
In our communities in San Diego

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.890
there are lots of culture activities going on

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.710
lots for culture exchange going home

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.560
so it's very important for people who work at SDSU

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.380
and also students and SDSU

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.299
to talk about diversity San Diego
State University is an ideal

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.799
institution environment for those faculty
particularly interested in diversity

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.880
as part of daily life and also as part
of their

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.420
scholar researcher life as also the
instructor like

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.780
in the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry we have more than 50

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.600
percent

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.149
of our students from different

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.399
and represented groups and we need

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.350
at diverse faculty to educate

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.570
and mentor certainly in engineering  we work
together in teams

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.490
it's usually teams of people that are from other

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.290
countries other

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.380
nationalities other religions and you have to be able to not only respect

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.050
but enjoy the cultural differences amongst
people

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.250
my colleagues were on board with me from
the very beginning

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.930
and they are there to this day there's a sense of unity

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.500
centered on how we're all different

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.910
diversity and inclusion and the excellence of the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.680
Companies that are woven together in
the fabric of our campus in a variety of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.450
different ways

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.560
and our students appreciate that
