asteroid field is approximately 3, 720 to 1. Han: Never tell me the odds.

Narrator: Asteroids collide all the time.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.250
At least, we think they do. Close-up views from spacecraft show asteroids

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.310
to be pockmarked with impact craters. But until recently, astronomers

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.450
never expected they'd see the recent aftermath of a collision.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.510
Now, thanks to Hubble and Swift, they have. In

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.540
early 2010, Hubble took a close look at the tail of what astronomers thought was an unusual

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.700
comet. The curious tail turned out to be wreckage from a collision between two

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.730
small asteroids. On December 11, 2010,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.770
astronomers saw that another asteroid, (596) Scheila, had also grown a tail.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.830
Swifts ability to see ultraviolet light helped astronomers rule

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.870
out the possibility that they were looking at a comet. None of the gasses characteristic

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.930
of a comet were detected. These plumes are clouds of dust,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.980
debris from the impact of a smaller asteroid, less than 100 feet across.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The shape, evolution, and content of the plumes let astronomers reconstruct

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.080
what happened.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.110
The smaller asteroid would have been heading towards Scheila at about 11,000 miles per

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.170
hour.

It hit at a low angle with the force of at least a 100 kiloton nuclear

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.470
bomb. Yet much of the debris fell back onto the asteroid.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.500
The particles that escaped were the smallest ones. Easily

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.570
pushed around by sunlight, this fine dust formed wispy plumes.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.590
When Hubble observed Scheila two weeks later, the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.620
plumes were barely visible. Within two months of the outburst,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.690
the plumes were completely gone--and with them went any sign from Earth that Scheila even had

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.710
a collision. Astronomers estimate that, somewhere in the asteroid

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.750
belt, events like this may happen as often as every year. Thanks to Hubble and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.860
Swift, we're just beginning to see them.
