00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.210
You know that feeling in your gut that you
get when all your bags are packed... ready

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.210
to go.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.790
Wherever your journey takes you-- maybe a
few days or a few years-- there's excitement,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.630
anxiety, anticipation, fear.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.550
Fear is the key.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.710
It's the difference between a vacation and
an adventure.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.510
A fear of setting out under imperfect circumstances
with equipment that is far from ideal.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:51.040
Fear that is at the same time decimated and
compounded the minute you embark.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.159
The coward in you burns to turn around and
give up, and just return to the norm, while

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.120
courage and curiosity pushes you forward.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.000
It happens every time.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.960
I set out on a 1000 mile, three day journey
to meet some friends aboard a DRZ 400 dirtbike

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.470
with a bald back tire.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.350
On the road the DRZ is slow, loud, and bone-rattling
uncomfortable.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.860
Why do it on a dirt bike?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:35.390
Because sometimes we choose to handicap ourselves
to push us a little harder.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.930
My route was designed to go no faster than
60, and see every vacant, forgotten back road

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:49.390
south of Richfield.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.390
You roll the dice when you choose backroads
over familiar freeways and tourist routes.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.080
You could see nothing but sage brush and tumbleweeds
spread between random dilapidated gas stations,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.010
or you might see what few ever dare to.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.500
No car.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.000
No trailer.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.190
It's just you, and a bike that can take you
anywhere.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:06:58.499
This is why we ride the dual sport motorcycle.
