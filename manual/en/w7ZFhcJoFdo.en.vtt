00:00:01.279 --> 00:00:04.390
We're here today at Fold-a-Cover in our research and development lab

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.980
today we're going to take a look at some of the
key functionality differences

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.180
between the Fold-a-Cover

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.099
and the Extang Solid Fold.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.659
Immediately, the first thing you'll
notice, is the G4 Elite utilizes a

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.349
four panel folding system which allows
for seventy five percent of the truck

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.089
bed to be used when fully stacked.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.859
Whereas the Solid Fold only uses three.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.239
Another major difference you'll notice
is the process that takes to open the cover.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.930
Now that we have a cover open we can see that
the Solid Fold does not use a rail system

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.130
this means cover sits directly on the
bed rails

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.010
this allows for dirt,sand, and other abrasive material to collect beneath the cover.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.740
Overtime this will be damage the finish of your truck bed.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.260
Another key difference between the Fold-a-Cover and the Extang Solid Fold is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.060
the latching system.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
The LS Series Fold-a-Cover uses a
six-point lighting system and the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.840
G4 Elite Fold-a-Cover uses an eight point latching system.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.540
The Solid Fold attaches to your truck
bed with only four plastic clamps.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.860
Additionally, when the Solid Fold is in the
fully open position, there are only two

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.220
plastic clamps attaching the cover to your truck bed.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.490
Security is another major difference
between the Fold-a-Cover products

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.710
and the Extang Solid Fold.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.450
The Fold-a-Cover products each come with a
locking mechanism that secures both the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.070
tailgate and the cover.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.680
The Solid Fold on the other hand has no
locking mechanism so unless you have a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.530
locking tailgate your truck bed is not
secure.
