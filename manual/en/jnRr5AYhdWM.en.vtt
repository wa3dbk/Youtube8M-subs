00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:46.504
Crossroads

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:49.249
and given the option

00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:54.743
to pass and look back at goals I've missed.

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:58.053
Rainbows

00:00:58.053 --> 00:01:00.889
are burning bridges,

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:05.740
if you squint a little more it looks the same.

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:10.377
But oh,

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:14.552
there's a little bit of me inside you

00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:18.361
gathering what you've lost.

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:22.016
But oh,

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:26.097
there's a little bit of you in everyone...

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.422
...can never keep a secret.

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:32.320
Problems,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.151
lines on your face.

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:40.300
You smooth them out so no one can tell.

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:44.195
Put a straight back

00:01:44.462 --> 00:01:46.903
upon a stage,

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:51.743
could dance dance hide the tremor in your hand.

00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.431
But oh,

00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:59.931
there's a little bit of me inside you

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:03.683
gathering what you've lost.

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:07.520
But oh,

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:11.464
there's a little bit of you in everyone.

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:18.224
And I'm watching you now,

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:21.478
I see you building the castle with one hand

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:26.181
while tearing down another with the other.

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:29.415
And I'm watching you now,

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:33.147
I see you building the castle with one hand

00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:37.332
while tearing down another with the other.

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:40.931
And I'm watching you now,

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:44.594
I see you building the castle with one hand

00:02:44.907 --> 00:02:49.133
while tearing down another with the other.
