00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.030
Do you live in a megacity?

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.499
Yes, that’s a real term.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.450
It’s used to describe a metropolis with
over 10 million residents.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.059
Right now, there are 28 megacities in the
world, with about 450 Million inhabitants

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.170
among them.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.980
The most densely populated areas can have
an average of more than 100 thousand people

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.169
per square mile.

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.220
So what are some of the largest cities in
the world?

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.339
Well, when we talk about “largest cities”,
we’re usually talking about the number of

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.339
inhabitants.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.029
There are many organizations that rank cities,
but for this video, we’re relying on 2014

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.309
data from the United Nations.

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.060
Cities in Asia have dominated the top-ten
list for a long time now.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.600
On the very top, by a long shot, is Tokyo,
Japan, with about 38 million people.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.059
Tokyo has been the most populous megacity
since about 1955, and it will likely remain

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.899
that way until sometime after 2030.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.590
After Tokyo, three other Asian cities dominate
the top of the ranks - Delhi , Shanghai, and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.510
Mumbai . Out of all the people living in urban
areas in the world, 53% reside in Asian cities.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.180
Before Tokyo grew so large, New York City
in the United States was the most populous

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.270
city from the 1920s to the 1950s.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.090
However today, NYC barely makes the top ten
list.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.900
To the south, Mexico City in Mexico and Sao
Paulo in Brazil comprise other non-Asian metropolises.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.300
The world’s largest cities are also sometimes
measured in terms of population density, and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.300
land size.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.940
Asian cities, again, are at the top of these
rankings.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.880
City sizes, in square miles, tend to vary
dramatically, but China’s Shanghai and Beijing

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.321
are reportedly among the largest land-wise,
as is Pakistan’s Karachi . Then, cities

00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:41.970
like Manila in the Philippines, and Dhaka
in Bangladesh, reportedly have some of the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.150
highest population densities in the world.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.330
Dhaka , according to a report by Demographia,
has more than 15 million people living on

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.550
just 139 square miles of land.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.060
And that breaks down to about 100 thousand
people per square mile.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.970
For the past six decades, urban cities like
these have seen unprecedented growth.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.440
In 2007, for the first time ever, the global
urban population outnumbered the global rural

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.680
population.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.650
And the trends are expected to continue: by
2050, the UN predicts about two thirds of

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.970
the world will be living in urban cities.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.220
And by that time, there could be 13 ADDITIONAL
megacities prospering around the globe.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.220
Languages, like cities, are one of the most
interesting ways to study how people interact.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.660
So what are the biggest languages in the world?

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:39.820
Take a look at our video here.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.690
Thanks for watching TestTube, we’ll see
you again tomorrow.
