00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:00.909
 

00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.640
Hello I'm Wayne Allyn Root for Personal Liberty.
Only a madman would gamble with our lives…our

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.879
children’s lives…and the entire American
economy. Why would President Obama play “Russian

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.099
Roulette” with the future of our country?
It’s a gamble no sane leader would take.

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.029
The life and death issue is Ebola. The President
is more concerned with political correctness

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.099
(and golf) than taking common sense precautions
to prevent a deadly pandemic. Why does this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.200
President not see his responsibility is to
keep the odds as low as possible?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.330
There are three simple, common sense actions
any President who cared about American citizens

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.870
would take:

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.550
#1) Ban all flights from the Ebola Zone and
quarantine all travelers coming from any Ebola

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.200
Zone. This is an absolute ‘no brainer’.
Time is wasting. It should have been done

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.440
months ago and may already be too late. Who
knows how many people in America right now

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.380
(or flying here tonight or tomorrow) are already
infected.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.380
#2) Secure and seal the border- NOW. Any day,
any minute, illegal immigrants sick with Ebola

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.550
could be walking across our border.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.530
Worse, how easy is it for our radical Muslim
enemies to send Ebola infected terrorists

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.460
across the border? How simple to infect and
send hundreds of “Ebola suicide terrorists”

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.380
into our hospitals and children’s schools.
All our radical Jihadist enemies have to do

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.880
is inject tainted Ebola blood into volunteer
suicide bombers or worse, innocent children,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.440
and send them across the border. Undetectable,
they walk across our Southern border showing

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.870
no symptoms and surrender to U.S. border agents.
Obama disperses them across the country where

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.670
they sneeze or cough on their lawyers, caretakers,
and classmates. It’s that easy…it’s

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.270
that simple, to start a deadly Ebola Pandemic
across America.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.820
Equally disturbing, what if Ebola spreads
to Mexico, Central or South America. Suddenly

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.510
panic ensues and hundreds of thousands of
their citizens (or even millions) run for

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.869
the U.S. border looking for America’s medical
system to save them, spreading Ebola like

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.239
wildfire… into your home and mine.

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.180
Our border is wide open to bring death and
disaster, ending America as we know it. Yet

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.099
President Obama is unwilling to do a thing
to secure it. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.060
The question is why?

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.849
#3) Return all U.S. troops from the Ebola
Zone. Obama’s decision to send troops to

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.989
Africa is pure madness. No good can come from
sending 4000 U.S. troops into harm’s way

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.569
of an invisible deadly germ.
Can you imagine the panic that will ensue

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.569
if any of our troops contract Ebola? What
if a ship becomes infected? Would it stay

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.260
at sea while most die and until the survivors
are deemed safe? Will returning planes be

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.519
diverted to military bases where every soldier
is a ticking time bomb that could infect friends,

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.379
family, entire communities?

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.779
Mr. President, it's time to tell the truth
about Ebola. It is far easier to become infected

00:02:55.779 --> 00:03:00.239
than doctors or health experts are telling
us. We are told becoming infected is an extremely

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.510
remote possibility. Really? An NBC cameraman
got Ebola without ever touching a sick patient,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.950
or entering the room of an Ebola victim. A
nurse in Dallas got Ebola while wearing heavy

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.659
protective gear. Over 200 doctors and nurses
in Africa are dead despite wearing protective

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.950
gear, washing hands with bleach, and knowing
exactly what they were dealing with. Still

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.219
they are powerless to stop it.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:29.459
My new book, “The Murder of the Middle Class”,
focuses on economic murder. Ebola is the embodiment

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.859
of this murder. An Ebola pandemic will kill
thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.129
Americans. But separate from the human tragedy,
the economic cost will overwhelm and bankrupt

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.400
our country.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.849
The cost of treating just one Ebola patient
is beyond comprehension: special ambulances;

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.819
isolation chambers; hazmat suits; weeks or
months in the hospital; quarantines for every

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.739
person that came into contact with the Ebola
victim; decontamination teams for their homes;

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.010
and even special handling of bodies for burial.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.159
We’re talking about millions of dollars
per Ebola patient. Multiply that times thousands,

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.040
tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,
maybe even millions of victims. If Ebola gets

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.620
loose in a crowded urban area, America’s
economy will crumble.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.840
Then there's the death of tourism and commerce.
Restaurants, hotels, airlines, shopping centers,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.780
movie theatres, sporting events, tourism and
entertainment of all kinds will be shut down.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.370
Sports seasons will be cancelled. Americans
will be trapped in their homes, frightened

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.490
to go outside. Commerce will grind to a halt.
Jobs lost by the millions. The economic devastation

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.050
will be unimaginable. America’s economy
(already on the ropes) will be in ashes. The

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.310
result could be total economic ruin.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.680
Yet knowing all this, Obama does nothing.
He refuses to secure the border. He sends

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.139
our young military men and women into the
death zone to face an invisible killer. He

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.430
even purposely chooses to refuse to do something
so simple and common sense as ban flights

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.060
and quarantine travelers from the Ebola Zone.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.069
Our President is putting all of our lives,
our families, our economic survival, at risk.

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.810
He is gambling with our children, our jobs,
the future survival of America. Yet none of

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.120
this has to happen.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.900
Why take that gamble? Why risk economic suicide?
Why not take all possible actions and precautions

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.840
to limit the possibility of a widespread epidemic?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.110
Is Obama criminally insane? A madman? An ignorant,
delusional fool? Or is he doing this purposely

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.169
to overwhelm America’s economic system?
Does it matter?

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.520
By the way, as America’s first case of Ebola
transmitted on U.S. soil was announced, where

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.069
was Obama? Playing his 200th round of golf
as president.

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.849
Any American who isn’t blind can see something
is very wrong. It's time for patriots, political

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.180
and military leaders to speak up. Our President
is clearly reckless, irresponsible, incompetent

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.120
or evil. Regardless of the reason, for the
sake of our families, and our physical and

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.270
economic survival, it’s time to remove Obama
from office.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.169
Now…before it’s too late. Before he gets
us all killed.

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.190
I'm Wayne Allyn Root for Personal Liberty.
See you next week. God bless America.
