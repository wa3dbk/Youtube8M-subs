00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.145
(light jingle music)

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:05.980
- Hi Friends.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.578
- Hey guys.

00:00:06.578 --> 00:00:08.494
- Thank you so much for
tuning in to Cook with April

00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:09.861
on Tasty Tuesday.

00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:11.896
i've been really addicted
to making popsicles,

00:00:11.896 --> 00:00:14.015
so this is another popsicle episode.

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:15.601
And, today we're gonna show you how

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.628
to make strawberry-banana
yogurt popsicles.

00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:20.772
- Mmmm. That's my favorite.

00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:21.707
- So, stay tuned.

00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:25.850
Start out by placing a cup
of yogurt into your blender.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.028
You can use soy, Greek, any type,

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.352
and then add a cup of fresh strawberries,

00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:32.313
or frozen if you have that as well.

00:00:32.313 --> 00:00:34.119
And then add a banana.

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:36.890
One whole large banana,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.357
and then add a couple
of tablespoons of honey,

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:41.828
preferably, you know,
two, three tablespoons,

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:45.564
less or more, depending
on how you like it.

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:46.732
And then you're gonna blend.

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:48.300
I'm using my Breville blender.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.449
Many of you have asked, and
it is an incredible blender

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.738
that I've had for, I
think, at least four years.

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:54.806
It works great.

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:56.941
After blending, you're going
to pour your ingredients

00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:58.493
into your popsicle molds,

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:02.220
and then you're going to place
the popsicle mold sticks.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.614
And then, preferably,

00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:05.876
you might want to freeze this over night.

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:08.085
But, you can freeze it
for about six hours,

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:09.554
and it'll still be hardened.

00:01:09.554 --> 00:01:11.891
But, definitely,
overnight is a great idea.

00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.014
Alright friends, so the
strawberry-banana popsicle is ready,

00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:18.631
and I let it stay and freeze overnight.

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:20.518
So, I'm not gonna be worried
about it melting today.

00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:21.368
- Mmmm.

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:25.970
So, the way you remove the
popsicle from the top is

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.457
that you run it under hot water,
or you dip it in hot water,

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:30.047
- Mmmm.

00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:31.717
- and magically it comes off.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:32.999
So, honey, would you like to try it?

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.827
- Mmmm. Does that mean I get to try it?

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.377
- Mmhmmm.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:35.047
- Alright. Here it goes.

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:36.349
- I added extra honey this time

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:37.910
'cause last time it was really tart,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.301
but I love the sweetness of honey.

00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.801
- Mmmmm.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:42.720
Is it yummy?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.855
- Oh, this is my favorite.

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:44.746
- Yeah. Can I have some?

00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:45.565
- I like this part.

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:46.331
- You were like...

00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:47.226
- I know for a second I was like...

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:49.324
- I saw you kinda like
push back being selfish.

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:50.409
- No, it was so good.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.806
(laughs loudly)

00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:54.065
- There's three other
ones there for ya hun.

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:55.501
You could have those.

00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:57.403
- I like this one too.

00:01:57.403 --> 00:01:59.038
I'm definitely gonna eat up one.

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:00.152
- I like this one.

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:02.007
- So, thank you friends,
so much, for tuning in.

00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:04.108
So, husband Justin likes this one better

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:05.543
than the last episode.

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:06.462
- I do.

00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:07.846
- It's sweeter, and it has bananas.

00:02:07.846 --> 00:02:08.570
He loves bananas.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.381
- Yeah, bananas,
strawberry-banana's my favorite.

00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:11.484
- It's yummy.

00:02:11.484 --> 00:02:12.441
- It is very good.

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:13.412
- Thank you all so much for tuning in,

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:15.517
and I promise the next
episode won't be a popsicle.

00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:16.117
(laughs)

00:02:16.117 --> 00:02:16.855
Have a beautiful day.

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:17.455
- Bye, guys.

00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:17.756
- Bye.

00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:22.700
