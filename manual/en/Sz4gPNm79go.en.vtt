00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:05.569
How to Prevent Wrinkles.

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.149
Take steps today to keep your complexion wrinkle-free.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:17.340
You will need Sunscreen Lip balm with sunscreen
Sunglasses Anti-wrinkle foods Acai or goji

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.730

Moisturizer Red wine and sunscreen with mexoryl

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.060
sx.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.079
Step 1.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.710
Protect your skin from sun damage every single
day, year-round, by wearing a broad-spectrum

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.730
sunscreen with a minimum SPF 15—including
on your lips.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.530
And wear sunglasses to prevent squinting.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.010
Look for sunscreen that contains Mexoryl SX,
an ingredient that is more effective at blocking

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.350
UVA rays than other compounds.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.350
Step 2.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.940
Cut down on sugar, which some dermatologists
believe attaches itself to collagen, causing

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.180
stiffness that leads to wrinkles.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.180
Step 3.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.559
Eat foods that have been linked to wrinkle
prevention: beans, berries, almonds, apples,

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.560
apricots, oily fish, spinach, sunflower seeds,
sweet potatoes, cooked tomatoes, and watermelon.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.560
Step 4.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.119
Try beverages that have been linked with smooth
skin.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.920
Acai berry juice, goji berry juice, and green
tea may inhibit wrinkles and help regenerate

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920
skin.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.009
Aim for 4 oz. daily of goji or acai juice
and one cup of green tea.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.009
Step 5.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.310
Apply a daily face cream containing the ingredient
retinol, a form of vitamin A that boosts collagen,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
plus a few of the following antioxidants that
prevent wrinkles by protecting skin against

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.509
free-radical damage: vitamin E, coenzyme Q10,
green tea, acai berry, caffeine, and selenium.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.710
To make sure you’re getting the most anti-wrinkle
bang for your buck, look for a cream that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.229
lists an antioxidant-containing nutrient as
one of the first five ingredients.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.229
Step 6.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.009
Apply moisturizer just before you go to bed.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.710
Dehydrated skin creases more easily, leading
to lines.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.640
To further minimize wrinkling, sleep on your
back.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.640
Step 7.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.929
Don’t smoke, and avoid second-hand smoke.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.729
Smoking depletes your skin of oxygen and essential
nutrients like vitamin A. It also damages

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.400
collagen and elastin fibers, which are key
to maintaining elasticity.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400
Step 8.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.160
Limit alcohol intake.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.910
Alcohol dehydrates skin, leading to wrinkling.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.530
When you do drink, choose red wine, which
offers antioxidants to offset alcohol’s

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.530
negative impact.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.050
Did you know A study of 400 elderly men and
women found that those who ate the most leafy

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.409
green vegetables and beans had the fewest
wrinkles.
