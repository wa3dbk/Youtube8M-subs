00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.379
Blazes of light flashed round the kitchen
and pierced Mary’s soul.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.550
A low rumbling shook the house and threw Mary
to the floor.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.550
‘You are truly blessed!

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.390
The Lord is with you.’

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.710
The words thundered round the room.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.200
Mary was terrified by the light and the figure
it was coming from.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.020
And she was confused by the words she had
heard.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.260
The sound was dreadful and yet comforting.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.620
‘W-w-w-w—‘
‘Don’t be afraid, Mary!

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.829
God is pleased with you and you will have
a son.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.570
His name will be Jesus.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.440
He will rule the people of Israel and his
kingdom will never end.’

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.750
Questions raced through Mary’s head.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.750
King?

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.320
Rule for ever?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.340
God is pleased?

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.420
Is this an angel?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.339
Finally, Mary asked the question that most
troubled her.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.210
‘But how can this be?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.450
I’m not married!’

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.580
‘The Holy Spirit will come down and God’s
power will rest upon you.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.190
Your child will be called the Son of God.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:29.220
Your cousin Elizabeth is pregnant, even though
she is old – nothing is impossible for God!’

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.830
Mary’s head was reeling, she could barely
take it all in.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.420
The Son of God!

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.799
Amazing!

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.799
Pushing thoughts of the consequences of what
might happen out of her head, Mary looked

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.840
at the angel with boldness and certainty.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.590
‘I am the Lord’s servant.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.790
Let it happen as you have said!’
