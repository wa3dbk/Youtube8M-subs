Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week --
your guide to everything that's

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.266
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.967
This week: The President spoke
on American energy security at

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.667
the Argonne National
Laboratory in Illinois;

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.767
celebrated the
Luck of the Irish;

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:16.500
honored leaders in STEM
education in small business;

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800
filled out his NCAA
tournament brackets;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.233
announced his nominee for
the Secretary of Labor;

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.500
and embarked on a
five-day trip to Israel,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.400
the West Bank and Jordan.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.200
That's March 15th to March 21st
or "Reach Out To New Horizons."

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.367
The President:
Our restless spirit, our
willingness to reach out to new

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:37.567
horizons; that's the
nature of America.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:40.533
Narrator:
On Friday, President Obama
traveled to Argonne National

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:44.133
Laboratories Nanoscale Materials
Center just outside Chicago,

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.567
Illinois, to talk about all of
the progress we're seeing from

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.734
his all-of-the-above approach to
energy independence and the risk

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:52.934
that this important sector faces
from the arbitrary cuts being

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:54.600
imposed by the sequester.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.066
Michael Duoba:
We've tested hydrogen,
Hythane, natural gas.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.834
Lynn Trahey:
I look at the ball
and stick model --

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:01.567
Stephen Ciatti:
My specialty is high-speed
combustion projects.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.734
Lynn Thaney:
Every time you mention energy
and all of that it really has an

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:05.800
impact on us.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.633
So thank you, very much,
for telling people how

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:08.567
important it is.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:09.500
The President:
It is important.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.400
Announcer:
The President of the
United States, Barack Obama.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.066
The President:
One of the reasons I was opposed
to these cuts is because they

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.333
don't distinguish between
wasteful programs and

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.367
vital investments.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:21.700
They don't trim the fat; they
cut into muscle and into bone

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.100
like research and development
being done right here that ends

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.967
up creating all kinds of
spinoffs that create good jobs

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:29.333
and good wages.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.033
Narrator:
On Monday morning, the President
made a personnel announcement in

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:35.800
the East Room introducing his
nominee for Secretary of Labor,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.934
Thomas Perez.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.633
The President:
Like so many Americans, Tom
knows what it's like to climb

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.633
the ladder of opportunity.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.700
He's the son of
Dominican immigrants.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.667
He helped pay his way through
college as a garbage collector

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:50.934
and working at a warehouse.

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:54.233
And he's helped settle some of
the largest cases ever on behalf

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:58.300
of families targeted by
unfair mortgage lending.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.967
So his story reminds us
of this country's promise;

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:02.834
that if you're
willing to work hard,

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:05.567
it doesn't matter who you
are, where you come from,

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:08.533
what your last name is,
you can make it if you try.

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:11.233
Narrator:
Later, the President honored
key supporters of STEM

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:12.667
education programs.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.533
That means education
in science, technology,

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:18.934
engineering and math,
in the Oval Office.

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:21.700
Then he headed to the Eisenhower
Executive Office Building where

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.433
100 small business owners
from across the country were

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.734
participating in a meeting
of the National Small

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:27.867
Business Association.

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.633
At the end of the day, he joined
the First Lady in the East Room

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:33.400
for a reception in honor
of Women's History Month.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.133
The President:
It is hard to believe that a
hundred years ago this month,

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:41.700
thousands of women were marching
right outside this house,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.800
demanding one of our most
fundamental rights --

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.367
the right to vote.

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:51.433
And today, a century later, its
rooms are full of accomplished

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:53.834
women who have overcome
discrimination,

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:57.700
shattered glass ceilings and
become outstanding role models

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.133
for all of our
sons and daughters.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.834
Narrator:
On Tuesday, the President
welcomed Prime Minister Enda

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:05.667
Kenny of Ireland to the White
House to honor the strong

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:09.500
bilateral partnership enduring
people-to-people ties and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.967
commitment to advancing peace,
security and prosperity in the

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:14.567
world that our
two nations share.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:19.800
The President:
We cherish this opportunity
once a year to reaffirm the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.900
incredible bond between the
United States and Ireland.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.767
This year, it also gives
us an excuse to stretch out

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:28.600
St. Patrick's Day for
a couple of extra days.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.333
Narrator:
Then it was time for the annual
traditional St. Patrick's Day

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.500
Lunch at the United
States Capitol.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.834
And then in another
rite of spring,

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:38.100
the President
engaged in some good,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.200
old-fashioned bracketology,
announcing his personal

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.200
predictions for the NCAA
Basketball Tournament that some

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.500
people like to call
"March Madness."

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.333
Speaker:
They have not won a national
championship since 2000.

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:51.066
The President:
I know; but...this
may be the year.

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:53.233
Narrator:
In the evening, the President
and First Lady hosted a

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.100
reception to celebrate their
fifth St. Patrick's Day at

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.400
the White House.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.333
During the reception the
President and Prime Minister

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:02.934
Kenny participated in the
Annual Shamrock Ceremony.

00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:04.600
The President:
Michelle, did you see this?

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.066
This day has served as a
reminder of just how many

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:11.066
threads of green are woven
into the red, white and blue.

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:15.467
And in times of war and
peace, good times and bad,

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:18.533
Americans have always found a
way to celebrate that heritage.

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:22.967
Narrator:
And then it was time to head
east, and east, and east again.

00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:29.567
Approximately 9,462
kilometers, or 5,880 miles,

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:34.066
or 5,109 nautical miles for
the President's first trip as

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:37.633
President to Israel, the
West Bank and Jordan,

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:40.166
which would keep him on the
road for the next four days.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:43.333
The President:
America's support for Israel's
security is unprecedented and

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.367
the alliance between our
nations has never been stronger.

get a picture in

Photographer:
Yeah, let's do that!

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:09.800

Let's go walk over there.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800
If you set it up I'll
take the picture for you.

I have a feeling he will figure
that one out but thanks for the

tip, though, pal!
