Hi Everyone! Kristina here. This is the second
of two videos that I'm posting today as part

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.190
of the Simon Says Stamp Pure Sunshine Release
Blog Hop. The second video I decided to do

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.850
because I really wanted to color this image
from the Princess stamp set. This is a stamp

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.039
set that I designed and I just love it. It
has a special place in my heart because I've

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.970
been drawing and illustrating like girls and
princess dresses since I was a little girl.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.860
I remember drawing all my friends and you
know I'd draw like them as a bride and I'd

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.360
put the groom next to them. It was just fun
and so it's kind of a cool moment to actually

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.030
see an illustration that I've done become
a stamp set like this. It's also a buildable

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.210
stamp set. Like I made it so this second part
of her dress, like you could leave it off

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.820
and just have it be a very plain dress or
you could stamp it over top and have a second

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.220
layer. There's a couple different options
on the stamp set. It's really kind of neat.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.350
So I just stamped on that extra layer and
I'm also going to add some jewelry. So this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.120
first stamp that I'm adding is a necklace.
Unfortunately I had to kind of bring it a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.400
little bit out of view of the camera in order
to get it on there just right. Just added

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.670
a little locket to her neck and then I'm adding
some pearls around her wrist which can double

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.720
as a bracelet or as a necklace. Now I'm going
to kind of speed up the coloring process and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.190
just turn on some music and you guys can enjoy
the coloring. Today I'm using some Copic Markers

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.190
on top of Copic X-Press It Blending Card.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.780
That finishes up all the coloring I just added
a little bit of the detail with a Uniball

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:01.119
Signo Broad White Gel Pen. That is the coloring.
