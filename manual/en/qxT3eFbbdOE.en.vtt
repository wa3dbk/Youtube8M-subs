00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.600
A team of six swimmers have claimed a new
open water relay distance record of 380 kilometres,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.890
that's 236 miles, when they completed a crossing
of the eastern Mediterranean from Cyprus to Israel.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.300
The Israeli sextet, ranging in ages between
44 and 66, left Paphos at the western end

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.230
of Cyprus on the 5th October.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.860
They set the new mark on the 10th when they
reached a point off the Israeli coast south

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.840
of Tel Aviv, but they remained on their support
yacht and came ashore together on the 11th.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.640
The aim was also to raise awareness for cleaner
seas, as one of the swimmers, Udi Erell attests:

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:15.740
Our goal was to bring to attention everybody
here in Israel and all over the world, clean

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.880
seas. We need clean seas. Unbelievably, this
team came together, it was so I'll almost

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.440
say so easy to do it with this team, it wasn't
easy but they made it easy.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.100
Israeli Environment Minister Amir Peretz,
who greeted the swimmers, said new legislation

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.829
would be enacted on the distribution of polythene
shopping bags, a huge contributory to sea pollution.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.700
The six men achieved their goal at the second
attempt after aborting their swim last year

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.940
due to rough seas.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.759
This time round though, the World Open Water
Swimming Association confirmed that a new

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.899
record had been set.
