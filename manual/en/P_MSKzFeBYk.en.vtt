Hi, this is Yolanda from VanveenBulbs.com
and in this segment we're going to talk about

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.620
grass that grows in the shade. Now we've all
had an area of our lawn that is shaded that

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.700
we've tried to grow grass in and whether we're
successful or not it's always a challenge.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.990
So there's a few hints that I can give you
to get grass to grow in shade but if none

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.670
of them work then you're just going to probably
have to give up and grow a moss garden in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.460
that area especially if you live in the northwest.
But here's some of the reasons that you cannot

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.039
get grass to grow in your shade. And number
one is because you don't water in the shade.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.140
This is kind of my shady area of my front
yard and it's in the fall, it looked pretty

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.860
good over the summer actually because I was
watering all the time but I haven't been watering

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.219
lately and because there's these big trees
above me, everything is turning brown. You

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.670
know if I would put some sprinklers out here
and water really well, this would green right

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.870
up just like the grass in the sunnier areas
have. So the number one reason that your grass

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.000
is not growing in the shade is because its
drying out. So just water it and you'll find

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.080
it'll help a lot. Another trick that I found
that helps a lot is just putting a little

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.790
bit of compost over your area if the soil
is just clay or sand or there's no nutrition

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.570
down there just by putting a little layer
of soil and just putting lots of grass seeds

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.770
in that area then doing that in the fall and
the spring every year for do it for a couple

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.520
years it usually will grow in very, very well.
Another trick is just cut a couple of the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.350
branches out from the lower parts of your
trees and it'll allow a lot more sun to come

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.980
in and so as soon as you get a certain amount
of sun in your yard, the grass will grow really

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.390
well. So grass seed it, just put tons of grass
seed on it and water it really well in the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.710
spring and the falls especially in the months
that it's still growing but you're not getting

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.200
any rain on it because of the trees, water
it. And if none of those work, here's my key.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.409
If you've got an area that's so shady that
weeds won't even grow, you've only got moss

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:14.379
and pine needles, then you probably should
give it up on the grass. I hate to say it.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.530
You can talk to your local nursery or garden
center and find out if there's certain varieties

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.519
they might recommend but outside of that,
I would start a beautiful shade garden. Put

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.090
some raised beds in, put a bunch of hostas
and fuschias and begonias and all types of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.159
cyclamen and calla lilies, just the large
white and the green callas because the other

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.519
callas that grow in the sun, the colored ones
need the sun, but the other ones will do the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.721
shade and create your own shade garden in
that area because you're going to have a very

00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:50.140
difficult time growing any grass in that area.
So good luck, water it and grass seed it and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.230
you still might have a nice garden.
