00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.393
Parris: Hi, it's Parris.

00:00:01.393 --> 00:00:04.824
Ximena: And Ximena. Welcome to Ximena week.

00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:09.157
Parris: Yes, on RainyDayDreamers. We're actually out here today to look at the partial solar

00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:10.094
eclipse.

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:16.120
[music]

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.860
Parris: Now, I'm not going to point my camera directly into the sun, just like you shouldn't look

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.651
directly into the sun, but the sun is low on the horizon. We're almost to the best viewing time

00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:30.259
when you can see the biggest missing piece of the sun where the moon has moved in front of it.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.142
Here is our equipment, our hi-tech equipment, two pieces of paper. This is all you need to see

00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:38.632
this eclipse. So you remember how to hold them up?

00:00:38.632 --> 00:00:39.825
Ximena: Yeah.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:43.739
Parris: One with the hold up in front. A little bit of sunlight is going to come through that, and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.661
we're going to use this other one as a screen. I can help you with this one. And so, what we're

00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:54.048
looking at, let me zoom in here. All right, there's our image. You can see the circle of the sun

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:59.156
with the little piece basically cut out where the moon is passing in front of the sun.

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:05.662
Now, if I move the paper further away, that should get bigger, but a little bit fainter. If you come

00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:12.724
down here, smaller but brighter, but without looking at the sun and damaging your eyes, this is a

00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:15.652
way you can watch the solar eclipse.

00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:22.992
Now, we have the binocular and you can see briefly there, there is the solar eclipse. There's a

00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:29.183
nice view of the sun and you can actually see some sunspots. The black spots there on the sun, or

00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:36.755
a cooler temperature, eruptions of gas that look dark against the bright surface of the sun. So

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:45.458
you're actually seeing sunspots and the partial solar eclipse all at the same time. Very nice.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:51.425
Okay now, never look at the sun unless you have a proper device, which we happen to have a

00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:56.672
sun peep mask from science center, that it makes it okay to look at the sun. Go ahead and take

00:01:56.672 --> 00:02:00.164
and see what it looks like through that.

00:02:00.164 --> 00:02:01.327
Ximena: Cool.

00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:02.405
Parris: Can you see the sunspots?

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:12.215
Ximena: Almost. I feel like should see one. I can't see a sunspot, but it looks like my first bite

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.539
out of a cookie.

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.367
Parris: First bite out of a cookie. All right, let me see if I can record through that with the

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:22.994
camera, but I don't know. This is with the camera through the solar filter. I can't make out the

00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:29.691
sunspots this way, but definitely, I can see the eclipse in action. So that was the eclipse, the

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.065
partial solar eclipse of 2014. How was that?

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:33.797
Ximena: It was awesome.

00:02:33.797 --> 00:02:37.984
Parris: And you were able to see sunspots looking through this device after when she found the

00:02:37.984 --> 00:02:39.720
right focus with your glasses. Right?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.631
Ximena: Yeah, I had to test it right against my glasses to see.

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:45.077
Parris: It is pretty cool to be able to see sunspots, right?

00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:45.748
Ximena: Yeah.

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:50.971
Parris: Okay now, did you know there won't be another solar eclipse for three more years that

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:56.061
you can see from North America. But, the next one will be a total solar eclipse. That means the

00:02:56.061 --> 00:03:01.232
moon will completely block the sun, and in the middle of the day the sky will go dark. You'll be

00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:07.524
able to see the stars. The birds will fly to their trees to go sleep. Now, do you think we ought to

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:09.943
make a trip if we have to, to be able to see that?

00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:10.567
Ximena: Yes.

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:15.308
Parris: Yes. I've seen one of those in my lifetime, and I remember it so clearly, so we got to go

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:16.349
do that.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.003
Ximena: Definitely.

00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:18.538
Parris: Okay, we'll put it on the calendar.

00:03:18.538 --> 00:03:19.517
Ximena: Bye.

00:03:19.517 --> 00:03:24.038
