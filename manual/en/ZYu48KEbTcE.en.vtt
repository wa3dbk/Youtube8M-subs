This is Kevin from SnowboardProCamp.com.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.920
In this beginner series video I'll show
you how to slide on the toe edge

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.609
of your snowboard. Toe sliding

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.580
allows you to control your speed on the
slope. It also allows you to travel from

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.780
one side of the run,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.890
to the other. Once you've mastered toe
sliding

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.009
You'll be ready to start turning on your
snowboard.  You want to start by finding an easy

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.300
slope to practice on.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.989
For your first try you can even get
someone to give you a hand for balance.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.969
To start your snowboard sliding bend your
knees forward towards the snow

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.640
and lift your heel edge. The more you
lift your heels

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.500
away from the snow the slower you will
go. You want to find that spot

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.899
where you can lift your heels and slide
smoothly on your toes.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.510
While sliding

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.239
keep your knees bent, your back straight
and head up.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.320
This will keep your weight in the center
of your snowboard. To slide from side to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.930
side

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.000
simply look in the direction you want to
go. Turning your head

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.409
will cause your body to turn slightly and
angle your snowboard

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.119
in the direction you're looking. To
change directions

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.350
simply look the opposite way and your
body will turn

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.880
and angle your snowboard in that
direction. By looking to the side

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.280
you'll also be able to see any obstacles
that may be in your way.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.799
To stop your snowboard from sliding side to side

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.409
simply look and face your body to the
top of the slope.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.570
Practice toe sliding until you're comfortable
controlling your speed

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.570
and traveling back and forth across the
hill. In the next beginner series video

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.020
I'll show you how to do single turns on your
snowboard. Subscriber to SnowboardProCamp
