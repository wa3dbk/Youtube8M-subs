00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.070
Hello. As some of you may know, I've written
a book. It's a fantasy novel called "The Princess

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:17.130
and The Fool". It features a Princess and
a Fool, yes, but it also features scary monsters.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.730
And I thought today I would share a very short
chapter from the book with you. It's a chapter

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.730
regarding the mythological origins of the
scary monsters in the book. It gets a bit

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.960
creepy so brace yourselves! Okay, it's just
a bit of fun.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.480
The Many Births of Baelic the Bloody
Extract from

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.440
"Myths and Legends of Old Firgenland"
by Lesung Cifesdaughter.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.180
Once, many years ago, there was a wicked King
who lived in the Magenhold and ruled over

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.660
all the lands. He wanted nothing more than
a son to continue his line, but his many wives

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.269
only gave him daughters.
Finally, the wicked King went to the shrine

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.040
of Ryneweard himself and pledged his soul
to the darkness in exchange for the gift of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.380
a son.
The next child given unto him was indeed a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.470
son, but the darkness is not to be trusted
and the child was born horribly deformed.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.770
A loathsome bundle of warts and muscle with
red eyes and sharp, black teeth.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.770
The Queen died of terrible injuries in childbirth,
and the King took it upon himself to raise

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.790
the horrific child alone.
The boy was named Baelic and the King presumed

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.110
to treat him as any other child, though his
many daughters were terrified of their brother

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.280
and would not play with him lest he bit or
scratched them.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.610
The boy grew at an alarming rate, and was
soon taller than even his eldest sister, Ferluf,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.299
though she was twelve years his senior.
In the first moon of Baelic's sixth summer,

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.660
the King was woken by cries in the night.
He ran to the nursery and saw that three of

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.510
his youngest daughters lay dead. Their blood
was on the walls and floor, and Baelic was

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.510
performing an unspeakable act on poor Ferluf.
The King and his guards managed drag Baelic

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.870
away and lock him in the Magenhold dungeon,
for the King could not bring himself to slaughter

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.870
his only son, no matter how monstrous.
Following the attack, Ferluf was with child.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.290
The babe came to fruit after less than two
moons, and Ferluf did not survive the birth.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.960
The King saw that this new child was as Baelic,
monstrous and terrible, and put a knife through

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.780
its face on the birth bed.
He still could not bring himself to do the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.380
same for his only son, however, and Baelic
the Bloody lived on in the dungeon, his unearthly

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.380
howls echoing up from the depths of the castle.
After a time, the King took to visiting his

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.750
son. The King would stare through the bars
of Baelic's cell, wondering at this eight-year

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.750
old who stood taller and stronger than his
best knight.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.870
Some say in this time that Baelic began to
talk to the King, though he had never spoken

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.790
before. Some say the King arrived at his grim
decision alone, but whatever the cause, the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.790
King began bringing things for Baelic. It
started with animals: dogs, goats, sheep,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.620
cattle. The king brought them to his son one
at a time and left them for nature to take

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.180
its course.
Most of them were eaten, but some of them

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.320
gave birth to unspeakable things, abhorrences
that should never have been, creatures that

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.320
the human mind would quail even to consider.
And that was before he started bringing him

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.170
people.
The King would bring Handmaidens and vagrants

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.350
and whores and criminals, and leave them in
the care of his son.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.230
He had his masons knock the dungeon walls
through, so Baelic had the run of every cell.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.600
A fate worse than death it was to be sent
to the dungeon in those dark days, for in

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.910
that black labyrinth of cells, Baelic or one
of his terrible offspring would eventually

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.430
find you.
It was here that all the unman horrors of

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.220
the world were born. Brittle the Banwarch,
the Skriking Angshrikes, the Finders and the

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.220
Keepers, all the wyrms, goblins, draca, boga
and everything that slithers, creeps and crawls

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.100
with evil in its heart slipped out of that
dungeon on one fateful day.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.810
The King had grown old and lost his mind to
madness and, one day, he simply walked down

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.810
to the dungeon and went in alone.
Some time later, a travelling merchant arrived

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.240
at the Magenhold to find it in ruin and all
its people slaughtered. Searching the ruins,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.010
the merchant found only two survivors. A young
couple who had hidden when the monsters emerged,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:32.010
and survived once they'd left by eating the
remains of their fellows. The hair on both

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.590
their heads had turned white, and they would
not speak of what they had seen or heard.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.040
When asked, they would cry out and fall to
the floor as if in pain and terror, shrieking

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.040
"The Prince is abroad!" over and over.
When the merchant returned with soldiers from

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.210
Elderhaime, they found the dungeon door hanging
off its hinges, the oak shredded as if by

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.920
giant claws. The dungeon was empty, save for
bones and darkness.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.520
So, next time your Mother says to be home
before dark, for the Prince is abroad, you

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.260
know exactly what she means.
And the Prince is not alone.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:27.800
So there you go. Little bit creepy. Little
bit monsteriffic. Little bit scary. But yeah,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.020
so that's a chapter from my novel The Princess
and The Fool available from Amazon. You can

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:41.000
buy this wonderful paperback copy for £9.99,
I believe. Look at the wonderful cover design

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.360
by Mr Ed Stockham. I'll put a link to Ed's
channel in the description. Yeah, go and check

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.340
it out, it's a fun fantasy adventure, but
there are, y'know, dark creepy elements to

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:03.320
it as you can see. I'm a fan of mythology
and the general horrors that are presented

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:10.740
in mythology so that's my version of that
is to give a fantasy world vaguely horrific

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.460
mythological background. That's all good fun,
innit? But, yeah, if you're into that sort

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.470
of thing: Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings,
any of that sort of fantasy nonsense but with

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.370
a bit of a sense of humour... The Princess
Bride, if you're a fan of that, check out

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.400
The Princess and The Fool. It's £9.99 like
I said for the paperback, but you can get

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:42.140
it for £1.99 on kindle. Links in the description.
It's also available elsewhere in other currencies

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:49.150
but other currencies may vary. So thanks for
sticking around. I promise I'll stop trying

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:57.710
to sell you stuff soon and do something actually
creative. Thanks for listening. Take care.
