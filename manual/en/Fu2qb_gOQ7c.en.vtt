00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What is the likelihood that mankind will destroy itself?

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.300
I say looking at the next 100 years that
there are two trends in the world today.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.500
The first trend is toward what
we call a 'Type I civilization':

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.100
a planetary civilization.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.200
A civilization that resembles something
out of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A 'Type II civilization' is stellar.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.900
They consume so much energy,
they can play with stars.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200
That is for example the
Federation of Planets in Star Trek.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.600
Star Trek would represent a
typical Type II civilization.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.700
Then we have 'Type III', which is galactic.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.500
Like The Borg, or Independence Day,
or The Empire of The Empire Strikes Back.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.700
That is a Type III civilization
which is truly galactic.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.600
Now, by the time you reach Type II,
you are immortal.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.700
Nothing known to science can
destroy a Type II civilization.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
Comets, meteors, earthquakes,
even a supernova!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.700
A Type II civilization would be able
to survive even a supernova.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.600
The danger is: the transition
between 'Type 0' and 'Type I'.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.300
And that's where we are today:
we are a 'Type 0 civilization'.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.300
We get our energy from dead plants:
oil and cole.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.200
But if you get a calculator, you can calculate
when we will obtain Type I status.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.000
The answer is: in about a 100 years;
we will become planetary.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.700
We will be able to harness all the
energy output of the planet Earth.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.200
We'll play with the weather!

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.000
Earthquakes, volcanos; anything
planetary we will play with.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.100
The danger period is now.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.200
Cause we still have the savagery,
we still have all the passions.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.500
We have all the sectarian, fundamentalist ideas
circulating around, but we also have nuclear weapons.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.700
We have chemical, biological weapons,
capable of wiping out life on Earth.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
So I see two trends in the world today.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.900
The first trend is toward a multicultural,
scientific, tolerant society.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.500
And everyone I go, I see aspects of that birth.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.600
For example: what is the Internet?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
Many people have written about the Internet.
Billions and billions of words written about the Internet.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.800
But to me, as a physicist, the Internet is
the beginning of a Type I telephone system.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.600
A *planetary* telephone system.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.700
So we are privileged to be alive to witness the birth
of Type I technology: a planetary telephone system.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
What is English?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.000
English is the beginning of a Type I language.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.200
Everywhere I go around the Earth,
people speak English, because

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.500
that's the lingua franca of science, technology,
business... They all speak English!

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.400
It is the no. 1 second language on the planet Earth.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.700
And what is the European Union?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.300
The European Union is the beginning of a Type I economy.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.300
And how come the European countries -which have slaughtered
eachother ever since the ice melted 100,000 years ago-

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.100
how come they have banded together, put aside
their differences to create the European Union?

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.500
Well, to compete with us!

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.600
And who are 'we'? We are: NAFTA.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.800
So we are beginning to see the beginning
of a Type I economy as well.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.400
Then we are beginning to see the
beginning of a Type I culture.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.500
Everywhere I go, you turn on the radio, what do you hear?
Rock 'n roll. You hear rap music, you hear youth music.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.900
Youth music is now planetary, knows no
boundaries around the planet Earth.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.400
Everywhere I go I see high fashion.
Chanel, Gucci bags...

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.600
We're witnessing the birth of a planetary fashion.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.800
Also sports! Take a look at the Olympics.
Take a look at soccer.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.700
We're seeing the beginning of a tribal initiation rite,
called "sports", being turned into a planetary initiation rite,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.100
that unifies the entire planet.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.400
So, whenever I open the newspaper,
every headline I see in the newspaper,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.600
points to the birth pangs of a Type I
civilization in formation.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.900
However, every time I open the newspaper,
I also see the opposite trend as well.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.700
What is terrorism?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.800
Terrorism, in some sense, is a reaction against
the creation of a Type I civilization.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.600
Now most terrorists can not articulate this,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.600
they don't even know what the hell I'm talking about,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.900
but what they're reacting to is not 'modernism';
what they are reacting to is the fact that

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
we're headed toward a multicultural, tolerant,
scientific society. And that's what they don't want.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.800
They don't want science,
they want a theocracy.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.900
They don't want multiculturalism,
they want monoculturalism.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.500
So instinctively, they don't like the march
toward a Type I civilization.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800
Now which tendancy will win?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.800
I don't know.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.900
But I hope that we emerge as a Type I civilization.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.100
Now in outer space, we look for signs
of intelligent life in outer space.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.600
So far we find none.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.600
Civilizations like Type I should
be commonplace in the galaxy.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.400
Some people assume therefore that
Type 0 civilizations are rather common.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.700
But only a few of them make it to Type I.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.600
Because that society, for the first time in its history,
has the ability to commit planetary suicide.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.100
So maybe that's the reason why we
don't see aliens in outer space.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.800
Maybe they never made it.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.700
Maybe one day we may have
starships and visit them,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.400
we'll see atmospheres that are irratiated,
because they had a nuclear war.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.900
Atmospheres too hot to sustain life,
because they had a runaway greenhouse effect.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.500
Maybe when we go in outer space, we'll see the corpses
of Type I civilizations that never quite made it.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.500
Who knows.
