00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.680
Since the launch of
the Volvo hybrid truck in March 2011...

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.040
about 50 trucks have been delivered to
customers all over Europe.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.000
Roteb, with over 6000 employees
Rotterdam's largest employer...

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.720
specialises in refuse collection
and street cleaning.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.000
Two years ago
they bought Volvo hybrid trucks...

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
to meet both its own and the city's
environmental policies.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.360
It works really well. It's very quiet.
It's just perfect.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.360
It's fully automatic. I don't have
to do anything, just start the engine.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.640
I switch to drive and it starts to move.
The rest happens automatically.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.680
If you want to keep driving on electricity
you can press a switch.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.360
Then it stays on electric. When you
press diesel, it stays on diesel.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.760
You don't need to do anything else. It
recharges automatically. That's all. Easy.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.800
Two experts were appointed to support
technicians in work shops...

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.200
in markets with issues
with a hybrid drive line.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.360
They haven't been busy. The trucks
have been proven to work as reliably...

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.640
as any other Volvo truck.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.680
It works quite like any normal truck.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.080
It saves quite a lot of fuel
and it's more quiet than a normal truck.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.280
It just fits in the regular workings.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.360
The up time is quite normal.
Just like the other trucks.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.120
It's not special or different in use.
It's just like the other trucks.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.960
The truck reduces the fuel consumption
and CO2 emissions by up to 20%.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.000
With an electrified garbage compactor
the reduction is up to 30%.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.080
Depending on usage
it can travel short distances silently...

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.280
and with zero emissions
at speeds of up to 50 km per hour...

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.560
on its electric motor alone.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.520
When you do a retardation,
you store energy in the battery.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.040
You use that energy in acceleration.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.680
That's why transport tasks like
refuse collection or inner city driving...

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.200
are perfect segments.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.160
If you also place an electrified garbage
compactor on our hybrid chassis...

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.720
you have a perfect, complete truck
for most optimised fuel savings.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.360
It's very quiet. I often get compliments
from people on the streets.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.120
They wonder if the truck is electric
and of course I tell them it is.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.240
They raise their thumbs in appreciation.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.480
People are really surprised it's so quiet,
and they smile.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.680
They're pleased to see that a big truck
like this is electric. They like that.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.280
I believe hybrid technology
is very promising for the future.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.440
It has revolutionary fuel savings
and emission savings.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.880
I think we can't afford
not to further investigate this route.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.960
That is something we will do.
