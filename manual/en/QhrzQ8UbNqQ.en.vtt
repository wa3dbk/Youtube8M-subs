Like so many others I have spent my time with
and enjoyed playing Minecraft on my PC.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.930
While there are debates about whether it is
a 'game' in the strictest of terms, there's

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.910
no denying the sense of satisfaction that
comes from setting a goal and working your

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.360
way towards it.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.440
However, Minecraft - Pocket Edition...

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.009
... well there's no other way to say it other
than "it's simply the free java browser version

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.390
for your iOS device of choice," and this alone
wouldn't be so bad, but it's also plagued

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.829
with issues.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.850
Getting around your randomly generated world
is easy enough thanks to a lack of monsters

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.940
- simple swipes allow you to look around while
a giant virtual pad moves you back and forward,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.609
side to side, and jump.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.920
However, the game does get a bit confused
as to what it can automatically jump up, with

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.430
some blocks placed in the world (such as glass)
causing your character to hump and slide around

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.019
the transparent cube like a zero-g sex offender.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.910
This aside, you're free to drop blocks in
the world, from a selection of 36 different

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.110
kinds, to build the fantasy structure of your
dreams.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.070
Unlike the game's bigger brother there's no
crafting, which means no doors or other useful

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.210
structures to make the world interactive,
severely limiting your creative output to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.090
what amounts to a virtual game of LEGO blocks.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.159
Things are further restricted by the limited
size of each world, taking a mere couple minutes

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.590
to traverse from corner to corner, less if
the randomly generated biome (note: singular)

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.310
is flatter than others.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.750
What you get for your money is a virtual block
playground that you can also share with your

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.149
friends on a local Wifi network.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.990
Unfortunately having tasted the PC version
(which is also still a work in progress),

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.899
Minecraft - Pocket Edition feels more like
a diversion than the creative time waster

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.149
gamers have come to know and love.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.360
Worth grabbing if you can't fulfill that creative
itch or you'd like to gamble on updates adding

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:59.360
deeper gameplay content.
