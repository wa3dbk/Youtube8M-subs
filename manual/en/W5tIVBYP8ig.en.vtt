00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.959
On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Libby
Caldwell and I'm here to tell you about water

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:10.809
color journaling. Right, now I'm going to
put in the trees on either side and I'm going

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.450
to use this brown for the tree trunk out there
and actually this one as well. And I'm going

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:26.230
to use the water color, pans of water color
here, for the leaves. So, you can test on

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.820
a piece of paper. I always keep a piece of
paper at the side, just to see how it is.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:40.150
OK, so beginning with the tree on the right,
you just, because your sky is dry, you can

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:52.210
put in, and I'm not trying to make this exact
again, it's the general impression. You can

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:11.479
dip into the water, like that. And now, I'm
coming into the area that's going to be writing.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:25.240
So, I'll just carry on but I'll make it looser,
you see. And now, I'll introduce another green

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.139
which is the one I'll use on the other side.
And just drop it in there while the paint

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:56.479
is wet. OK, now the tree on the other side,
I have some branches and a tree trunk. So,

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:15.200
I'm going to put those in first but keep it
pretty wet. And if you don't like quite where

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.530
something is or if there was another tree
in the middle, I wouldn't put it in because

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:46.420
it just wouldn't look balanced. OK, coming
into my green, and to do it while the brown

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.199
is still wet so that they blend, they'll run
together on their own.
