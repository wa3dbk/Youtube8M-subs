00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.750
Good to have you back, Mr. Harper.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.750
Thank you, Bobby.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.290
Haven't seen your mother here for quite some
time.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.280
Well, maybe you just didn't recognise her.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.880
Like Satan, my mother can take many forms.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.900
Good one.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.860
I'm ready to order.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.430
Of course.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.900
Apologies for the frivolity.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.680
What would you like?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.080
I'll have the seared ahi tuna fillet.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.680
Good choice.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.640
I want it very rare.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.300
That's how we serve it.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.200
I want it red in the middle, not pink.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.730
Shall do.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.430
If it's pink, don't even bother bringing it.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.220
Got it.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.160
Just give it to someone who doesn't know what
rare is.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.930
Of course.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.110
You know what, forget it. You won't get it
right.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.640
Is your salmon fresh?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.400
Flown in today.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.550
What time?

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.870
I'll ask the chef.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.880
Many forms...

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.420
Thought you were joking.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.960
Do you eat here regularly?

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.000
Not any more.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.300
So, listen, about this weekend.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.960
My ex is going to be out of town, so I'll
have the kids.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lydia.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.230
No one loves the little ones more than
old Uncle Charlie.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.460
But don't you think it might be a bit soon
for me to meet your kids?

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.760
Oh, I don't want you to meet them.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.570
Why not?

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.980
Because I'm very careful about who I expose
them to.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.090
What's that supposed to mean?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.910
Charlie, please...

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.680
Why can't I expose myself to your kids?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.100
I mean, why can't I meet your kids?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.760
Please don't make me hurt your feelings.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.439
You can't hurt my feelings.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.631
Alright, fine.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.080
You're a professional boy toy.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.720
A perpetual adolescent leading a dissolute
life.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.240
You may have your uses, but you're not the
kind of man I want around my children.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.840
Oh.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.680
What made you think that would hurt my feelings?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.740
Two o'clock, JetBlue from Vancouver.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.580
Would you like me to find out what the movie
was?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.320
Don't bother.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.120
I'll just have the capellini.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.340
And I'll have the pork chop with a baked potato.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.939
How about a little angioplasty for dessert?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.620
Hey, I like a nice pork chop once in a while.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.650
Fine, I'm not going to tell you how to eat.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:56.929
Really?

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.789
Even if I chew slowly for your pleasure?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.200
So, yay or nay on the pork chop?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.180
I'll have the spinach and goat cheese salad.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.840
Good choice.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.640
Thank you.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.660
On the food.
