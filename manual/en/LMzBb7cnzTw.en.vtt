00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.920
Joining a sorority was most meaningful

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.630
that was the first milestone here at Cal

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.190
State Fullerton it opened a lot of doors.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.099
I became pretty involved in school with

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.189
ASI, also Camp Titan and a lot of

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.990
different things so that was definitely

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.270
the most meaningful. Honestly Greek life

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.530
was the most important thing that I've

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.330
ever done I feel like when I came to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.309
campus it wasn't so much of a commuter

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.870
campus because I saw my friends every

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.910
day so Greek life is what I'm gonna miss

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.769
most about Cal State Fullerton. Just the

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.390
small classes the professors and the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.220
friends that I've made here it's a it's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.629
a nice campus and you get used to it

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.059
rather quick. Joining a fraternity, Pi

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.900
Kappa Phi. I before joining that I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.180
drove back and forth from Los Angeles,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.190
Downtown LA and once that your

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.350
fraternity I moved out here live with

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.379
all of my brothers, it's the whole life

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.049
changing experience that that is well I

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.780
that's what I'm gonna miss most.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660
Ok, my favorite professor was actually a Dr. Johnson.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.100
Dr. Hope Johnson from the Biology Department.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120
Um I loved her because she was she was a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.260
great teacher um I actually did research

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.660
in her lab so she was very friendly

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.910
always open to help talk and just you

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.990
know give you advice on anything you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.820
needed to do so she was def by far my

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.980
favorite teacher. My favorite professor

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.110
is Dr. Eugene Fujimoto, I took a

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.040
instructional leadership class with him

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.140
where we did a Maywood Project which we

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.850
went to the city of Maywood to do a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.190
college fair which is to promote a

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.450
college-going culture cause only like

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.160
one percent of the population goes to

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.170
college. My favorite professor is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.270
Professor Carrie Lean from the Sociology

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.760
Department. You could just tell through

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.860
all of her lectures and just talking to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.720
her even outside of class that she had a

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.720
really big passion for life and it just

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.130
came through and everything that she did

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.810
she didn't mind talking to you about

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.940
study abroad or helping you figure out

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.770
how to get financial aid for that or

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.610
talking to you about your class or just

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.870
being a pet foster home keeper. She's

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.760
just a really awesome person to work

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.470
with. Well if I had to choose it would

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.810
definitely be Professor Coma Tante, she

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.930
really helped guide me into figuring out

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.550
what I want to do after I get my degree

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.380
in Anthropology which is focused on

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.840
Forensics and Osteology. She's been a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.420
tremendous guidance and I guess leader

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.360
mentor in that field for me so Professor Coma Tante.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.300
