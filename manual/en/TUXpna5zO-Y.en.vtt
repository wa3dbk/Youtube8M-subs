00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:44.085
I flip-flop between Trini and Jamaican. My bad.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:45.575
With Jamaican I'm kind of weak.

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:50.256
So a lot of you guys watched this video, my diet, how I stay fit. If you haven't watched it,

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:56.992
So step number 1!

00:00:56.992 --> 00:00:58.779

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.164
'Cause cooking, and all things in life are supposed to be fun!

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.494
So I'mma share my secrets with you, okay?

00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:20.898
Here we go!

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:24.260
And first thing you need is jerk chicken seasoning.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.294
Yes, it is mild. I am already hot-headed!

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.442
Then you get yourself some chicken!

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:31.717
Chicken breasts-tststs!

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:35.430
You're gonna marinate that. Overnight, 24 hours!

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.450
With coconut milk. This stuff is bomb.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:48.491
Now, I am not a fan of dairy. All those recipes that call for milk; butter milk--get yourself some coconut milk, this stuff leaves your chicken moist!

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:51.779
Then some sea salt--just a little sprinkle, a little dabble.

00:01:51.779 --> 00:02:00.287
Whole spice, AKA pimento--I think it's the same thing, but for whatever reason some places out here call it whole allspice..

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:03.302
Get some bay leaves, you need some bay leaves.

00:02:03.302 --> 00:02:08.538
You can get some thyme. Little, little, little, rosemary.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:11.790
A little cracked pepper. Peppercorn.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.826
Garlic? You could put some garlic, that would be bomb.

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:15.959
What else?!

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.406
Onions, if you like onions you can put that in there. I didn't put any onions in this one.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:23.354
But before we get into that, clean your chicken! And this is how I do it.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:29.052
Put some water and a little bit of vingar, and I let that sit for like, 5 minutes. 'Cause I want a clean chicken!

00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:32.046
And then you wash your hands because you don't need that salmonella.

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:37.042
And 2 little teaspoons of jerk chicken sauce. Rub it in.

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:44.200
Little sprinkle of thyme. Rosemary. Couple bay leaves. And just a few of these little pimento balls. Like, 3.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.120
And then you take the coconut milk and you drizzle it.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.600
And you mix it around. And then you cover it.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.321
Then you put it in your fridge, okay?

00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:55.494
Put it in your fridge!

00:02:55.494 --> 00:02:58.342
And then the next day, you cook it!

00:02:58.342 --> 00:03:04.513
You just pan sear it; you put a little olive oil on the pan, just enough to get the bottom coated.

00:03:04.513 --> 00:03:10.698
Then you put the chicken on it, then you put the lid on it--and then you make sure that that flame is low.

00:03:10.698 --> 00:03:14.916
Let it cook... I don't know--I don't know like what, 6 minutes?

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:19.352
Just check--and then you turn it over, cook the other side another 6 minutes; that's 12 minutes.

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:23.770
Just keep checking. Eyeball it--you know, I didn't even really time it.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.234
Yeah, but while that's cooking for like 6 to 12 minutes, you're gonna prepare your salad!

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.813
Get some of your baby spinach and... shablam!

00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:32.988
Shablee!

00:03:32.988 --> 00:03:34.239
Shablow!

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.435
And just put it in this bowl--cooking is fun!

00:03:37.435 --> 00:03:39.004
I need a cooking show!

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:42.482
So then you get de cucumber, you get de cucumber!

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:46.565
Cut it into little slices; little, little, little thing there!

00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:50.099
Like so, you cut it into quarters!

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.562
And then your chicken should be done at this point.

00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:58.480
So once all that's set you get your chicken off of the grill, or whatever you're using to cook.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.653
Chop it up--look at that, fresh off de stove!

00:04:01.653 --> 00:04:07.527
And then get your favorite toppings! This is 'ahh' so good! So good!

00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:08.691
Now!

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.798
If you feel real diva-like...

00:04:12.798 --> 00:04:15.437
Shredded coconut!

00:04:15.437 --> 00:04:19.011
You just put your hand in de bag like so!

00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:22.855
Then you sprinkle to de bowl like...

00:04:24.728 --> 00:04:27.145
Then, you wanna get your dressing.

00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:29.713
This is the deal right here, okay?

00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:38.514
Then you mix it and you twirl it around like so...

00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:42.603
See, and you do your jerk chicken wine!

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:49.386
Stay fit! Have fun! Body break!

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:52.045
You should be sweatin' by the time you're done cooking, okay?

00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:55.535
That's it! If you like this track, read the description box!

00:04:55.535 --> 00:04:58.901
I wanna know what your favorite salad dressing is.

00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:03.482
Is it creamy like a ranch, or is it a vinaigrette?

00:05:03.482 --> 00:05:08.497
If you happen to make this jerk chicken salad, make sure you guys instagram it, okay?

00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:14.516
I'm on instagram, yo! Instagram it, @ me. And my username is @mayasworld.

00:05:14.516 --> 00:05:15.938
Hashtag it!

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:17.879

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.409
Do you boo! Chef Shameless loves you!

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:22.692

00:05:22.692 --> 00:05:23.894
Te amo mucho!

00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:24.833
Hold on, we're in...

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:31.682
Me love to slow wine, pon it, jerk chicken wine pon it--that's not slow Maya!

00:05:31.682 --> 00:05:36.209

Jerk chicken wine!
