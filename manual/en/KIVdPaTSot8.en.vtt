00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.149
What is a gasoline direct injection
engine?

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:13.719
Today's vehicles grow in complexity with
every passing year.

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.789
Oxygen sensors, catalytic converters,
engine control modules, and engines

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.339
themselves constantly undergo
improvements to help vehicles operate

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.879
more efficiently.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.710
One of the more recent and significant
trends happening today is the growing use

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.619
of gasoline direct injection engines.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.300
Let's explore why direct injection
engines are a hot topic today.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.780
A direct injection engine uses a
different approach to deliver fuel to

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.060
the cylinder.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.680
As an alternative to the port fuel
injector, which delivers fuel past the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.440
cylinder's intake valve,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.470
the direct injection engine has fuel
injectors that spray fuel directly

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.370
into the combustion chamber.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.580
The gasoline direct injection engine is
part of a long history of sophisticated

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.950
and innovative evolutions in the
industry, all geared toward common goals:

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.930
Achieving better fuel economy.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.480
Lowering emissions.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.580
Increasing engine power.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.950
In 1885,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.710
Karl Benz invented the carburetor, which
mixed liquid gasoline with air to form

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.780
a vapor that would combust and fuel the car.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.800
For nearly a century, the carburetor was
used and constantly improved on by the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.550
automotive industry.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.490
But starting in the 1980's, regulatory changes in admissions and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.580
new customer expectations began driving
changes to technology.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.680
Governments set stringent limits on
emissions, with specific requirements for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.050
unburned fuel, carbon monoxide, and
nitrous oxide emissions.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.720
These restrictions initiated the use of
the catalytic converter, which is still

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.920
used today to clean tailpipe emissions.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.610
In addition, fuel injection was
introduced as a more efficient method of

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.650
controlling fuel flow and ensuring small
droplets.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.850
Today, gasoline direct injection engines use
the next generation fuel injector,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.570
enabling engines to run leaner, with
higher compression ratios, and with more power,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.770
but while using less gasoline. Like many of today's sophisticated components,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.190
gasoline direct injection engines work
through complex computer-controlled

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.720
technologies to achieve the tightest of
tolerances to deliver just the right

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.119
amounts of fuels.

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:20.180
These complex new technologies require
fuels to evolve at a similar pace.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.709
When injectors experience higher
temperatures and pressures, it's just

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.109
that much more important to keep them
functioning properly.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.609
The right combination of advanced fuel
additives are critical in keeping the

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.449
direct injection engine clean and
efficient,

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:38.219
delivering the right quantity of fuel at
the right time in the right position in

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:38.729
the cylinder.
