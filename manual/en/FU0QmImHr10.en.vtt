Hey what's up guys, this is David Benjamin
from HealthyWildAndFree.com,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.340
Today I want to talk about the health benefits
and specific uses for the mineral silica.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.250
If you aren't familiar with silica, silica
is a mineral basically derived from silicone

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.900
which is
in the environment and it's actually very

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.260
prevalent in the environment.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.400
Silicon valley in California, fun fact, is
actually named silicon valley because silicone

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.320
was
very prevalent in the region many years ago

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.199
when they first initially named it.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.040
So it's called silicon valley.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.960
The cool thing about silica is that it's an
amazing mineral that has many beneficial properties,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.780
mostly based in how you look, so, if you want
to have better looking hair, skin or nails,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.250
silica is definitely a supplement that is
beneficial for those things.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.110
Initially in my own life I got silica because
i started having some different hair, my hair

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.520
was falling out, I had a receding hairline
and i'm like this is ridiculous, i'm too young

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.000
for this!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
shenanigans.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.489
So I started looking up and researching online
different holistic modalities and minerals

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.569
and herbs and you name it that helped with
hair growth and regrowing of hair.

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:12.569
Preventing hair loss.

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.460
I found that silica was one of the most important
minerals for that, so what I did was start

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.460
taking silica.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.200
This is the first silica i started taking
it's orgono living silica, it's just a liquid

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.119
silica and I do like liquid dietary supplements
and liquid products in general because I feel

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.810
like liquids are more bioavailable to the
body as opposed to plants, or you know other

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.880
things like clay here that I will show you
in a minute.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.539
So I started taking it and started realizing
right away that my hair started growing faster.

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:46.359
One of my toenails that had a spot on it was
starting to get basically, basically be removed.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.569
My nail was basically growing faster and healing
that.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.029
And, I started noticing when I was taking
a shower instead of having hair in the palm

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.469
of my hand that the hair, I had less and less
hair falling out.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.950
As I continued to take silica, so if you have
hair loss or widow's peak or you want to regrow

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.550
hair or something along those lines, silica
is an amazing supplement that I highly recommend

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.090
that you can use in your routine as \well
as eating foods rich in silica which include

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.209
oats, barley, millet, and red beets and horsetail
extract.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.870
SO, if you include those in your diet you're
going to have silica which is very beneficial

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.790
for your hair skin and nails.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.334
Beyond being beneficial for your hair skin
and nails, the cool thing that silica is that

00:02:28.334 --> 00:02:30.079
it's also a metal detoxifier.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:36.550
Now, heavy metal toxicity is a huge health
problem in the world as a whole but specifically

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.730
I believe in america because of vaccination,
because of all the water we get is held in

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.650
metal and it goes through metal pipes.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.049
Metal is everywhere around us, we use it way
too often and we interact with metal, we eat

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.549
foods, our fish has metal in it, I mean there's
metals in everything, so silica is a great

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.859
mineral for actually detoxifying and purifying
the body to remove heavy metals specifically

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:00.859
aluminum.

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.720
So if you have aluminum toxicity, or you have
too much aluminum in your body and you know

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.510
that, silica would be a great supplement to
add to your routine as well.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.290
Beyond hair, skin and nails, metal detoxifier,
silica is also great for your muscoskeletal

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.400
system, your bones, your joints, your ligaments,
your tendons, because silica is a mineral

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.860
that's very important for basically connecting
other minerals such as phosphorus, magnesium,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.209
calcium, all these other minerals to have
them do their job efficiently and effectively.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.700
So if you have arthritis, or just joint pain
or anything along those lines, silica may

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.299
be a very beneficial supplement and nutrient
to include in your diet and lifestyle as well.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.560
Beyond that, the cool, the really kind of
cool fact that involves silica is that it

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.280
actually helps to protect your heart and cardiovascular
system because what happens is, as you may

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.269
or may not know if you have mineral deficiencies
or mineral imbalances within your body, specifically

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.989
within regards to calcium, phosphorus and
magnesium, specifically we'll just focus on

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.310
calcium here for the sake of this video.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.069
If you have too much calcium in your body,
and not enough magnesium and phosphorus to

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.129
kind of have that synergistic ratio for your
body to use is what happens is that your body

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.420
starts storing calcium in your joints, in
ligaments, tendons, in your arteries which

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.610
is obviously, which is the main blood flow
channel to and from your heart.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.639
So, if you have too much calcium in your body
and not enough of the other minerals, your

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.270
body will start depositing calcium in different
ares of your body causing stiffness, joint

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.650
pain, the constriction of your arteries.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.699
SO your arteries look like this, if you have
too much calcium and not enough other minerals

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.389
your arteries will actually constrict and
shrink causing your heart to have to work

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.030
harder pumping blood through that same specific
pathway.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.490
But the cool thing about silica is that it's
a supplement that helps neutralize and balance

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.860
out the excess calcium within the body to
keep the arteries healthy, flexible, and keep

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.990
the heart functioning optimally, so for cardiovascular
health, for heart health, bones, ligaments,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.530
tendons, skin, hair and nail health, silica
is an amazing mineral that has a variety of

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.099
benefits and you start to see your hair, nails
and skin change right away, specifically your

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.710
hair and nails grow faster.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.669
Right now my hair is longer than it's been
in a while and it's just growing faster and

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:24.669
faster.

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.380
It's even it's growing too fast, I need to
get a haircut, I should have gotten a haircut

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.440
before this video, and i'm going to get one
soon before I go to Costa Rica which is upcoming

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440
soon.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.669
So silica is an amazing mineral, the cool
thing is, beyond supplements, this supplement

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:47.539
is kinda pricey, this supplement I believe
was 50 or 60 bucks, and you just take this

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.900
little cup here and you drink out of this
little thing.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.540
You take a little bit at a time and it does
last a while and it is very bioavailable.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.980
I saw my hair and nails grow quickly right
away, so if you're looking to regrow your

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.960
hair, nails, or something along those lines,
the liquid is probably going to work best

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.280
for doing those specific things.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.610
but if you're on a budget and you still want
to get silica in your diet and just have it

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.910
as part of your diet, a great alternative
option is this big bag here, this is called

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:22.050
diatomaceous earth, it's a clay that is specifically
used for removing parasites from the body

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.030
because it acts like a knife essentially cutting
parasites in half so it breaks down the parasites

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.169
and helps your body either kind of use them
as energy or detoxify them.

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:38.460
So this is specifically used for detoxifying
parasites which is great because 90%+ of the

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.310
population in America and probably even more
in 3rd world countries and overseas have parasites,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.699
so by taking this clay you help to detoxify
those.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:51.030
The great thing about this diatomaceous earth
is that it's 89% silica content.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:57.330
so you are basically just eating silica, which
is a very important mineral for the things

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.550
that I discussed in this video, so if you
want to get diatomaceous earth, this is a

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.940
5 pound back that cost me only 11 bucks, I
couldn't believe in when I found it.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.000
So, this is quite a bit more, you can get
in your diet, or you can start taking clay,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.169
or just start using all three and start getting
in your diet, including the clay and the liquid

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:21.199
to really know that you're efficient in silica
and to get those silica levels up.

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:29.820
That's it for this video, take silica to improve
your hair, skin, nail, joint, bone and joint

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.560
health, and as well as for your cardiovascular
health, heart health and the health of your

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.591
arteries in general, so, thanks a lot of your
