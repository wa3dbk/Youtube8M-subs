00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.670
Hey guys it’s Ro!

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.790
Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies!

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.410
Today I am gonna be doing something a little bit different.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.830
I love sushi and I have been playing a lot
of the video game Sushi Go-Round,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.430
so I thought hmmm, let’s do that.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.050
Today we’re gonna be making Sushi Cupcakes
and we’re gonna be using a really

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.670
yummy Green Tea recipe.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.150
Let’s get started!

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.600
The things you will need, will be: 2-1/2 cups
sifted flour, 3 tablespoons of Matcha

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.040
powder, 2 teaspoons almond extract, 3 teaspoons
baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.040
1-1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup milk, 1/2 a cup of
vegetable oil, 2 eggs, and then to decorate

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.320
you’ll need some finely shaved coconut,
and some vanilla frosting.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.940
I’ve just put it in a plastic baggie for
more control.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.180
Now let’s put it all together!

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.979
The 1st thing that we’re gonna do is mix
all of our dry ingredients together in this

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.290
bowl, whisk it together until it’s well
combined.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.010
The 2nd thing that we’re gonna do is, we’re
gonna pour our oil into our milk.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.710
Eeeeeeewp! Then we’re gonna mix it together.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.760
Now we’re gonna pour this mixture into our
dry ingredients, pour it all in there.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.790
And then we’re gonna mix it together for
2 minutes on medium speed.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.890
Once that’s all mixed together, now we’re
onto our last step, we’re gonna add 2 eggs,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.500
almond extract and some Matcha green tea powder.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.070
Once your batters all mixed together, it smells
so good! It smells like delicious

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.860
Green Tea Cupcake, I can’t explain how good
this smells, you, you’ll have to try it.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.380
Um, but we’ve got our little mini cupcake
trays over here, I’ve never made mini

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.659
cupcakes before, this is my 1st time on Nerdy
Nummies.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.530
And we’ve lined them with all of these mini
cupcake liners.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.310
I chose the black liners because I thought
it would look the most like seaweed.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.240
I’m going to scoop 1-1/2 teaspoons into
each cupcake tray.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170
Now that we’ve filled all of our cupcake
trays you’re going to heat your oven

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.819
to 350 and bake for 9 minutes. But keep your
eye on them, because you don’t want them to burn,

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.319
they’re very small, you want them to turn
a golden green.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.180
Mwaf-whaf-whaf-whaf-whaf-whaf-whaf-whaf! Instead
of golden brown…. It’s a baking joke!

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.950
Just took the cupcakes out of the oven and
you want to give them plenty of time to cool,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.620
you do not want them to be warm when we are
frosting them, but these little guys are

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.650
ready to go. Look how cute they are, dew-dew-da-dew!

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.120
I’m just gonna put them on top of this tray,
I chose to decorate on this tray

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.870
because it is a Lazy Susan, it spins around.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.290
So it will make it easy to frost and decorate
all of our different little sushi cupcakes.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.550
So, if some of your cupcakes are a little
bit tall, I’m gonna use a sharp cutting knife

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.400
to cut them so that they’re a little bit
more flat,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.440
so that they actually look like sushi.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.120
Just take off a little bit, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm,
hmmm, hmmm!

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.200
Owmp! Mmmmm! Mmmmm! Mmmmm! Mmmmm! Mmmmm!

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.400
Now we’re gonna frost all of our cupcakes
and dip them in the shredded coconut.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.950
Ba-boom! Look! Looks like a little sushi roll!

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.330
I Dipped all of the cupcakes into shredded
coconut, except for 4, I left 4 out so they

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.630
will look like this, little fish eggs.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.069
These are candy sugar orange balls, what you’re
gonna do is dip them into the candy

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.010
just like we did the coconut.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.489
Now that our cupcakes are ready it's my favorite
part, it is time to decorate!

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.489
Over here we have a smorgasbord of candies,
we’ve got orange slices, some gummy

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.489
octopus, a bunch of Swedish Fish, some Haribo
raspberry candies, some sour gummy ropes,

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.650
some Ju-jees, I’m just using the black ones,
because when you roll these out with a

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.050
rolling pin, they look like seaweed, so they’re
perfect!

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.430
Alright, now you can get creative and we’re
gonna put them all together.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.060
Ta-da! Here are the Sushi Cupcakes that we made
today, they were so much fun to make!

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:34.779
I have never made mini cupcakes before on
Nerdy Nummies, and, if you like Green Tea,

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:36.129
this recipe is for you!

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.169
I nommed on a few of these and they’re so
good!

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.800
I’ll be posting lots of pictures of all
of our Sushi creations on

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.719

because, I live in California and

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.419
I’ve been eating a lot of them lately!

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.699
