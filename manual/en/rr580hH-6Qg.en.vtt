00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.680
Another great game that you can play at a
bridal shower is bridal shower bingo, and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.560
I'm going to show you how to make a bridal
shower bingo card. You're going to want them

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.730
all to be different and you're going to want
to have enough for each person and give them

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.160
a marker, a pen, or a highlighter to mark
off each item, and what you're going to use

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.280
instead of numbers like you would in bingo,
you're going to use gifts for the, for the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.440
bridal shower, and also wedding items so you
can, you know, call those out, and have a

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.940
list of everything too. So what you do is,
instead of bingo you're going to write out

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.969
bride, so you want to divide your sheet of
paper into enough sections to write out BRIDE,

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:48.699
and you can also go online. There's a website
called bachelorette.com that has free templates

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.620
if you don't want to make your own. But I'm
just going to show you how to make your own

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:14.000
here, and then in your top box you're going
to write BRIDE, and then going down in your

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:29.060
boxes you can write various things like wedding
cake, groom, and you can continue on with

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.380
gifts that she might receive. We'll put mixer.
You're going to continue your whole card until

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.950
you have it all filled up. Make sure that
you, again, keep a list of the items you're

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.689
writing down so that you can call them out,
and another thing you can do is if you want

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.119
to go on the registry for the bridal shower's
registry and take down the items that have

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.560
been bought that are going to be present you
can do this game while she's opening presents

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.490
and do all the things that she was registered
for, and that's another way that you can do

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.549
bridal bingo. As she opens each item, if they
have that on their card they can mark it off,

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.690
and the first person obviously to get any
in a diagonal or in a row are going to win

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.440
bridal bingo and just have a prize ready for
them. So that's a little twist on it.
