1, 2, 3...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.083
Hello.

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:32.625
Hello.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:33.167
How are you?

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.792
Well.

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:37.042
Let's do this interview.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:37.875
Sure!

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.000
Come on, please!

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.458
Please.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:53.875
In Portuguese, please!

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:57.875
First the pregnant!

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:03.542
Asking if you have two, three hours available.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:12.958
After London, is there any chance 
you will head to Barcelona..?

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.417
Maybe proposals? Tell us about it.

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:23.000
No, no proposals, I will come back to 
Santos, I'm happy here...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.375
I will stay here, I'll go play the 
Olimpycs and quickly come back.

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:31.208
To wrap, he wants you to dance Michel Teló's song.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.417
No, I'm changing this, otherwise we 
will cry all the way to São Paulo.

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:00.042
Yes.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.375
I'm sorry for those who'll try to touch your face today!

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:12.917
Let's stop here?

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.667
Take it off, press it on...

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.000
Oh poor thing, I feel sorry for him.

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:19.750
He is not feeling anything, trust me, he is 
sleeping, when he sleeps he does not feel pain...

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:29.708
So it's going to be radical, man.

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.375
What is going to be radical? What is he going to do?

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:33.333
He wants to cut all (the hair) on the back, 
he wants to shave there.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.292
C'mon just leave it.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.292
What happened?

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.042
I want to cut my hair.

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:41.917
Why do you want to cut your hair? Tell me!

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:48.417
People, c'mon don't even joke about it...
I think you are joking, aren't you?

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:50.875
Nope. Dead serious.

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:54.042
Yes, you are joking!

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.000
C'mon dad!

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:00.333
Hey, didn't you talk to him? Are you supporting this?

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.000
I did... Supporting?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.083
Duda said it will look good!

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.583
Such a liar!

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.375
In 2015, in 2015 you are allowed! Deal? 
In 2015 it's OK.... No you can't, no no.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.292
I'm cutting it...What if I cut it now?

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.833
You can't Jr, we have contracts 
with this damn hair.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:25.375
I'm cutting it. You just said it's a 
shitty hair, so I'm cutting it.

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:28.292
Why did you invent this? He invented it!

00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:29.250
I didn't invent anything!

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.625
C'mon man

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.250
My heart is beating all the way 
to my arms, right here, look...

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:44.292
Look, jumping here just from you mentioning it...
Can you see it jumping? Yes? See it?

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.458
Look where the heart vibrates!

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:47.958
Wow, it is indeed...

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:50.667
I'm on edge you know?

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.417
Hello!

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:54.042
What's up?

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:05.000
I'm going with my father, 
go with him, and I'll go on mine.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.375
I'm coming, but aren't you bringing everyone to see it?

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:08.250
I'm not sure, it'll be a while before we leave.

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:10.125
These people, look!

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.458
Ah, it's coming, I told you.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.200
Damn!
