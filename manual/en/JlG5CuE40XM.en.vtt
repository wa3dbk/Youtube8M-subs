00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.120
Are you hitting your iron shots too high and
feel you're loosing distance?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.789
This is Sean McTernan and you're watching
another episode of My Golf Tutor, the number

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:16.240
one place on the internet for you to play
your best golf now.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.369
Welcome back, today's question comes from
Doug and Doug wrote, "Hey Sean, I'm having

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.420
a lot of issues with my iron play.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.830
I'm hitting shots way too heigh.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.750
Do you have any techniques or suggestions
to help me bring the height or trajectory

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.930
of my shots down?"

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.910
Thanks very much for your question, the first
thing I would like you to check is your ball

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.930
position.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.220
If the ball is to far forward this could be
a contributing factor as to why it's going

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.870
too heigh.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.640
Get an alignment rod, you are going to place
it perpendicular to your alignment rod on

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.560
the ground and opposite of the golf ball.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.430
If you are using a seven iron to a pitch wedge,
I would like to see the ball in the center

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.670
of your stance.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.770
Have both feet equal distance from the rod
on the ground and as we go to six, five four

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.570
and so on its going to start getting a little
closer to our left heal.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.420
The second thing I want you to check is your
weight distribution in your golf swing.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.000
More often than not I see people hanging back
trying to help the golf ball in the air.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.369
This unfortunately delivers the club head
in a very weak position.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.840
If you could imagine you have an axe and trying
to chop a tree down.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.409
You're not going to chop it this way, you're
going to get your weight into your left side

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.450
and chop it down that way.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.930
One little thing I would like you to do is
get an impact bag.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.249
I have one here, its just a small one with
some sand in it.

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:56.170
I think using an impact bag is going to be
beneficial to help give the correct sensation

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.170
and feel.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.650
If you could imagine we have an impact bag,
we are not going to hit it this way.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.609
We are going to hit it that way.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:09.979
As you can see the natural instinct is for
my hands to beat the club head back to the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.979
bag.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.979
I'm not going to do this.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.780
I have a feeling this is a contributing factor
to why you could be hitting it high as well.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.250
Next time you go to the range, get that impact
bag shift your weight and try to make sure

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.940
those hands are leading the club head.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.390
This will help take some loft off the face
and get a better flight and trajectory to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.750
get your distance back.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.580
