00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.250
Hi, I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
In this next segment, we are going to start

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.720
getting our water up to a boil, adding our
extract, and then getting our boil rolling.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.150
As we are getting in close to our boil, say
around one-hundred and ninety to two-hundred

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.160
degrees, we're actually going to turn off
the heat now and we are going to add some

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.369
of our malt extract. First we are going to
take our kettle off the main heat. Then we

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.279
are going to take the malt extract, which
has been soaking in hot water, start mixing

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:44.870
it in very nice and slowly, trying to make
sure that it all gets blended in. Now, a tip

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.160
that you may not get from a lot of other brew
starters is that you don't actually want to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.579
add all the malt extract right now. Instead,
we're going to add roughly half to two-thirds

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.269
of the extract. What this will prevent is
some of the caramel flavors which are sometimes

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.320
associated with extract brewing. The rest
of the extract we are going to add with about

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.979
fifteen to twenty minutes left. During this
process you want to continually stir to make

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.140
sure that everything is all mixed together
and that none of it is going to be left on

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.130
the bottom in order to scorch. Now that you've
got two-thirds or half of the extract put

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.011
in, just continually stir it, turn on your
heat and start working on getting it up to

00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:33.979
a boil. In particular, if you're going to
be using dry malt extracts, you never want

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.100
to add that while it's boiling, you want to
add that before hand or else it will clump

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.079
heavily and it will be very hard to break
into the solution. As you can see, we are

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.590
getting very nice and close to a boil. At
this point, you really want to be careful

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.610
with your temperature. You don't want to overshoot
your boil and have a boil-over because this

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.039
creates a huge mess and you basically don't
want to spend a lot of time cleaning that

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.090
up. So, let's carefully turn on your temperature
and watch carefully for the boil. Do not leave!

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.909
Here you can see the first boil bubbles pushing
through so you really want to be careful with

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.970
your temperature now. Once you have a nice
rolling boil going, make sure that it doesn't

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.819
get too vigorous; that the foam doesn't rise
too high and start going out of your pot.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.540
Otherwise, if it does, you can kind of spray
it down with a sprayer or possibly drop ice

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.370
cubes in. It's going to foam up, but with
a little temperature management, you should

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.959
be okay.
