00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.439
Hello internet!

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.140
I'm Hazel, and this is a look at the new battle
pets and pet-related toys coming to your Garrison

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.250
in Patch 6.2.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.240
There's a lot of new stuff coming in 6.2,
but for these things, you won't even have

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.670
to leave your front door.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.120
Alliance players will find Tiffy Trapspring
hanging out with your battle pet master, while

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.100
Horde players will be joined by Giada Goldleash.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.200
These vendors will sell you toys and new pets-
if you have the Pet Charms.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.770
I recommend saving up.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.400
For 50 charms, you can buy yourself a Bloodthorn
Hatchling.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.750
This is a red version of the Skitterer pets
you tamed on Draenor, and it shares the same

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.750
moveset.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.210
Whoop-de-doodle-do.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.170
Also priced at 50 charms, there's the Dusty
Sporewing.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.620
Yes, it's ANOTHER moth, but check out the
moveset.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.670
The Sporewing has access to both Counterspell
and Call lightning which means it's on par

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.760
with the Skywisp Moth from Timeless Isle and
the Cerulean Moth from Tanaan Jungle.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.350
Welp, guess it's not that special after all.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.560
For 100 Pet Charms, you can get a Glowing
Sporebat.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.540
This guy's moveset is almost identical to
the Shadow Sporebat, except he has Glowing

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.740
Toxin in place of Barbed Stinger.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.920
For 200 charms, there's the Lost Netherpup.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.049
This is a purple wolf pup model with his very
own moveset.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.069
He can do Beast, Elemental and Undead damage
while Howl is always a nice move to have handy.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.240
This guy would look super cute following around
a Shadow Priest or Warlock.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.869
There's a couple of toys available also- 50
charms gets you a bone you can give to your

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.229
Perky Pug.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.889
For 100 charms there's a Spirit Wand that
lets you give any pet a hopefully cruelty-free

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:37.820
spectral appearance.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.340
And 500 charms will buy you the Magic Pet
Mirror, said to let you take on the appearance

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.700
of any battle pet.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.990
I wasn't able to test that one due to the
price, but I have to say I can't wait.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.119
It has a one hour cooldown and I can't imagine
they'd let you enter combat in your pet form

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.579
or else I'm going full battle Cow.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.749
Thanks for watching!

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.989
Let me know what you think, and check out
my channel for other pet battle videos and

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.310
previews from live and the 6.2 PTR.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.109
Have a wonderful, wonderful day.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.209
Bye!
