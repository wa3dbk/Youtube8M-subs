Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week,
your guide to everything that's

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.934
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:08.233
This week, the President
visited New Jersey communities

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:11.600
recovering from Hurricane Irene;
celebrated Labor Day in Detroit;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.867
welcomed NASCAR Champions
to the White House;

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:16.333
and unveiled the "American
Jobs Act" before a Joint

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.800
Session of Congress.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.467
It's September 2nd to September
8th or "American Jobs Act!"

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.300
On Sunday, September 4th, the
President traveled to New Jersey

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.467
to visit with residents of
Wayne and Patterson affected by

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:31.467
Hurricane Irene and pledged
the full support of the Obama

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:34.633
Administration as the
communities recover and rebuild.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.934
Mayor Vergano:
You know, there's just not any
words you can say any more.

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:38.400
President Obama:
Hola!

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.400
Just stopped by to let
you guys know that we're

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.533
standing behind you.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.934
Are you okay?

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:43.967
Hurricane Victim:
Uh-huh.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:45.700
President Obama:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.667
We'll be here to help.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.667
Hurricane Victim:
It's hard.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.967
President Obama:
I know. It's very
hard. It's very hard.

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:57.533
But the Mayor is going to be
working hard and the Governor.

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.233
Hurricane Victim:
We appreciate that. Thank you.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:00:59.200
President Obama:
We'll be all right.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.533
You'll rebuild. You
guys will recover.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.100
Hurricane Victim:
Yes.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.166
President Obama:
Obviously, visiting Wayne,
visiting Patterson,

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.433
many of these surrounding
communities gives you a sense

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:11.500
of the devastation that's taken
place not only here in New Jersey

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.333
but in Upstate New
York, and Vermont,

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.633
and a whole range of
states that were affected

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.700
by Hurricane Irene.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.433
As President of the United
States I want to make it very

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:26.800
clear that we are going to meet
our federal obligations because

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.166
we're one country and when
one part of the country gets

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:33.900
affected, whether it's, you
know, a tornado in Joplin,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.800
Missouri, or a hurricane that
affects the Eastern seaboard,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.367
then we come together as one
country and we make sure that

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.133
everybody gets the
help that they need.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.166
Narrator:
The President wrapped up his
visit to the Garden State with

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.300
a stop at Lowe's in Patterson
where he thanked volunteer staff

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.834
at a "Road to Recovery
Center" for those impacted

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:51.700
by the hurricane.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.967
President Obama:
You have got volunteers
who are helping out.

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:54.500
What kinds of stuff
are they distributing?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.734
Volunteer:
Yes, they're distributing goods
from "Feed the Children" that

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:01.533
were given to us, cleaning
supplies, food items,

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:03.467
juice and water.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:06.066
Narrator:
On Monday, the President
traveled to Detroit to speak

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.934
to working men and women
at the city's traditional

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:08.834
Labor Day event.

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:09.934
(cheering)

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:12.266
President Obama:
We've got roads and bridges
across this country --

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.600
Audience:
Yeah!

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.567
President Obama:
-- that need rebuilding!

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:15.633
Audience:
Yes!

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.166
President Obama:
We've got private companies with
the equipment and the manpower

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.400
to do the building!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.066
Audience:
Right!

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.867
President Obama:
We've got more than 1 million
unemployed construction workers

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:24.367
ready to get dirty right now!

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.934
Audience:
Yes!

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:28.100
President Obama:
There is work to be done
and there are workers ready

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.000
to do it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.567
Labor is on board.
Business is on board.

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:33.633
We just need Congress
to get on board!

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:34.166
(cheering)

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.200
Let's put America back to work!

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.400
(cheering)

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.767
Narrator:
On the days leading up to his
major jobs address to both

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.166
Houses of Congress, the
President convened meetings of

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:51.133
his Economic Policy Team and top
advisors to hammer out a clear

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:55.367
and strong jobs plan that would
create more jobs right away.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:59.433
President Obama:
All right. The gang's all here.

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:00.266
Have a seat.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:02.900
Narrator:
On Wednesday, the President
honored Jimmie Johnson's NASCAR

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.700
Sprint Cup Series Championship
at the White House and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.867
recognized NASCAR for
its efforts to give back

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:09.100
to the community.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.500
President Obama:
So I want to
congratulate Jimmie.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.133
I want to congratulate all of
the drivers who are on the stage

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:18.000
for their extraordinary success,
for the success of NASCAR,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.433
and for everything that
they do for our country.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.400
I will wear the helmet
and the gloves --

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.367
(laughter)

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:24.433
-- when I'm driving --

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:25.567
Jimmie Johnson:
Heloing?

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:26.734
The President:
No, Golf Cart One!

00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:29.333
(laughter)

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:31.467
Narrator:
On Thursday, the President
spoke to a Joint Session of

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:34.066
Congress and unveiled
the American Jobs Act,

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:37.500
a set of ideas supported by both
Democrats and Republicans to cut

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.467
taxes for small businesses; put
more money in the pockets of

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:43.867
middle class families; and offer
targeted assistance to Americans

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:46.500
who have been unemployed
for six months or more.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.533
These bipartisan ideas will be
paid for and the President urged

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:51.967
Congress to put country
before party and pass

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:53.266
this Bill quickly.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.066
(applause)

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:57.166
President Obama:
There are steps we can
take right now to improve

00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:00.467
people's lives.

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:03.867
I am sending this Congress
a plan that you should pass

00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:06.200
right away.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.967
It's called the
"American Jobs Act."

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:11.467
There should be nothing
controversial about this

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.166
piece of legislation.

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:16.033
Everything in here is the
kind of proposal that's been

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:19.767
supported by both
Democrats and Republicans,

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:22.133
including many who
sit here tonight.

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:26.433
The purpose of the American
Jobs Act is simple: To put more

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.600
people back to work and more
money in the pockets of those

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.400
who are working.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.567
It will create more jobs
for construction workers;

00:04:33.567 --> 00:04:36.100
more jobs for teachers;
more jobs for veterans;

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.100
and more jobs for
long-term unemployed.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.200
(applause)

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.367
It will provide a jolt to an
economy that is stalled and give

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:46.500
companies confidence that if
they invest and if they hire

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.800
there will be customers for
their products and services.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.934
You should pass this
jobs plan right away!

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:55.700

That's the shot!
