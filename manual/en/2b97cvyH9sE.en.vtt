00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.369
What's going on everyone? I'm Scott from Scotthermanfitness.com if you're looking for a great way to target your glutes and abductors

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.320
We're here at the hip abduction machine

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.620
It's a cybex machine and I'm going to show you how to use it now

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.990
First thing you want to do is figure out how to get in this thing

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.539
So what you want to do is the handle right here is push it up and pull the legs apart

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.619
And then you're going to sit down

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.149
And you can just squeeze it it'll click itself into place

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.969
Put your foot in the machine like this if you're a really shorter if you're a short person

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.959
I would say put your foot up like that the whole point is you wanna make sure your legs at a 90 degree angle

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.030
so put your feet in

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.079
close

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.829
Now what you want to do is sit back in the chair

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.140
Keep your back flush with the seat keep your neck straight maintain neutral spine

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.410
Grab the handles hold on tight, and then you're simply just going to open your legs like this

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.430
Come down to the weights almost touch and come back up

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.949
you need to breathe out as you push the weight out because you always breathe out when you exert a force, so

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.400
breathe out breathe in breathe out

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.540
breathe in

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.419
Now the little trick that I've learned over the years to really help target your bum on this machine

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.250
Is what I like to do is do a set like this and then lean forward and grab the machine

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.970
right here, and

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.479
Then do another set right after and that's going to target you bum right through here, and it feels great

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.699
Feels really good I promise you I'm not

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.850
Then we're done with the machine

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.879
Simply Grab this handle right here relax your legs if you're still putting pressure on the pads you'll be able to lift this thing up

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.070
Relax your legs pull this up

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.979
Open it and get out

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.739
