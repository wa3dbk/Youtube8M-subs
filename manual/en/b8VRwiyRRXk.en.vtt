00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.009
Okay, so here we are, building a fence.

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.009
I'll show you a little bit about the structure,

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.009
the tools you need, and how to put it together.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.869
How to build a fence.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.020
So, first of all, we'll talk a little bit about structure,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.020
and to do that, I am going to show you this corner here.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.540
We use a four by four post,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.800
I'll pull that away so you can see it,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.800
in cement on the ground.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.260
Now if you're using a fence section,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.820
you have to decide what section you are going to use,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.700
and make those posts eight feet apart.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.340
A standard two by four eight foot is usually eight feet one quarter inch,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.180
so if you set your posts eight feet one quarter inch apart,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.300
and cement them in that way, it's quite difficult,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.640
but if you use the, if you put your rails in at the same time,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.700
and then cement your posts later, it's a little easier.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.200
When you are using pickets like this, it's not quite so important to be exactly eight feet,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.640
but when you use pre-made sections, then you'll have to kind of put them all in at once,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.200
at least that's how I do it.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.860
Now this is a very sturdy fence because it's got a top rail,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.640
which is this piece, and then an under support

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.900
that makes a very nice, what they call strong back,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.900
when you put two together like this, it becomes a strong back,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.460
and the bottom rail is also up and down.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.180
You can see when you fasten the picket to that, it has to actually bend seven inches of two by four.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.140
Also if you make sure you get your crowns,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.620
which is the slope of your wood, pointing up,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.980
it gives it even more support,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:59.060
because the lumber is more structurally favourable to the crown part.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.420
Now, when you are doing a fence like this,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.340
it's wise to keep it slightly maybea little bit off level is fine,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.460
but if you make it a great deal off level, then your
fence boards will end up looking like that,

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.940
if you're off level, so, and you'll have to cut every one.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.040
So, it's often better then, rather than do that, is to step your fence down

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.600
so you can keep the top rail as close to level.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.500
In this case, we didn't have to do that because the lot is very level,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.740
but as you step it down,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.340
then you can use your fence board and it automatically stays square and to the top.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.100
What I do is I shoot those on with sixteen gauge galvanized pins,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.140
and in a real windy area, then I'll screw everything together after that,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.920
but it's nice to use pins to start with,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.500
because if you need to take anything apart, it's easy.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.540
And on top of these little sections, I left them sit up a little bit,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.260
so I can put a post cap on that to seal the water from coming in here.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.960
It's more than decorative.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.360
Also, make sure you get a coat of paint on that, or something,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.400
if you've, I like to put stain on, if you've cut it,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.180
so that the water doesn't have a chance
to soak into it, even if it's treated wood,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.420
when you cut it, it's not so treated in the middle.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.940
It's only treated around the outside.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.660
Let's see, what else do I want to tell you. I guess not much.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.660
After that little bit of education,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.400
you should be ready to go out and
support your local lumber yard,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.500
try and stay local if you can.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.920
Nothing against multinationals,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.700
but if you've got a local lumber yard that does their best to bring everything in,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.960
then maybe it's wise to support them.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.220
At least that's what I try and do.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.060
I buy my share from every lumber yard,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.220
so I guess nobody goes out of business with me,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.260
but I try and support local when I can.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.420
Alright, well, that's the fence.  It's very nice.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.940
I put them right together because these are very wet cedar pickets, and they will shrink.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.800
Also, if you get them exactly eight and a quarter, eight foot, one quarter inch apart,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.940
you should usually end up with seventeen one by six cedar, or otherwise, pickets,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.600
and you may not even have to cut
the last one in every panel.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.620
Well, happy fencing. Thank you.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.020
