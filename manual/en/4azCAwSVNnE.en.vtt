00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.510
Chamonix is a famous resort in the French
Alps at the foot of Mont Blanc. Also it is

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.810
credited with hosting the 
First Winter Olympic games in 1924.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.689
Situated near the massive peaks of the Aiguilles
Rouges and most notably the Aiguille du Midi,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.699
Chamonix is one of the oldest ski resorts
in France and is known as the "gateway to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.749
the European Cascades." The north side of
the summit of Mont Blanc, and therefore the

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:37.360
summit itself are part of the village of Chamonix.
To the south side, the situation is different

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.680
depending on the country. Italy considers
that the border passes through the top. France

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.200
considers that the boundary runs along the
rocky Tournette under the summit cap, placing

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.480
it entirely in French territory.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.710
The Chamonix commune is well known and loved
by skiers and mountain enthusiasts of all

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.230
types, and via the cable car lift to the Aiguille
du Midi it is possible to access the world

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.830
famous off-piste skirun of the VallÃ©e Blanche.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.560
Chamonix is a popular winter sports resort
town in France. As the highest European mountain

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.610
west of Russia, Mont Blanc holds a special
allure for mountain climbers, and Mark Twight

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.420
described the town as "the death-sport capital
of the world" because it is a base for almost

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.240
all types of outdoor activity, especially
their more extreme variants, such as ice climbing,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.240
rock climbing, extreme skiing, paragliding,
rafting, canyoning and Wingsuit flying.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.140
In the summer months Chamonix is a mecca for
alpine mountaineers, drawn to the area by

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.710
challenges like the north, west and south-west
faces of the Dru, the Frendo Spur on the Aiguille

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.710
du Midi, the north face of the Grandes Jorasses
and the massive face climbs on the south side of Mont Blanc.
