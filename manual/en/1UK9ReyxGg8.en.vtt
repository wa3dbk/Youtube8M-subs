a while so I want to do a video today
because I feel the entire hobby fresh

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.830
salt cichlids whatever always respect to
this fish talking about goldfish that's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.239
right why because goldfish have been
kept in captivity since like the Jin

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.370
dynasty in China New Year 2065 that
makes them almost seventeen hundred and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.480
fifty years folks seventeen hundred
fifty years these fish have been kept in

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.120
captivity
that's insane no excited that makes a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.780
two point five history major from wild
University makes me pumped here's what's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
going on so today I want to talk about
my one two three four five top fun facts

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.219
about goldfish number one goldfish are
the most commonly kept pet in households

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.239
today we are going to go into how their
captain under one poor conditions but

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.369
they are the most commonly kept pet okay
number two goldfish are orange in color

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.020
instead of yellow even though yellow is
actually genetically easier to breathe

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.590
so it's easier to get the color yellow
than it is to get the orange gold color

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.150
that we see and the reason for this is
that yellow was the Imperial color in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.619
China so it was forbidden for people
outside of the imperial family and house

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.229
or whatever to keep yellow fish they
bred the orange goldfish if you will so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.680
that's why there's more orange goldfish
than there are yellow even though it's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.159
easier to make yellow goldfish number
three the largest goldfish on record was

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.340
one foot three inches long and was about
five inches high and weighed over two

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.049
pounds you know that's a hospice
goldfish Mac koi okay and then the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.840
world's oldest captive goldfish lived
for 43 years and died gracefully and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.090
it's Bowl somewhere over in England so I
just think that's crazy 43 years old

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.860
that's nuts folks that's the nuts okay
and then finally either this is

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.690
interesting the most expensive goldfish
ever recorded was 2,800 bucks and it was

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.140
for like a blue Phoenix you can see the
photo here this fish absolutely does

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.800
