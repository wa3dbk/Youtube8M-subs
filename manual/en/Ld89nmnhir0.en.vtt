bjbj &gt;&gt; RYAN: Hey what's up guys? It's Ryan
from TheWorkoutCorner.com and today is a great

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.980
day for working out. But before we start working
out let's go ahead and dive into your questions

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.190
from last week. So first up we have 14 Brad
and he wants to know "For building muscle

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.619
do you need to eat just protein or are carbs
as important as well?" And it looks like you've

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.480
been getting conflicting answers on that,
but yes for building muscle you want to be

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.390
eating protein and carbohydrates. Some great
carbohydrate sources for building muscle would

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.881
be whole wheat pasta, sweet potatoes, brown
rice, oatmeal, those will be a few that you

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:55.140
can dive into that are great for building
muscle. Next up we have Kamshi and he wants

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.710
to know "What do you do when you are going
to a gym and they don't have the equipment

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.040
that you want or need for a particular exercise
or body part." This is a great question and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.330
I think a lot of people struggle with this
and the simple answer you do the best you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.361
can with what you have. So don't let it become
an excuse, oh I can't workout x body part

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:29.350
because I don't have free weights or I don't
have dumbbells. There are tons of workouts

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.320
on the internet and YouTube and even you,
checkout my home video workout, that don't

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.000
even need weights. So you can work out without
weights and depending on what your gym has

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.220
you may have to make adjustments. If they've
only got machines you do a machine workout,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.560
if they only have dumbbells you do a dumbbell
workout I mean there's a workout for every

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.530
type of equipment. It may not be perfect but
it's the best for what you have. And the underlying

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.750
goal is that you're in the gym working out
that's what you need to be doing. And finally

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.729
we have XX Nusca 24XX wants to know "Does
it benefit to drink a protein? Do you want

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.810
to drink a protein shake before you workout
or after?" And I think there are a couple

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.079
of other questions related to that as well.
So I'm going to do some nutritional videos

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.480
later on we'll get into that, finishing the
exercise videos first. But to answer it here,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.530
yes you definitely want protein after you
workout, whether it's a shake or some type

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.020
of quick meal that you've thrown together
you absolutely want to have protein within

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.569
45 minutes. So remember that eat it within
45 minutes, ideally 30 after your workout.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.779
If you're interested in a good book on the
timing of eating your food or protein rather

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:49.870
after working out you can checkout this book
"Nutrient Timing". You can get it I think

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.489
off of Amazon it's like $15 bucks. All right
guys that'll do it for another edition of

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.060
Mind Food Monday Your Questioned Answered.
Go ahead and put questions in for next week

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.989
and I will talk to you then. In the meantime
get in the gym. [Music] foods that build muscle
