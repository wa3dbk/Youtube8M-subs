00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:18.948
AI Planners are used in the generation of
action sequences in robots such as the

00:00:18.948 --> 00:00:23.373
Freddy 2 Hand/Eye Assembly Robot displayed
here in the National Museum of Scotland in

00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:28.339
Edinburgh. This version of Freddy from
four decades ago had a large, fixed

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:32.354
mounted arm with sophisticated touch
sensitive grippers, and a side mounted

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:36.759
camera to look at its world. Instead of
the robot moving to reach objects, the

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:41.448
platform underneath the robot was shifted
instead. Freddy was demonstrated on

00:00:41.448 --> 00:00:49.897
flexible assembly tasks involving simple
toy cars and boats. The video playing is

00:00:49.897 --> 00:00:54.927
taken from a sixteen millimeter film of a
Freddy project demonstration made in 1973.

00:00:54.927 --> 00:00:59.538
Freddy had to identify jumbled up parts
via vision, unscramble the parts, and

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:04.388
then assemble them to create the required
product. Some parts in the area didn't

00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:09.715
belong to the target assembly. In one
project, the Edinburgh Nonlin AI Planner

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:13.370
was used to generate object construction 
and arm movement sequences for Freddy.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.024
In its time, Freddy was one of the most
sophisticated robots in the world.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:27.617
The Stanford Research Institute Problem
Solver - STRIPS - is one of the best

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:32.088
known and most influential AI Planners, and
you'll learn about it on this course.

00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:35.580
Despite it being created over 40 years
ago, it was already in use to control the

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:40.743
activity of a robot called Shakey at the
Stanford Research Institute, which is now

00:01:40.743 --> 00:01:44.799
called SRI International. STRIPS had many
interesting features including using

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.910
theorem proving techniques to reason about
the state at points in the plan.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.469
STRIPS gave us a representation of actions
with preconditions and effects. It had a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.426
mechanism called MACROPS, for
generalization of its operators.

00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:02.063
And it included execution support facilities
to deal with partial failures.

00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:06.460
Shakey is now on display at the Computer
History Museum in Mountain View, California.

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:13.801
As we saw, Freddy included an early robot arm,
but as you can see here, technology

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:19.382
has come a long way. For example, this modern
research robotic arm has many more

00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:24.084
capabilities. Obviously, there's a lot
more to robotics than just activity

00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:28.687
planning and there are significant
challenges in terms of vision, mechanical

00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:33.262
issues, and spatial reasoning including
locating the robot, and tracking other

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:39.124
objects. But planning is a key aspect of
intelligent behavior. Not every robot has

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:43.889
the kind of activity planner that we are
describing on this course. That is, one

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.905
which can plan from first principles. But
robots typically do have plans, perhaps

00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:55.972
precompiled ones, that they use to control
their behavior. AI Planners have been used

00:02:55.972 --> 00:03:00.604
in much more recent robots also, of
course, such as in some humanoid robots

00:03:00.604 --> 00:03:05.612
and the robots used in the Annual RoboCup
Soccer League Teams. Here, planning may

00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:10.369
have to cover the coordination of
different robots with different roles, and

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:15.695
the robots themselves can have planners on
board that adjust their behaviors dynamically.

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.715
But planners have been used
in different kind of robots too.

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:26.015
For example, an on board planner and reactive
execution agent was used to autonomously

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:32.145
control the NASA Deep Space One spacecraft
for periods on its flight to rendevous with a comet.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:36.063
AI Planners have been used to provide
adaptability and flexibility in robots

00:03:36.063 --> 00:03:41.513
in the past and in the present, in the
factory, in the home, and in outer space.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.822
And its an area in which they will be put
to good use tomorrow.

00:03:44.853 --> 00:03:47.840
We hope you'll be part of creating this future.
