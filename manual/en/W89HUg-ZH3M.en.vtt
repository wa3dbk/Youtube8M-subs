Hi, I’m Monica Traphagan with the National 
Weather Service in Salt Lake City, Utah. This is

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:07.066
 an updated weather briefing about the tropical 
moisture surge that will be impacting

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:11.000
 Utah during the early part of the week. This 
briefing was created on September 7th, 2014 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.033
and should not be used after September 8th. 

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:19.033
Tropical moisture has started to move into 
southern Utah and will spread northward this

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:24.066
 evening and overnight. It will result in 
widespread rainfall for central and southern Utah

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:28.066
 tonight through Tuesday, with scattered 
showers and thunderstorms over northern

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:33.000
 Utah Monday and Tuesday. The rain may cause 
flooding along small streams in steep terrain,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 slot canyons, normally dry washes, and near 
recent burn scars. High flows are also

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.033
 possible on rivers and streams. It will also 
result in travel difficulties along backcountry 

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:47.066
roads. Let’s take a look at the situation in a bit 
more detail. 

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:51.033
The picture on the left is a satellite image from 
this afternoon. It shows what is now

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:56.000
 Tropical Storm Norbert in the Pacific Ocean. 
The system will continue northward, continuing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 to weaken as it moves across Baja California.  
Moisture from this system is being drawn

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.066
 northward and will continue to increase over 
southern Utah this evening and overnight. This

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:10.066
 moisture will spread northward, farther into the 
state, tonight into Monday.

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.033
This afternoon, we’re already seeing some 
convection over southern Utah, and this will

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:18.033
 continue to develop through the early evening. 
As the moisture continues to move into the

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:23.000
 state, rain will become widespread over central 
and southern Utah tonight and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Monday. The rain will continue into Tuesday. 
With the moisture moving farther northward still, 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we’ll see scattered showers move into northern 
Utah Monday and Tuesday. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.066
Here are our expected rainfall totals for the event 
between Sunday night and Tuesday. We

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:41.066
 think most of central and southern Utah has the 
potential to receive one to three inches 

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:46.066
of rain. The area highlighted in red is expected 
to see the greatest amounts of rain. Over 

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:51.066
northern Utah, rain will be scattered, with some 
locally heavy rainfall possible. 

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:55.033
The widespread rain will produce a few impacts. 
First, flash flooding is possible,

00:01:55.033 --> 00:02:00.033
 particularly along small streams in steep 
terrain, slot canyons, normally dry washes,

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:05.000
 and near recent burn scars. The rain will also 
cause high flows on rivers and streams. Finally,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 there will be travel difficulties on backcountry 
roads.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.066
To summarize, moisture associated with the 
weakening Tropical Storm Norbert will

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:18.033
 move into central and southern Utah through 
Monday. This increase in moisture will

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:22.033
 result in widespread rain over central and 
Southern Utah through Tuesday, with scattered

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:27.000
 showers and thunderstorms over northern Utah. 
Flooding is possible due to the rain, and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 travel on backcountry roads will become 
difficult. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.033
