00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.650
Today I will be making tomato soup.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.320
What is more satisfying and comforting than a hot bowl of soup?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.520
This is a easy recipe and simply delicious.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.420
Soup is always a good starter

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.520
and also can be served as a light meal

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.240
with salad and crusty bread.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.500
This recipe will serve 3.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.860
To make tomato soup we will need:

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.220
6 medium size tomatoes

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.560
I have already cut them in small pieces

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.620
and it makes about approximately

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.840
4 cups of cut tomatoes.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.240
1 carrot, which I have peeled and thinly sliced

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.840
and it makes about 1/3 cup of cubed carrots.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.620
1 stick of celery

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.380
Which I have already cut them in small pieces

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.700
and this is also about 1/3 cup.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.840
1/2 inch of ginger

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.920
I have peeled and sliced.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.620
2 teaspoons of oil

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.940
1/2 teaspoon of sugar

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.820
1/2 teaspoon of salt

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.760
1/4 teaspoon of black pepper

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.220
For seasoning

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.700
2 teaspoons of oil

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.600
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seed (jeera)

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.100
Pinch of asafoetida (hing)

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.260
Approximately 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro (hara dhania)

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.220
And just use the cilantro leaves.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.140
First I will stir fry the ginger in oil until it's light brown.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.900
Then add the carrot and celery

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.360
again stir fry for about 2 minutes

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.600
and then cook with tomatoes

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.340
and let the tomatoes cook till they are mushy

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.319
and cooked really well.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.259
Which should take about 10 minutes.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.300
Heat is on, medium high.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.120
Oil

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.250
Ginger

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.680
And just stir fry. It will change the color to light brown

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.720
and this should take about a minute.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.360
As you see all the corners of ginger has become light brown.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.160
And that’s how much it will get.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.180
Now we are going to add the celery.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.640
And carrot.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.240
Stir fry for again about 1.5-2 minutes.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.120
This has been about 2 minutes

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.020
and even on the carrot you will see some places rusty color.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.700
So it is ready and we are going to add the tomatoes.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.480
Sugar

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.420
Salt

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.420
And black pepper.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.840
Stir.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.660
And now turn the heat to medium

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.020
and cover it and let it cook for about 10 minutes.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.100
This has been about 10 minutes. So let’s check.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.160
Tomatoes are looking good. They are all cooked.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
I did stir it in between one time.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.960
So turn off the heat.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.070
And wait till tomatoes cool off little bit before we will
blend it.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.720
Tomatoes are lightly cooled off.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.480
Now I am going to blend it.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.660
And blend it on the high speed.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.180
I have blended this for about 30 seconds.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.760
And it’s looking right.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.920
So now I am going to season the soup.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.960
Heat is on, medium high.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.520
And I am ready to season the soup.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.240
And I will add some water

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.040
and make the consistency for your liking.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.890
So add the oil.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.760
Oil should be moderately hot.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.080
So when you put the cumin seeds

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.180
they should crack right away.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.560
Oil is ready so I will add the cumin seeds.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.820
As it cracks, add the asafoetida.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.960
And cilantro.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.940
Stir frying the cilantro gives a very nice flavor.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.440
Now we are going to add the tomato puree.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.420
So this is very thick

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.400
so I am going to add some hot water. About 1 cup.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.700
After adding the water and it comes to boil

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.220
then let it simmer for about 2-3 minutes.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.280
You can add the water to your liking.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.940
Dpends how thick you like your soup.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.720
Soup has been cooking for 3 minutes.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.100
Just the right consistency, I like.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.840
Cilantro gives very nice color.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.080
Soup is ready to serve.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.820
Turn off the heat.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.820
Tomato soup is ready, looking great.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.090
Nice color.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.020
Roasted ginger and cilantro adds a very nice flavor.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.100
I like to serve the tomato soup with few pieces of croutons.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.940
Today this is going to be our lunch with salad.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.660
Enjoy.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.780
Thank you.
