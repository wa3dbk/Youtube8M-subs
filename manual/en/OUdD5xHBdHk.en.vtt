00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:02.999
(cheery music)

00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:06.759
- Hey friends!
- [Justin] Hey everyone!

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:07.889
- Thank you so much for tuning in

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:09.538
to "Cook with April" on Tasty Tuesday.

00:00:09.538 --> 00:00:11.971
I am here with Justin, and today
I am going to show you guys

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.368
how to make some shrimp poboy
because I've always wanted

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:18.410
to make it at home, and it's
not that hard. So, stay tuned.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.523
Let's get started with
the remoulade sauce.

00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:22.065
Place mayonnaise,

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.075
horseradish,

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:25.975
soy sauce,

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:28.885
lime juice,

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:34.353
sweet relish,

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:36.363
cayenne pepper,

00:00:36.373 --> 00:00:38.687
minced garlic, and I
like using a garlic press

00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:40.821
to mince garlic because it's much easier

00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:43.258
than just chopping it up with a knife.

00:00:43.258 --> 00:00:44.599
And, you're just gonna go ahead and mix

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:47.836
those ingredients together
and refrigerate for later.

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:50.492
And now, let's work on
our Creole seasoning.

00:00:50.492 --> 00:00:54.139
That's onion powder,
garlic powder, oregano,

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.522
dried basil, thyme,

00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:01.382
black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika.

00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:07.619
You're also going to add salt,
but if you don't want to,

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.634
you don't have to at all.

00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:11.783
And because this is going to
be the batter for the shrimp,

00:01:11.783 --> 00:01:13.686
I'm going to add flour.

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.112
You're just going to go ahead and mix

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:18.345
those ingredients together,
and then I'm going to

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.837
end up placing that on a plate

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:23.721
so that it's a flat surface
for me to dip the shrimp into.

00:01:25.132 --> 00:01:26.858
Make sure that your shrimp
is completely washed,

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:28.199
and now you're ready to dip it into

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:31.050
the Creole seasoning flour mixture.

00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:34.930
After that, you're going to dip
the shrimp into an egg wash,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.755
and then after that
you're going to go ahead

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:42.422
and dip it into Panko crumbs.

00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:50.426
Heat up some oil into a large, deep pan,

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:51.654
and once it's heated up, you're ready

00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:54.942
to deep-fry your shrimp
until lightly browned.

00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:05.400
Grab your remoulade sauce and go ahead

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.209
and spread it into French bread.

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:16.002
Add some lettuce, and
some sliced tomatoes.

00:02:20.952 --> 00:02:23.894
Next, you're going to add the shrimp.

00:02:26.306 --> 00:02:27.294
You are good to go,

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:29.719
and you can use the
remoulade for dipping. Enjoy!

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.502
It's still hot so, we're
ready to taste-test it.

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:35.023
- Oh, man this is like, one
huge sandwich right here.

00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:37.236
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I got
a little too excited.

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:39.410
I did put some of the
sauce inside, though.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.326
- Okay, here we go.

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:45.892
Unbelievable.
- [April] Yeah? Wow!

00:02:45.892 --> 00:02:47.821
- Seriously, it tastes just
like the poboy that we get

00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:49.528
at one of our favorite
restaurants, you know?

00:02:49.528 --> 00:02:50.634
- Thanks!
- [Justin] Honestly.

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:52.578
And the sauce that you made?
- [April] I love that sauce.

00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:54.363
- Honestly, that's what makes it, I think.

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:55.463
It brings it all together,
- [April] Yeah.

00:02:55.463 --> 00:02:58.429
- and the fresh veggies,
and you really need

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.503
to have soft, fresh bread with this.

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:01.709
- Yeah, it has to be soft,

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.405
and this one was soft
- [Justin] Oh, my gosh.

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:04.741
- in the grocery store.
- [Justin] So good, honey.

00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:07.571
- Thank you! Thank you
guys so much for watching.
