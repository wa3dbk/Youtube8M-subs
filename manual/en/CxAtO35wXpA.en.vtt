00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.660
Well I reckon it’s pretty fitting that I
get to cook on this flash kitchen of Simon’s

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.840
camper. Now he gets to sleep in it, at least
I get to cook in it.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.570
So what I’m thinking? I’m thinking something
special. Let’s do something special, so

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.720
I reckon, and this is going to blow the socks
off you. I reckon chocolate pie.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.610
What do I need, first of all I will grab something
out of the fridge. So I am going to need ingredients

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:47.850
like milk, cream, some butter and some eggs.
First thing I do is get my cream and my milk

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.420
and get it on the stove, and I start warming
it up until I bring it to the boil. Remember

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.909
you got to watch cream and milk mate. Cos
it will get away on you and if you burn it,

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.920
it will be all over you will have to start
again.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.920
Grab out chocolate, whack that sucker in there,
like that, as you can see it’s supposed

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:19.299
to be chocolate buds, but it’s now just
chocolate block. So I am now going to pour

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.820
that on top of my chocolate. Now the trick
now is with that hot milk, is to stir in the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.950
chocolate. You can see it there, starting
to melt. So what I will do is I will grab

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.920
2 eggs. Do not forget the eggs. The eggs it
what is going to make this set. Without the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.020
eggs, it will be a runny chocolate mess.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.020
We are going to mix that together like that.
That’s 3 eggs I have chucked in, cos I am

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.859
going to grease this sucker up. While we are
waiting again. Still melting down. Got a sheet

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:01.859
of pastry and going to whack it in here. Remember
short bread pastry does the job. Grab a knife,

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.910
there we go. Simple as that. Now I got one
more ingredient I want to chuck in there,

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.970
to thicken that mixture up just a fraction,
now I am going to get myself a little bit

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.720
of flour. Again how much? It all depends on
thickening up the mixture, put a bit on the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.720
top to start with. All right the eggs go in.
In they go, stir all that mixture up. We are

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.010
ready now to put that mixture into there,
so we have got our pie tin ready with our

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.250
pastry. Now that, be real careful with it,
that is going to go into the camp oven. In

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:52.100
she goes. That is probably the hardest part
of the whole recipe, sticking that sucker

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.450
in there. I reckon that is going to go for
about 40 minutes. Of course set nice and hard

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:06.260
in the guts. There we go, chocolate pie, ready
to go. Hot as buggery. Now what I want to

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.680
do is slip it out of this little container
here, of this little tray thing. I will show

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.310
you a little trick with that. To finish her
off, let’s get some glazed cherries. Chuck

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:27.080
a few of those on top. Oi, you got to watch
him. To top it off with some icing sugar.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.900
There we go, that my friend is what you call
a chocolate pie, with glazed cherries on top,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.900
in a camp oven, try that one next time you
go out for a camp.
