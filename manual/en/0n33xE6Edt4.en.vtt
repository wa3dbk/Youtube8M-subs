00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:11.049
Hi! I’m Will again and this next one is
going to be a little tricky I’m going to

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:27.510
teach you about note lengths. The basic note
for music is called quarter note, there are

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.060
many different types of notes but this one
is just the one you’ll probably see most

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:43.330
frequently and it’s just the one you start
from. In a quarter note in for floor tom which

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:52.650
I’ll explain later has just one beat of
music, so essentially what it represents is

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:00.920
if you have four beats it goes 1 2 3 4, everyone
of those numbers is a quarter note and then

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
there’s other different lengths of notes
besides this. Longer than a quarter note is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.290
a half note where the quarter note goes 1234
for four quarter notes, a half note goes 1

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.090
2 3 4, so for every four quarter notes it’s
two half notes and then beyond half notes

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.954
there’s also a whole note which doesn’t
have a bar. In a whole note it’s just for

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:31.050
every four quarter notes you have one whole
note, so as a whole note would just be 1 2

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:42.090
3 4 1 2 3 4. Shorter than a quarter note is
what’s called eighth note and this is represented

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.570
by quarter note with kind of a tail at the
end, an eighth note in every quarter note

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.950
there’s two eighth notes so for every four
quarter notes you’ll have 8 eighth notes.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.829
So to count eighth notes you go, if the beat
is just 1 2 3 4, 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and to

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.829
get your 8 eighth notes in the time it takes
for four quarter notes. Smaller than an eighth

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:54.829
note is what’s called a sixteenth note and
it has two lines instead of just the one and

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.250
just as there’s 8 eighth notes and 4 quarter
notes there’s 16 sixteenth notes and 4 quarter

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.810
notes. As sixteenth note is represented by
where it’s 1 2 3 4, 20 and a 20 and a 30

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.630
and a 40 and a, that’s a sixteenth.
