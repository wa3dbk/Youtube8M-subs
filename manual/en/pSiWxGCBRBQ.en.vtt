Hi gorg,
Welcome back to my channel!

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.040
We're going to do a Revealed 2 palette tutorial
today!

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.600
As always, I'm going to start off by priming
my lids.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.330
And then, i'm going to take my E38 brush and
i'm going to dip it into this light pink color;

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.320
and apply this a little above the crease,
this is going to act as a transitional shade.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.490
Then I'm going to take that same brush and
dip it into a darker color and apply this

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.790
to the crease.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:40.750
Taking my E32 Brush, also by sigma; I'm going
to dip it into this burnt burgundy shade;

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.300
and this is going to be the start of the dimension
and depth.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:54.059
So, I'm applying this in the area where I
want the most intensity and blending 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.200
it out.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.700
Then, I'm going to blend out any harsh lines
using my Sonia Kashuk blending brush.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.639
Then I'm going to dip a flat brush by Sonia
Kashuk into this darker shade; and I'm going

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:11.070
to apply this very lightly on the lower edge
of that burnt burgundy color...

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.070
And this is going to add a little bit of depth.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.820
And of course, blend out again.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.829
Then I'm going to dip a flat rounded brush,
this is by brush love, and i'm going to apply

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.119
this rose gold color to the lid.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.340
Taking this light pinkish color, i'm going
to use this as a highlight on the brow bone...

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.439
I did add a little too much here, so, I had
to blend it out.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.439
But, it all worked out in the end.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.779
Then I'm going to take this black color, using
a small pointed detailed brush by coastal

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:54.039
scents and this is going to be a sort of cut
crease, but not really.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:03.859
(Does that make sense?)

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.080
And i'm going to pack on any more of that
rose gold color to the lid — if I lost any

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.330
of the intensity of it.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.360
And then, i'm going to take a waterproof eyeliner;
this is by too faced and just going to line

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.450
the upper lash line and smudge it out.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:28.140
This is going to be for the upper lash line
and the lower lash line.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:40.500
Then I'm going to add mascara to my upper
and lower lashes — this is buxom by bare

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.580
essentials.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.480
Here, i'm just wiping any fall out that I
had from the shadows and prepping it for all

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.400
my primers, foundation and concealers.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.130
I like to add a concealer underneath my foundation.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.760
I don't know, it just gives me a new type
of look.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.720
So i'm applying this Loreal crayon and buffing
it in.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.170
And then, I'm going to take my BB cream by
garnier, one of my favorites &amp; blending that

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.400
in with the real techniques miracle completion
sponge.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.880
Add a little bit of bronzer using my sonia
kashuk brush and adding tranquil from Sigma

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.930
beauty, this is a lip gloss that I am obsessing
with!

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.510
I love it!

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.380
And, that's it!

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.950
I also forgot to let you know, if you want
to make this a little more intense, you can

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.630
apply a cream eyeliner, any black eyeshadow
to the lower lash line like i'm doing here

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.250
and it will just make everything a little
more intense and deeper!

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.319
Thank you guys for taking time to watch, I
hope you enjoyed it!
