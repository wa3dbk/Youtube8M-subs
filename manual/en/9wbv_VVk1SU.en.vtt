00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.250
Hey, I’m Shawna Coronado.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.150
Every time I go on vacation

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.750
I kill all my plants.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.750
No kidding.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.000
My container plants, dead.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.900
I want to solve that problem

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.100
And the only way to do it,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.900
Is to hire a babysitter.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.250
I have got a better solution.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.750
I am going to save some money

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And try this new product called Vacation.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000
You are suppose to pour it on your plants

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.000
And when you pour it on the plant

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.750
What happens is that it suspends the plant

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For two weeks, three weeks.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.750
You can go on vacation

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.900
And when you come back,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.100
It looks just like it did before.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.900
No wasted money.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.100
No dead plants.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.750
So why don’t you give it a try with me?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And see if it works.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.000
So here’s how we do it.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.150
First thing.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.500
Read the directions.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It says one capful, per one cup, per herbaceous plants.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.000
That would be my annuals here.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.100
So let’s give it a try.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.900
We will pour a little bit in here.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.000
I have already got most of it mixed together.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.000
And then I want to give it a stir

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Because it is sticky.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.900
And I think the reason for that is

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.750
The stickiness really sticks to the soil

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.900
When you pour it in there

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.100
And helps the product last.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.000
Now something really important to know about this product

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Is that it is all natural.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.000
That means that it’s perfect around children or animals

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.000
It’s not a problem to use.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.250
In fact, it is made from a product that's a plant derivative.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900
So it’s going to be really good for your plants.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.100
It’s not going to hurt them.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Alright, make sure we have it watered all up.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.550
I think that’s it.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.100
These plants have been watered with Vacation.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.900
I am going to set them down right here in the sun

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.250
Next to the control group.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000
The control group has NOT been watered with Vacation.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.000
Alright, I think we are all ready to go

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.900
Let’s head out.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.000
We will put some of the plants in indirect light.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Three of them.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.750
Then, I have a surprise for you.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.900
We are going to put some of the plants in a closet.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.000
No kidding!

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.500
We are going to try this out and we are going to see what happens.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
I can’t believe it,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.000
I’m really doing it.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.900
I’m putting my plants in the closet.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.500
Now they are going to stay in here the entire time I’m gone.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.900
That’s almost 3 weeks.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.500
There we go. Alright.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.900
Now remember,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.900
Don’t water those plants.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.750
And it’s time to go on vacation.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.250
Here we go!

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.000
I am back from vacation

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.750
And you are not going to believe the results.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.500
These plants have NOT been treated

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900
And they are looking pretty dead.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.750
And these plants have been treated

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.900
And look! It’s amazing!

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.000
Wow!

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.900
Vacation really works.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.000
We have not watered any of these plants

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.750
And the results are fantastic.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.000
And now let us check it out.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.000
The indirect light results.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.000
And as you can see,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.000
Downright beautiful.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.900
No water during my entire vacation

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.900
And I came home to them looking gorgeous.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.000
And now we are going to go check out what is in the closet.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.000
That’s right.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.150
Remember the plants we put in the closet?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.000
Total dark. Let’s see what happens.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Are you ready?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.900
Let’s take a look

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.900
At the all dark!

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.900
All Vacation results.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.150
Holy cow!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
In the closet,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.000
The entire vacation

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.000
And look at how beautiful.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.900
No water at all.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.150
Let me tell you.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.000
Vacation works.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.250
You can see it right here.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.750
So, I tried Vacation.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.900
It was a great test.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.900
I love it.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.900
And now you are going to have to try it too.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.000
And check it out.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.900
Next time you go on vacation,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.000
Add Vacation to your plants.
