Welcome to Ahmet's kitchen, today we make sliced ​​chicken

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:08.139
Ingredients: 400g chicken

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.470
2 onions

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.770
2 peeled tomatoes

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.590
2 toes of garlic

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.190
4 peppers

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.030
Chives as decoration

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.100
20g butter, 20g paprika and 20g flour

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.890
Salt, pepper, chilli and thyme

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
Let's start right away

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.890
Oil in the pan

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.820
The pan has to be hot

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.400
that's 30ml

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.980
so that's already hot

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.950
the chicken straight away

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.060
Sauté for 3 minutes

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.409
then come the onions

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.100
as long as I cut the onions

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.819
roughly cut

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.279
the water in the meat is out now

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:25.290
you can see that meat is fried and has got color

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.179
Now the onions come in

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:39.069
the onions with the garlic

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.840
Now I cut the peppers

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.929
we cut them diagonally

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.450
the peppers pure

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.179
stir a few times

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.409
I'll leave it that way now

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.719
dice the tomatoes

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.599
now in the pan

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.599
finished

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:23.540
sauté everything together for about 2 minutes

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:53.230
Now put the pepper, butter and flour in the pan and stir

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:10.650
not too long

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.140
the spices are pure, salt, etc

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:26.499
and 30ml vegetable broth

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:27.499
stir everything

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:33.790
Cook for 2 minutes, then it's done

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.790
now it's done

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.340
we can give to the plate

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:55.689
that's a bit too much for a person

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:56.999
that's what I eat, and that's the Murat

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.099
I made some more slices of ciabatta

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.560
You can put it as decoration

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.909
You can eat it with bread, ciabatta or pita bread

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.959
Chives as decoration

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.549
finished

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:21.440
so you can serve them

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.030
I wish you a good appetite with sliced ​​chicken until next time,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.800
Ahmet, bye :)
