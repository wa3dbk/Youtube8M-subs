00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.009
Susan Lucille Wright is an American woman
from Houston, Texas who made headlines in

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.790
2003 for stabbing her husband, Jeff Wright,
193 times and then burying his body in their

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.180
backyard.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.980
She was convicted of first-degree murder in
2004, and is currently serving a 20-year sentence

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.710
at the Crain Unit in Gatesville, Texas.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.490
She became eligible for parole consideration
on 28 February 2014.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.740
Early life
Susan Lucille Wyche was born on April 24,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.850
1976 in Houston, Texas to Sue Whella and Jimmy
Lawrence Wyche.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.550
At the age of 17, she worked as a topless
dancer at Gold Cup for two months.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.360
In 1997, while working as a restaurant waitress
in Galveston, she met Jeff Wright and they

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.270
married in 1998 while she was eight-and-a-half
months pregnant with their first son, Bradley.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.970
In 2002, a daughter, Kailey was born.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.390
Wright claims that her husband began to abuse
her during the first few years of their marriage.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.030
Crime
According to evidence presented by the prosecution,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:18.160
on Monday, January 13, 2003, Susan Wright,
26, tied her husband, Jeff Wright, 34, to

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.310
their bed and stabbed him 193 times with two
different knives.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.910
She then buried his body in their Houston
backyard.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.960
She attempted to cover up the crime scene
by painting the bedroom.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.500
The next day, Wright filed a domestic abuse
report in order to get a restraining order

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.050
against her husband.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.170
According to the evidence adduced during the
2010 punishment trial, it was shown that the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.020
prosecution's theory that Jeff was tied to
the bed was not supported by the medical examiner

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.270
who excavated the body.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.780
The medical examiner testified that Jeff had
a significant amount of cocaine in his body

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.299
the night he died - so much so that Jeff's
body had not metabolized all the cocaine.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.890
The cocaine evidence supported the defense's
assertion that Jeff was intoxicated the night

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.000
of his death, when he came home from a boxing
class and punched his son.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.080
Jeff also had several knife wounds on his
hands, forearms, back, and the backs of his

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.490
legs, indicating defensive wounds inconsistent
with being tied to a bed.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.250
On January 18, Wright asked her attorney,
Neal Davis, to come to her home and admitted

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.360
to stabbing her husband.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.860
Davis contacted the Harris County district
attorney's office to inform them a body was

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.390
buried under Susan Wright's house and that
she had confessed to the crime.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.220
Wright turned herself in to authorities at
the Harris County Courthouse on Friday, January

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.920
24 and was arraigned on murder charges the
following Monday.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.750
Trial
Only thirteen months after her arraignment,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.410
Susan Wright's murder trial commenced on February
24, 2004.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.709
She had already pled not guilty to killing
her husband by reason of self-defense.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.630
Wright's prosecutor and defense attorney had
very different portrayals of her.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.930
Assistant district attorney Kelly Siegler
depicted Wright as a scheming wife who seduced

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.580
her husband into bed, tied him up, repeatedly
stabbed him, and then buried his body in their

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.800
backyard, all in hopes of collecting a $200,000
life insurance policy.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.310
Wright's defense attorney Neal Davis claimed
that his client had suffered years of physical

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.599
and emotional abuse by her husband, and killed
him to protect herself and her two young children.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.540
At her trial, Susan Wright testified in her
own defense.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.650
In her emotional testimony on the stand, Wright
claimed: "I couldn't stop stabbing him; I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.650
couldn't stop.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.240
I knew as soon as I stopped, he was going
to get the knife back and he was going to

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240
kill me.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.580
I didn't want to die."

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.800
She testified that on the night of the murder,
Jeff Wright was on a cocaine binge and was

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.129
violent, having allegedly beaten her.

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.660
Wright once again persisted that she stabbed
her husband in self-defense.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.010
Susan Wright's mother, among others, testified
for the defense, claiming they witnessed Wright's

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.099
bruises.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.000
ADA Siegler was not impressed by Wright's
statements; Siegler believed that Wright's

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.979
tears were faked for the jury's benefit.

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.740
While presenting their case, the prosecution
presented an unusual demonstration by bringing

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.779
the Wrights' actual bed into the courtroom.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:30.870
Using her co-counsel, Siegler depicted how
she believed Susan Wright had tied her husband

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.189
to their bed and stabbed him to death.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:38.270
During closing arguments, Siegler brought
up to the jury how Wright had been a topless

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.740
dancer, and reiterated how she believed Wright's
emotions were insincere.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.710
She contended that Susan Wright was a "card-carrying,
obvious, no-doubt-about-it, caught-redhanded,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.400
confirmed, documented liar", whose frequent
shows of emotion during the trial were deliberate

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.059
efforts to influence the jury.

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.669
Wright's defense never strayed from their
claims, however, that Wright had stabbed her

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.779
husband to death in order to protect herself
and her young children.

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.360
Verdict
On March 3, 2004, after only five-and-a-half

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.849
hours of deliberations, Wright's jury convicted
her of murder.

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.939
In sharp contrast to her emotional testimony
during the trial, Wright showed little reaction

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.050
to the guilty verdict.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.409
The following day came Wright's sentencing.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.020
Prosecutors were hoping for at least a 55-year
sentence, while Wright's attorneys argued

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.479
for probation for their client.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.729
In the end, the jury met in the middle, sentencing
Wright to 25 years in prison.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.409
Appeal
In 2005, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals of

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.409
Texas in Houston upheld Susan Wright's conviction.

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:53.949
With a re-appeal in 2008, a new witness, Misty
McMichael, the wife of former NFL Super Bowl

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:59.039
champion Steve McMichael and ex-fiancee of
Jeff Wright, came forward to tell her story

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.680
of how she endured abuse and violence during
her four-year relationship with Jeff Wright.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.319
In 2009, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
granted Wright a new sentencing hearing, after

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.289
determining that Wright's “counsel rendered
ineffective assistance during the punishment

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.539
phase of trial” in 2004.

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.499
On 20 November 2010, Wright had her sentence
cut to 20 years in prison, five years less

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.490
than her original sentence.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.939
Wright has been eligible for parole since
February 28, 2014, at the age of 38.

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:37.520
In popular culture
Author Eric Francis wrote a book about the

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.979
case entitled A Wife's Revenge in June 2005.

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:46.460
Wright's murder trial had been nationally
televised on CourtTV.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:54.089
Wright's case was first profiled on Snapped
in 2004, 48 Hours Mystery in 2005, on an E!

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:59.809
special entitled Women Who Kill, on the Deadly
Women episode "Lethal Love" on ID in 2011

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:04.979
and on an episode of Secret Lives of Stepford
Wives in 2014.

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:10.800
Wright's case is also the subject of the 2012
Lifetime original movie, Blue Eyed Butcher,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.680
starring Sara Paxton and Lisa Edelstein.
