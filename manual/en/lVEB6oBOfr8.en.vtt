Hi I'm David Cantieni and on behalf of Expert
Village I'm going to be showing you the many

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.360
aspects of playing the Irish wooden flute.
If you are interested in more information

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.529
or finding out other places where you may
find me you can go to www.digdigmusic.com

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:33.820
or you could email me at digdig@cracker.com.
I'm going to show you how to play a tune.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:44.310
Now we could take a simple tune like Mary
Had a Little Lamb or a simple Irish tune sometimes

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.219
it comes down to the same thing. Recognizing
patterns and of course making your fingers

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:00.309
move in those patterns. As you may know by
raising and lowering your fingers you will

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:08.820
change the pinch and the pinch is determine
the length of the air column between here

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.040
is the open hole, here is the close hole so
this is actually the hold of it that is making

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.470
the sound. You would also see if I play all
of my fingers down I will get the lowest note.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:29.400
If I played a different flute in a different
key I will put all my fingers down and get

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:41.070
a different note. Now I will go back to this
flute. The way that your raise and lower your

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.550
fingers make quiet a lot of difference. I
will show you a simple tune how about if we

00:01:46.550 --> 00:02:06.360
do Mary Had a Little Lamb.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.470
When there are repeated notes there is always
a question about what to do. Traditional classic

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:27.670
flute would require that you go t, t, t. in
Irish style we shy away from using our tongue

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.819
very much. Often you to make a division between
the notes you would use a k sound in the back

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:51.709
of your throat which will actually makes for
a bigger sound that we could play.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.580
You can see that I'm going k, k , k perhaps
you could see that. So that is the basics

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.879
of playing a simple tune.
