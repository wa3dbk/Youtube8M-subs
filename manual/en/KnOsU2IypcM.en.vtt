00:00:00.138 --> 00:00:01.604
- It's just coagulated pig blood.

00:00:01.604 --> 00:00:04.325
- Ewyah, Eugene!
(Eugene laughs)

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:09.298
(laid-back music)

00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:20.188
- This is tripe?

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:21.735
- It's the lining of a beef stomach.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:22.431
- Eww.

00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:23.974
- This looks spicy.

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:25.150
- Um, I'm shaking.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.519
- Oh, and it's cold.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.352
Oh my god!

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:29.438
What's up, it's Sichuan,
I'm spicy as (bleep).

00:00:29.438 --> 00:00:30.106
- [Striped Shirt Woman] Oh my god.

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:31.269
(Man coughs)
- Barf.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.482
- Oh, it makes me sneeze.

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:33.233
- Oh my god.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.818
- Is it weird that it tastes
like Italian food to me?

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:36.208
- Tastes like pizza.

00:00:37.653 --> 00:00:38.405
- Does not taste like pizza.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.335
- I can't taste anything except fire.

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:41.406
(hacking)

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:43.577
(laid-back music)

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.078
- Ooh, look at that line of fat.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.705
- Pork belly is one of the best cuts

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:48.498
of meat in existence.
- [Woman] That's...

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:49.986
- They've somehow ruined the pork belly.

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:51.585
It's like, not tender, it's very dry.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:52.628
- That's really good.

00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:54.171
- Oh man, these are good flavors.

00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:56.631
- Add some pineapple slices in here, mwah.

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.175
- You can do better than this, Sichuan.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:00.719
(laid-back music)

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.803
- This is my regular order

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:03.395
at Chinese restaurants.
- [Man] Mmm.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.848
- But this is the real
Kung Pao Chicken, right?

00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:05.974
- What's the difference
between this chicken

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:07.684
and, let's see, an American Kung Pao?

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:09.478
- Oh, they're like, mmm.

00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:11.021
- Ah, I'm so into this chicken.

00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:12.314
- This kind of food is really deceptive,

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:13.857
so it like, starts off really tasty.

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:15.192
- And then it got mean,

00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:16.860
like every single boyfriend I've ever had.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.363
- Ai, ah, ahhh.

00:01:19.363 --> 00:01:20.907
- This is inflammatory chicken.

00:01:20.907 --> 00:01:21.990
- (indistinct speech)
- [Woman] The powerful,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.074
the pleasurable, the

00:01:23.074 --> 00:01:25.076
- [both] irreplaceable Kung Pao.

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:27.954
(laid-back music)

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:28.747
- So, hash browns.

00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:30.332
- They also just kinda, looks like worms.

00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:31.250
- Please be like spaghetti.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.501
- This is a palette cleanser because

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.211
all that food is so (bleep)-ing spicy.

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:35.155
- I'm kind of into it.

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:35.921
- I ain't mad at it.

00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:37.255
- French fries that you dropped in water.

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:38.465
- This would be a great side dish.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.133
- We could fry them and
make them much better.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.678
- This is what, as a kid, I
hoped worms would taste like.

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:44.516
(laid-back music)

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:45.769
(arrow dings)

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:48.809
- What, this is, ack, wait.
- [Man] Eww.

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:50.519
- This is a cube of blood?
- [Man] Bluh!

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.104
- I'm gonna tap out of
that, pulling the Jew card.

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:55.566
- There's no way I'm eating pig's blood.

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.150
- Sometimes you wanna
impress people and be like--

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.796
- Yeah.

00:01:57.796 --> 00:01:59.027
- I'd go on Fear Factor, I'll eat blood.

00:01:59.027 --> 00:02:00.362
- (mumbles) is (bleep).

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:02.338
Oh, oh my...

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:03.156
- Oh, I hate that.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.157
- Oh god.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.035
- Mmm, that's delicate.

00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:08.662
- It liquified as soon as I took a bite.

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:10.497
(coughing)
And it's spicy.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:12.874
- I think my palette has
certainly evolved today.

00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:14.168
- It's one of those foods that I say,

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:15.961
you might have the
(bleep) the next morning,

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:17.128
but those (bleep) will be worth it.

00:02:17.128 --> 00:02:19.422
- I love the spice, way to go Sichuan.

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:21.675
- Mmhmm, I mean it's
blood, we're eating blood.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:22.317
(Man retching)

00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:25.142
So the minute you took a
bite of it, it just (laughs)

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:28.807
- [Man] When you said we're
eating blood, I was like, nope.

00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:30.235
(Woman laughs)

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:32.949
I'm not eating blood,
I don't know about you.
