00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.080
That day,
for no particular reason,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.580
I decided to go for a little run.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.760
So I ran to the First Blood.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.080
And when I got there,
I thought maybe I'd run to the Second Blood.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.670
And that's what I did.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:32.540
For no particular reason I just kept on going.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.190
My name's Forrest Gump.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.460
People call me Forrest Gump.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.420
Run, Forrest!

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.410
Run!

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.550
My momma said "You have to do the best with
what God gave you".

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.820
I got legs and a pair of shoes.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.390
Mama says they was magic shoes.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:08.600
They could take me anywhere.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.979
My momma always said, "Life was like a box
of chocolates.

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:28.590
You never know what you're gonna get."

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.179
Do you want a chocolate?

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:45.909
Mama always had a way of explaining things
so I could understand them.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.770
And that's all I have to say about that.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.119
Hey, Indian woman!

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.039
Are you my mom?

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.609
And who are you to teach me?

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:06.570
Are you my dad?

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.830
By the way, Momma, where is my dad?

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.250
On vacation?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.170
What is vacation?

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:31.990
Vacation's when you go somewhere...
and you never come back.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.990
And that's all I have to say about that.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.930
Run, Forrest!

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.410
Run!

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.880
Mama always had a way of explaining things
so I could understand them.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.930
Do you ever dream, Forrest, about who you're
gonna be?

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.760
Who I'm gonna be?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.830
Aren't-aren't I going to be me?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.650
Run, Forrest!

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.060
Run!

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:32.810
Congratulations, how do you feel?

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:44.900
I gotta pee.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.260
Don't look at me, mom, like that!

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:58.610
Mama always said, dying was a part of life.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.360
And that's all I have to say about that.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:17.570
Run, Forrest!

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.180
Run!

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.259
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:45.139
I didn't know I was supposed to be looking
for him, sir.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:53.389
I got him, sir.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.060
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:07.569
[nervously] I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:14.169
Gump!

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.099
What's your sole purpose in this army?

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.990
To do whatever you tell me, drill sergeant!

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.150
God damn it, Gump!

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.020
You're a god damn genius!

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.620
You must have a goddamn I.Q. of 160.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:39.770
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.699
What's my destiny, Mama?

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:51.840
You're gonna have to figure that out for yourself.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.180
Mama always had a way of explaining things
so I could understand them.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.960
Do you want a chocolate now?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.340
Mama, don't look at me like that...

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.159
Stupid is as stupid does.

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:26.819
Listen, Forrest, you promise me something,
OK?

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.699
Just if you're ever in trouble, don't be brave.

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.349
You just run, OK?

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:43.229
Just run away.

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.120
I could run like the wind blows.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.110
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:59.090
I was running!

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:11.860
Mama: You can't keep trying to rescue me all
the time.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.969
Forest: They was trying to grab you.

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:27.389
Mama: A lot of people try to grab me.

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:31.229
When I got tired, I slept.

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.719
When I got hungry, I ate.

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:47.240
When I had to go, you know, I went.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.039
Dear God, make me a bird.

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:52.330
So I could fly far.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:08:02.219
Far far away from here.

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:04.770
I have been killed many times.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.289
I have been stunned 13 times.

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:09.050
I'm pretty tired...

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.699
I think I'll go home now.
