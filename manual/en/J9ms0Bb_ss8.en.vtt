Hi, my name is Mary Thinnes and I'm a skincare
expert. The next topic we are going to be

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.400
discussing are bi-weekly treatments. As you
recall, I mentioned bi-weekly is done once

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.100
every two weeks. You want to just only do
it once--not every day--because too much of

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.110
a good thing can be a bad thing. What I'm
going to discuss are papaya treatments. Papaya

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.320
actually helps to break down dead skin cells.
As we age, our cells turn over at a slower

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.560
pace. When we're in our early twenties, our
cells turn over every 28 days. They come up

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.580
to the surface, then they slough off, then
new cells are regenerated. That process is

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.909
usually 28 days. As we get older, those days
turn into 30, 40 , 50...that's why we age.

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.269
Basically, papaya treatments will help break
down the build-up of those dead skin cells

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:56.409
and will help to speed up that process again.
With papaya treatments, actually it's just

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:04.690
a product that looks like a gel again, and
basically you want to massage it on the skin.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.180
Then, after it's applied to the skin (remember
to do it to your neck as well), you want to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.440
keep it on for 15 minutes because obviously,
most people don't have a steamer at home.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.830
Steam actually helps speed up the process,
so that would be heat. Heat and steam actually

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.590
help speed up the process of the enzymes working
to break down those skin cells. For those

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.800
of us who don't have steamers at home, 15
to 20 minutes I would recommend keeping it

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.550
on. With the steamer, you can keep it on for
about 10. Then basically what you do is just--it

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.460
doesn't harden, it doesn't dry like a mask--you
just rinse it off with a cloth, water and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.100
then proceed with your moisturizers and other
treatments thereafter. As I said, keep in

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.520
mind, you don't want to over-exfoliate and
papaya will exfoliate to the extent that it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.500
breaks down those dead skin cells, so only
do it on a bi-weekly basis.
