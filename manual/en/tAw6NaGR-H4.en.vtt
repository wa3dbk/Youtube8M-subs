Hi I'm Gail Hoffman from Redington Beach Florida
and on behalf of Expert Village I am going

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:17.070
to make for you a baked Alaska. Alright we're
going to use our plastic wrap to line our

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.800
stainless steel bowl which is going to fit
on top of our cake. You can do plastic wrap

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.960
this way and the opposite way if you don't
have a wide enough piece. Just make sure you

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:43.590
have enough to overlap on the sides. And just
kind of let it fall in the center and then

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:57.430
push it to the edges. And then we're going
to use some more plastic wrap to form our

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.449
strawberry outer layer. It's important that
your ice cream is nice and soft. Which I have

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:20.930
some softened strawberry ice cream. You don't
want it too soft though. And like I said before

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.400
you could just use one kind of ice cream and
fill it up to the top but I wanted to make

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.260
it two different ice creams just cuz it looks
a lot prettier when you cut into it and it

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:41.650
gives you two different flavors of ice cream.
And then we use the spoon to get this shape

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.799
going. You just basically want to make it
the same shape as the bowl. So you're just

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:59.590
pushing it to the sides and on the bottom.
I'm using for this bowl I'm using a quart

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:09.840
of strawberry ice cream. So it's relatively
smoothed out and now I have a little area

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.840
a little chamber in here that I'm going to
put the chocolate ice cream. But first I'm

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.439
going to put this in the freezer and let it
get nice and hard again.
