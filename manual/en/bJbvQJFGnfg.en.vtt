00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.830
Today's episode is all about depth of
field. Particularly shallow depth of

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.090
field, where your main subject in focus

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.369
and your background is sharp. I'm gonna
show you the Apple camera

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.980
how to do this using the lock focus mode
and also gonna show you how to cheat it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.939
using an app.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.910
This is particularly great we've got photo where you need to separate the main subject

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.029
from your background.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.910
Adorama TV presentes iPhoneography with Nicki Fitz-Gerald.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.860
One of the most popular techniques used by

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.230
professional photographers is creating a
depth of field.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.570
Now this is simply where we have the
main subject in focus and the background

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.650
usually blurred.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.720
Now adding depth of field is really going to

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.339
add a professional look to your
photograph and guess what. It's really

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.720
easy to do an iPhone

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.280
and I'm gonna show you how.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.600
To have more control over the look of your photos

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.989
one of the things you really need to get
to grips with is the lock focus mode in

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.059
your Apple camera.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.550
Now this isn't complicated at all but
it's a really important thing to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.340
learn and I guarantee once you've
learned it you're going to be using it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.929
ninety-nine percent of the time.

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.830
Now the autofocus mode in the Apple
camera is pretty good you can check how

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.740
quick is

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.670
in our focus pixels episode. but if you want the camera

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.100
to see something the way you're seeing
it, then you need to lock for focus on

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.950
the part the image you want to get sharp.
The Apple camera won't always do that for

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.310
you.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.849
So to learn this aspect of it is really
important. I’ll show you how to do this in

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.489
this scene we've got behind me here

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:39.929
on these little daffodils. If I point my
camera, now I'll open the Apple camera first

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.739
and point my camera to the scene behind me. Well you can see when we’ve got

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.360
our camera here, the auto-focus is automatically focusing on the scene in the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.060
background.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.920
What we want is the daffodils in
focus. So what we need to do is click on

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.330
there. There the daffodils sprung into life. The backgrounds gone nice and blurred.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.599
We've got that great depth of field. Look. I'll take a photograph.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.660
What happens is the focus just went back
into the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.890
background and now we've got the
daffodils once again out to focus.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.080
Now we want to lock focus on.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.580
We simply, instead of tapping we tap and hold.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.819
The auto-exposure/atup-focus lock comes on

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.900
and now we've got our beautiful daffodils
once again in focus.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.260
We could take that picture and look what
happens when I've taken it. The autofocus

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.360
doesn't reset. We’ve got our daffodils here still in focus.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.310
If we wanted to move them around they'd still be there in focus no problem,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.150
and we can carry on continue taking photographs. A simple technique, a really easy one but

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.630
it really can make a huge difference to 
your photography.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.900
Sometimes with an iPhone

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.030
we don't always get our photos exactly
how we want them because we're rushing to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.580
take that shot, we’re in a hurry.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.700
We can lose our subject against a busy
background. So we can actually

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.090
cheat this depth of field effect by
bringing our subject forward and making our

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.080
background blurred

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.300
after we've taken the photograph. I'm gonna show you how to do this in

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.790
the app called Leonardo. So the first thing
we need to do is open the Leonardo app.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.600
We need to bring in our photograph by
pressing the plus button on the top right hand

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.310
corner.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.640
Click on photo library. Now we need to
find our photograph.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.650
Find the photo, click on it to bring it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.640
into the Leonardo app and its formed a
layer on the top right hand corner here.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.170
We need to duplicate that layer,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.280
because we’re going to blur that layer and then we're gonna mix the two together.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.280
Click on that layer to duplicate it. See it’s come up duplicate here.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.230
Click on that and what we're gonna do is
gonna blur that layer

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.519
by clicking on the sun button at the
bottom.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.970
We’re going to find cause Gaussian Blur, click on that.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.120
Then we’re going to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.230
blur this whole layer just by sliding our
slider across. I’m going to overdo it

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.590
little bit just to show you the
technique. I’m going to click on the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.000
tick button there. That’s blurred that layer.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.370
What we need to do now is go back to our
layers

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.790
I'm gonna bring this layer to the bottom by
clicking and dragging. That's our blurred

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.310
layer.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.910
So our sharp layer is now on top. We need to
click on the sharp layer now that's

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.180
highlighted in blue.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.490
What we're gonna do, we’re going to remove this sharp

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.620
layer, part of it to reveal the blurred
background.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.260
We do this by clicking on the masking tool. Click on the brush.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.940
What you needs to do now is start rubbing he background away. What this

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.000
going to it is reveal that bottom

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.390
blurred layer. What happens here is

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.020
because this is blurred in the
background, this is gonna make the

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.919
foreground

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.250
our main subject, Lewis nice and
sharp. It gonna push it back. Now you can

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.840
adjust

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.000
the size of this brush slightly and the
softness

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.400
just by using that tool there. You can
go in really really nice and close.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.310
Right close up here to his ear.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.020
Work around. Nice and detailed so your going to get

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.070
fine soft-touch natural touch

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.500
around. We can make that brush bigger.
I Should make it softer.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.430
Let’s come in here and this get rid of
that boat here.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.690
Then brush all around with the wide brush.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.900
Just fill in the bigger areas get rid of
that litter bin which I didn't se when

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.280
I was taking the photograph.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.510
If we go over the edges we can also

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.240
take that away again by pressing that icon

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.450
up there. Okay so you can see the effects
now. It’s pushed that background right back. I've

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.540
over done it a little bit just to show the
effect,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.240
but you can see that's really making our
main subject jump forward.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.150
We can go in and refine that detail. Make our brush smaller.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.500
Go right in, up close. Pixels let’s bring it
back.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.000
Work our way around.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.150
Around his face. Bring that back a bit.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.190
Bring his ear back. Just keep working
around.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.280
You start to see

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.880
the sharpness of Lewis really jumping
forward

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.090
you see the effect is really made him
pop forward.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.560
Looks a bit strange at the moment because we've still left a few bits.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.510
But there we go and I'm happy with
that. We created that great depth of

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.260
field look.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.139
That's fantastic, I’m really please with that . So there we have it. Two great ways of

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:34.740
creating

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.510
depth of field look. Using a lock focused
using your Apple camera

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.139
or cheating it with a Leonardo app with a photograph you’ve already taken blurring the

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:43.770
background.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.970
