00:00:02.577 --> 00:00:06.074
What's up, beautiful people? It is your homegirl, Shameless, all up in your building!

00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:13.964
And I have a special guest! The beautiful, the wonderful, HeyFranHey!

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:15.799
FRAN: Hi, beautiful ones!

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:23.355
MAYA: For those of you that don't know who she is, this beautiful woman has a popular blog and a youTube channel.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.252
Check it out, link in description box.

00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:26.902
But you're known for...

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.658
FRAN: I am known for being sort of like a kitchen beautician.

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:36.032
MAYA: Oh! Kitchen beautician! That should be your tag!

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:37.516
FRAN: That's kind of cute, right?!

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:47.992
But I basically can teach you how to whip up everything you need, from lotions, hair conditioners, to deodorant, straight from your kitchen,

00:00:47.992 --> 00:00:53.189
straight from your pantry for affordable prices; obviously easily accessible right in your kitchen.

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:56.157
MAYA: And I watch her videos and I'm like, ''can you just sell this stuff? Because I don't have time.''

00:00:56.157 --> 00:01:00.335
FRAN: Right! That's Maya's comment all the time! ''Can you just make it for me?!''

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:04.294
MAYA: I don't have time. But it's winter and my skin is super dry.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:08.694
And I actually do want to make a shea butter.

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:10.504
FRAN: Let's make it!
MAYA: Let's make it.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.686
MAYA: So break it down, what's all this?

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:19.235
FRAN: So now that we have our butters that we've decided on; becaue Maya wanted it to be super strong.

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:20.957
MAYA: There's like, a bunch of--she has a bunch of butters.

00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:24.580
She has mango butter, aloe vera butter, and shea butter, but I just like the shea.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:32.204
FRAN: Yeah, and cocoa butter. Really, there's so many butters you can choose from. But Maya specifically said ''I want it to be shea based.''

00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:34.186
MAYA: Shameless shea butter!

00:01:35.357 --> 00:01:43.388
FRAN: And then when I told her about the aloe, how the aloe makes sure that everything is tied in together, she wanted to throw in for that double punch.

00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:46.516
So that's why we're using our 2 butters. She wanted it really creamy too.

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:48.702
MAYA: I want creamy, because I'm really ashy.

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:56.498
FRAN: And you know, if you want it really creamy, then you add more butter. If you want it  more whipped and kind of soft then you add more of the oils.

00:01:56.498 --> 00:02:02.654
So it's up to you to kind of customize it, but Maya said she wanted it thick so we're going to go with the shea butter and the aloe.

00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:10.954
Now for the moisturizing oils which is actually what's going to go into your skin and get rid of the ash and make sure that it's giving you the soft skin.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:18.135
You have choices: you can do coconut oil, you can do avocado oil, you can do olive oil, argan oil.

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:21.863
We decided to do coconut oil because that's Maya's favorite.

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:22.674
MAYA: That's Jackie's.

00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:25.547
FRAN: Yeah, this is actually Jackie's jar.

00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:35.441
Adding the coconut oil to our butters; and then jojoba oil is  the oil that is closest to our natural oil. It kind of matches it.

00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:42.156
So if you have eczema or any kind of skin ailment, this will kind of replenish anything that's missing.

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:47.419
So this gets you soft, and this heals your skin from the inside out.

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.090
Then you have to decide--oh wait! Actually no, not yet.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.436
I forgot, then we have vitamin e.

00:02:53.696 --> 00:03:04.463
Vitamin e; how many of you have issues with stretch marks, or like I metioned the eczema, or just--people get dry patches and rashes--

00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:07.163
MAYA: I do actually, I have some.
FRAN: Yeah, discoloration.

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:10.655
FRAN: There's so many different ailments that people--well, that all of us suffer from.

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:16.823
The vitamin e is a regenerator; it will make sure that all of that will start healing from the inside out as well.

00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:21.856
So that, combined with the jojoba, tag team, beautiful skin, it's exactly what you're looking for.

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:29.304
Now you have to decide how you want it to smell. So this part is really up to you;  it's not necessary to pick what we're picking.

00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:33.443
Maya wanted something kind of warm and vanilla-ish.

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:38.710
MAYA: I picked vanilla, and then I got this stuff. It's jasmine, rose, and seederwood.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.678
FRAN: Yeah, I told her it smells like my grandma, but she likes it.

00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:46.935
Now we are going to throw all of it into our Ninja.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.915
Yeah, let's blend the shea first.

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:51.508
MAYA: This is so funny. I feel like I'm on some sort of talk show.

00:03:51.508 --> 00:03:52.795
FRAN: We're on the Oprah show!

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:56.506
MAYA: Oh! Shameless is a show girl!

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.024
FRAN: And then we are going to use a cup of aloe butter.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:05.909
MAYA: I can imagine all these little kiddies watching your videos in their kitchens...

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.293
FRAN: Like, making stuff!

00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:14.623
Alright, so now let's put in our moisturizing oils. We're going to put in 1/4 cup of each oil.

00:04:14.623 --> 00:04:16.796
Want to do the honors and add that?

00:04:20.313 --> 00:04:23.503
MAYA: This is why I can't be serious when I'm cooking in the kichen!

00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.534
Chef Shameless!

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.731
MAYA: And then I got some cinnamon, because...

00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:06.540
That's going to add like, some texture!

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.230
She's not with it. I change it up on them.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.169
FRAN: Shameless DIY, I get it!

00:05:15.304 --> 00:05:17.122
MAYA: She don't know about this cinnamon!

00:05:17.654 --> 00:05:19.356
Look at that! It looks so cute!

00:05:19.356 --> 00:05:20.992
FRAN: It's like, bubbling!

00:05:21.757 --> 00:05:23.812
Nice and creamy, look at that!

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.706
MAYA: It will harden.

00:05:25.706 --> 00:05:29.627
FRAN: Yeah, it will harden. I mean it always does. I'm going to take some.

00:05:29.627 --> 00:05:32.341
MAYA: I want to eat it. But she said I would get indigestion.

00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:34.038
FRAN: It smells so good!

00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:39.436
MAYA: That's it! That was really fast and fun! I think this is like, a good thing to do with friends.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.800
FRAN: And I love that Maya added the cinnamon because it added these cute little specks. It's really cute!

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:45.827
MAYA: Looks like a chai latte.

00:05:46.247 --> 00:05:47.312
Winter ready!

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:49.951
FRAN: And it's all clean.

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:53.171
MAYA: All natural. And made in my own home.

00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.703
FRAN: And made in your own home, so you know what went in it, you know who handled it. 

00:05:56.703 --> 00:06:05.690
And one last tip: it's nice to store it in glass, because a lot of the plastic jars and stuff are usually made with chemicals.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.464
And because your butter's sitting in it you don't know what's seeping into the butter.

00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:15.297
You know, buy these mason jars; I actually bought a box of 12 mason jars.

00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:18.189
A box of 12, and I think I paid $10.

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:19.247
MAYA: From where, Amazon?

00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:22.703
FRAN: From Amazon! Yeah, it's so cheap, it's like a dollar each, really.

00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:25.436
MAYA: That is it! Thank you!

00:06:25.436 --> 00:06:26.780
FRAN: Of course!

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.800
MAYA: Yay! Everyone go check out HeyFranHey; her channel is in the link in the description box.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.218
And she also has a video, a detailed video.

00:06:36.218 --> 00:06:42.405
FRAN: Right, if you want to know more information on each ingredient and exactly what it does, then...

00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:44.455
MAYA: It's not shameless, though.

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:50.717
That's it, guys! Make sure you like, comment, subscribe--oh, I always like to ask questions.

00:06:52.015 --> 00:06:54.112
Are you guys doing any DIYs?

00:06:54.112 --> 00:07:00.848
FRAN: Or let us know what your favorite recipes are, if you make your own body butter. Let's kind of swap recipes in the comments.

00:07:00.848 --> 00:07:05.147
MAYA: Remember to do you, be you, and stay true.

00:07:05.455 --> 00:07:08.302
Be shameless!
