me back

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.200
couple nd really nice features about the
store

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.200
won the first thing to look at is just
the kind of weird edged words berries

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.850
very nice law

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.630
deftly votes

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.850
hi or

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.260
uh... which is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.000
europeans can't see certainly feel
depressed or

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.110
stores for person pay-per-view

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.030
at this point person baker here perhaps

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.260
what that means is the source of the
last line

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.630
last model

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.549
anything five instead big box store

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.509
all right now let's talk about the
inside of the doors and the features and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690
benefits we have here

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.310
we'll put it up

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.909
first thing you'll notice that at the
bottom is the standard uh... piston that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.500
they have for

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.850
closing the door

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.860
but it is color match the next door so
lynn said very well

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.800
uh... what's different about this
store's actually has to closures

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.049
if we look at the top there's a saket
one out there

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.200
that second one against color match

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.659
benefit having to those that keeps the
door alliances being open and close

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.430
ginger get longer life

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.230
uh... as was impossible but more

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.119
but in the wall of fame and replace the
door and in fire in years

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.969
is money well spent

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.529
okay now let's talk about the sweep on
the bottom of the door

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.579
uh... the sweet is really important
because that's what keeps out dur dust

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.839
weaned of water insects

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.559
uh... things like that from blowing in
from underneath your door of nice thing

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.729
about this store's excessive triple
sweets edison one or two uh... reverse

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.559
we just like most doors have reason
that's important is the doors self is

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:40.279
not a flack from one side to the next
threshold where people walking out of

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.279
the world and step on it

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.049
so this gives you could contact all the
way crops and again that's going to keep

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.639
out all of the insects in the wind in
the ring

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.180
office and i want to talk about my
abrams door

be separates i have been getting and the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.319
second section

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.069
has a plastic so

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.059
depending on the season here we're going
to meet with sachin replacement becomes

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:15.429
very difficult and painful mixed breed

fun

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.480
unit

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.570

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.510

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.729
king's ho

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.159
prodi has done something really really
busy

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.939
incorporated the screen actually into
the door itself

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.719

and i will use it on the top sach

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.049
it's also follow sashes well so if you
wanted to do it from just the top

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.029
or just the bottom one px twelve px you
have the option of doing

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.499
young really if you have to be pets

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.090
and this is nice because believe it down
on the bottom w

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.400
was in really

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.429
from the top as much as what

00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:22.919
uh... industry feature

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.310
sako spring it's hidden you can actually
lost his class in the place right here

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.620
cinemas get the opener clothes from the
outside

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.209
it's the last thing let's talk about the
store

00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:39.849
is that he had hoped that lock system on
the you see it's bronze inside and out

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.089
it's got an axe dual lock here so that
way in the evenings or anytime you can

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:49.199
kind of feel safe about opening up your
front door lashing this enough and worry

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.589
about summit coming up

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:56.439
only time it's also keyed on the side as
well so

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:00.529
if you want to walk it full time still
have access from the outside with a key

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:01.149
you can do that
