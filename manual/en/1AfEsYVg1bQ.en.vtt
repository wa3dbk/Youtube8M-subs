00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.040
Hey everybody this is Steve, and can you
believe we only have about a week left of Great Lent?

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.860
Its been a long few weeks with a lot of challenges.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.420
Lent is hard work.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.389
Lent unites us in a common struggle,

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.769
and a common preparation

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.769
and if we're honest, in a common failure.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.340
No one's perfect.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.340
These past few weeks we've all stumbled.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.040
We've all fasted less than we should or

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.430
said things we shouldn't have said or

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.940
done things we shouldn't have done.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.560
And instead of allowing us to move into
Holy Week discouraged or demoralized

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.880
the Church offers us hope in the person of
Saint Mary of Egypt.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.080
For a long time Saint Mary lived a very sinful life.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.080
until one day she decided to go to
Jerusalem to visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.360
which is where the Tomb of Christ is.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.160
And when she tried walking in she felt some invisible force keeping her out.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.040
She realized it was because of her sin.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.040
She was ashamed.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.979
When she saw an icon of the Virgin Mary outside of the church building

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.320
she repented.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.020
She asked for forgiveness,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.610
and went to desert.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.850
She stayed in the desert for 40 years,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.700
praying, drawing closer to God, repenting of her sins

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.260
Now when we think about Saint Mary

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.400
we don't think about her flaws.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.860
We don't think about who she WAS,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.440
We think about who she IS:

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.680
A Saint,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.480
a holy person in the kingdom of God.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.480
She's a saint, because she repented.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.080
Now normally when we think of repentance we associate with feeling bad for our sins.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.000
but it means a lot more than that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Repentance comes from the Greek word "metanoia"

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.900
which means a change of mind or a
change of direction.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.360
Saint Mary didn't simply feel bad for her sins,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.820
she changed her life,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.720
she changed her direction.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.320
She stopped moving away from God

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.340
and started moving towards Him.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.320
Sometimes we resist repentance in our own lives because of fear.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.820
We're so burdened by guilt that we think forgiveness

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.570
is impossible.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.210
We build walls around ourselves

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.899
because we're afraid,

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.359
fearing that we're too broken, too imperfect to love.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.580
When Saint Mary felt that force outside of the church

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.580
she had a choice:

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.540
She could turn around,and keep moving further away from God,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.460
or she could try moving towards Him.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.670
It's no accident that she made her
decision after looking into the eyes of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.370
the Virgin Mary,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.430
because somewhere deep down in her heart she knew

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.300
the saints love her

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.900
and are waiting for her.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.880
She knew that God loves her

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880
and is waiting for her.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.380
She realized that no sin is too big, or too bad

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.920
for God to forgive.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.210
No matter what she had done or how long
she had been doing it for

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.890
God was waiting for her, arms open, ready to forgive.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.600
We've all sinned and we've all had our own failures, but no matter what we've done

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.680
there's nothing that God can't handle!

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.500
That doesn't just go for Great Lent.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500
That goes for our lives generally.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.800
Now repentance isn't easy,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.640
and it takes a lot more than a moment.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.920
Saint Mary spent forty years repenting in the desert.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.960
But it started with a moment,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.360
with the decision to turn back to God.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.580
And the saints continue this throughout
their lives, every day

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.680
every minute, every moment is an opportunity

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.040
and an invitation to refocus on God.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.850
And sure, we'll stumble and we'll fall

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.500
but God is always there to reach out His hand, and lift us up again.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.300
And if you feel like you haven't taken advantage

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.560
of the opportunity of Great Lent

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.980
don't worry, there's time to prepare for Easter!

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.800
Just start now.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.830
And even if you've spent your entire life
running away from God,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.290
don't worry.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.720
Just stop running

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.450
and turn around.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.080
So let's Be the Bee, and repent

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.580
this moment, every moment.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.579
Be the Bee, and #LiveOrthodoxy
