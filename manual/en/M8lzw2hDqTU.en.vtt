00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Hi I'm Chris Wardlaw for CarGurus and
today we're going to talk about the pros

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.240
and the cons of the updated 2016 Acura
RDX Acura has made a lot of changes to its

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.109
entry level crossover SUV this year
we're going to talk about a few of those

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.560
while we go for a drive, common, let's go

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.789
turbocharged four-cylinder
engines might be the hot new trend but

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.120
in my opinion nothing beats a powerful
and refined V6 the Acura RDX has one it 3.5

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.160
liters of displacement makes 279 horsepower
and it makes this little crossover

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.660
really fun to drive it sure does help
that the steering is perfectly weighted

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.480
and responsive and that the chassis is
willing and while the brakes can fade a

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.969
little bit under duress overall there's
really nothing to complain about here as

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:05.420
far as driving dynamics if you enjoy
driving the Acura RDX is for you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.220
now for 2016 Acura has upgraded the RDX's
underlying structure for improved crash

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.450
protection basically what that means is
underneath the sheet metal the hard

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.640
components that are underneath here that
are designed to protect you

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.770
they've been strengthened for 2016 now
the early results are looking good

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.180
the federal government has performed
crash tests on the RDX it gets five star

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.060
ratings across the board

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.159
the real test though is going to be the
small overlap frontal impact tests

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.000
conducted by the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety basically that measures

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.500
what happens if you hit something hard
on the front corner that test hasn't

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.659
been conducted as we're creating this
video but based on what the Honda CR-V

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.990
upon which this vehicle is based has
done in that test it looks promising

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.229
now another nice thing for 2016 is the
Acura watch Plus package of safety

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.469
technologies not only does it include
forward collision warning with automatic

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.030
emergency braking and lane departure
warning system and a lane Keeping Assist

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.160
system but it's also available on every
RDX

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.990
Acura's not making you spend all your
money on the top trim level package to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.300
get the safety features you can get it
on any one of the RDX's it sells

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.290
nice thing about the RDX is that it's
really easy to find what you're looking

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.100
for and to use it

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.260
you're never gonna be driving to the
side of the road and angrily ripping out

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.620
the owner's manual to figure something
out if you've watched my video of the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.720
Acura MDX and you're looking at this
dashboard in seeing this two-screen

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.630
infotainment system you might be
thinking all right Wardlaw why did you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.130
criticize that design so much in the MDX
but you'd love it in the RDX let me

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.460
explain in this vehicle the climate
controls are already down here the only

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.300
thing related to climate controls that
is on this screen is the temperature

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.030
display that means nothing but the radio
and your media choices are operated

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.210
through this middle screen all the other
functions of the infotainment system

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.690
are accessed using these
buttons and knobs and this top screen

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.290
and what that simple change with the
climate controls does is that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.320
automatically makes the driver remember
I use this for radio use this for

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.040
climate everything else is done here and
looking here in the MDX that's not

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.870
necessarily the case and so I find the
RDX is setup much more user-friendly

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.100
much more intuitive much easier

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.880
so now that we've discussed a few of my
favorite things about the RDX let me

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:55.470
tell you about some of the things I'm
not so crazy about now as much as I like the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.920
V6 engine in the way that the RDX
drives I gotta tell you I'm a little bit

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.600
bummed that Acura does not employ its
super handling all-wheel drive system on

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.890
this particular model now super handling
all-wheel drive is a torque vectoring

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.860
all-wheel-drive system that can actually
put about seventy percent of total

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.930
engine output to just one rear wheel and
it makes vehicles with SH-allwheel-drive a

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.930
lot of fun

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.100
the RDX uses a more simplistic
all-wheel-drive system it primarily

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.090
powers the front wheels it'll send up to
40% of the power to the rear wheels as

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.510
conditions warrant I really wish this
vehicle had two more sophisticated

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.400
SH-allwheel-drive system

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.090
now another problem for me personally is
the driving position in the RDX the seat

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.889
itself is perfectly comfortable in fact
in the advanced package it comes with

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.820
heated and ventilated seats and I'll
tell you these ventilated seats are

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.180
doing wonders today because the heat
index or something crazy like close to a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.110
hundred degrees rather for me the
driving position is the issue I don't

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.330
feel like I have enough height and I
don't feel like I have enough rear

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.090
seat track travel now I'm only six feet tall
but I'm built like all the guys in my

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.510
family have got long legs and a short
torso so that means I like to sit up high and

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:26.289
as far back as I can my legs require 33
inch inseam pants so if you've got a 32

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.800
or higher you may find that you sit
kind of split legged in the RDX kinda

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.849
like I do and while right now that's ok

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:41.060
over many many miles and many many hours
on a road trip that gets old pretty fast

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:49.610
if you're wondering what this beautiful
blue paint color is called its fathom

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.800
blue pearl in my wife loves it

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.389
unfortunately Acura only offers this
paint color with what it calls a

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:05.570
greystone interior my wife can't stand
the gray interior now other RDX models

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.520
are available with ebony or parchment
leather but this particular fathom blue

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.380
pearl is only available with greystone
the problem with that is that luxury

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.570
vehicle buyers expect to be able to get
things the way that they want and

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.770
because of Acrua's approach in terms of
limiting choice not only when it comes

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.430
to the paint colors on this vehicle but
also the equipment packages and how you

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.139
can configure an RDX my bet is that a
lot of people pass this vehicle up for

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.300
something that gives them more choice so
what's the verdict when it comes to the

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.340
2016 Acura RDX should you go test drive
this vehicle right away is a work in

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.180
progress or should you just cross it
right off your shopping list

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.240
before you answer the question one
thing I want to convey to you is that I

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.860
really like Acura products they're fun
to drive their very refined their

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.949
impeccably engineered but then so are
the Honda's that so many Acura's are

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:07.910
based on it because they're based on
Honda products that makes Acura a

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.310
premium brand rather than a luxury
brands in america people buy luxury

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.509
brands because they tell the world how
awesome you are a premium brand doesn't

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:24.680
do that so until the calipers on that
grill are able to convey that palpable

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.370
sense of awesomeness that you want to
tell the world about I think that

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.180
Acura is going to continue to
struggle now as far as the RDX itself is

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.410
concerned I recommend it

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.289
i buy one of these myself if I were in the
market but what you basically got here

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:45.820
is a really nice Honda CR-V with the V6
engine and until something changes there

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.440
I think Acura going to continue to
struggle for more information about the

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.930
RDX be sure to see my full review on
