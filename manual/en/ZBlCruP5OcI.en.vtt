00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.740
On behalf of expertvillage.com I'm Tom Flowers
of Well Tempered Piano Tuning here to talk

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.169
to you today about piano tuning and maintenance.
Now we're moving down to what we call the

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:17.640
tenor section. Now, it's this section that
begins with this C-sharp and end with this

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.320
F-sharp. It's essentially the middle of the
piano and we're going to begin tuning it.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:36.280
I'm going to set the tuner for C-sharp3, which
is what this note is and it's flat to the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.600
tune of about five cents or about five percent.
Every time you make a move on the piano you're

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:57.320
moving one hundred cents just as in a dollar.
Now that we have the center string at pitch,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:45.840
we're going to tune the left string to it
and the right string as well. We'll continue

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:57.109
on through this entire section in the same
fashion. A certain amount of care is taken

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.259
in pulling a string like this up on a ninety-eight
year old piano. As you can see on the strings,

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.819
there is a certain amount of rust and oxidation
that's going to weaken the structure of the

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.590
string. So I would not be quite as aggressive
with this as I would be a new piano.
