Hi, I'm Mark Lobel. When you start with
a great raw steak, any way you choose to

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.340
do it you'll wind up with a great
tasting cooked steak. And great tasting

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.619
steaks aren't relegated to those cooked
only on the grill. Pan roasting is a two

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.359
stage method incorporating high heat
searing on the stovetop and lower

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.070
temperature finishing in the oven. Steaks
cooked indoors take on a different

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.309
personality. A steak seared in a hot pan
develops an intensely flavorful

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.450
caramelized crust that seals in juices
that simply burst in your mouth with

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.520
every bite. First remove the steaks from
the refrigerator and allow them to come

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.070
to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Before beginning to cook assemble your

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.509
olive oil, sea salt or kosher salt, and
pepper. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.179
Fahrenheit. On the stovetop heat an
ovenproof frying pan or skillet on high

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:16.320
heat until the pan smokes slightly or a
drop of water evaporates on contact.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.729
Brush the steaks with olive oil and rub
with coarse kosher or sea salt and

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.770
freshly ground pepper. When the pan is
heated lay the steaks carefully into the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.079
skillet to avoid splatters. Your venter
fan should be set on high because this

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.329
method creates a fair amount of smoke as
the steak is seared. Sear the steak for

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.950
two to three minutes on each side.
After the steaks are seared put the pan

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.710
directly into the oven and roast the
steaks to a desired doneness. Transfer

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.200
the steaks to dinner plates or a platter
and let rest for five minutes before

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.890
slicing and serving. A simple prepared
steak is delicious on its own or paired

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.680
with other flavors. To add more flavor
try using the compound butter or a sauce

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.250
to enhance the entire presentation. For
more tips, techniques, and recipes

sauce recipes for topping a pan roasted
