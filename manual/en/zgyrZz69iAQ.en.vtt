00:00:02.683 --> 00:00:05.825
the swallow is a simple traditional paper plane

00:00:06.127 --> 00:00:07.762
it does loopings

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.778
you can fold it from A4 or Us letter paper

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:17.784
fold the sheet in half along the long edge

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:29.048
open the model

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.708
fold the short edge to the long edge

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.724
so the fold is diagonal

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:42.453
open

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:46.596
repeat on the other side

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:54.689
now weâ€™ll do something like a water-bomb-base

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:57.737
if you know that, this step will be easy

00:00:57.787 --> 00:00:59.499
turn around

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:06.359
fold the corners to the corners of the creases

00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:12.428
so the crease goes through the intersection of the other folds

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:15.285
open and turn over

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:17.303
push in the center

00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.287
bring it together that way

00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:22.740
bring together all edges

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:25.313
make flat

00:01:28.164 --> 00:01:32.200
take the two top flaps

00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:35.077
and fold them to the top corner

00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:43.104
now a "rabbit-ear-fold"

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.133
fold the angle-bisector both ways

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:54.183
fold both at the same time

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.254
and pinch the corner together

00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:03.630
repeat with other flap

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:10.643
pinch the corner

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:15.686
this might be hard because there is a lot of paper to fold

00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:19.924
just pinch hard, you'll do it :)

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:27.670
the crease goes along this line

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:31.083
where the "ears" are

00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:37.069
the ears become the tip of the plane

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.997
crease firmly

00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:45.379
fold in half like in the beginning

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.979
fold down to form wings

00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:54.904
as far as the head of the swallow allows it

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:59.308
repeat on back

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:06.453
make small wings down there

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:12.528
use the first wing as a reference-point

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:22.126
press the corner inside

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:30.885
pinch in together

00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:34.205
that is the finished swallow

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:40.536
please comment if you use the subtitles ,so I know if it is worth my time =)
