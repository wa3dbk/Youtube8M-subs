00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.530
How to Grow Your Own Pineapple at Home.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.270
Growing a pineapple doesn’t take a lot of
skill, but it does take a lot of patience—two

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.210
to three years worth, to be exact.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.110
You will need A pineapple A small bowl of
water Planting pots And potting soil A pineapple

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.560
A small bowl of water Planting pots and potting
soil.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.560
Step 1.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.590
Buy a healthy pineapple—one with a green
top that has no bruising or soft spots.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.590
Step 2.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.600
Cut off the top where the stem is, known as
the crown.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.400
Do not leave any of the fruity part of the
pineapple on the stem.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
Step 3.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.340
Pull off the outer leaves of the stem, leaving
about six big leaves near the center of the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060
pineapple plus the small leaves that are in
the middle.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.330
Put the crown aside for a few days to dry
out.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.330
Step 4.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.760
Put the top in a small bowl filled with about
a half inch of water.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.930
The bottom of the crown should be submerged,
but the water should not touch the leaves.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.010
Step 5.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.140
Place the bowl in a sunny spot—but not in
direct sunlight—for two weeks.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.570
Change the water every few days.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.580
Step 6.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.620
After two or three weeks, the crown should
be sprouting roots, meaning it’s ready to

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.040
be planted.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.250
Fill a container that drains with potting
soil, and plant the crown.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.600
Step 7.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.730
Water your plant from the top, including the
leaves, and set it in a sunny window.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.670
Keep the soil moist, but take care not to
overwater.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.820
Pluck old leaves as they die in order to provide
light and air for the new leaves that are

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.180
sprouting.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.190
Step 8.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.271
Keep your budding pineapple in full sun for
a minimum of six hours each day, and keep

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:34.450
the room temperature at 60 to 75 degrees.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.450
Step 9.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.970
After about a year, replant the pineapple
in a bigger pot.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.970
Be patient.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.910
It takes two to three years for a pineapple
to mature.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.910
Step 10.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.170
Pick the pineapple when the eyes are even
from top to bottom, and the fruit has a rich

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.250
pineapple scent.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
It won’t ripen any more once it’s been
picked.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.730
Did you know A pineapple actually is not a
single fruit, but a collection of hundreds

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.780
of tiny fruits.
