Hi everyone I’m Ryoya.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.440
The theme of this month is Japanese dessert.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.460
I’m going to make Warabi mochi today.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.760
Warabi mochi is really easy to make.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.040
Put all ingredients into a pot, then heat it. Done.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.340
That’s all you have to do. This is one of the easiest Japanese dessert.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.780
let’s get started!

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.980
If you couldn’t find warabi mochi powder, you can use any kind of starch powder instead

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.140
such as tapioca starch, corn starch or Kudzu starch.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.620
Any kind of starch powder can be substitution, so try this at home.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.520
I coated the warabi mochi with Kinako powder today,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.760
You can add a touch of mactha powder.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.280
or you can also drizzle any kind of syrup on warabi mochi.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.100
try making your own flavored warabi mochi.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.920
See you next week!
