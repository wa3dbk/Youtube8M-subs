00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
NO SPACE!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
NOT THIS TIME SID MEIER

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.728
We’re in mod-land, and there are Large Islands
- call me Margaret

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:10.797
The Kalmar union - they have big Baltic Warships
while the Church is Round and good for gold

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:12.647
This is where we will live - mountains are
tough to come by

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:18.818
Monuments must be built now that Tradition
was nerved - see Patch Notes version 1.0.3.276

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.998
Anyway - look up, way up

00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:23.488
And find a unit-friendly Natural Wonder

00:00:23.488 --> 00:00:24.488
And the Pope’s house

00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:25.488
White smoke?

00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:29.338
They’ve chosen a new Pope!

00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:31.358
The smoke clears over Stockholm

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:32.757
Siam says hi

00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:34.468
As does Enrico

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:37.988
We saved a Worker from the Vatican and now
the Pope is angry

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:39.578
He got angrier

00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:43.497
Not unhappy and there are unclaimed Bananas
- Banana?

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:44.738
Banana!

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:50.177
The Round Church will come to order

00:00:50.177 --> 00:00:51.528
Money will go to others

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:54.727
There’s Brazil and William of the Netherlands
too

00:00:54.727 --> 00:00:56.347
The religion is complete

00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:59.518
Complete with a Grand Temple - in 8 turns

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:03.268
At this point the Vatican will forget about
all past wrong-doings

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:05.458
And a Harbor connects the coasts

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:09.338
A spare Settler camps out in the field while
Astronomy is figured-out

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:11.878
The Vatican will fall to Venice eventually

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:13.768
You can Bank on that

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:14.968
And found a city up North

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:17.728
There’s not much land to go around nearby

00:01:17.728 --> 00:01:19.388
Plenty of Research Agreements though

00:01:19.388 --> 00:01:21.278
The clergy is tense

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:25.768
And an Inquisitor appeared just in time to
scare away the Venetian Missionary

00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:28.848
Industrial - that means there’ll be violence
soon

00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:30.778
Going to need some War Boats

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:33.028
And can’t let Culture be ignored

00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:35.688
The holy buildings bring all sorts of yields

00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:38.658
Margaret completed Macbeth - how ambitious

00:01:38.658 --> 00:01:42.058
The Public Schools can appreciate all the
Shakespeare we generate

00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:44.788
Maybe someone can write about Cathedrals,
or Monasteries

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:48.038
Just a World’s Fair aka the Hunger Games

00:01:48.038 --> 00:01:51.788
Stockholm is stock exchanging while Oslo needs
Walls and a Castle

00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:56.178
Picking Order and making Brazil discontent
would be the best idea

00:01:56.178 --> 00:01:59.058
Just install a conflicting World Ideology!

00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:00.168
Also Hotels help

00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:02.488
Be all we can be in the Armory

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.538
Oxford will teach us about Penicillin

00:02:04.538 --> 00:02:06.018
It’s free from the clinic

00:02:06.018 --> 00:02:09.928
This Brazilian Settler spends its spare time
in the Venetian sea

00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:12.538
Submarines can sink it if we go to war with
Brazil

00:02:12.538 --> 00:02:17.328
Or maybe we’ll go to war with Venice - if
the price is right - it wasn’t

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:21.378
No one wanted to see Venice get attacked so
I’m stuck dealing with the lack of smiles

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:23.578
There - the empire is alright

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:26.348
And Brazil is friendly - the Settler is safe

00:02:26.348 --> 00:02:29.298
Everyone else beware - we got Gatling Guns

00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:31.578
Sorry but that’d be the dumbest thing to
do ever

00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:33.538
The research is ready!

00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:37.258
Turns out there’s a bit of radioactive geology
- and Silver was banned

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:41.848
I’d feel bad for the Dutch since they traded
me Spices for Silver but their unique ability

00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:43.218
can handle it -

00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:45.968
You see, Siam got to the nearby Spice first

00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:48.417
Castles are upgraded next turn

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:50.698
Optimize the Tourism output

00:02:50.698 --> 00:02:52.458
Initialize more shared studies

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:56.278
It’s important to time the end of Rationalism
with the availability of Satellites

00:02:56.278 --> 00:02:58.478
And make sure there’s a Great Engineer for
the Hubble!

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.898
Only 4 turns remain until two Bill Nye the
Science Guys

00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:06.428
Utilized the Uranium but the world isn’t
aware yet - so many friends

00:03:06.428 --> 00:03:09.228
Now everyone is afraid, but Tourism continues
to grow

00:03:09.228 --> 00:03:11.728
Don’t be afraid of education!

00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:14.947
Do be afraid of Venetian athletes - they aren’t
human

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:17.878
Someone finally paid me to get belligerent
with Venice

00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:19.618
So drop a nuke on the Vatican

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:23.748
I’m not sure what he’s saying because
I can’t really read good but thank you

00:03:23.748 --> 00:03:28.307
National Visitor Center means we’ll need
a wall to shield tourists from the Vatican

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:32.038
He asked for a ceasefire, but he means gunfire

00:03:32.038 --> 00:03:33.447
Shots fired

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.848
Holy new city, Batman

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:39.368
Batman mentioned a new breakthrough at the
technology division of Wayne Enterprises

00:03:39.368 --> 00:03:44.038
Someone’s attacking Brazil and the Stock
Exchange still isn’t done in Stockholm

00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:46.307
Might as well launch our own assault

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:47.307
Whoosh

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:48.498
Glub Glub

00:03:48.498 --> 00:03:50.648
Might as well claim some of the new landmass

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:53.648
It’s too easy - and there’s a Stonehenge

00:03:53.648 --> 00:03:57.878
The druids were actually trying to build Stone-Venn-ge

00:03:57.878 --> 00:04:00.328
And now I see a disappointed face - moving
on

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:02.307
Brazil holds back on the conversion

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:03.848
But resistance is - not gonna work

00:04:03.848 --> 00:04:05.738
Honey, I shrunk Brazil

00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:09.138
Honey, I blew up and lost - not done yet though

00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:10.138
ONE MORE TURN

00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:12.958
Operation defend Scandinavia

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.617
First thing’s first: Citadel our way into
William’s Brazilian Deer - hit him where

00:04:16.617 --> 00:04:17.617
it hurts

00:04:17.617 --> 00:04:18.888
Then nuke the Venetians

00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:23.278
Yes, yes, William, Disney can rival Pixar
- let it go

00:04:23.278 --> 00:04:25.267
The XCOMs are ready to take over

00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:27.498
Did I mention everyone else is attacking?

00:04:27.498 --> 00:04:29.428
Seems I made some enemies

00:04:29.428 --> 00:04:31.478
The world slowly collapses

00:04:31.478 --> 00:04:33.258
There are a lot of angry boats

00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:34.658
Future tech won’t help

00:04:34.658 --> 00:04:36.288
There is hope for the others

00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:37.808
Sometimes the AI is a bully

00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:40.068
It’s equilibrium in action

00:04:40.068 --> 00:04:41.978
A lot of the land is on fire

00:04:41.978 --> 00:04:43.547
The villagers are fleeing

00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:44.748
Oslo goes to Wiliam

00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:47.228
Siam’s new home is Stockholm

00:04:47.228 --> 00:04:49.047
Our fate is undecided

00:04:49.047 --> 00:04:51.297
But we’ll be learnin’ a new language

00:04:51.297 --> 00:04:52.798
Any last wishes?

00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:54.288
Maybe we’ll order pizza?

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:56.288
If we pick it up we save the delivery fee

00:04:56.288 --> 00:04:59.678
Sorry just trying to ignore the fact our new
capital is Brazilian

00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:00.678
A smokey Brazil

00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:01.678
But Brazil nonetheless

00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:03.058
This world is on fire

00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:06.458
I keep on wondering when this will end

00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:09.608
Building a Shrine because it’s a puppet
and I have no control over it

00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:15.208
I could annex but why - the screen is fading
- it must be the end - thanks for watching!
