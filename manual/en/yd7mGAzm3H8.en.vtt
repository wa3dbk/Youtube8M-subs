Alright, in this clip we're going to talk
about how to check the sled over before you

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.160
start it up, because you don't want to get
out on the trail and have a loose nut or bolt

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.440
that you could have fixed right here in the
parking area. So we just kind of just do a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.880
walk-around first and just look at the general
condition of the sled. And you're just checking

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.970
to make sure everything looks tight. There's
no big dents or bent skis. Looks like everything's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.170
in order. You want to check the tension of
your track. So just kind of give a push on

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.940
here. It should be pretty tight. You can check
your owner's manual for the exact specifications

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.530
on it. Check the condition of the track while
you're down here to make sure that it's not

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.540
broken or if there's any big cuts that could
make the track fall off while you're riding.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.470
There's some adjuster nuts here to adjust
the track tension, and you can find out about

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.830
all that in the owner's manual for your snowmobile.
And if you rented one, these guys keep up

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.151
on their maintenance really well, so they'll
definitely have checked the track and everything

00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:10.850
over. But you still want to give a good walk-around,
just in case you see anything they might not

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.460
have noticed. Alright, you can go ahead and
lift the hood up. So we've already filled

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.760
our tank with gas. This engine is a two-stroke
motor, so it also burns oil, because it doesn't

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.730
have any oil like your car does down in the
bottom of the crankcase. So, we got our oil

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.950
here. Make sure that's good and topped off,
because if you run out of oil, then your engine's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.870
going to quit. It's water-cooled, so we have
a reservoir here for the water. And just kind

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.950
of make sure that the reservoir has water
in it, or coolant. There's an on and off switch

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.229
for the fuel, so in storing and trailering,
we turn the switch to off so the fuel doesn't

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.670
fill up the carburetor's. So we want to turn
that on and just give a quick look around.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.140
Make sure the brake -- looks like it works
good. The pull starter: the cord looks like

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.170
it's in good condition. So this is where the
drive belt is housed. I talked about having

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.130
a spare belt earlier. Here's the belt here,
and we can just check the condition of the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.420
belt.
