00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.740
Searching article databases is a great way to do research

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.689
but like any new experience it can be intimidating and confusing at first

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.500
by learning a few simple tips and search strategies

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.890
you can be a capable searcher in no time. 
That's easy for you to say

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.410
you're a librarian. what if I don't even know
what a database is?

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.809
No worries. If you've ever searched Facebook
for your friends

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.430
or typed a search in Google, you've used the basics of database and keyword searching

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.660
okay well that doesn't sound so hard. So
what database is THIS?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.210
For this tutorial we'll be using  the EBSCO Host Database Academic Search Premier

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.069
this is a general subject database that 
can be a

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.969
great place to start your research

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.370
the researching tips and tricks that you learn in this database will apply directly to other EBSCO databases

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.539
and they're often similar to to databases by other vendors

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.520
so this will be almost identical to
other databases on EBSCO interfaces

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.850
like Business Source Premier and CINAHL
and professional development collection

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.190
and I can apply these general search
strategies to databases and other

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.080
interfaces?

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.390
that's really great!   That's right.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.280
Let's get started. To begin a search type a word or subject

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.300
into the open search box.  what does that "select a field" mean in the other box?

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.840
Good question. if you left that box alone and just hit search.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.930
the database will search the
entire full text or citation of each

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.150
record in the database

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.410
for the word or subject you just entered into the search box to the left

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.230
however if you click on the drop-down
arrow

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.750
you'll notice that there are many choices. if you pick one of these choices

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.220
it will narrow the search to just the area of
the record

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.730
I really like the title field option because
it will look for your keywords

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.660
in the title of articles articles which produces a really specific result

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.940
Wooh, hold up a minute. let me get this
straight

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.229
so let's am doing a research paper on
children's poetry

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.640
I type children's poetry and found 2700
results

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.670
what if I do the same search and select Title
field

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.150
that's just gonna search the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.270
words in the title and now I only get 99
results

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.140
I get a much more manageable list and
they seem a lot more relevant

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.600
exactly!

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.600
and you can do the same with other field selectors.  Another good one to use is

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.050
subject terms

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.150
because this one will then search only
in a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.310
small section of the article citation where

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.319
EBSCO librarians have categorized every
article choosing subject terms will produce

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.840
 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.300
a smaller number of articles but likely a more accurate list

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.410
other choices include

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.510
author if you already know the name of the author who's work you would like to find

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.640
or journal name, if you're only interested in articles

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.390
published in a specific journal or magazine.   You know, I've tried searching databases

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.140
before and it always seems like I'm
getting thousands of results

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.099
or nothing at all.  it's so frustrating.
It happens to all of us.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.140
even librarians and we went to school for this kind of thing.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.490
Often times the first search terms you enter will not give you the perfect results list.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.890
You may want to make your search a bit
more specific to your needs.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.980
Try using the "and" "or" or "not" functions. Back up the search boxes

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.330
you can narrow your results by using "and"
This will produce

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.360
only citations that include both criteria.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.230
for example if you want to find articles 
about children's poetry

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.810
you can search poetry and children

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.120
this will produce a list of which every article mentions

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.930
both poetry and children which makes it more likely that the article is

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.720
actually about children's poetry.
Ok, so if I want to get less results

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.709
I can use "and" and add more terms to make
my search more specific

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.440
but what if I want more results because
I'm not getting enough.  If you aren't getting

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.500
enough results

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.470
you could try using the "or" function. using
the example of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.780
children's poetry you could type in children

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.240
or poetry. Now the results will show
articles that mention

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.449
only poetry, articles that mention
only children

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.669
and articles that mention poetry

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.270
and mention children. The "not"

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.300
function is used when you want to include a certain term

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.570
or subject from your list. For example,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.650
if you're looking for articles about
poetry but are not interested in

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.630
articles about children's poetry

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.840
you could search poetry not

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.600
children this will search the database
for

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.750
all articles that mention poetry and then

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.020
exclude any articles that also mention
children

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.139
Oh, it sounds like using the "and" "or" and
"not"

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.230
in combination with the select a field
options

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.220
can help me produce a more accurate
search result

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.970
okay I think I can do this. it wasn't as
bad as I thought

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.260
now I don't suppose you have a tutorial
that actually writes the papers for

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.580
students do you?

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.830
Nice try. But at least with the research underway you're halfway there.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.320
