00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.820
it is time for new brunswick to move to
a single license plate.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.490
if you buy a new or used vehicle from a
neighbouring province, it is often

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.530
difficult or impossible to bolt a
license plate onto the front.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.070
numerous new automobiles are designed
without mounts for a front plate.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.779
many drivers are fined and forced to drill
holes and find places to put a plate,

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.869
which is often less than ideal.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.150
in nova scotia and you can enjoy the
same car without a plate on the front.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.180
3 territories and 6 provinces have
already phased out front license plates.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.800
this leaves only four provinces
remaining with obsolete front plates.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.620
Alberta phased out their front license
plates in 1991 to save money.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.310
Ontario could save three million dollars
per year if they go with the single plate.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.670
Saskatchewan has reportedly saved
$370,000 per year,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.550
since they dropped dual license
plates in 2004.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.360
New Brunswick should follow the example
of atlantic provinces like Newfoundland

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.380
and eliminate the front plate.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.079
This change could allow the government
put hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.140
each year into more important areas like
education or health care.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.350
there are hundreds of better things for
the police to watch for.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.280
one example related to plates is the arming number of vehicles driving around

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280
our province with no plates!

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.200
people drive for a long distances with
no plates at all on their vehicle.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.050
instead a police ticketing our hard
working citizens who do not display a front plate.

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.789
we could take a hard look at people who
drive without any plates,

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.610
drive unregistered vehicles and drive illegally
on public roads.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.270
it is also likely that some of these
people who drive including vehicles do

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.810
not have insurance.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.409
we see businesses driving vehicles
without plates. new vehicle purchases and

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.530
car dealers frequently letting customers
test drive without plates.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.790
drivers without plates can get away with
speeding, reckless driving, and other offenses.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.950
There is usually no way to
trace the driver of an unplated vehicle.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.080
often we hear that the are RCMP are the
main supporter of front plates.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.619
but New Brunswick has lower crime than numerous other regions of canada.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.049
The RCMP get their job done all
across Canada without front plates.

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.049
We know they can do it here too. It is
time for new brunswick to modernize and

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.999
drop the front license plate.

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.819
please show your support by forwarding
this video.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.139
Writing to your MLA.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.429
or take the front plate off your vehicle.

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:24.389
You can already see tens of thousands of
New Brunswickers without front plates

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.379
on our highways each day.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.520
They make a statement

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.739
loud and clear.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.769
That they do not want a front licence plate.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.389
please view our other videos on motor
vehicle inspections.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.649
Front Plates

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:38.109
Winter Tire laws

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.259
and puttint temporary registration permits
on the rear of vehicles.
