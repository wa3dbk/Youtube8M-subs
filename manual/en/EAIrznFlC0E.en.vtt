00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:20.080
Alright, Today I've got a nice easy one for
you.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.480
Got some blind stems out of step here.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.300
All you have got to do is grasp this and turn
it.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.600
If you can't get a good handle on it what
you can do is pop the slat out.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.340
Than use a pair of pliers to turn it.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.070
Here I got two more.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.950
Usually I find I can get it but I will show
you how to do it with the pliers here on this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.950
one.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.079
Lift up on the back tab.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.219
By usually using the thumb and grab it with
a pair of pliers.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.219
Pop it over.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.469
Now I can reset the slat and test it out.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:13.610
Check for our full rotation.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.980
Beautiful.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:58.210
And we are all set there.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:14.390
Good to go.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:34.010
