00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.980
Red eye’d girl

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.660
The room’s dark but the smell of blood

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.100
Oozing, an open cut

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.440
Slowly the window opens a little more

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.740
Shred faith ’til you’re…

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.920
Why she lives, she doesn’t know yet

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.000
Don’t know why, forever waiting

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.160
So then she trapped herself deep in this castle her home

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.680
Dyed in the blood that flows, flows still in me

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.260
So there she sleeps peaceful where I can’t see

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.640
See petals twirling, long lost dreams

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.120
That float upon the water’s surface in a gentle stream

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.740
Childish hopes for someone there for me

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.460
Basking within a lonely light

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.660
Songbird, you have lost your only song

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.720
Waiting for something took you far too long

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.840
These small hands bare no stain

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.880
Walking over corpses in the rain

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.600
Wake up, it’s time

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.560
The ticking clock announces the start

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.200
That person from my dreams comes closer

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.480
I’m scared but nowhere to run

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.420
In a vortex of pure light

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.400
I don’t know what’s wrong or right

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.800
Feel my blood is aching, throbbing again

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.220
See petals twirling, long lost dreams

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.740
That float upon the water’s surface in a gentle stream

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.300
Childish hopes for someone there for me

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.980
Basking within a lonely light

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.160
Songbird, you have lost your only song

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.300
Waiting for something took you far too long

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.500
These small hands bare no stain

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.840
In the rain

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.820
As long as you’re here

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.300
I don’t need a thing

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.620
You, I believed in

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.040
You were my everything

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.380
But soon the window opened up

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.440
And what I saw won’t leave me

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.900
Perhaps there is more out there… for me

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.520
Please let me go

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.300
You’re to blame for my wish

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.720
‘Cause you taught me how to be human

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.360
See petals twirling, long lost dreams

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.820
That float upon the water’s surface in a gentle stream

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.240
Childish hopes for someone there for me

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.080
Basking within a lonely light

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.220
Songbird, you have lost your only song

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.420
Waiting for something took you far too long (far too long)

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.500
These small hands bare no stain

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.060
Walking over corpses in the rain
