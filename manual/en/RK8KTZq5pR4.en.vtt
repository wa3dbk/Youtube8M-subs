00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.450
So there's that, there's our vanishing point
there. So we see the top again, we've moved

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.370
below the horizon line again so we see the
top, and we move that up there. And here,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.720
I'll color in the top again so that you can
kind of keep track, there's that. Okay, so

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:35.980
we've moved around and now we see the side
again, and here's the vanishing point, there.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.749
And now I see a lot of the top, because I'm
a lot farther from the horizon line, so I'm

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:48.269
seeing far more of the top. I'm close to the
vanishing point though, so I'm not seeing

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.550
a whole lot of the side, I see a lot more
of it there, and I don't see it there. Okay,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:04.770
we're going to go over here, here's my top.
So you notice this is going this way, so I

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.040
don't really see too much of this at all,
I see just a little sliver of that and I see

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.740
basically my top and my front there. So there's
that. So we've gone from here, here, here,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.329
nothing there, and then we're getting a lot
here. Then if we go over here, what's going

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:35.920
to happen? I'm going to start seeing the bottom
of the box. So I'm going to see the bottom

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:46.520
sort of going, and maybe this side. So I see
a bottom here instead of seeing the top, I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.780
won't see the top anymore. Okay, we've got
a side again because it's in front of us kind

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.719
of like that box, but now we see the bottom
edge and we see this. So instead of seeing

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:12.380
the top up here, we see the bottom here. So
these are both in sort of the same place in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.970
that we see the front, but we see the bottom
there, we see the top there.
