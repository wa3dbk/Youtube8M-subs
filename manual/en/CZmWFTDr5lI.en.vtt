00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.310
Real life can be tough.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.880
With family and work not living up to your
hopes and dreams, life can be a difficult

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.950
time.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.440
But you can always escape these problems and
live the life you have always dreamed of with

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.300
The Sims 3 Pets.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.900
Don’t have the family you want in real life,
then make a new virtual family that will obey

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900
your every wish.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.950
The Sims has always been one of the most popular
franchises because its simple premise can

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.720
be enjoyed by practically everyone.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.100
You can recreate yourself and live another
life, only this time with chirpy background

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:22.780
music.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.009
And while this experience is mostly enjoyed
on PC, consoles have been given their own

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.980
versions of the games, be it a less version
and is more difficult to control.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.310
A controller will never give the same control
that a mouse and keyboard does.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.610
But that doesn’t mean that this game doesn’t
provide a good time.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.800
Just like in the PC version this is a life
simulator.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.899
You design your Sim, and give all the qualities
that describes yourself or all the qualities

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.170
you wish described yourself.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.400
The character creation gives you many options
and your are able to make your Sim look anyway

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400
you want.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:06.970
I’m going to make mine look like Derek,
so that he listens to my every command.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.170
After you settle on an appearance you have
to give them a personality.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.000
Remember, even in the Sims world, if you don’t
have the looks you can still make up for it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.030
with a great personality.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.560
You pick which traits you want them to have
and also what are their lifetime wishes.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.720
This will determine the future of your Sim.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.530
Is your Sim going to want to be a world renown
journalist or is your destiny to be a professional

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.530
athlete?

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.470
This is where that is decided.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.950
And because this is Sims 3 Pets, you are also
given the opportunity to create your own man’s

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.520
best friend, or the family cat.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.110
There is basically every breed you could want,
from German Shepard to Corgis.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.500
I wonder what those mixed together would look
like?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.950
After you have your family and your home,
you live your lives.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.030
You will need to find a job, make friends,
and watch over your Sims as they go through

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.780
life.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.810
The controls on console feel very awkward
to work with at first and will leave your

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.520
wishing for a mouse.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.960
But after you play a little, and become use
to them, they will start to feel natural.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.240
This is coming from having played The Sims
on PC first, but if you have only played on

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.870
consoles then they will feel fine right from
the beginning.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.390
One thing that I don’t like about the game,
is that every time you give your Sim a command,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.840
the game pauses while you select your decision.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.740
I understand this is to help with the console
controls and is not that much of a bother,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.620
but it does interrupt the flow of the game.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.290
Also there are some pretty decent loading
times when you leave areas.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.650
Again, not deal breakers but long enough to
be a bother.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.400
The city of the Sims is big, with tons of
different things for your Sims to do.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.920
You can have them go fishing or to the bookstore.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.520
And with online, you can download things and
designs created by other users.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.900
This goes on to make you feel like just one
family in a much bigger city.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.170
You are in control of these virtual lives,
with countless ways to have them live their

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.310
lives.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.590
Will have them make a family and raise their
children through the generations or will you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.720
lock them in a house and burn it down around
them.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:28.759
These are your Sims, and your decisions.
