00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.867
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody.

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:06.333
Happy St. Patrick's Day.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.967
Green tie, not bad, huh?

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.300
Conrad didn't get the memo.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.734
You didn't, either.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:15.767
Good morning.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.900
With the budget committees hard
at work this week, I wanted to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.633
meet with Chairman Conrad and
Chairman Spratt to talk about

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:26.533
the progress they're making
on this budget resolution.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.400
Because these are no ordinary
times, I don't just view this

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.600
budget document as numbers on
a page or a laundry list of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.867
programs.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:39.367
I see it as a economic blueprint
for our future -- a foundation

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:42.834
on which to build a
recovery that lasts.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:46.066
Now, this budget does not
attempt to solve every problem

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.166
or address every issue.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:52.233
Because of the massive deficit
we inherited and the enormous

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:57.633
costs of this financial crisis,
we have made some tough choices

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.533
that will cut our deficit in
half by the end of my first term

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:04.233
and reduce it by $2 trillion
over the next decade.

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:07.166
That will bring discretionary
spending for domestic programs

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.934
as a share of the economy to its
lowest level in nearly half a

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:12.734
century.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:16.433
What we will not cut back,
however, are those investments

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:19.800
that are directly linked to
our long-term prosperity.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.233
As I said last week, we can't go
back to a bubble economy -- an

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:28.033
economy based on reckless
speculation and spending beyond

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:33.500
our means; on bad credit and
inflated home prices; and some

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.967
of the shenanigans that have
been taking place on Wall

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.433
Street.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:43.000
Such activity does not lead to
the creation of lasting wealth.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.133
It leads to the illusion of
prosperity and, as we're finding

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:50.200
out, it hurts us all in the end.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.633
And that's why this budget makes
the investments that will lead

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:56.066
to real growth and real
prosperity -- investments that

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.033
will make a difference in the
lives of this generation and

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:03.300
future generations because
it makes us more productive.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.166
Because so many Americans are
just one illness or medical

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.700
emergency away from bankruptcy,
we have made a historic

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.133
commitment to health care reform
in this budget -- reform that

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.500
will finally lower costs for
families, businesses, and state

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.533
governments; reform that's not
a luxury, but a necessity if we

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:23.734
hope to bring down the cost of
Medicare and Medicaid so that we

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:26.867
can reduce our deficit
in the long run.

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:30.600
And this is a fight that Kent
Conrad and John Spratt have been

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.233
fighting for a long time.

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:35.066
The two gentlemen standing with
me today, they've been leaders

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.467
in efforts to get these
entitlement programs under

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:40.900
control, and they understand
that if we don't solve the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.934
problem of health care costs
now, we are not going to be able

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:47.266
to get a handle on
entitlements down the road.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:49.934
Because we know that the
countries who out-educate us

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:53.367
today will out-compete us
tomorrow, this budget also

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:56.834
invests in a complete and
competitive education for every

00:02:56.834 --> 00:03:00.800
American -- in early childhood
education programs that work; in

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.867
high standards and
accountability for our schools;

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:08.767
in rewards for teachers who
succeed; and an affordable

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:11.633
college education for
anyone who wants to go.

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:13.800
That's the reason the three of
us are standing here today.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.233
None of us were born with a
silver spoon in our mouths --

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:20.100
but we got a great education.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.166
And if we combine additional
resources with a commitment to

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.834
reform, then I think we can
deliver that for every American

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.500
child.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.867
Because we know that the new
jobs and new industries of

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:37.266
tomorrow will involve harnessing
renewable resources -- renewable

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.500
sources of energy, this
budget will finally spark the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.600
transformation we need to create
those jobs and those businesses

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.367
right here in America.

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:48.066
It makes clean energy the
profitable kind of energy, and

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:51.934
it invests in technologies like
wind power and solar power;

00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:57.033
advanced biofuels, clean coal,
fuel-efficient cars and trucks.

00:03:57.033 --> 00:03:59.700
And because millions of
Americans are already struggling

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.834
under the weight of their
monthly bills and mortgage

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:06.166
payments, this budget does not
raise the taxes of any family

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:10.934
making less than $250,000
a year by a single dime.

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:13.900
In fact, 95 percent of all
working families will receive a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.300
tax cut as a result
of our recovery plan.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.500
Now, there are those who say the
plans in this budget are too

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.600
ambitious to enact; to say that
-- they say that in the face of

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.467
challenges that we face, we
should be trying to do less,

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:36.033
than more.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:38.867
What I say is that the
challenges we face are too large

00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:40.500
to ignore.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.667
The cost of our health
care is too high to ignore.

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:47.033
The dependence on oil is
too dangerous to ignore.

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:51.400
Our education deficit is
growing too wide to ignore.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.100
To kick these problems down the
road for another four years or

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.300
another eight years would
be to continue the same

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.066
irresponsibility that
led us to this point.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.433
That's not why I
ran for this office.

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:05.367
I didn't come here to pass
on our problems to the next

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:09.333
President or the next generation
-- I came here to solve them.

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:12.000
I know that there are some on
Wall Street and in Washington

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.567
who've said that we should only
focus on the banking crisis and

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:16.667
one problem at a time.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.433
Well, we're spending a lot of
time focusing on this banking

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:23.934
crisis, and we will continue
to do so because until we get

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.734
liquidity flowing again,
we will not fully recover.

00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:29.867
But the American people don't
have the luxury of just focusing

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:31.900
on Wall Street.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.600
They don't have the luxury of
choosing to pay either their

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.867
mortgage or their medical bills.

00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:40.467
They don't get to pick between
paying for their kids' college

00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:43.100
tuition and saving enough
money for retirement.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.166
They have to do
all these things.

00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:48.100
They have to confront
all these problems.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.100
And as a consequence, so do we.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.000
Now, there's been a lot of
discussion about this budget

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.367
already, and I hope we engage in
a healthy debate going forward.

00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:01.333
The challenges we
face are not partisan.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:06.066
We're going to get some numbers
with respect to the budget that

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:13.900
may make this even tougher in
the coming couple of weeks.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.667
The answers don't have to be
partisan, and I welcome and

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:21.233
encourage proposals and
improvements from both Democrats

00:06:21.233 --> 00:06:23.333
and Republicans in
the coming days.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:26.934
But the one thing I will say is
this: With the magnitude of the

00:06:26.934 --> 00:06:30.700
challenges we face right now,
what we need in Washington are

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.300
not more political tactics
-- we need more good ideas.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.000
We don't need more point-scoring
-- we need more problem-solving.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.367
So if there are members of
Congress who object to specific

00:06:42.367 --> 00:06:45.567
policies and proposals in this
budget, then I ask them to be

00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:48.900
ready and willing to propose
constructive, alternative

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.867
solutions.

00:06:51.867 --> 00:06:55.433
If certain aspects of this
budget people don't think work,

00:06:55.433 --> 00:07:00.166
provide us some ideas
in terms of what you do.

00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:03.633
"Just say no" is the right
advice to give your teenagers

00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:04.667
about drugs.

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:07.900
It is not an acceptable response
to whatever economic policy is

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.233
proposed by the other party.

00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:14.266
The American people sent
us here to get things done.

00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:17.066
And in this moment of enormous
challenge, they are watching and

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:19.133
waiting for us to lead.

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:22.166
Let's show them that we're
equal to this task before us.

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:25.233
Let's pass a budget that puts
this nation on the road to

00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:26.667
lasting prosperity.

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:29.667
I know Kent Conrad is committed
to doing that; John Spratt is

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:31.600
committed to doing that; I'm
committed to doing that.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.266
We're going to need everybody
working together to get this

00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:34.667
thing done.

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:35.200
All right?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.200
Thank you, everybody.
