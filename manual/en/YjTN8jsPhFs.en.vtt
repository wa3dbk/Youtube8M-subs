00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.726
As a first step we will define the structural grid for the building.

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.293
Let’s select “Design,

00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:13.092
Grid System...” from the menu.

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:20.444
The ArchiCAD Grid System makes it really easy to define complex column-beam grids for your design.

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:25.668
The grid includes not only just the 3D model elements but also the grid lines,

00:00:25.668 --> 00:00:31.131
numberings and other annotation elements needed in Floor Plan, section and 3D views.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:36.252
A dialog box comes up where we can determine what the grid should look like.

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:41.317
Display the Grid Positions panel of the Grid System Setting Dialog.

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:46.388
The “Grid positions” panel deals with the basic geometry of the grid.

00:00:46.388 --> 00:00:52.316
Here we can add and remove horizontal and vertical grid lines specifying the distance between them.

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:57.499
Certainly the distances don’t have to be uniform between grid lines

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.923
Click once to select the first horizontal grid line in the list on the left.

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:06.482
Click the Minus sign to delete all additional grid lines.

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:12.073
Now click the Plus sign once to add a new horizontal grid line

00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:14.425
and enter “6000” for distance.

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:20.593
Now click the plus sign 5 more times to create additional grind lines

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:24.641
We need 7 horizontal grid lines altogether.

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:30.464
Now select the first vertical grid line and delete all the other entries.

00:01:30.464 --> 00:01:35.161
Add a new grid line and enter 6000 for the distance.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:39.337
Finally add new vertical grid lines.

00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:42.914
We need 12 vertical grid lines altogether.

00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:47.578
The distance between the grid line axes is 6000 mm

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:51.916
Open the “General settings” panel.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:56.499
This determines how the grid will be displayed on the Floor Plan and in sections.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:01.819
Here you can also define which other elements should be placed together with the grid.

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.875
Here, we opt to place a column at each grid intersection.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.843
Checkmark the “Elements at grid line intersection” option.

00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:13.715
Make sure that “Column” is selected,

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:18.050
and finally click “Settings” to open the Column default Settings dialog,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.274
to modify the properties of the columns to be placed.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.450
Display the “Geometry and Positioning” panel.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.362
Set the Column Top  to “1st Story, Home +1”.

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:35.235
Enter -200 mm for the top offset to top linked story value.

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:41.406
Enter 300 mm for the core dimensions of the column.

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:48.285
Make sure that “Reinforced Concrete, Structural” is set for material.

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:52.340
Display the “Floor Plan and Section” panel,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.826
and make sure that the “Floor Plan Display”,

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:59.921
Show On Stories option is set to “All Relevant Stories”.

00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:05.369
Finally click OK to close this dialog.

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:09.913
Also it’s nice to have the grid line dimensions placed automatically,

00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:12.328
so that we don’t have to deal with them later.

00:03:12.328 --> 00:03:15.638
To place the dimension lines automatically,

00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:20.046
check the “Dimension Lines” check box in the Grid System Settings dialog.

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:24.406
Display the “Grid Elements” panel.

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:30.670
Here we can set the line type of the Grid on Floor Plan, Section and Elevation as well as in 3D Views.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.062
Click “Grid Element Settings...” to display the corresponding dialog.

00:03:37.062 --> 00:03:41.327
Select “Dot &amp; Dashed” line type on the Floor Plan panel.

00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:49.104
Display the Section and Elevation panel and select the Dot and Dashed line type there too.

00:03:53.423 --> 00:03:57.366
Click “OK” to close this dialog.

00:03:57.366 --> 00:04:01.990
Click OK once more to close the Grid System Settings dialog as well.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:09.345
ArchiCAD will prompt that the layer we are about to use is locked, so click “Unlock Layer” to unlock it.

00:04:09.345 --> 00:04:14.680
As you move the cursor around, a preview of the grid system follows it.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.720
Let’s click twice on the project origin to place the grid.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.487
The grid system is placed instantly.

00:04:22.487 --> 00:04:25.895
Zoom out if necessary.

00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:32.346
Select any of the grid elements and note the entire grid system will be selected.

00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:36.834
Open the Grid Element settings dialog box.

00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:45.938
Open the Grid Element settings dialog box.

00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:48.827
 Click OK.

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:53.453
Let’s view the grid system in 3D.

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:59.622
Click on the “View, … Editing Plane Display” menu item

00:04:59.622 --> 00:05:04.518
in order to see the editing plane in the 3D window in case it is not yet visible.

00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:08.477
Now we will remove the unnecessary columns from the grid.

00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:11.373
Return to the Floor Plan view.

00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:16.750
Select the Marquee tool in the Toolbox.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.206
Define an area around the left six columns of the top row.

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:26.582
Activate the Column tool in the Tool box.

00:05:26.582 --> 00:05:31.853
Select all columns within the Marquee by activating the  “Edit, Select All Columns”

00:05:31.853 --> 00:05:32.853
 

00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:36.397
or use the equivalent keyboard shortcut.

00:05:36.397 --> 00:05:41.523
Delete the selected elements with the “Backspace” key.

00:05:44.434 --> 00:05:49.058
Please note, that you can lock grid and dimension layers.

00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:52.946
Select the Grid element,

00:05:52.946 --> 00:05:58.547
and then activate the “layers, … Lock layer” option from the context menu.

00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:03.818
This way, you can select columns using the normal selection method and delete them.

00:06:03.818 --> 00:06:10.778
Select the Marquee tool again and define a new area around the right six columns of the bottom row.

00:06:10.778 --> 00:06:16.686
Select all columns in the Marquee and delete them, as described above.

00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:21.069
Press “Escape” once to remove the marquee area.

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:28.101
If you locked the Grid and Dimensions layer earlier, please do not forget to unlock these after deleting the columns.

00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:35.716
We have to resize the inner columns to 500x500 mm.

00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:40.204
To select these columns quickly, use the Marquee Tool again

00:06:40.204 --> 00:06:44.051
and set the “Geometry Method” to Polygonal in the Info box.

00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:48.171
 Draw a Marquee area as presented on the screen.

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:55.419
Select all columns in the Marquee by activating the Column tool

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.410
and then the “Edit, Select all columns” option.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:07.656
Open the Column Selection Settings dialog and open the Geometry and Positioning page.

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:13.925
Modify the size of column from 300 mm to 500 mm.

00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:21.525
Change the heights of the columns to be linked to the 21st Story.

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:30.071
Make sure that the top offset value is set to -200.

00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:34.519
Click OK to close this dialog.

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:38.847
These columns will be seen on all relevant stories automatically.

00:07:38.847 --> 00:07:39.847
