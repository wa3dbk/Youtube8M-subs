Hello, my name is Nicole Valentine and on
behalf of Expert Village, I'm here to talk

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.000
to you about how to coordinate birthday games
for a birthday party. Now we're going to discuss

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.929
another birthday game and this one also happens
to be an oldie but goodie. And this game is

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:26.949
called connect the dot. This is a perfect
game if you want the kids in your birthday

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.820
party to kind of calm down. Let's say after
they've eaten, or even the birthday cake.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:49.730
But you want to draw about 4 lines of dots
containing 5 dots a piece in each line like

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.899
so. You can easily use a white board if you
have one at home. If not first use a poster

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:07.460
board and you can hang it on your wall. Just
be creative and use whatever you have at home.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.960
Now with another color marker I am going to
be the first person to participate in this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.320
game. I'm going to choose to connect the dot.
Let's say I choose from here to here. The

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:31.320
goal is to try to make a box. So another party
guest will take the marker and let's say they

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.170
want to connect the dot from here to here.
And you continue this pattern until eventually

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:53.910
there won't be that many more dots to connect.
The person that actually makes a square with

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:05.200
the dots, that person gets to put their initial
in that box. And if you would like to make

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.950
this into a team competition game, you can
give two teams a name, red team, blue team.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:21.500
So when a team connects the dot, they can
put their name and the team that has the most

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.890
squares at the end is of course the winner.
