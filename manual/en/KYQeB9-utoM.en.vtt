00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:05.490
so i thought it was uh... yesterday

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.739
uh... it was reported that a u_s_ army
sergeant

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.320
killed at least sixteen civilians

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.670
nine of whom were children

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.399
in a part of uh... southern afghanistan
the story

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.359
there are there are conflicting reports
as to how many people are involved in

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.260
this

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.260
the official story is that this one army
sergeant who was part of a uh...

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.190
specific unit

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.460
which uh...

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.870
functioned to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.760
organize local police units in track
down taliban

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.520
in the uh... southern part of
afghanistan

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.610
left his base in the middle of the night

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.560
i guess traveled a mile

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.030
and then start banging on doors in a
local village in just shooting up people

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.870
and then grab them

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.870
uh... once they were dead and attempted
to burn a bunch of them

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.190
talking about nine of the children and
four of them uh... girls younger than

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.820
six

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.140
he and has been uh... deployed to
afganistan iraq at least at one other

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.800
time in the past as there's obviously

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.360
and mixed information

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.290
there are reports that multiple
witnesses

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.340
though not the preponderance of
witnesses at least according to the new

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.840
york times in the a_p_

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.170
said that they sell out

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.729
other

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.040
soldiers

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.100
now it's unclear whether not they saw
other soldiers who came in after the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.040
fact

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.440
uh... or during it but

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.560
it does seem uh...

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.410
search trash the imagination slightly

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.520
that this guy was able to uh... lease
duke

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.930
kill people and then attempt to work
gather them together

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.520
to burn them

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.420
uh... it's unclear

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.299
but one of the most disturbing things
that

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.570
struck me in reading this story

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.959
because we're going to hear

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.959
how this loan uh... gunmen was crazy how
he uh... lost control of himself

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:25.150
how this is not indicative of anything

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.439
new york times reports the killings came
two days after an episode in the cap

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.770
he's a province

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.870
in the eastern afghanistan and which
nato helicopters apparently hunting

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.479
taliban insurgents

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:43.479
fired on civilians killing foreign
wounding another three

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.459
this is gone going in afghanistan

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.239
and the idea that it's one lone gunmen
who did this

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.009
one uh...

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.969
soldier who went crazy with did this

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.299
is the problem is completely
understating and under selling what the

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.160
problem is

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.479
the promise that we are constantly

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.079
on a weekly if not daily basis

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.009
killing civilians in this country

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.640
and nobody can really explained

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.829
why

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.829
what it is that we're supposed to be
doing there

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.419
you know we have that moment where the
country could uh... rejoice those who

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.829
wanted to uh... in the killing of osama
bin laden well where's the dividends for

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:39.599
that

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.019
if we're going to uh...

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.659
it's bad enough that we have to reduce
uh... this country um...

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.039
in terms of its moral stature

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:54.949
from uh... where was when he could
actually tried

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.189
crimes against humanity

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.149
to now where we just simply assassinate
people

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:06.339
door targeted killing actions

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:11.039
uh... but why couldn't we use that event
as a

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:14.669
reason to get out of a quagmire where
all we seem to be doing

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.699
is uh...

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.249
treading water at the expense of
innocence about it

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:26.020
it's really just a horrible horrible
shame

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.529
and uh...

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.230
hopefully we will get an excellent
repair

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.270
sooner rather than later

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.729
you know for those who suggest that
there is

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.349
a uh...

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.300
presidential candidate

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.539
who is going to be more apt to get out
of afghanistan uh... an active candidate

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.199
is uh... mit romney i would tend to
disagree

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.590
we just

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.759
in this country don't have

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.790
popular designer

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.439
that is manifested anyways

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.800
to stop killing civilians

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.729
that's just the reality
