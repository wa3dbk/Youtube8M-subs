00:00:01.223 --> 00:00:04.776
- What's up guys? Welcome
to Monday, day 1,095.

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:06.145
Kids just got home from school

00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:09.082
and Bryce had some big news to tell me,

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:10.523
and the only reason why
I'm pulling the camera,

00:00:10.523 --> 00:00:11.625
he didn't want me to pull the camera out.

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.182
But the only reason I'm pulling the camera

00:00:13.182 --> 00:00:14.957
out is because I want
this marked in history.

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:16.582
Which is part of the reason why we Vlog.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.499
Is because we look back
at this a year from now,

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.961
two years from now, three years from now,

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.978
this was the day that Bryce got his first

00:00:23.978 --> 00:00:26.551
kiss from a girl, aw.

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:27.201
- [Mason] Aw.

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:30.016
- Hey it's awesome, he's so embarrassed .

00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:31.036
I don't know why he's embarrassed.

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:31.860
I told him I didn't get my first kiss

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.822
until I was in third grade,
he beat me by a year.

00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:36.202
But now apparently a girl
kissed him on the cheek.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.178
Tell us the story, come here.

00:00:37.178 --> 00:00:39.116
Alright, so Bryce is a little embarrassed.

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:40.718
He's afraid that people are going to

00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:42.657
laugh at him because a girl kissed him,

00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:44.375
but I keep telling him, no
one going to laugh at you.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:46.001
Like, they're all going to
think it's cute and adorable.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.913
Like I said I was in third
grade when I got my first kiss.

00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:51.759
I had girlfriend in third grade.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:53.535
You're in second grade, so you beat me.

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.557
You're better than me, that's the

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:55.381
way it's supposed to be.

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.635
Your son's always supposed
to be better than you.

00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:57.796
No, tell me how, tell me what happened.

00:00:57.796 --> 00:00:59.487
Were you guys on the
playground just playing?

00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.460
And she just like ran
up to you and kissed you

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.247
or did she tell you
she was going to do it?

00:01:03.247 --> 00:01:04.165
How did it happen?

00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:05.627
- She just ran up to me.

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:07.206
- She just ran up to you
and kissed you on the cheek?

00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:08.739
Yeah? It's totally, I was telling Bryce,

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:12.884
it's totally natural for
girls to kiss cute boys.

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:14.416
Because they think he's
cute, so that's a good thing.

00:01:14.416 --> 00:01:16.784
They think he's a cute boy, right?

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:18.282
That's what it means.

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:19.862
They think that he's a cute boy so

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:21.418
they want to give him a kiss, it happens.

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:23.980
It's going to keep
happening his entire life.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.468
Okay guys, so we are out of the house.

00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:29.337
I have Mason with us, he's hanging out

00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:31.950
for a few hours while his mom and dad work

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.404
before what, what do you gotta do tonight?

00:01:33.404 --> 00:01:34.924
- Um, baseball practice.

00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:35.828
- You got baseball practice pretty much

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:36.909
every night, don't you?

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.883
Yeah, if you're not up-to-date

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:41.680
on TheBevos vlogs, he's
on two baseball teams.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.197
He's on the, surprise,
normal league like Bryce is

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:46.334
but he's also on a club team.

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:50.117
So he's got practice twice
a week for both teams.

00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:52.533
Then he's got a game and/or
a tournament every week.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.355
So kid's like, hard core baseball.

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:55.692
This might be the definitive year where he

00:01:55.692 --> 00:01:58.292
splits and only does
baseball, I don't know.

00:01:58.292 --> 00:02:00.136
Anyways, we're here at Home Depot cause

00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:01.379
once again I'm looking at curtains.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:04.619
It is getting hot, hot in my room

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.616
and so I really need to
get some block-out curtains

00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:08.415
and block out the heat
coming from that window.

00:02:08.415 --> 00:02:10.171
Also, while I'm here I
thought I'd look at some fans.

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.771
Maybe some oscillating,
like ones with the filters

00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:15.628
built into them cause my
room's a little dusty too.

00:02:15.628 --> 00:02:17.566
And, I have to say, Home Depot definitely

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:19.865
has the better selection and they have it

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:21.409
in my size so now I
just have to figure out

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.825
which pattern to go with.

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:24.288
Unfortunately Tiffany is not here with me

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:27.829
so I may either pick the wrong one.

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.326
She might not like it.

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:31.974
Or I might be waiting for her, we'll see.

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:34.409
But they do have my size, which is good.

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.023
And they have block-out curtains.

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:38.089
Well, they did have the ones in my size

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.726
but now I have to pick
out the curtain rod.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.606
They had some shades and
some other options available

00:02:42.606 --> 00:02:44.846
and I feel like I need Tiffany
with me to make a decision.

00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:47.284
Because if I make the wrong
decision, she's going to be

00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:49.188
all up my butt going "Why'd you pick that?

00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:50.417
"It doesn't go with that.
It doesn't even look good.

00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:51.635
"What were you thinking? Ugh."

00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:54.712
So, we'll come back tomorrow with Tiffany

00:02:54.712 --> 00:02:57.429
and pick out some curtains, finally.

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.007
Next order of business, a fan.

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:00.994
Cause at least that will
cool me off a little bit.

00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:04.835
Well little did I know that a fan does not

00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:07.192
come with an air purifier
and an air purifier

00:03:07.192 --> 00:03:09.491
doesn't really come with a fan.

00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:11.674
So, either I gotta buy two separate units

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:14.518
or I gotta buy a really
expensive air purifier

00:03:14.518 --> 00:03:17.909
that can blow air out enough
to actually cool off a room.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.048
Cause it sounds like,
it's one or the other.

00:03:20.048 --> 00:03:21.650
You either buy a fan
that blows air or you buy

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.842
an air purifier that just
sucks in air and blows it out

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:27.362
clean, not at a pace that
actually cools you off.

00:03:27.362 --> 00:03:30.299
We're here at Target, one last stop.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.504
This actually has a lot more
options as you can tell.

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:37.518
Let's look and see if I can
find a fan that will purify air.

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:41.849
(children talking)

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.624
Well, just like Home Depot, they have fans

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:45.784
and they have air purifiers and these are

00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:48.394
the air purifiers and none of them

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.033
talk about air speeds and some actually

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.264
show the air coming out the top.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.808
Which tells me that it's not a fan at all.

00:03:52.808 --> 00:03:56.812
So, looks like I said,
one or the other or both.

00:03:56.812 --> 00:03:58.126
Getting back to the tradition of letting

00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:01.724
the kids pick dinner and
alternating back and forth.

00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:03.686
Bryce picked lunch yesterday so Sierra's

00:04:03.686 --> 00:04:07.691
picking dinner tonight and
she choose Chipotle! Aw.

00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.142
Not going to hear any
complaints out of me, are you?

00:04:10.142 --> 00:04:10.997
- [Bryce] Not me either!

00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:14.152
- Or Bryce, yep that's true,
that's normally a Bryce pick.

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:16.463
Very surprised that
Sierra's going with that.

00:04:16.463 --> 00:04:17.444
But again, no one's complaining.

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:18.745
As usual,
(crowd talking)

00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:20.764
super busy here at Chipotle.

00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:22.111
We got here just in time,

00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:24.827
This is what it looks
like to eat at Chipotle.

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:26.511
Look at that, he's got
lettuce, he's got corn,

00:04:26.511 --> 00:04:28.751
he's got pico de gallo salsa.

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:30.779
Got some medium under there, right, right?

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:31.806
- Uh huh.

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:32.920
- [Clintus] Bryce knows what's up.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.964
Sierra went with the corn,
she has some lettuce.

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:36.228
She's trying the chicken,

00:04:36.228 --> 00:04:37.959
you say you're not
digging the chicken, huh?

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:40.865
You don't like the smokey flavor?

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:43.978
It's chipotle, is probably
what it is, chipotle marinade?

00:04:43.978 --> 00:04:45.976
(lively music)

00:04:45.976 --> 00:04:46.497
At least you know now, right?

00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:47.693
- I like the carnitas.

00:04:47.693 --> 00:04:48.397
- [Clintus] You like the carnitas,

00:04:48.397 --> 00:04:49.110
but they're out of carnitas.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.802
- Yeah.

00:04:49.802 --> 00:04:51.235
- [Clintus] So I ended up going

00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:54.253
with this tower oscillating fan.

00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:56.086
Three speeds and this is on low

00:04:56.086 --> 00:04:57.493
and it's working pretty good.

00:04:57.493 --> 00:04:58.735
(fan softly whirring)

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:01.627
Not too noisey and it
does have a two hour timer

00:05:01.627 --> 00:05:04.412
which is kind of cool
if you forget about it.

00:05:07.204 --> 00:05:09.496
(whispering) This guy's
already fallen asleep.

00:05:11.893 --> 00:05:14.081
You still awake?

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:17.447
It's late, huh? (laughs)

00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:20.322
Sleeping with your snake?

00:05:20.322 --> 00:05:23.828
He can coil around you, like this.

00:05:23.828 --> 00:05:28.379
Is that how he sleeps? Yeah,
that's good, like this.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.840
There you go, is that how
you sleep with your snake?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.237
(laughing)

00:05:32.237 --> 00:05:34.942
Okay, so something I haven't
done in quite some time

00:05:34.942 --> 00:05:36.381
is give some shout-outs to our

00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:38.378
most engaged audience members.

00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:40.480
Been so crazy busy that I haven't even

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.080
looked at this in probably over a month.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.621
But, well we're due for
it, so let's take a look.

00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:48.920
So top of the list, Most Engaged User

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.062
SARA XOXO, Rock Star, Shaw Kids,

00:05:52.062 --> 00:05:56.414
MXandMTB, Randy Schneiter,

00:05:56.414 --> 00:06:00.574
DJM Montoya, motomayhemcrew,

00:06:00.574 --> 00:06:02.871
The Chicks Life, what up dude?

00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.971
Vines All day, Yero Bah, KawaiiTime101 TV,

00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:09.431
I see her tweets all
the time, and right down

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:12.287
at the bottom squeezing in is Alexa Smith.

00:06:12.287 --> 00:06:14.053
What that means is that these people

00:06:14.053 --> 00:06:16.525
are engaging with our videos the most.

00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:17.825
They're commenting, they're liking,

00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:19.032
they're sharing, they're favoriting.

00:06:19.032 --> 00:06:21.912
All the things that YouTube
considers engagement.

00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:23.572
Not me, YouTube.

00:06:23.572 --> 00:06:26.590
They are doing it the
most across our channel.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.213
So for that I thank you
and give you a shout-out.

00:06:29.213 --> 00:06:30.629
Probably a good point to end the vlog,

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.264
but before I do, I've made a decision.

00:06:34.264 --> 00:06:36.343
I'm going to buy a dirt bike when

00:06:36.343 --> 00:06:38.524
we hit 100,000 subscribers.

00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:41.566
So, whenever that is, we hit 100,000,

00:06:41.566 --> 00:06:44.225
the next day or two,
depending on my schedule

00:06:44.225 --> 00:06:46.964
and my availability, I'm going
to go buy a new dirt bike.

00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:51.163
I'm throwing it out
there #Clintus to a 100K

00:06:51.163 --> 00:06:53.983
whatever, whatever.

00:06:53.983 --> 00:06:56.166
That's when I'm going
to buy a new dirt bike.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.267
It kind of just puts a line in the sand

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:00.508
because we've been talking about it.

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:02.923
I still haven't even really
shopped around for which one

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.057
I'm going to get, I'm probably
going to do that this week.

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:05.671
I need to do it this week.

00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:08.167
But then whenever we
hit 100K, which I think

00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:11.697
we're, statistically, if
everything continues going

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:14.274
the way it's going, it'll
happen at the end of April,

00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:16.735
first of May, that sort of thing.

00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:19.824
But the sooner it hits, the
sooner I go buy the dirt bike.

00:07:19.824 --> 00:07:21.249
So that's up to you guys.

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:22.991
I'm going to go ahead
and end the vlog here.

00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:23.813
If you liked it, you should give it

00:07:23.813 --> 00:07:25.509
a thumbs up, eye in the sky.

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:27.889
Put one year ago, two years
ago, latest Clintus games.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:29.050
There's a new Clintus games video.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.047
I exported like six of them out today so

00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:33.345
there should be one up
every day for the next

00:07:33.345 --> 00:07:35.307
five days and then tomorrow I'm going to

00:07:35.307 --> 00:07:36.579
shoot the in box and videos and start

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:37.775
getting those out as well.

00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:39.516
Until then, log on.

00:07:43.086 --> 00:07:45.383
(techo music)

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:52.732
(techno music)

00:07:58.252 --> 00:08:00.035
(techno music)
