00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.830
I am holding the Black Diamond Apollo.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.149
This is an extremely versatile lantern that
packs down to be pretty small, but when you

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.610
open it up and use all of its features, it
puts out a lot of light for its size and its

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.960
weight.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.760
I have it compressed down right now, but the
stand out feature is these feet that fold

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.760
down.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.779
So you have got three feet.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.609
It provides a really stable base for the Apollo.

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.099
And they are really light weight, really easy
to use and very durable.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.489
And you can also extend it out.

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.290
So you have got just a couple of different
really simple settings with this light and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.989
we are just going to go through all the features.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.429
There is just one button on this light, on,
off.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.550
And this is the button that also dims the
light.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.370
So with one click of the button it will turn
on.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.149
You have a nice ambient light.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.620
It is kind of a frosted globe here so it is
not going to blind you when you turn it on.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.649
The brightest output is 80 lumens.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.640
You can also dim it all the way down to 10
lumens.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.550
So as an emergency light, if you just need
that 10 lumens to get you through, it is going

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.229
to last up to 60 hours which is great for
that emergency use.

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.000
And if you want that bright light, if you
are sitting around the campsite, it is going

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.719
to all the way up to 80 lumens and that is
for 15 hours.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.289
So definitely going to last you for a weekend
of camping.

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.229
This takes four double A alkaline batteries
or you can get a Black Diamond energy recharger

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.329
kit to go with it.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.070
That is sold separately.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.649
But in order to change the batteries, the
battery housing is right here at the bottom.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.890
And all you have to do is give it one little
twist and you can see the battery housing

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.890
there.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.479
I take this out, you can just see that I have
got my four alkaline batteries in there.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.840
But if you take that out you can insert the
energy recharger kit if you choose to buy

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.109
that separately.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:12.050
There is a battery power indicator on this
light and so right now we are at a full charge

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.660
and new batteries.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.510
If I compress that down the green light comes
on there.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.750
So there is a green a yellow and a red light
to just tell you how much battery life there

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.120
is left in the light.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.390
Some last quick features.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.700
The feet on here are really sturdy and stable
and they are covered in a nice rubber, so

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.390
definitely durable.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.000
When everything is kind of compressed down
they really protect the light.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.660
So if you do have it inside a pack or you
are traveling with it you have protection

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.690
there.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.040
There are two nice metal hooks at the top
so you can hang this from inside of a tent

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.900
or just if you want that light above you to
provide light for a campsite or if you are

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.900
traveling.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.870
So that is a really great feature there.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.750
And all in all this is a really sturdy, really
great light for emergency use, camping and

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.750
travel.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.599
It is the Black Diamond Apollo.
