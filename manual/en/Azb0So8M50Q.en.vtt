00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.220
When we use tillage the soil ecosystem is
disturbed on a massive scale. Purdue's Dr.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.220
Eileen Kladivko contrasted natural ecosystems
with tilled systems and what we stand to lose

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:18.930
when soils are tilled.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.230
If you think about natural ecosystems they
don't have a tillage implement running through

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.710
them once a year or a couple times a year
but nutrients get recycled and trees grow

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.710
or grasses grow and what's recycling the nutrients
are the organisms and so part of what we are

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
saying with the no till system is that if
you don't take an implement through there

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.050
and you allow the system to kind of comeback
that there will be organisms that will do

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.769
that job for you, they do it differently obviously
than a piece of metal would do it, but they

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.010
can be very effective and besides loosening
the soil or making burrows they do some of

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.010
these other things like convert nutrients,
recycle nutrients have pathways where roots

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.890
can grow and then those pathways stay there,
if you think about a tillage implement any

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.840
root channel from last year in the top soil
is going to be totally broken up by a tillage

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.550
implement the next year. You have a night
crawler channel or even if you have a red

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.360
worm channel that is part of the red worm
channel its there and the roots can follow

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.090
that and so you can have channel built upon
channel, built upon channel, the night crawler

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.720
channel, maybe a root, maybe a cornuted, maybe
a cover crop root will go down that and then

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.540
the next year another night crawler, and so
and so it builds upon itself.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.540
Will you explain to us why organic matter
decomposes faster because of tillage?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.320
A tillage operation does a couple things,
number one is it opens up aggregates that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.220
were otherwise protected so your opening up
more surfaces for the bacteria to decompose

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.140
the organic material faster, that is probably
the main reason, sometimes people say well

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.890
your putting oxygen in the soil, its not really
so much that as by breaking up aggregates

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.810
you expose the organic matter in the soil
to decomposition whereas when it's in an aggregated

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.230
state in the soil some of that is protected
and the bacteria that decompose that organic

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.250
matter can't get to it.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.750
So the tillage actually favors bacteria that
would live in that environment. That's maybe

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.640
what causes the flush of carbon dioxide and
nitrates into the soil as well I guess?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.260
Oh yes, the flush of carbon dioxide is very
much related to the tillage operation.
