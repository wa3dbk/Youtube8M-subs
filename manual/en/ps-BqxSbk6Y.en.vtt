00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.890
It's not the best, it's not the most popular...but
I'm not sure there's a regular series on Nintendo's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.230
roster quite as charming as Mario and Luigi.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.430
Sure, it's only been around for about a decade,
but in that time, it's grown into something

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.430
pretty special.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.430
I mean, it's funny.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.370
And not, like, video game funny.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.080
It's genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.500
It's a series that lets you in on the joke.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.150
It's a series that embraces creativity, in
a less and less creative industry.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:12.750
And...it's a series that might be even better
on the Nintendo 3DS.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.650
Dream Team is only the fourth game in the
Mario and Luigi series, but of course...it's

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.650
hardly a new idea.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.520
The series may be a newcomer by Nintendo standards,
but it traces its roots all the way back to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.950
1996...and one of the best 16-bit games ever
made.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.830
When you played Super Mario RPG, you knew
it was something great.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.260
And that legendary blueprint serves as the
foundation for the Mario and Luigi games.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.970
Only the structure on top it?

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.070
That gets a little wacky.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:57.190
One of the defining elements of the Mario
and Luigi series is that...each game has its

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.729
own creative gimmick.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.470
So it always starts with Mario RPG, right?

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.830
But then, the brothers might be, partners
in time or...swallowed by Bowser.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.289
And this time?

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.520
Well, Luigi likes to sleep.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.050
Like, a lot.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.270
So Mario's gonna have to save the day, right?

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.459
As usual?

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.459
Wrong.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:33.200
Turns out Luigi's REM cycles are way more
powerful than a Starman.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.159
Dream Team is built around a pretty typical
Nintendo conventionâ€”the idea of two separate

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.560
but related worlds.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.370
In this case, one is a dream world.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.379
The citizens of Pi'illo Island have been trapped
inside these nightmare stones and cast away

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.709
in the dream world.

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.819
Only problem is, they're also the only ones
who can access the dream world, thanks to

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.099
their abnormally strong sleep patterns.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.560
No one else can open the gate.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.799
Then again, no one sleeps harder than Luigi.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.519
So that one idea sets up everything in Dream
Team.

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.040
Its premise, its hook...but it also sets up
this great characterization of Luigi.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.909
And that's what Dream Team does best.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.319
It gives these two characters...character,
and a brotherly dynamic.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.469
They call for each other, they strategize
in fake Italian...

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:29.620
They freaking hug, you guys.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:39.470
You know, there's just something incredibly
endearing about Dream Team...and even relatable.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.799
Mario is always the guy, but this time, he
steps aside.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.489
And he seems to do so happily.

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.450
I mean, you may control Mario, but...this
is really a game about Luigi.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:59.220
And how sometimes, heroes can come in the
most unlikely forms imaginable.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.719
So obviously, Dream Team's personality and
incredible writing are highlights, but the

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.189
gameplay's just as good.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.609
Dream Team takes Nintendo hybrid platformer/RPG
design to a whole new level.

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.570
So this time, it's not just turn-based battles
and 3D over worlds.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.000
The dream worlds are in 2D, and they're actually
the most creative levels in the game.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.650
Dream Team just throws cool ideas at you,
one after another.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:36.270
Like reusing the old Mario 64 title screen
for something really clever.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.480
Turn-based RPGs aren't for everyone.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.770
But this is a turn-based RPG for everyone.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.470
Its a genre that can often be convoluted and
daunting, but this one's intuitive and welcoming.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.250
Not to mention thoroughly creative.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.360
And you know, it gives these legendary characters
something even some of their most legendary

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.030
games didn't...a personality.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:07.250
For that and more, Mario and Luigi continues
to be a dream.
