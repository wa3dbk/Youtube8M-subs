00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.340
This is the Vango Eden 600.
It part of Vango's polycotton Airbeam range.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.619
You can see that this year they've gone for
the safari tent look.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:32.119
It has this really big polycotton extension
on, and we've been in this tent when it was

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:40.691
pouring down with rain, no leaks.
Inside we've got a massive living area. This

00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:45.719
is a big tent. There's plenty of space in
the corners for storage, there's additional

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.219
doors on the side, and at the back of the
tent, there are two very large sleeping pods.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:03.550
Shown on here is also the Vango tension system.
These straps clip in here, and clip in down

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.090
here, and these give the tent extra bracing
in bad weather.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:22.720
They can simply be unclipped, from the top,
and rolled away into the storage pocket at

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.659
the side.
The tent also has lots of little pockets around

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:40.790
for storing additional nicknacks, and its
got ventilation around the bottom.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.530
Blinds also tuck away inside down here so
that they're not dangling down.
