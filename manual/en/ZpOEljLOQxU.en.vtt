Hey, guys, Matt here at etrailer.com.

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.520
Today we are going to be going over the Yakima
BedHead.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.700
This is the truck bed mounted single bike
rack, part number YO1132.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.580
We will go ahead and take it out on our test
course and show you how it performs.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.029
The Yakima Bed Head allows you to carry 1
bike in the bed of your pickup truck.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:48.339
It easily clamps onto the bed rail and provides
easy loading 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:02:10.920
and 
unloading 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:26.490
of 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:42.370
your bike.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:03:15.959
I&amp;#39;m going 
to 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:37.200
show you 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:04:29.930
how 
to install it.
