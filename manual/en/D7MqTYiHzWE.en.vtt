00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.020
Bom dia! Today, we’re going to Lisbon.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.640
To do some really cool things…

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.420
Such as what? Well, you’ll see in a minute.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.460
We’re going to make 
lots of people happy as…

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.780
…we’ll be giving away sweets on the flight!

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.780
Yummy!

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.220
Fancy some sweets? 
- Thanks.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.740
Thanks! 
- My pleasure, have a good flight.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.080
I feel like a stewardess today. 
Madame? Fancy a sweet?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.920
Thanks. 
- My pleasure!

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100
I’m Sanny from &lt;i&gt;Sanny zoekt Geluk…&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.680
I’m Noor, from Queen of Jet Lags 
and we’re in…

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
Lisbon! Yes! We’ve just arrived and 
we’re going to have a really fun trip…

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.620
…and we’re taking you with us too…
Let's go!

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.720
We’re going to be spreading a feel-good feeling 
and giving lots of compliments…

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.880
…to everyone, 
in Portuguese!

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.640
Pedro you're so kind. Thanks! 
We’ve got a map. Yaay…

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.160
Here is our booklet with simple 
compliments in Portuguese…

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.440
I’m not going to read them too loudly 
or that man will know what I’m about to say…

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.300
Thanks for the great taxi ride, 
he was very nice and laughing the whole time.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.300
He was very nice. 
- Yes.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.280
It was a very good experience! 
- Great, have a nice stay.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.460
And it was a 5-star trip…

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.100
…and you are a 5-star customer…

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.940
Let’s wait for our host!

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.960
Yaaay! I’m curious. Me too…
…because we’re getting our very own tour.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.700
She’s already practising her Portuguese…

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.300
…for the next compliment that 
she’s going to give to this nice man.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.300
Well, only if he’s nice…

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.560
So here is cheese and wine for you! 
Ow, nice! This square is around here right?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.000
Yes, it's just in front of the apartment, 
so we can see the statue.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.960
You're welcome, and it's my pleasure and 
we hope you can come back soon, OK?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.060
The sun! I’m so happy!

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.080
How far is it to walk, do you think? 
It's just here?

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.880
15 minutes, 20 minutes…

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.440
Straight ahead?

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.020
“Thank you. Without you, 
we’d have gotten totally lost!”

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.240
I hope so! 
Have fun!

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.500
We’re at a very touristic attraction. 
People are taking selfies here.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.060
And we’re going to ask whether 
we can take some photos of them.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.200
That looks very cool, doesn’t it? 
Yes! OK, let's go!

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700
OK…
1, 2, 3…

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.780
We’ll help you. 
1, 2, ah, he’s looking really good…

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.580
Thank you so much! Aaahh thanks! 
And enjoy your day!

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.060
I think these are going to be very sweet photos.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.180
It’s really great to help people.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.600
If you don’t come here for the fish, you 
can always come here for the men…right?

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880
We’ve just had a delicious meal, 
so we’ll just thank the chef.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.460
It was nicely cooked and absolutely delicious!

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.320
You see these tiles 
everywhere in Lisbon…

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.100
…they’re typical of Lisbon.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.100
What we’re about to eat 
is really healthy…

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.600
How was it?

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.100
Oh yes, really tasty.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.000
How great is this! 
- We’ve made a few more people happy too!

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.640
Over the last few days we’ve been 
spreading a little Dutch kindness.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.740
Unfortunately, our mission in Lisbon 
has come to an end. Thanks, Transavia! Bye!
