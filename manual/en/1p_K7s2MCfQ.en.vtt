00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.670
In the production of a safe and wholesome
beef product, implants can provide a number

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.450
of economic advantages. Beef implants have
been proven over the years to improve the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:22.650
leanness of cattle versus non-implanted cattle.
Aggressive implants can also have a huge effect

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.369
on growth and feed efficiency while changing
the composition of the carcass grade. So it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.739
depends on what market one is trying to hit
or target as to which implant may be used.

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.309
Implants do increase feed efficiency, as well
as their lean muscle gain, and therefore with

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:51.050
the disadvantage of compromising quality grade
with lean muscle gain implants are as much

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.399
of an economic decision as well as a quality
decision and it really depends on what market

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.050
one is trying to hit.
There are a number of consumer concerns regarding

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.710
implanted cattle and that concern remains
high today. Therefore administering implants,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.800
as long as it has been done properly and the
label directions have been followed, we know,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.080
as cattle producers, that they are a safe
product. The FDA does regulate implants and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.460
growth implants are certainly something that
is extremely safe for not only production,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.950
but as well as the consumption of the beef
product. When considering implant management,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.490
there is no withdrawal time for slaughter
with the FDA approved implants. One needs

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.799
to administer them by reading and following
the manufacturers directions. Most implants

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.460
need to be within the middle one third of
the ear and make sure that the ear is fairly

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.310
clean and sanitary and utilize some kind of
antiseptic on the needle, prior to implanting

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.390
a calf. This will cut down on abscesses and
maybe even walled off implants within the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.400
ear.
When giving an implant, it is a subcutaneous

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.670
injection, through the middle one third of
the ear. An implant should never be placed

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.569
any place else on the animal’s body. When
you work the cattle through, routinely check

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.650
your implants and make sure that they are
ok as you work the cattle through the chute.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.750
Simply rub your hand over the back of the
ear to feel for that implant.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.200
When implanting a steer, start the needle
to the outer edge of the middle 1/3 of the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.239
ear. Make a subcutaneous injection with the
needle, dispense the implant, and then check

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.590
the implant after you are done.
Between each calf, make sure that the equipment

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.300
is sanitized before moving on.
Now hormone levels in beef is something that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.390
the consumers have been concerned about, but
maybe don’t fully understand the science

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:16.330
behind it. Small amounts of the different
estrogens are found in beef whether they are

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.739
implanted or not. The net difference between
an implanted steer and a non-implanted steer

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:33.120
is .5 Nano grams. That is relative to a blade
of grass that would be found in a football

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:42.150
field. The FDA does approve the safe levels
and the manufacturers make sure that their

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.569
products follow the FDA regulations. And finally,
humans should not be concerned about the estrogen

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:58.549
levels in beef. When one looks at the estrogen
levels in a child as well as to an adult,

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.420
they are hundreds of thousands of times larger
than what is found in a beef product.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.180
On the next slide, we have several problems
that can occur with implants, and primarily,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.269
it has to do with technique. Abscesses are
largely due to just not taking care of sanitation.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.610
We need to make sure that the equipment and
the ears are dried as well as being clean

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.410
and then when you go down this list of possible
problems with implanting cattle, it is because

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.710
of the technique, or maybe going too fast.
This is not a race with implanting cattle.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.130
We need to make sure and do the job properly,
and if we do the job properly, the implant

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.780
will pay you.
