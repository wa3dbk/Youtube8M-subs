00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:13.490
Wasabi is a root vegetable grown in the mountain
areas with very shallow running cold water

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.880
and it has to be in area that is not muddy,
like a very sandy area.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.769
It is very hard to grow wasabi.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.009
That is why real wasabi root is very expensive.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.160
Once you have it and you taste it, it is so
much better than other wasabi, fake wasabi,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.930
such as tube wasabi or powder wasabi.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.680
Those are like horseradish or mustard, whatever
they put together with it and then put the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.430
coloring in it, that is fake wasabi.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.390
This is fresh wasabi root.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.520
This is very short but sometimes comes like
this and sometimes bigger, a little thicker.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.610
These are the stems and the little leaves.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.080
Of course, we eat the root and also the stems.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.470
The stems you can cut in little pieces, you
can marinate them in soy sauce or any other

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.310
thing and it is very fragrant, a little bit
spicy and very good.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.040
The root you just peel off a very thin layer
outside of the skin.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.360
This is the wasabi grater.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.310
The surface is made of shark skin so you just
grate it, grate it.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:41.180
Like a massage motion, nice and creamy, bright
green colors and the aroma comes out and tastes

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.030
so much better.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.320
It is very spicy but at the same time it is
very sweet.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.580
You can taste the sweetness of the root and
then very spicy.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.870
If you have the chance to have real wasabi
root, try it and you will really enjoy it.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.470
The way you eat sushi with wasabi; I usually
do not eat wasabi at all.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:12.230
I only put a little bit on the top of the
fish and eat it but not all fish, just the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.370
fatty types of fish like yellowtail or toro,
which is a fatty tuna.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.190
But if you like a little wasabi you can use
it but not too much.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.379
Certainly you do not want to take a whole
block of wasabi and put it in the soy sauce

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.459
and then mix and mix and mix it, and then
you are dipping into, or swimming into the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.140
soy sauce/wasabi mixture and eat it...

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.060
You are like, 'Ugh!'

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.799
That is not the way to eat sushi.

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.660
Sushi is very delicate so do not forget, you
are not trying to taste the wasabi and the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.019
soy sauce; you are trying to taste the fish
and the delicate flavor of the sushi rice.
