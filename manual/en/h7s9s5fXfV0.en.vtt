&gt;&gt;EMKA KLUCOVSKA: Hello, my name is Emka,

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.599
I'm 15 years old.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.769
I live in Slovakia

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.590
and I draw monsters, creatures with sharp
teeth,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.110
and I'm also a Falconer.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.439
When I was two years old, I started drawing
birds

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.700
and I then I saw an Alien movie

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.200
and drew something, not a bird, but it had
teeth,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.500
sharp teeth and blood.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.500
My parents were like "Oh, my goodness!" 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.300
(Laughs)

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.900
Here it is.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.700
My first Alien.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.600
My dream is to become a professional designer
of characters for movies.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.600
I really love Robert Downey Jr., and I really
love the Iron Man movies.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.800
&gt;&gt;ERICH LITOFF: That's drawn? With pencil?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.100
&gt;&gt;EMKA: Yes, yes. These.  

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.900
(Laughs)

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.500
&gt;&gt; JOHN ALES: Beautiful.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100
&gt;&gt; EMKA: Thank you.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.860
&gt;&gt; I do not study at Arts School.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.760
In my country, I don't have opportunity.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.780
I'm just watching Tutorials

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.599
and almost everyday I visit an animation studio

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.829
where I have a teacher

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.069
who teaches me how to draw

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.349
and how to animate.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.760
Never give up.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.080
And focus on what you can do the best.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.920
Thank you! Thank you!

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.620
&gt;&gt;ERICH LITOFF: Okay.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.900
&gt;&gt;EMKA: Ok. So that's the end.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.340
&gt;&gt;ERICH LITOFF: That's it, that's it. That's
it. Very nice to meet you.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.340
&gt;&gt;EMKA: Ok, yeah. Nice to meet you.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.780
&gt;&gt;ERICH LITOFF: Thank you very much, alright, bye.                                          &gt;&gt; JOHN ALES: Bye.
