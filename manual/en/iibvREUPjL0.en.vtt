Hey what’s up guys, David Glenn of davidglennrecording.com,
mixingvocals.com and theproaudiofiles.com.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.910
Today I’m gonna show you a new song, I’m
not even finished mixing it yet but it sounds

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.250
pretty sweet. I’m excited for it. And the
artist is Samantha Encarnacion, one of my

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.030
best friends Victor Encarnacion produced it
and long overdue is — the production is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.300
finished and it’s in my hands and we’re
working through it — my mixing assistant

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.300
Neil Devaro is prepping the rest of the files
and this one is just about done, we’re rocking

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.670
with it so moving on, I’m gonna shut up
and hit play and we’re gonna show you how

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.239
we’re gonna take a little special guitar
lick that he did and add a quick effect to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.089
it with automation instead of coming down,
creating a new track, and doing something

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.530
special there, just kind of a quick way to
solve that problem. So let’s hit play, take

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.530
a listen and then we’ll talk about what
I did.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.580
[music + electric guitar]

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.630
Ok cool. So kind of a rocking pop/rock tune,
we’ve got this little lick right here, you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.520
just heard the lead guitar was the one doing
this.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.000
[lead distorted guitar]

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Ok. And then over here after the verse starts
he did this little lick. Very cool. Now for

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.130
me, in the mix I could hear an effect on that,
kind of like a telephone type filter on an

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.400
EQ to kind of give it some separation and
to do that I’m gonna quickly walk you through

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.480
showing the new FabFilter Pro-Q 2. This is
available for anyone on Pro-Q 1 you can still

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.980
do this. You go to the presets, they’ve
got a sweet one here called phone. I’m gonna

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.900
take a listen to what that sounds like.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.480
[guitar with telephone EQ effect]

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.380
Very cool. I feel like a little more low end
could come in. That’ll work. And what I’m

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.070
gonna do is I’m gonna quickly bypass it,
I’m gonna hold all three modifier keys,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.299
no matter if you’re on PC or Mac, it’s
gonna be the same. All three of them: control,

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.690
option, command, or Windows: alt and control.
Hold all three of those, click on bypass.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.269
Now this would be a Pro Tools only thing.
Sorry guys if you’re not on Pro Tools, but

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.540
you can still do this with your DAW. I’m
gonna enable automation for the master bypass.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.350
That’s that. Now I’m gonna hold command
and control and click on the master bypass

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.820
and close the plugin. You’ll see that that
automation lane for the master bypass is now

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.310
active. It’s right here. So I’m gonna
highlight the section that I want this to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.220
apply to and I’m gonna click and drag that
so it is no longer bypassed. And so there

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.820
you see it is bypassed back here.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.120
[guitar without FabFilter Pro-Q 2 EQ bypass
automation]

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.260
And then whenever we get to this lick it's active.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.889
[guitar with FabFilter Pro-Q 2 EQ bypass automation]

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.290
Very cool. And let’s hear what it sounds
like in the track so at the end of the tail

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.100
end of that.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.100
[guitar with FabFilter Pro-Q 2 EQ automation
bypassed]

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:47.489
Very cool, now let’s make it inactive and
hear that same thing. So it’s just a little

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.120
kind of muddy, kind of it’s there, but it’s
almost — it doesn’t stick out enough,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.870
so cleaning it up using that effect. A quick
automation of that we could probably go throughout

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.070
the song see if there’s any other parts
that we like that same effect too. Highlight

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.250
them, pull the bypass up or down depending
on what you’re doing there. And All is well.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.489
One more thing I think that might be cool.
Throw a kind of a strand of effects, let’s

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.340
go mono-stereo for this Plugin &amp; Mix Tremolo
Pan, and I’m gonna throw the width out wide.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.290
I’m going to sync it like maybe a 16th note.
We’re gonna go the depth all the way to

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.150
do that. We’re gonna bypass it through out
modifier keys, we’re gonna enable it. Command,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.150
control, click. That lane is up. We’re gonna
now come in here and unbypass is for that

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.430
section. And let’s take a little to what
it’s doing.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.600
[guitar with tremolo pan effect automated]

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.840
Very cool. That’s actually pretty sick.
But let’s go to 32nd note and see what that

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.220
does.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.500
[guitar with tremolo pan effect automated]

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.500
K, the other thing to note is by doing a mono
to stereo the track is now in a stereo format.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:04.670
We need to take that and we’re gonna wipe
out my left automation here for the rest of

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.030
this stuff and we’re gonna put it — let’s
do this — throw it all the way to the left

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.030
for that. And let’s see what that sounds
like. Cool. Might be a bit much, let’s see

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.790
what happens in the track.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.000
[mix + guitar effect automation]

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
That’s a bit crazy, maybe that doesn’t
work, let’s try 16th and see if that works.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.110
Ok, you win some you lose some. Maybe the
tremolo pan is not quite working out, you

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.550
can get rid of that, try something else and
move on from it. But a cool tip about that,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.180
something I’ll do, I learned from the Tony
Maserati camp over at the Mirror Ball Entertainment

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.810
guys, they have a 10 minute rule. And so they
won’t work on any one separate effect or

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.490
anything for more than 10 minutes. And so
what I actually do is I pull my phone out

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.590
and I set a timer, I say Siri set a timer
for 10 minutes, and when it goes off if I’m

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.120
still messing around with it and it’s not
working, get rid of the whole things it’s

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.720
done. And I get back to mixing, get — excuse
me — get back into the meat of stuff that’s

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.250
gonna actually get me to the finish line with
the mix. So anyways, couple tips there on

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.920
how to quickly automate the EQ effect with
the Pro-Q 2, got the Tremolo Pan that maybe

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.620
didn’t work out, but hopefully you learned
and get that working into your arsenal of

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:48.270
tools so that you can quickly get in and out
of a creative idea. And don’t forget to
