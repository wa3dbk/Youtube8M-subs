VICTORIA MACKENZIE-CHILDS:
Ahoy, my name is Victoria

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.820
MacKenzie-Childs.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.290
And my husband Richard and I are
the proprietors, I guess

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.540
you'd say, of Yankee Ferry,
our boat and our abode.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.790
Welcome aboard.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.080
We've owned Yankee for about 12
years, and every day feels

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.300
like another adventure because
it's closer to nature than

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.840
living in an apartment or a
house in a way because even

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.200
parts of the boat that
we're living on

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.900
are out in the winds.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.760
And I just love that feeling.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.730
We even have chickens and
animals on the boat.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.900
And they have their quarters.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.180
And so we have fresh eggs
in the city every day.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.880
And that's really funny to me.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.730
Most of the things that you
see around are things that

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.100
we've made.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.070
And being sculptors, we know
how to work with every

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.130
material, from steel, to wood,
to anything that we would

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.710
possibly need to do to keep
her pulled together.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.790
It really needs us as much
as we need to her.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.210
She's the oldest vessel in the
whole Eastern Seaboard that's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.610
actually floating.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.370
Most boats don't make
it this long.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.730
So this is the crew quarters,
and now it's practically like

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.590
an apartment.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.850
It has a tiny little space for
an icebox and microwave oven.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.870
This bed is an example of what
the beds were life that came

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.540
out of the side of the hull.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.934
So that used to sleep
16 crew members.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:58.317
So just imagine what it would
be like hearing all those

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:01.190
people snoring in the
night [LAUGHS],

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.140
swaying with the boat.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.940
And then the master stateroom,
which is where we normally

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.160
reside, with bunks for
our grandchildren

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.552
when they come visit.

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:14.408
So they think it's normal.

00:02:14.408 --> 00:02:15.336
They've only always
known that their

00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:17.062
grandparents live on a ship.

00:02:17.062 --> 00:02:20.730
And here is the salon.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.820
And the salon is pretty much the
way it would've been 100

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.560
years ago in that it was just an
open space, just like this,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.480
exactly the same.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.662
On a ship, a bathroom
is called a

00:02:31.662 --> 00:02:34.530
head, but it has shower.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.380
It has a big old clawfoot
bathtub, which we tease is our

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.550
whirlpool, or our jacuzzi
because on a windy day, if you

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.540
fill it up with bubbles and
water it's slopping all over

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.245
the place like it's made to
bubble up around you.

00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:54.640
And it's really a fun place
to have a bath.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.460
The galley is one of our
favorite places.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.470
It's quite large, actually.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.580
It's probably as big as any
country kitchen would be.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.370
There's something about
hunkering down around a cup a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.460
chowda in Yankee that really,
to me, brings us home.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.530
So we have everything that you
would call home right with us,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.780
especially the heart.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.210
