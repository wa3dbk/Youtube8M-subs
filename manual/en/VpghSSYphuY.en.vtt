Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I'm taking a closer look at another great

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.870
interior dress up item from Modern Billet,
I have with me their chrome and satin E-brake

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.199
cover fitting all 2010 and up Mustangs.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.130
Before we get into this product from Modern
Billet, I just want to remind you all to subscribe

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.160
to our YouTube channel, if you haven't already.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.490
Super easy to do, all you need to do is simply
click the banner below right now, or you can

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.460
click on the AM logo on the corner at any
point during this video.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.110
So as you may have guessed from the name,
Modern Billet is a company that specializes

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.269
in making a wide variety of styling accessories
for your Mustang, these handles included,

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.749
using nothing but 100% solid Billet aluminum.

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:49.210
As you can see the handle covers are pretty
simple by design but they're a great way to

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.579
add some more style and customization to the
new S197's interior.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.649
As I mentioned at the beginning the cover
is available in a satin, and bright triple

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.339
dipped chrome finish, with both options working
well in these newer interiors.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.890
For instance the satin options would work
great with a satin dash insert or even our

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.250
TCI ratchet shifter which we have installed
on our 2010 behind me.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.860
On the other hand the chrome accent would
work great with some of the other chrome accents.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.689
If you're not watching this video on our site
already and you'd like to see more images

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.210
of both handle options installed, along with
some customer submitted images, all you need

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.340
to do is simply click the link below to head
over to the product page at AmericanMuscle.com.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.590
You will need to select whether your E-brake
handle is made of leather or rubber in addition

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.439
to selecting your preferred finish option
whenever it comes time to ordering.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.490
When you do install your handle cover, you'll
be happy to know it installs in a matter of

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.270
minutes, simply slide the cover onto your
E-brake and tighten the screws using the included

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.270
allen wrench.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.890
That's it, but if you have any issues you
can always feel free to give us a call or

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.350
shoot us an email.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.659
So if you'd like to add more satin or more
chrome to the interior of your 2010 and newer

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.450
Mustang, then be sure to check out one of
