Hi my name is Ruth and welcome to another
video from Tech-Compass

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.259
In this video tutorial We are going to demonstrate
how to manually create a restore point then

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.000
restore a computer to a previous working state
and also how

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.300
to undo a restore point in Microsoft Windows
8.1

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.320
So lets get started

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.160
In order to manually create a system restore
point just type in "System Restore" from the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.840
start screen. As you start to type Windows
will automatically

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.219
open the search box and enter the text, then
press enter

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.260
From the results that appear click on "Create
a restore point"

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.429
You will then be taken back to the desktop
and a new window will appear showing all the

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.249
information about System Protection

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:54.620
First you should check to make sure that "System
Protection" is turned on by selecting your

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.609
C: drive and then click "Configure"

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:07.150
In the new windows ensure "Turn on System
Protection" is selected and click "Ok"

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.210
Then click "Create" and give your System Restore
Point a name

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:26.840
In this demonstration we will call it "Test
Restore Point" then click "Create"

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.480
A new restore point will now be created which
you can restore to should your computer become

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.410
unstable at a later date

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.050
The next demonstration is how to use system
restore should your computer have any issues

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.580
after installing some windows updates, device
drivers or perhaps

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.980
become infected with malware

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.590
Again from the start screen type in "system
restore" and press enter

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.030
Click on "Create a restore point"

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:12.100
In the new window click on "System Restore"
and then click "Next"

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.090
Here you can see your available restore points
including the one we just manually created

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.000
by selecting one and clicking "Scan for affected
programs" you can see which updates or device

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.350
drivers would be deleted that may be causing
the issue

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:47.100
In this demonstration we choose the latest
restore point and click "Next" and then "Finish"

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.810
Click "Yes" to confirm and your computer will
restart and restore itself to the chosen restore

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.750
point

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.470
Once the restore has finished you will receive
confirmation including the time and date of

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.349
the restore point.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.819
In the third and final demonstration we are
going to undo the system restore, this is

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.060
something you would do if it hadn't resolved
the issues and you didn't

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.740
want to install updates or drivers again

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.190
Again from the start screen type in "system
restore" and press "enter"

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.280
Click on "Create a restore point"

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.040
In the new window click on "System Restore"
and then you will be presented with the option

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.709
to "Undo System Restore" leave this selected
and click "Next"

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.840
Click "Finish" and then "Yes" to confirm

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.040
Your computer will then restart and restore
itself to the previous state

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.040
So thats how you can use system restore in
Microsoft Windows 8.1 to keep your computer

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.930
running smoothly.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.239
