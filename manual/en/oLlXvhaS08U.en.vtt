Hi gang.

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:07.330
John here with Real Truck Garage.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.809
Today we are going to show you
how to install the In Channel, Snap In, Side

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.730
Wind Deflectors from Stampede
on our 2013 F-150.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.870
The first step in the process of putting on
our Side Wind Deflectors is to

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.109
go ahead and insert them into the channel
where they're going to be placed.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.000
Then what we want to do, once we get them
sitting up here, is to go ahead

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120
and pull the red tape off.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.170
Now that we have the tape off, we're going
to go ahead and fit our Side

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.690
Wind Deflector up into the channel.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.250
Take your fingers and run them around
on the inside, just with a little bit of firm

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.910
pressure to help the tape to
adhere to the channel.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.479
Then we'll take our spacer, and in case you
are wondering what these are

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.030
for, these are actually to go in here so it
helps the window get past this

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.399
corner of the Side Wind Deflector, so that
it doesn't get caught in there

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.509
and pull it out.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:26.619
Then we'll take that, we'll place it up in
the corner up here.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.479
We'll push
it back in there as far as we can get it.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.600
Now we'll go ahead and attach our rear one.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.610
What we're going to do is go
ahead and pull the red tape off of our 3M

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.340
sticky stuff.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.329
Fit this into the
channel.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.880
Push it right up in there.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.720
Run our finger across the inside to
press it in really well.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.570
We'll take our clip and insert it into the
channel.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.990
What I do is just take a flat screwdriver,
because these are kind

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.270
of tough to get in.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.100
We'll just go in the center of it, and we'll
just push

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:17.580
it back in there.
