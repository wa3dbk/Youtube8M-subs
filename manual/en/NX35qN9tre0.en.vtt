Steve Russell: Well I guess I’ve got one,
I guess it’s there. It’s sort of doing

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.390
things most of the time, I don’t
really know what it’s doing, I don’t have

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.169
any in-depth technical knowledge about the
brain. I know

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.169
where it is, I suppose that’s why I’m
interested in seeing it. I think it’s a

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.630
great opportunity to
actually have a look inside my own head and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.369
see possibly what’s going on there. At the
end of it

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.369
I’ll have something great to show, I’ll
have a picture of my brain I can put on my Facebook site.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.860
My feelings about the scan now: I suppose

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.360
I’m a bit ambiguous because I’m still
really interested

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.430
to get the result but I’m getting slightly
more nervous about the process, I have to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.510
say, and about
being put into – I don’t mind the confined

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.540
space but it’s the space with this huge
magnetic field

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.540
and I’m wondering if I’ll come out the
same person as I went in.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.130
When I looked at the questionnaire I suddenly
started to realise actually it’s quite a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.350
serious
process. I’d possibly been a bit flippant

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.159
about seeing it as ‘OK I just go in, I get
scanned, it’s no big deal’.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.159
When I noticed all the questions about metal

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.539
and surgery and clips and things inside the
body, I

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.850
realised that there were safety issues involved
and it was quite a powerful thing that I’d

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.420
be
subjecting myself to.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.749
David Bradbury: Right Steve, I need you to
remove all your metal items, so any necklaces,

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:55.209
your glasses will
need to come off.

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.229
SR: It’s sort of a fairly straightforward
process. Gradually you find yourself more

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.259
and more
constrained from what in my imagination was

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.660
just me unfettered going through this machine,
sort

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.660
of lying down in a quiet way, turned into
earphones, earplugs, pads holding my head

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.810
in place and
then you get this sort of strange cage-like

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.440
contraption over your head. Then I think if
I had been

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.700
claustrophobic I probably would have not been
very happy at that point.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.220
DB: Are you ready to go? Here we go.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.220
[sound of machine running]

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.180
SR: It was very noisy, there’s the noise,
which I think is the sort of pulses from the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.880
magnet. It’s
almost like a 12-minute record song, you know,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.340
it’s sort of strange electronic monotonous
music.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.340
DB: A researcher will come up with a certain
plan, they will then recruit X amount of people

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.870
for
their study. No volunteers – no scanning

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.980
 – no research – no future developments
in neuroscience.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:25.000
Obviously this is an amazing centre for innovative
neuroscience and therefore without the raw

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.160
materials, i.e. people’s brains, we can’t
do any research – simple as that. How are

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.810
you doing
Steve? Are you OK?

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.250
SR: Fine, yes.
DB: Fantastic job. We’re just going to have

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.080
a quick check through that data and then we’ll
get you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.350
out. Is that OK?
SR: The big payoff for me was actually seeing

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.720
the images on the screen, it’s like a sort
of form of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.880
interior narcissism to actually see your brain
up there and be able to sort of scroll around

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.069
and look
through it. I think previously I’d thought

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.420
of it as a big sort of general mass, but now
I’m thinking of

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.290
‘oh there are finely distinguished parts
of it’, so it might change how I think of

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.410
my interior
processes.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.319
That’s brilliant. I’m amazed.
