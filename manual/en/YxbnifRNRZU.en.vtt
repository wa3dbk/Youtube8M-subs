Hi, I'm David from Simpsons Paintball.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You're watching Social Paintball! YEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Welcome to Social Paintball News.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm your host, Justin Hafford. Here's your news for this week.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Kick Greg Hastings. Dye buys Pro-Tec.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"Graveyard", the short film. The EPPL hosts the Quito Open.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
[Intro Music]

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This just in...Greg Hastings has started a kick starter campaign

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
for a "Greg Hastings' Tourney Ball Max'd 2" video game.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So consider giving some support.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
As little as fifteen dollars will score you "Fan Status"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which will give you one digital copy of the game for PC, Mac or Linux,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
an exclusive desktop wallpaper, and an exclusive tour of duty digital booklet.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.933
[Beginning of Dramatic Music]

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I am on a mission,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a mission of great importance,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and failure is not an option.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I will complete and deliver another awesome paintball videogame

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
with tournament level multiplayer functionality.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I can't do it alone

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so I'm building my team now.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Join me and help make Max'd 2 a reality.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
My name is Greg Hastings and this is my mission.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
[Dramatic Music Fades Out]

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
San Diego, California-based Dye Precision has acquired Pro-tec

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
from Vans for an undisclosed amount.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Pro-Tec, which will celebrate its 40th anniversary in 2013,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
came under the Vans umbrella a decade ago when the company acquired

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Mosa Extreme Sports in 2002.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The CEO of Dye had this to say,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"We are very excited about the acquisition of the Pro-tec brand,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The culture and history of the brand fits well within Dye,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and we are confident in our ability to further strengthen the brand and its product offerings."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Check this out. JT SplatMaster began airing National TV commercials

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
starting on November 19th.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Spread the word to all your Moms and Dads out there!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Our friend Gio at Tiberius Arms and Guerrilla Air

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
wants to make sure that all of you know that they're now accepting

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
team sponsorship applications for the 2013 season.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Both Tiberius Arms and Guerrilla Air. So, hit up the link below for an application.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
A new short film based on paintball is now available from

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
filmmakers Mike and Dan Palermo.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They started out making short videos in an effort to fight small town boredom,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but as their equipment list and technical know-how grew,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
they realized it was possible to have fun and make a living entertaining people.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It was a trifecta that proved to be a strong motivator.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So check out this latest effort, which features a special-unit Marine,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
who has to work with his squad in a personal battle to rescue his brother

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
who has been taken hostage by a band of trigger happy terrorists

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and their menacing leader, Colonel Vasquez.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The only thing that isn't real is the battlefield.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000

If you're looking for an International tourney this weekend,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
then be sure to attend the Ecuadorian Professional Paintball League's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Quito Open the 23rd through the 25th at Adrenalina Paintball Field de San Luis Shopping.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The organizers have worked for months to ensure a first class event

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
before, during, and after the tournament.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We are talking top notch event facilities and treatment for players and fans.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Vendors and techs from companies such as Dye, Planet Eclipse,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Empire, and HK Army will all be present.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They have plenty of seating, and hell, they even have a free open bar of mojito

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
thanks to Azuca Bar who will also be hosting a players party that evening.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The EPPL also scored some major sponsors such as Energizer,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Monster Energy Drink, Juan Valdez and more.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Ecuador is where it's at this weekend so get out of here now.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Free mojitos and paintball vs. cold turkey sandwiches - I know what I would pick!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This week we feature one viewer submitted channel and one of my own picks.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
First, some more International content's flowing from Monkey Media.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
They are a brand new paintball media company in the Netherlands

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So go check them out and after you're done there,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
check out my pick of the week, which is Hustle Paintball.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Sure, they sell the stuff, but they are working harder than most anyone else to bring

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
quality to their productions. So, for some quality video reviews,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
head on over to check out our friends at Hustle.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:41.000

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I'm Victor. I'm with Python Paintball. a5feedneck.com

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And what we've come up with is a power driven

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
alternative to the cyclone feed system.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
It's a plug and play. All you do is take the cyclone feed off.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Put our feed neck on. There is no modifications that need to be done to the gun.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Pop our feed neck on. Screw it in and you can now run any aftermarket

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
power driven hopper, the hopper of your choice, on top.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
That's all for this week.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving and be sure to get out there

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
