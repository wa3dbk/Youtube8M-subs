00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And now let's connect with the border, from where 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we have some images taken this morning by our correspondents deployed there. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Laia Bonet informs from Betlehem. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This morning we were amazed by the image of high

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 executives playing golf after they had partaken in the 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Christmas dinner served in the same club. The menu 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of the special dinner including acommodation was 360€. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is the of what those persons sitting on 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the border fence might make in a year. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is one of the images of extreme inequality

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 as it has been revealed by the last reports

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
from Oxfam and Caritas in Spain. The image of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
persons sitting on the fence has become a normal feature

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 in these last years. However, this situation 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
changed drastically when a numerous group climbed the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
fence from the other side of the border. Among these

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 persons there was a woman called Mary in advance

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 stage of pregnancy. She and her husband Joseph

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
had tried in vain to be looked after at a hospital in the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
neighbouring country because they were foreigners. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When the first fence was crossed, she broke waters. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
At that juncture, the couple decided to look for shelter 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
next to one of the other fences so as to give birth. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
On the other side an ox and a camel grazing 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
nearby came closer to the fence and they seemed

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.040
 to give some warmth to the baby and his mother. 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.000
When they realized what had happened, 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the rest of people organized a human chain to let them

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
get all the necessary items for the delivery, since 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
any kind of help was denied from our side of the fence. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It seems that if the child would have been born in our country,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
he would have had right to citizenship and there are strict 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.000
orders to avoid this at all costs. The “Romia Civil”,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
s the frontier police is called, has stated that 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
they had strict orders to prevent anybody the border

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
from crossing during these days and they have 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
unsuccessfully tried to carry out “hot devolutions”

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Mary has given birth during the night. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In the morning those sitting on the fence 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
have passed on the message that the baby was born.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They announced it like human loudspeakers

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 to all people of Gurugu Mountain who had come 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to the fence to bring items to the baby and his mother.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
At the end of the day and after much pressure 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
from newspapers, radios and TV, anonymous citizens 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and a request from change.org that collected more than

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
200 million signatures in one single day, kings

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and leaders from different countries have shown their

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
interest for the situation and the baby. Even some 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
of them have talked to the mother via mobile phone. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
All these leaders have decided to make a  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
gesture and, as a gift to the newborn child, they 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
decided to open the border fence so that all those 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
who wanted could cross the frontier. It was an implicit 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
recognition of the fact that all persons are equal and born. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
have the same rights no matter where they were 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
With the normal shouts of “Bossa, bossa” the citizens

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 crossed the border. Talking to  our cameras

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 they explained that tonight their saviour had been

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 born and they almost worshipped the baby

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Thus his parents have decided to call this boy Jesus,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 which in their language means saviour. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Authorities are now scared

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 since  they have now see that very reality that was

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
ignored  during so many years and now they are afraid.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It is not ruled out that on 28th, Innocents' Day, some 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
measures against the baby might be taken and another

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
tragedy might take place like the one of 4700 persons 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
who have officially lost their lives trying to cross borders. 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.000
