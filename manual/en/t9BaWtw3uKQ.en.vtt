The Benefits of Cast Film

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:18.020
In Cast Film we’re taking pvc, plasticizer
and different pigments and making them into

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.590
a paint, then we actually paint or coat it
right onto a substrate.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.539
We think of it as a substrate but you can
think of it as a mold.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.300
That’s why casting is called casting; you’re
painting right onto a mold.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.080
Now and you and I don’t normally think of
a mold as being 6,000 feet long and 60 inches

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.220
wide but it is a mold nonetheless.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.610
When we are done with that film the face that
you, the signwriter, use is actually the face

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.690
that was resting right on that mold.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.230
If we wanted to make a carbon fiber cast film
we’d cast on a carbon fiber base, if we

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.780
wanted to make a matte film we’d cast on
a matte base.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.520
The key here is that we made a paint.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.770
In making that paint we can use very high
molecular weight or large polymers to do that with;

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.229
molecules that are little difficult to deal with in their raw state but make a film that

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.820
is so stable in application that you almost
can’t do any better than that.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.320
Once the casting is finished you’ve got
a product that has gone through an oven “wet”,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.289
slowly dried out and finally brought up to
temperatures around 400°f in order to cure;

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:36.399
but when you cure materials with that high
of energy it usually means it takes a lot

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.299
of energy to destroy them, and that really
ends up being the difference.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.130
Cast is film is only two mils thick, calendered
film is almost three mils thick yet cast film

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.479
lasts almost twice as long.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.740
It goes through almost every application that
vinyl film can be put into and survive, calendered

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.720
film can cover about 70% of those applications
but it’s that top 30% that separates the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.350
men from the boys.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.250
You can see why cast film is a more expensive
product to buy,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.000
it is certainly a more expensive product to make.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.989
But when you go the other side of the coin
the end user benefits by all that because

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:26.040
you are able to make a thin film that is highly
flexible, completely malleable in areas such

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.240
as fenders and covering car mirrors and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.620
all kinds of things like that, including thermoforming,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.360
that calendered film doesn’t have a prayer at.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.549
The process of manufacturing a thermoformed
sign exposes the vinyl to very high heat,

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:50.051
over 400°F. At the same time it stretches
vinyl up to 50% while demanding that color

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.519
stay consistent and the film will last more
than seven years.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.079
Cast film is your only option.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.280
Now think about a vehicle wrap.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.239
A vehicle wrap is the hardest application
for vinyl; the film needs to be durable, conformable

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.829
and absolutely perfect: conforming to door
jams, deep channels and all those other difficult

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:18.449
areas of a vehicle is a job that only cast
film can do.
