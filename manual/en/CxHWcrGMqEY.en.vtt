Protein, protein, protein, that's what we
hear about as far as weight loss and diets

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.090
go these days. My name is Mark Brinson, Doctor
of Oriental Medicine, Human Performance and

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.499
Physical Medicine Specialist. With the popularity
of the Atkins Diet which recommended higher

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:19.010
amounts of protein, we've seen many, many
spin-offs are espousing that the more protein

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.939
you eat, you don't really have to worry about
calories and you'll naturally drop weight.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.160
Let me talk to you about that just a little
bit to make sure that you understand the mechanism

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.180
behind that. Our body does need high amounts
of protein, lean meats etc., in order to function

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.500
properly. It provides us a lot of amino acids,
which are the building blocks for not only

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.610
muscle, but also brain matter. In this day
and age protein seem to be a little bit harder

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.730
to come by rather than the carbohydrates that
are in every snack machine or that are very

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.120
simple and cheap to acquire. So, to an extent
we all do need to up our protein intake just

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.120
a little bit. But you don't want to go overboard
with it. Because if you're only eating proteins,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.170
there's a lot of things that you're body isn't
getting that can cause health problems, anything

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.610
from problems with the kidney, liver, even
problems somewhat in the intestines. So, eating

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.330
protein also can have kind of an effect of
being a diuretic, which is going to make you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.360
retain less water weight. So sometimes those
quick results that you get are only going

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.100
to last temporarily while you're on that high
protein or on your, or that diuretic type

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.050
diet. Now, generally speaking for health though,
I would recommend more protein than people

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.510
typically eat. So if you can get it in with
each meal great, or per day, that's fine as

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.220
well. In the proportions, when you're talking
about protein, carbohydrates and fats, protein

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.470
should be higher, maybe in the 40 to 60 percent
range. Then then the carbohydrates maybe in

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.860
around the 40 percent range, and the fats
in the 10 to 20. Now that carbohydrate is

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.240
definitely manipulable though. The more carbohydrates
that you eat that are complex, your vegetables

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.060
and fruits and things like that, the better.
