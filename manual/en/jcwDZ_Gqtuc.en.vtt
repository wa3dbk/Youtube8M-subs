This is Jessica Smith. I'm with Bland's Nursery
in West Jordan, Utah and today we are talking

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.830
about how you grow your own cut flowers. Cut
flowers can be perennial, annual, bi-annual.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.750
They can even be some flowering shrubs for
you. What you want to do is make sure you

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.070
get a nice combination of all different types
of flowers that you can cut. The best time

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.480
to cut flowers is in the early morning or
in the late evening hours. At this time they

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.820
are actually holding more water and nutrients.
In the middle of the day they are a little

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.610
more stressed. Now the cut flowers are going
to wilt irregardless. You are taking them

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.920
away from the mother plant. You want to get
a nice long stem for your ones, get a long

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.280
stem actually to begin with. You can always
cut it down because you are actually going

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.640
to take a little bit more off. You want to
cut right in front of the leaf so that the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.960
plant will actually produce more flowers again
for you and you cut at a slant. A slanted

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.210
cut will actually help the water take more,
or the plant will actually take more water

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.920
up. Don't use scissors or anything like that
or kitchen shears that can actually smash

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.740
the stock itself. Either use pruners or a
sharp knife. You want to pull off the bottom

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.079
leaves. You don't want these in the water.
Then you'll immerse it into some cold water.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.070
Before you go to arrange it you want to make
a new cut in the water and then put it into

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.299
the water of your vase or whatever it is you
are using on your arrangement. To preserve

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.729
your flowers a little longer make sure you
water daily and use a warm water. They'll

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.149
actually uptake the water better than they
will a cold water. You can use a commercial

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.920
preservative that you can buy from your local
floral shop or you can try some natural remedies,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.869
a copper penny with an aspirin, or lemon juice
or vinegar. A copper penny will help take

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.590
away some of the fungal problems in yeast
and the aspirin, lemon juice, and vinegar

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.920
will actually mix with the water and will
take away the bacteria. You will have all

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.160
these in the water. It's just what happens
with a cut flower. They naturally produce

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.360
these things. But like I say continually water
with some new water. You probably want to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.320
change it every now and again and you can
actually get your flowers to last longer for

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.370
you.
