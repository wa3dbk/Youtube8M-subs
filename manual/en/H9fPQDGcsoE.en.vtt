Hi I'm JA Donnelly for Expert Village and
today I'm going to talk to about four track

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:12.610
recording. Now that's multiple tracks playing
there, just to give you an idea. Playing the

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.170
Transport, the play from my keyboard, which
then goes via midi right to my software to

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:40.350
my track one. If I want to record that I hit
record, and play, and then after I record

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:51.750
I want to play it back, play all tracks, overdub
a new track. Basically you record one track

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.120
at a time, each instrument individually into
your four track depending what you are using.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.470
If you are using the onboard sequencer, you
could have a four track built in here, on

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.940
your computer, your software or your four
track. Most of the time it's more than four

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.610
track, I'm going to give you an idea. Next
we are going to do layering of different tracks

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.500
and different instruments. I just selected
drums now as a new track, okay! On my software

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.950
I'm showing you a keyboard because the drum,
this will be track two. I already did track

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:35.130
one, track one was a bass, track two is going
to be drums. I put the drums triggered here,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:49.270
little tom tom, bass, snare, okay we are going
to record that track now and as you recall

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.790
the transboard here is just your record button
just like on a cassette recorder, will midi

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.660
up to the recorder and I will hit record here.
That will start recording and as soon as I

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:23.319
start playing, it will record of course. Hit
stop! If I like that, I hit rewind here and

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.810
I'm going to play it back. So now I'm going
to play back the track that we just recorded.
