00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:11.010
Bacteria lives everywhere, the sky, the earth,
the oceans, and IN YOUR BEARD! *pointing*

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.249
Sup guys, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.809
I am going to shampoo the crap out of my face
after this one.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.200
Recently, the Daily Mail Online reported an
interview with a trichologist from the Birmingham

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.710
Trichology Center[1] and she said, facial
hair is "courser than other hair, so traps

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.510
dirt and germs more easily."

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.570
So we wanted to know, on behalf of my bearded
brethren, are beards gross and germy!?!

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.800
Is this a thing?!

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.740
Human skin is covered microbes, including
bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses and mites[2].

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.090
Constantly.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.329
Don't reach for the antibacterial whatever,
most of it is either good for you, or harmless.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.660
In fact, a study in Nature looking at the
diversity of bacteria on our skin[3] found

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.910
different parts of the skin have different
species of bacteria.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.780
For example, the bottom of the heel alone
has 80 different species of bacteria living

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.780
there.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.200
Most of the skin is considered a harsh environment
for bacteria -- But in folds of skin, darker

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.190
wetter areas like underarms, or oily spots
like behind the ear -- bacteria thrive[4].

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.581
According to Skin Pharmacology &amp; Physiology,
25% of our bacterial population live in the

00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:18.890
hair follicles![5] Again, this is completely
normal, and CAN be beneficial.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.820
Other studies have shown washing your face
won't clear all the bacteria.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.960
In fact, in the 1960s, a U.S. Army microbiologist
researcher[6] looked into the ability of beard

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.190
hair to hold bacteria and transmit it to other
people.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.450
Researchers sprayed beards with non-infectious
bacteria; allowed them to rest in the hair

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.770
for a while -- and then washed.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.119
After the cleaning, there was STILL enough
bacteria to spread disease.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.750
This experiment has been repeated a number
of times with similar results.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.090
And mustaches aren't safe either.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.210
According a specialist from Queen's University
in Canada, mustaches are hotbeds for bacteria

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.869
because of the moist air leaving the body
through the nose and mouth.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.540
Thus, even MORE bacteria.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.610
I KNEW mustaches were gross!

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.390
I KNEW IT.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.739
After a study published in the journal Microbiology
and Immunity[7], repeated the experiment (yet

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.150
again) they claimed we should find a way to
decontaminate human hair.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.150
Soâ€¦

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.790
I'm sorry to say friends, beards probably
have bacteria in them.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.780
BUT in case it hasn't become clear yet; it's
NOT JUST BEARDS.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.280
Scientists from the University of Arizona
tested the hairbrushes of 30 different women,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.069
and found 20 percent more bacteria living
on the brush than on the bathroom sink[8].

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.240
The brushes contained dead skin, oil and (obviously)
hair!

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.629
Okay, okay, I'll stop fear-mongering; remember,
the flora which live in and on our bodies

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.750
ISN'T going to harm us; it's symbiotic.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.100
It feeds on our oils and dead skin cells.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.130
the bacteria living in your beard is the same
that lives on your skin, and it's ALWAYS THERE.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.590
Shaving won't rid you of this evil beard bacteria.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.830
If, for some reason, you ARE worried; all
bacteria can be managed by regular hygiene:

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.660
shampoo or soap your hair to cut oil and thus
bacterial load.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.260
Also, just a general non-gross rule, make
sure there's no FOOD caught in your beard!

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.840
Sure, humans are gross and icky and whatever,
but we've been this way for millions of years!

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.160
Why worry about it now?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.140
If you're questioning your facial hair now,
you should watch my video about how we've

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.040
reached PEAK BEARD.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040
Beards are SO OVER.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040
They're NOT SEXY anymore.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040
That's why I straddle the divide with this
half-beard.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.049
