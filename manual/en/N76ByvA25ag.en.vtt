00:00:40.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And just above us, the port wing bridge is where Dick Quincy was stationed.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You should be able to see that foremast laying down on the deck.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Coming up to the break,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and there's the foremast on deck.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:45.000
[We're now turning towards starboard, and the break in the ship.]

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Just to let you know, the ship goes further forward as you approach starboard so you may be coming up on structure.  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This is the torpedo impact zone.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Looking inside the dry storage -

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's a great image isn't Chris, the boat davits in their launched position; a great reflection of what was going on 62 years ago.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So we're now passing forward of the bridge house, coming up to the starboard wing bridge.
