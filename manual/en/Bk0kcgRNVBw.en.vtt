00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.380
So I wanted to go ahead and go over vaccinations
with Kim and talk about what we think is necessary

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.820
for cats that are kept inside. So has this
cat had any vaccines yet? No. Okay. We're

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.589
going to start a vaccine program today. And
we kind of gage all of our vaccination programs

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:25.630
on where your cat's going to be and how your
cat is exposed to other diseases. People that

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.119
keep your cats inside like you've recommended,
or like you said you're going to eliminate

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.110
some of the vaccines that we don't need to
give all the time. Other vaccines are so important

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.620
because they carry human health hazards with
them that they're mandatory whether they're

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.620
in the house or not. Other vaccines we give
them to the cats and they're covering them

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.440
for a lethal disease. If they get feline aids
or feline leukemia they die of it. And so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.699
that's why we think those are vaccines that
really should be done on all cats. So let's

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.960
just start out and go through the different
ones that we're going to do today. We have

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.340
what we call a distemper shot and that covers
the upper respiratory as well as a couple

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.580
of other common diseases that all cats need
to be protected from. The distemper actually

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.030
is part of it that prevents them from getting
this distemper problem where cats get panleukopenia.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.420
Panleukopenia simply means that because they
get this virus all their waste cells die out

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.990
and they can die of that. So it's very, very
lethal to cats and it's going to be one of

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.151
the ones we cover today. The other thing that
we wanted to do today s the distemper shot,

00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:41.320
in addition to the distemper shot I mean is
to get your cat started on a leukemia program.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.531
Again, leukemia is a disease that if your
cat gets it they die of it and so we want

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:49.950
to get your cat started on this vaccine right
away to prevent your cat from getting it.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.340
It's transmitted by another cat biting your
cat and so you've limited the cats exposure

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.100
to it by keeping him inside. But we think
that a marauder cat could break in or in a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.050
rainstorm your cat could get out and you don't
know it and get bitten by another cat and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.740
this way they're always protected. If it was
a virus that just made your cat sick for a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.319
little while and it had to be transmitted
by another cat we may not do it but this is

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.800
a lethal virus that could kill your cat so
we think it's important. Later we're going

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.950
to do some other vaccines. When we talk about
other vaccines at our next visit we're going

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.750
to want to also update your cat and get him
started on a rabies program. Rabies is another

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.650
virus that can be transmitted from the wildlife
into our cats and dogs. And it's lethal for

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.159
humans as well as cats. And so again we think
all cats should be vaccinated for rabies because

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.739
if your cat were to get rabies chasing a bat
or something like that and to bite you then

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.939
you'd have to get the shots and everything.
So it's a lethal, another lethal disease but

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.549
also it has a human health aspect to it, too,
because we can get it. So those are the basic

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.670
vaccines that we think that all cats should
have. There are a few other vaccines so if

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.519
you start letting your cat out then we should
talk about those but since your cat's going

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.721
to be inside as we recommended with most,
we wonâ€™t deal with that today. I wanted

00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:09.109
to give you this brochure. This talks about
feline aids, it's one of the diseases that

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.409
we're discussing today and I want you to read
through that and if you have any questions

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.560
about it. Now this is the one about leukemia.
Leukemia is the disease we talked about that's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.000
lethal and we want you to have this brochure
so that you can go ahead and read through

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.029
that.
