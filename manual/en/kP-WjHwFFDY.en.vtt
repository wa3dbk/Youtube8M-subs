00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.650
Think scientists have anatomy and physiology
all figured out?

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.910
Think again!

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.720
Hi everyone!

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.690
Crystal here for DNews talking about how the
more scientists learn about the body, the

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.700
less we really seem to know … what am I
talking about?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.910
A recent discovery by scientists at the University
of Virginia revealed a connection between

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.480
the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune
system that had gone unnoticed for centuries.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.439
This discovery challenges current theories
about basic brain-body interactions and could

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.270
throw our current ideas on the development
of some neurological diseases completely out

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.270
the window!

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.200
After learning about this discovery, one scientist
was quoted as saying “they’ll have to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.570
rewrite the textbooks.”

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.370
I find results like these so exciting because
they demonstrate that the pursuit of new knowledge

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.760
is a dynamic process.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.100
In the journal Nature, the scientists from
UVA’s School of Medicine reported the existence

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.970
of previously unknown vasculature carrying
immune cells between the meninges -the protective

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.580
tissue around the brain- and the cervical
lymph nodes that are the hubs of our immune

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.580
system.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.980
This discovery was made the same way a lot
of big scientific discoveries are made: by

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.980
accident.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.930
A scientist developing a new way to prepare
slides of intact mouse meningeal tissue noticed

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
an unexpected pattern of immune cells in the
tissue under his microscope, and, because

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.720
he’s a scientist, he just had to know why.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.180
In science, unexpected results can mean big
discoveries and this was no exception.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.650
In addition to draining interstitial fluids,
classic lymphatic vessels carry the white

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.360
blood cells of the immune system throughout
the body.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.080
Prior to the discovery of these new vessels,
no direct link between the brain and spinal

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.270
cord and the Immune system had been found
and it was thought that the brain was an area

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.380
of mild “immune privilege” meaning able
to tolerate insult or disease exposure without

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.360
eliciting a rush of inflammation to the affected
region.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.400
This assumption left scientists in the dark
about the mechanisms behind many neurological

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.710
diseases that involve altered immunity.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.320
But now that this connection has been discovered,
there is already speculation about whether

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.530
impaired drainage or malfunction of these
newly discovered lymphatic vasculature could

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.869
contribute to the buildup of plaques in Alzheimer's
disease, and scientists have a new place to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.740
look when investigating the immune attacks
experienced by patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.750
The discovery of direct interaction between
the CNS and the immune system changes how

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.620
we think about the brain’s response to injury
and the development of disease.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.680
Obviously, more research is needed and these
groundbreaking results are nonetheless preliminary.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.159
But this exciting discovery will lead to further
investigation into the vasculature structure

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.629
surrounding the human brain and hopefully
a more detailed understanding of human health

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.930
and physiology.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.279
On the topic of new discoveries, some scientists
are finding that young blood might have rejuvenating

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.920
properties - at least in mice - but they’re
still trying to figure out why.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.519
