00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.450
Nice to meet you.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.590
Are you a youkai?

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.590
Yeah, I'm a normal boundary youkai.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.290
You have an interesting power.
Aren't you having a hard time living with humans?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.570
Yes, I wish...

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.440
I wish I was born as a youkai.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.440
Funny to hear you say that. Though if you wish...

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.880
I can teach you about that...

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.250
Fu fu ~ You're a funny youkai.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.220
- My name is Yuko Saigyouji.
- I'm Yukari Yakumo.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.590
Saigyou-Ayakashi?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.700
Yeah, that gigantic cherry-tree monster.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.530
If possible, I want to seal it...

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.730
Yuko! I've finally mastered the secret of Sealing Border!

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.140
We can seal that cherry-tree togeth...

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.490
Daughter of Fujimi,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.800
when the Saigyou Ayakashi blooms perfectly

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.500
and the border between life and death is complete,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.770
your soul will rest in peace in Hakugyokuro Shrine,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.210
and I will seal the Cherry Blossom, placing it as the border.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.080
I wish...

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.280
She will never suffer pain again...

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.950
To never ever reincarnate again to suffer...

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.960
Wah!~
Woah!

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.830
Hellooo, Ms. Yukari.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.800
Wh... who are you?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.370
This is Chen, my shikigami, I've just recently contracted her.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.340
Funny cat, I'd say...

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.210
Ms. Yukari, why are you depressed like that?

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.750
Hey, you should have a smile all the time!
Naa~?

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.220
- Chen! What are you thinking, forcing her to smile?
- Unyaaa~!

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.960
Fufu~

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.160
I'm off to Hakugyokuro Shrine for a bit.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.040
Stop! Youkai over there!

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.650
What are you doing in this place?

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.150
As Youki Konpaku, the keeper of Saigyouji,
I will not let you...

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.660
Eh...?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.930
Nevermind, you may enter this place.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.440
Master!

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.940
Why did you allow such a youkai to pass the gate!?

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.480
- Listen Youmu, she is a dear friend of our Lady Yuyuko.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.150
... are you sure such a youkai is?

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.650
You will see someday.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.450
Maybe it's time for me to retire...

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.960
Ms. Yukari, you may retreive what you once lost.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.360
You can restart all over again.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.430
And again, it will be...

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.950
Nice to meet you.
