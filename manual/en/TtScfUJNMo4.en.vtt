&gt;&gt; Hi Mrs. Hexman this
is Amy, my name's Andrea.

00:00:02.526 --> 00:00:02.596
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:04.396
&gt;&gt; She's a Penn College
student nurse

00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:05.736
and we're gonna put
an IV in today.

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:07.246
I'm gonna talk her through it.

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.806
Are you ok with her doing this?

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:10.356
&gt;&gt; Yep I'm fine.

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:12.356
&gt;&gt; Ok. You want to get all
of your supplies around.

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:12.476
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:14.046
[ background music ]

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.606
&gt;&gt; When I got pregnant
and I was going

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:18.556
to my doctor appointments
the nurses just made me feel

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:22.606
so unbelievably you know
special and cared for

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:27.116
and like I was the first patient
they had ever seen you know just

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:30.176
made me feel that cared for
that I thought to myself

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:32.156
if I can make somebody
feel the same way

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:33.846
that they're making me
feel, that's what I want

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.186
to be able to do with my life.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:37.946
&gt;&gt; Hi my name is Amy Vanderwall.

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:42.636
I'm a senior Bachelor of Nursing
student here at Penn College.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:47.546
[ music ]

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:50.526
Right now we're standing
in one of the best parts

00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:53.876
that I think the nursing program
at Penn College has to offer

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:55.426
and it's the nursing lab.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:57.156
I would say as far as practicing

00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:00.406
in the lab definitely your first
year in nursing school you're

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:03.606
in here a lot, learning a
lot of the skills and then

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:06.316
as time progresses we're
in here less and we're

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.906
out in the clinical setting more
but at first we're definitely

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:10.966
in here a lot learning how
to take care of patients,

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.736
learning all of the
skills, catheters,

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:15.056
traches, things like that.

00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:19.076
&gt;&gt; His hand against.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.496
&gt;&gt; one of my favorite parts
in the labs is SimMan

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:25.576
and this is SimMan and if you
can see SimMan is actually

00:01:25.576 --> 00:01:26.836
breathing on his own.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:31.056
SimMan will talk, SimMan has a
heart monitor hooked up to him,

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:35.066
oxygen supply, blood
pressure cuff, he has an IV,

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.386
so he is pretty well set
up as if he were a patient

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:39.636
in a hospital setting.

00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:42.586
Basically what would happen
is the instructor chooses the

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:47.496
scenario and then the students
choose what interventions we

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:50.666
need to do to help this
patient and so when we get

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.346
out into the hospital setting,
or the nursing home setting,

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.356
or wherever we might
be, we're with real people

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:59.836
and would much rather
practice here on SimMan

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.776
and learn my skills here
and then when you get

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:04.976
out into the clinical setting
it is so much more comfortable.

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:10.606
[ music ]

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:14.696
I came in older, you
know not just straight

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:18.686
out of high school person,
pregnant and came in right

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:21.056
at the last minute and
said I have decided I want

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:22.946
to do nursing, this
is what I want to do

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:26.186
and the nursing department
did everything possible

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:28.346
to make that happen for me.

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.096
&gt;&gt; What was the website
Hope was talking about?

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:35.366
&gt;&gt; My classes this year are about
20 people and we've all been

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:38.586
with each other for the past
3 years so we know each other

00:02:38.586 --> 00:02:43.346
and we're a tiny little family
that is able to get along and go

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:44.826
through this experience
together.

00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:48.386
I know a lot of the
professors well enough they ask

00:02:48.446 --> 00:02:53.116
about you know my life outside
of school, my life in school,

00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:55.686
they care how things are
going with the semester,

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:56.986
they want to see you do well.

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:00.216
Classes are extremely intense.

00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:05.036
Med surge nursing, OB,
pediatrics, mental health,

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:09.896
med surge 2, cardiac, but I
love them and I've learned

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:11.406
such an incredible amount.

00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:15.266
After the past 4 years I sit
down and have conversations

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:18.096
with people and I think wow
4 years ago I would not have

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:19.396
understood a thing I just said.

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:28.206
[ music ]

00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:32.236
All the different units in
the hospitals, nursing homes,

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:37.346
different community
organizations and schools,

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:39.896
I mean I've been in all of
those places for clinical.

00:03:40.716 --> 00:03:42.706
It's great to be able
to go to an employer

00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:45.286
and say yes I've had
experience on all

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:46.746
of these multiple
different units,

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:48.576
and these different
organizations.

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:53.306
What I'm thinking about right
now is medical surgical nursing

00:03:53.636 --> 00:03:58.126
or emergency trauma nursing
because you are able to use all

00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:01.396
of these skills that we've
practiced over the past 4 years

00:04:01.756 --> 00:04:03.656
and see them all
with actual patients.

00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:07.866
&gt;&gt; We're gonna [inaudible] good
and then you can slowly flush.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:10.776
&gt;&gt; The number one
thing in nursing is

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:11.876
to be the patient advocate,

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:14.866
to be able to always
do what is right

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:17.616
for the patient is the
best feeling in the world

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:21.366
because how else would you be
able to justify being a nurse

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.626
or being in the medical field
caring for people's lives

00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:25.256
without doing what's
right for them.

00:04:25.586 --> 00:04:29.386
I'm extremely happy being
in the nursing field.

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:32.316
I have goals now.

00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:36.136
I have a vision of where I
want to be in the future.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:39.006
I know that I want to
help people and help them

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:40.986
to get healthy, to stay healthy.

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:48.106
I know that's what I
want to do with my life.
