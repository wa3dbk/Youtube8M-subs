00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.210
The University of Wisconsin's campus is
situated on 900 rolling acres on the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.950
shores of Lake Mendota in Madison,
Wisconsin. Besides being Wisconsin's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.780
capital, Madison is a vibrant city with
a quality of life that appeals to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.140
everybody. Madison has many civic and
cultural activities as well as sporting

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.120
events, great restaurants, and shopping
areas. Madison is also a safe city.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.740
Many residents enjoy outdoor activities year round.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.520
We build our program on four basic
principles:

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.360
Love,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.200
trust,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.540
which any relationship has to have to be
successful,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.980
commitment,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.940
and a belief.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.380
The belief in the program.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.020
The belief in one another.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.260
Belief in the plan.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.620
Belief in the University.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.140
The University of Wisconsin
football program is on the move.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.560
With the hiring of Barry Alvarez 
as head coach in 1990, the University

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.540
athletic board demonstrated a renewed
commitment to football success at Wisconsin.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.679
Barry Alvarez came to Wisconsin
from winning programs in Notre Dame

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.750
and the University of Iowa and is
now building the UW program stressing

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.020
fundamentals, a positive attitude, and a
caring atmosphere.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.960
All of the ingredients for success are here,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.940
a great academic institution, 
an experienced coaching staff

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.600
dedicated to building a winning tradition,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.020
the biggest factor for me was 
coach Alvarez and his staff, you know,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.400
he comes with from a big name, from Notre Dame,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.640
and his coaching staff comes from
Iowa, you know.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.180
So they're big name people and there's no question they're going to turn this program around.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.880
That was definitely the main thing. It's going to be a challenge to turn it around,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.020
and I want to be part of that challenge.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.400
If you decide to attend University of Wisconsin,
I can promise you three things.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.240
Number one, get an opportunity for a great education.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.840
Two, play championship football
in a great conference.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.700
And three, get great coaching by 
people who care about you.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.680
It's exciting to see a program building,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.140
to see a program well coached,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.140
to see young people out on our playing fields that are excited about what they're doing.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.420
They're having fun out there.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.180
It's very clear that Barry Alvarez
and the coaches that he has brought in

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.320
are absolutely first-rate. They're
bringing out the best in these young people.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.700
The young men that are going out
to play football at Wisconsin are excited.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.160
They're having fun out there.
They're clearly working very hard,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.320
and I can't tell you how excited this community is.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.460
The only thing we're missing on the road to the 
Rose Bowl is you.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.755
Get the most of your college experience,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.920
join us in Madison,
at the University of Wisconsin
