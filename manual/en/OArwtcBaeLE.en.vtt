Changing Brake Fluid Video - Advance Auto
Parts

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.000
Bryan: Welcome to today's Video Clinic, Changing
Brake Fluid.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.370
So much of
the time we talk about what makes a vehicle

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.370
run.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.880
Perhaps the most important
thing is, what makes a vehicle stop.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.110
Jim:That's right, and changing brake fluid
can be very controversial.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.030
Manufacturer to manufacturer, they disagree
as to exactly when it should be

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.030
done.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.270
But we know it should be done because brake
fluid can get

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.290
contaminated.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.720
It absorbs moisture and it can cause fading,
brake fluid

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.890
boiling and it can even destroy expensive
ABS components.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.690
Bryan: That's right and this is a really easy
job if you use the right

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.070
tools, which we have, and we're going to show
you how to do that today.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.830
You've got about an hour, this is something
you need to consider doing

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.320
every time you change brake pads.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.680
Jim: Let's take a look at the things that
you'll need to do the job right.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.239
You'll want to look at your owner's manual
or check with an Advance Auto

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.129
Parts' team member, to find out if you'll
need DOT3 or DOT4 brake fluid.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.620
Brian: Lot of great options out there for
brake fluid folks.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.150
Today we're
going to use the Valvoline synthetic brake

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.989
fluid which actually exceeds
DOT3 and DOT4 standards, great in all ABS

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:02.989
systems.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.510
Jim: Another thing to consider is how you're
going to bleed the system.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.460
You can either use a one man brake bleeder
like this.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.450
Many people like
this because you can do this all by yourself,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.140
at each individual wheel
cylinder.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.350
Brian: Or you can use another really nifty
tool, both available at Advance

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.350
Auto Parts.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.439
We really like this, it's a vacuum pump.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.759
We're going to
suction the old fluid out of the master cylinder

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.329
as well as bleed the lines
and fill the lines with the new brake fluid,

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.329
using this tool.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.119
Jim: The first step is to put the canister
on the pump, that's provided

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.119
with it.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.079
This becomes the reservoir, and now we drain
the master cylinder.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.880
Brian: You need to make sure you get the tube
all the way down into the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.149
bottom of the reservoir.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.580
There's usually a primary and secondary
reservoir.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.539
We made sure the tube is all the way down
in, to pick up all

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.250
the fluid possible.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.020
You can see how quickly the reservoir fills
up and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.211
look how brown this fluid is.

00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:51.249
You can tell that it's old, worn brake
fluid.

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.200
Jim: I like having a rag handy.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200
Brian: Great idea.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.140
Jim: So brake fluid doesn't get all over the
paint and things.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.210
Now get
yourself a nice clean rag, and try to get

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.619
out as much of the dirt as you
can around the inside of the reservoir, and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.050
the outside of the neck.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.090
So
that we have a nice clean place to start with.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.580
Brian: So working as quickly as possible so
we can get that lid back on the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.090
master cylinder, we're going to go ahead and
add the new synthetic fluid.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.480
Just fill it to the line level where it says
"full."

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.720
Almost all master
cylinders show you where full is.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.960
Jim: OK, it's full, Brian, and I'm going to
put the cap on as quickly as

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.800
possible, to keep the air out.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.830
Brian: We're at the back of the vehicle now.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.370
We've actually got all four
wheels removed so you can see what we're doing.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.200
This particular vehicle
has drum brakes on the back, so on the back

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.950
of the backing plate, you can
see the bleeder valve.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.920
I'll pull the rubber boot off, and expose
the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.459
bleeder valve.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.250
So we're using the same vacuum pump that we
used to drain the master

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.540
cylinder reservoir.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.239
It simply connects to the back of the bleeder
valve,

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.939
like so.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.370
We take, in this case, a three-eighth's wrench,
Jim has given us

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.590
a good pedal full of pressure.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.030
Loosen the bleeder valve, and you can see
it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.720
coming out the line along with a few air bubbles.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.739
This truck did have a
spongy pedal, and that's probably the air

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.599
bubbles that we're seeing right
now.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.959
You can see the old, contaminated fluid coming
out.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.840
Give it about 15
or 20 pumps.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.860
Go ahead and tighten your bleeder valve back
up, and we've got

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.560
to add some fluid to the master cylinder reservoir
up front now, and we'll

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.700
do this again.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.870
Well, I've completed the passenger side front
of the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.510
vehicle which is the third fartherest wheel
from the master cylinder.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.230
Now
we're working on the driver's side front which

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.909
is basically right below the
master cylinder.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.989
You can see the brake line as it travels down,
comes into

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.790
the caliper, and again we're attached to the
bleeder valve.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.610
We go ahead
and crack open the bleeder valve, and drain

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.660
the rest of the contaminated
fluid out of that line.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.790
Pump the pump a few times, watch for the air
bubbles to dissipate.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.819
There you go, you can see the golden brown,
solid line and the tubing

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.409
coming off the bleeder valve.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.469
That means we've got all the new brake fluid
filled into the caliper and no air bubbles.

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:04.469
We're just about done.

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.041
We're
going to top off the master cylinder and we'll

00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:07.120
be ready for a test drive.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.349
Jim: It's a good idea to take time to check
the brake pads and the rotors

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.940
while we've got the wheels off.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.320
And also make sure there's no fluid on any
of those components that would indicate a

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320
leak.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.829
Brian: Now in some vehicles, when the job
is complete, the brake pedal may

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.560
go almost to the floor and you might get an
ABS light coming on.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.610
After you
pump the brake pedal up 10 to 15 times, it

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.420
will firm up and be near or
better where that pedal was located before

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.720
you started the job, and the ABS
light should go off after the car ignition

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.910
is turned off and then on again.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.850
If it doesn't go off, unhook your battery,
the negative terminal, so the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.390
computer will reset.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.440
So we spent about an hour changing the brake
fluid on

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.440
this Dodge truck.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.640
We had the right tools for the job, which
is key.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.230
We've
got a great pedal and I'm looking forward

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.230
to the test drive.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.361
Jim: That's right, so the next time you're
changing your brake pads, go

00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:55.730
ahead and spend the extra hour and change
your brake fluid.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.480
It's a great
investment in your safety.
