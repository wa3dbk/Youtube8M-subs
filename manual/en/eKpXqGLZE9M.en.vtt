00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.870
How to Do an Ollie.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.690
Invented by Alan "Ollie" Gelfand in 1977,
the Ollie is a skateboarding trick where the

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.090
rider pops the tail of his skateboard into
the air and then jumps with the board ‘stuck’

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.859
to his or her feet.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:28.509
You will need Skateboard Flat, dry surface
Practice and courage, stamina, and the willingness

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.519
to fall down.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.250
Always wear protective clothing, including
a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, kneepads,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.110
and appropriate footwear.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.720
Skateboarding is not recommended for children
under the age of 6, and children between the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.810
ages of 6 and 10 should only be allowed to
ride with adult supervision.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.810
Step 1.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.960
The easiest way to perform this trick is by
using a rolling start, rather than standing

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.960
still.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.930
Begin by pushing the board forward at a comfortable
speed--the faster you go, the better the “pop.”

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.550
Because of the way the board flies off the
ground, this trick was initially known as

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.440
the "Ollie pop.”

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.440
Step 2.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.690
While moving forward, place your front foot
about halfway up the board at a slight forward

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.820
angle, and put the ball of your back foot
on the center of the tail.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.710
Your toes on your front foot should be near
the skateboard’s outer edge.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.710
Step 3.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.460
With both feet on the board, lift the heel
of your back foot so your weight is on the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.500
ball of your foot and your toes.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.710
Step 4.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.840
Squat your body down in a crouch in preparation
to spring upward.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.409
The lower you bend your knees, the higher
your board will fly into the air.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.450
Step 5.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.060
As you straighten your legs to start the jump,
stomp your back foot down so you smack the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.240
tail of your board to the ground.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.540
Step 6.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.890
As the tail hits the ground, jump off your
back foot into the air.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.200
Turn your front foot in until the side of
your shoe rubs against your grip tape at the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960
top of the skateboard.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.990
Lift your front leg, dragging it up the board
toward the nose.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.990
Step 7.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.840
Push your front foot forward and tuck your
knees to your chest, which will pull the skateboard

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.229
with you into the air.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.950
Be sure to pick up your back foot as well,
because that levels out the board horizontally.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.759
If you lose your balance in midair, try to
relax.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.790
Rather than sticking out your hands to break
your fall (which can result in broken bones),

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.190
tuck your body into a ball and roll to the
ground on the fleshy parts of your frame.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.190
Step 8.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.319
Now that you’ve leveled out, straighten
your legs a little bit and let gravity bring

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.750
you back down toward the ground.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.750
Step 9.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.040
To land the trick, bend your knees as you
touch down, making sure both feet are squarely

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.940
on the board and on your grip tape.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.550
Then roll away, leaving mouths agape with
your new shredding skills!

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.660
Did you know The world record for the most
Frontside Ollies off of a halfpipe ramp is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.750
34, which was set by Sascha Müller of Germany
on July 5, 2005.
