in an Iron Man Mouse because your workload

and douse the flames!….oh wait was that

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.409
beanie.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.360
But if the zombies do appear use your team
fortress atomizer bat to take care of business.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.000

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.300
stack the little deadly pikachus on top of
a sleeping snorlax - or maybe it’s time
