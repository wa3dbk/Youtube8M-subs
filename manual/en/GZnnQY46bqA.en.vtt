00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.709
E. coli O157:H7 produces a toxin when it’s
in the human body that is excreted from the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:16.500
bacteria and, if it enters the blood stream,
can cause severe, severe illness.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.500
The normal illness that can be ascribed to
E. coli O157:H7 is Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.890
or HUS, and that has caused untold deaths
and severe illness in the United States and,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.750
frankly, throughout the world.
It is everywhere. It used to be thought of,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.899
primarily still, a reservoir in cattle, but
we’ve been finding it in buffalo, sheep,

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.170
goats, deer, they even found it in a trout
in a lake.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.940
These are bacteria that are fecal in origin,
that come from animals other than us, and

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.750
that in our body, our body doesn’t tolerate
them.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.189
E. coli and other bacteria are especially
dangerous to the young and the elderly because,

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.689
in the young, their immune system is not fully
developed, and, in the elderly, their immune

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:21.399
system has been compromised.
E. coli O157:H7 symptoms are pretty classic.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.520
3-4 days after the ingestion of the bacteria,
it’s cramping. It’ll then turn to bloody

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.590
diarrhea. Bloody diarrhea is the hallmark
of an E. coli O157:H7 infection. Most people

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:44.840
recover. Some 90% of the people within 10
days will start to get better, but it is a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.840
very horrible experience and very painful.
5-10% of people will go on to develop complications

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.439
and may require hospitalization. And then
a percentage of them will go on to develop

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.659
acute kidney failure, and, unfortunately,
sometimes death.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.670
For consumers, paying attention to where you
are buying your food, you know, handling it

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.420
properly and cooking it thoroughly is the
best thing you can do to protect your family.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:25.060
To think about the risky products that are
out there: sprouts, hamburger, raw milk, leafy

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.950
greens. Things that have caused illness in
the past.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.560
Make sure that if you are going to use those
products, and some of them, frankly, I don’t

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.060
think you should, but if you are going to
use those products, you should take extreme

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.660
caution.
