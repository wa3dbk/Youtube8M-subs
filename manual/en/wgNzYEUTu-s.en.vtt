Hi, this is Matt on behalf of Expert Village,
and today we're going to learn how to make

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.680
my Chinese chicken fried rice. Okay, so now
that we have our onions cut and also I just

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.580
want to stress the importance of having a
big cutting board. Because then you can just

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.490
kind of move each vegetable after you prepare
them, move them to their own space. You have

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.929
a lot of room. This one's pretty big. I've
seen bigger, but this one's definitely decent

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.820
sized. So anyway let's work on our peppers
now. So we're going to take our red pepper

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:38.500
and we're going to do is we're going to cut
around the stalk, like so. And then, you can

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.620
just lift it out with a knife and there, it's
gone. Now we also have the seeds and everything

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.640
inside, so we definitely want to get rid of
that. So let's just cut it right down the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.110
middle here and let's just go to our waste
bowl and we're just going to get all the stuff

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.761
that we're not going to, just get all the
waste, the stuff that we're not going to use,

00:00:56.761 --> 00:01:01.800
like the seed, and the gristle, we're not
going to use that. So let's just get that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:12.249
out of the way. Okay, okay, that looks pretty
good. So now we're going to cut, we're going

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:20.630
to cut our peppers. So let's just start with
this one. I'm just going, I want finely diced

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.159
peppers for our rice. So just take a few,
you know and just with your finger, use it

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:41.649
as a guide and cut back, just, you know, really
small little pieces like so. And then, let's

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.679
get a couple of these here that I missed.
Then we're just going to move those to their

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.679
own little spot. So, and we're going to do
the same thing. I have the red peppers here,

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.310
I'll finish those in a minute. We have the
same thing with the green pepper, we're just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:05.060
going to cut around the stalk, like
so. You can just lift that out. Oop, I caught

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.009
it, there you go. Then you cut this right
down the middle and we're just going to get

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.040
rid of the stuff we're not going to use, like
the seeds and the white, the gristle here.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:29.070
Just get that out of there. Do the same thing
for this one. There's a lot of seeds in this.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.460
Okay, and we're going to do the same as we
did the red pepper. We're just going to cut

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:43.780
a few slices, so it's easily manageable. And
then we're just going, with our finger as

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:55.400
a guide, just cut small pieces, like so. There
you have it, and I'm just going to move those

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.870
with the red peppers because they're peppers,
same family, just different color. Okay, wonderful,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.840
I'm going to finish this up here and then
we'll move on to our next step.
