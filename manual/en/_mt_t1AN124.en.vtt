Hey everybody, welcome to PROlike gear, where we make builds for your 
 set looking and working like professional products but being inexpensive.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:36.809
My name is Jano Kaltenbach and I like to welcome you to the new episode. It took some 
 time to produce it, I am sorry about that - I had a lot to do.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.209
Today we have this: The PROlike Anamorphic Lens Filter. An anamorphic lens is used 
 in professional cinematograhpy to crop the image without the lose of quality.

00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:57.545
And there are some sideeffects of this procedure: 1. an 
 oval shaped bokeh and 2. streaking lens flares.

00:00:58.026 --> 00:01:00.026
Both of these effects you can see in many professional made movies. Some days ago I saw 
 a filter on the internet that can be mounted on a DSLR camera and it adds

00:00:58.026 --> 00:01:10.405
Both of these effects you can see in many professional made movies. Some days ago I saw a 
 filter on the internet that can be mounted on a DSLR camera and it adds 

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:18.032
streaking lensflares and the oval shaped bokeh. So it looks like 
 you are filming with a real anamorphic lens. 

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:38.480
The filter is pretty cheap - something like 100€ - compared to an anamorphic lens for 10000€. But for me this is 
 still a lot of money to spend - so I build it for myself for around 1€! Check out the trailer!

00:02:46.827 --> 00:03:00.320
You see? Looks a lot more like a real film look.  With no post 
 production at all! So let me show you how to build this little thing.

00:03:01.134 --> 00:03:11.390
You just need three simple parts: Something to mount the filter to your camera. You can fold 
 a simple cup out of paper or use a broken UV filter like I did.

00:03:12.872 --> 00:03:27.570
Then we need black paper and a scissor. And last but not least a transparent string or fishing line. 
 We cut out an oval shape with the sizes of given in the template under this link.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:36.950
then we have to glue the string straight through the center of 
 the oval shape and add everything to our filter mount. 

00:03:38.943 --> 00:03:45.910
And that's already everything - you just saved 100 or even 10000 €!

00:03:46.839 --> 00:04:05.640
One important thing is that you need to use very fast lense with something like 50mm or tighter for 
 cropped frame cameras like the t2i for example. I used the fixed 50mm 1.8 in the example shots.

00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:24.400
And that's everything! Go out and use this little great baby - thanks for watching! See you 
 again at the next episode - follow me on twitter - and good bye!
