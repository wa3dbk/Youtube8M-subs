00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.370
What's going on Hermanites!

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.670
Today we are going to go over the reverse lunge!

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:18.860
The reverse lunge is a great exercise if you 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.300
want to strengthen some of the joints in your 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.800
lower body, build some muscle mass

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.730
or

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.929
work on explosiveness

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.180
for various sports

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.890
some of the key muscles that are 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.800
involved during this exercise your primary movers are going to be your quads and glutes

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.930
secondary muscles

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.150
are going to be your hamstrings, your soleus, abductors and adductors but some of these muscles are going to work more

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.660
as stabilizers throughout the movement

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.690
The set-up you want to have when doing this exercise

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.830
as you guys can see

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.650
in this demonstration video over hear

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.080
is starting off with your feet shoulderwidth apart

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.219
your hands can either be on your hips or behind your head.  You are going to make sure your core is nice and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.640
tight the entire time

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.149
and keep those shoulders back, your chest up

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.149
and maintain a neutral spine.  Now you want to make sure that as you are stepping back during this exercise

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.290
that all your joints are straight

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.350
and in alignment

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.310
you don't want your foot stepping back over here, or over here.  And you want to make sure that your knee is underneath your spine

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.250
each time you step back

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.530
now you can choose to step

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.740
back further if you would like to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.850
but just make sure you are keeping your chest upright.  This will help you get a bit more glute engagement

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.840
so I am going to do some 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.770
demonstration reps for you right now.  I am going to alternate sides

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.869
as I do this exercise.  Just keep in mind

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:35.900
those key points

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.900
Let's do some reps!

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.680
as you guys watch my form here, what I am trying to do for each rep is let my front leg 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.479
take most of the load

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.340
as I am stepping back I am on the ball of my foot, making sure my knee is always under my spine

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.469
and as I step forward and backward, I'm making sure that my spine is nice and tall, chest is up

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.590
and my shoulders are back

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.050
So there you guys have it, a reverse lunge

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.599
