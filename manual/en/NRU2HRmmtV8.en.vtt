00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.620
Today we're going to show you how to replace
the distributor cap and the rotor in your

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:15.790
conventional internal combustion automobile
engine. On this car, this is a Ford F250,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:25.270
its a V8 motor, it is fuel injected. Now how
this motor works is, you have to have three

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.910
things for the motor to run, really four.
One is it takes air. The air comes in through

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.699
here, goes through the air cleaner and then
goes through these tubes into the throttle

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.019
body. This is kind of like your carburetor.
I'm going to point with this screwdriver.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.410
This is like your the air comes in through
here and then goes down into the motor and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.260
is mixed with the gasoline and there is the
combustion chamber in there and the gasoline

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.789
is burned and it makes the car go. Well, the
thing that delivers the spark to your motor

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.360
is the spark comes from the coil. I'm going
to point to the coil. This is the coil right

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.910
here, this little black box makes a big spark
of electricity and then the electricity goes

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:22.560
through this wire, this is your coil wire,
and that coil wire delivers a big spark into

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.760
your distributor. And then the distributor
distributes the spark out these spark plug

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.030
wires to each of the spark plugs which are
in the combustion chamber. So here at the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.790
end of my screwdriver, you see the spark plug
connector. I'll pull that off so that you

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:50.490
can look and see the top of the spark plug.
So if you see at the end of my screwdriver,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.390
there is this white ceramic insulator. That
is part of the spark plug and then this is

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.990
the spark plug wire that hooks on to the spark
plug and then the spark is delivered from

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.519
the distributor out to the spark plug. Now
many times if the car is running poorly or

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.470
if it just will not start, a common problem
is the distributor cap and the rotor.
