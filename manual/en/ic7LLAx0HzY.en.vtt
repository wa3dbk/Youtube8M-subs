00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.691
Hello and Welcome back to the First forex show 
here at 1STFX TV studios

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:26.564
were hosted at the FOREXPROS.COM site and sponsored by the Prizmal2040.com.

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:32.229
as you know we would run here a professional 
 review on the World Automatic Trading Championship

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.223
and Today we are about to review the First week in the Championship,

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:42.167
I would Like to invite you people to send us questions and remarks,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:47.367
and If there is any ATC related issues you would like 
 us to discuss, we would love to hear about it.

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:54.892
Toady we have with us again Vladimir, Known as PrizmaL from 
 the Last  ATC, where he won the 2nd place,

00:00:54.892 --> 00:01:00.093
Vladimir prepared for us some exciting review 
on the first week in the show,

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.093
Vladimir, The Stage is yours …

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.709
Hello again David, we start today with the 1st week review, 
 it was quite a good week for the traders,

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:13.909
 and as we spoke in the previous show, I would 
 start with a quick review on the first 7 places,

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:16.579
and then with the top 3 I would go a bit deeper.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:25.449
on the 10th place we have zigong from China, with a profit of 
 84%. This EA StopLoss is half the size of his take profit,

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:29.300
 I like it because its much less vulnerable to losses.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.737
on the 9th place we have bobsley from the 
 Russian Federation with a profit of 87%

00:01:34.737 --> 00:01:41.840
This EA works with no StopLoss/TakeProfit  at all,  I 
 think he wants to hide them from the broker.

00:01:41.843 --> 00:01:48.860
on the 8th place we have -BerKut- from the 
 Russian Federation also with a profit of 87%,

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:53.080
He did only 5 trades, and also he has no StopLoss/TakeProfit as bobsley

00:01:53.081 --> 00:02:01.490
on the 7th place we have Nelson_Mandela from from Belarus 
 he also have a  profit of 87%

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:06.690
but only 3 trades were done, so nothing really to say on this one.

00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:12.530
but I must add, It is nice of Lukashenko  to give him citizenship.

00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:19.780
in the 6th place we have 4xprofitq from the USA 
 , he broke the a 100% profit limit,

00:02:19.784 --> 00:02:26.100
I suspect him to work with a Martingel based 
 system, and he also has no StopLoss.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.430
on the 5th place we have ShurikAn from 
 Russian Federation with a profit of 110%

00:02:33.437 --> 00:02:40.820
His Money management looks a bit weird, we would have to wait a 
 few more weeks to see if its a problem or not .

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:48.110
on the 4th place we have roadrunna11 from 
 United Kingdom with a profit of 120%,

00:02:48.112 --> 00:02:58.140
roadrunna11 lead the championship a few days, until he got a small hit. 
 he uses a 20 pips StopLoss with a 180 pips TakeProfit,

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:05.300
which is very impressive I must say, I hope he would keep riding 
 good trends with his EA till the end of the Championship.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.380
on the 3rd place we have tyev from Belarus with a profit of 125%,

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.880
tyev reached 220% profit at some point last week, 
 which was 1st place at that time.

00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:19.880
way to go tyev !!

00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:28.140
He uses a very nice SL/TP ratio, and 6 of his 
 11 trades were profitable, Tyev is trading the GBPUSD

00:03:28.144 --> 00:03:36.270
while most of the previous places traded the EURUSD, seems like his log is filled 
 with in an    “Already have a position to buy! “ 

00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:42.820
alert, in this championship this is considered as an EA 
 bug and can disqualify him in the future.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.040
By the way, this bug appears in the log files 
 of  quite a few users on the championship.

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:54.940
on the 2nd place we have DEDMOROZ from 
 Russian Federation with a profit of 150%,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.000
an Interesting thing regarding  DEDMOROZ is that he uses 
 same StopLoss/TakeProfit  and time frame as tyev

00:04:01.998 --> 00:04:12.030
but unlike tyev he scored 8 profitable trades out of 9 which is nice , you 
 can also see he used a fix LOT, with a trailing stop in trades.

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.030
For our newbies audience, please explain, what is a trailing stop ?

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:22.900
Well, Trailing stop protects your trade from losses, when ever 
 the trade reached a profitable (or less losing) point,

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:32.140
the EA changes the StopLoss so if a fall will come it would 
 be much smaller, This is a professional way to write an EA.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:38.920
on the 1st place we have notused from 
 Ukraine with a profit of 154% 

00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:45.100
He works with no StopLoss (which is very risky) 
 and uses a different TakeProfit per symbol, 

00:04:45.095 --> 00:04:49.040
He is the Only EA in the top 
 ten which is multi currency,  

00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:55.780
and he is also the only one among top 
 ten that works massively with pending orders

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:59.300
Why he uses pending order and doesn't open the trade directly ?

00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:06.410
I personally give much more credit to these kind of EAs, 
 using future orders, meaning it predicts the trend more accurately,

00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:13.520
a future trend, for your newbies audience,  is an order to 
 open a trade if the price would reach a certain limit,

00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:18.950
if the trend goes the other way, the 
 order will not be executed at all.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.870
Vladimir, In a broader view, what do you have 
 to say on the first week ?

00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:28.930
Its only the first week and there is 
 no real Indication to identify the movements,

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:33.720
hough you cant miss the fact that most of the EAs are single currency,

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:39.380
and this is a pitty because in MQL5 it is 
 much easier to develop a  multi currency EA

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:46.300
I expect in the next few weeks to see more EAs 
 that are using this feature among the top ten users.

00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:53.920
Another Interesting thing I noticed while digging in the EA log files are 
a lot of Errors with the  **  Ctrade Trade Classes  **

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.210
This is not a real error, but probably a misuse 
 of the new MQL5 features by the EA writers,

00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:06.320
and since it adds a line in the Log 
 file, the Championship might disqualify these EAs

00:06:06.318 --> 00:06:13.330
I think this error mainly appeared since the developers rushed to 
 finish their EAs in time for  the championship.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.160
Earlier you mention a developer that wants to hide his StopLoss 
 /TakeProfit , what did you mean by that ?

00:06:20.157 --> 00:06:26.610
Well, many traders suspects the broker to manipulate the feed 
 in order to catch trades and close them

00:06:26.612 --> 00:06:33.660
so smart EA writers keep the real StopLoss inside the code, 
 this would prevent the trade closing as we spoke

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:41.770
but in case the EA terminal is disconnected from some technical 
 reason, a single trade can wipe the entire account.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:46.670
aha, This is a bit dangerous no?,  do you 
 have any tip how to avoid that ?

00:06:46.674 --> 00:06:54.990
What I usually do Is to set a false StopLoss which 
 is at least twice as far as my real StopLoss,

00:06:54.987 --> 00:07:00.330
 and I code my EA to close the 
 Trade when the real StopLoss is reached.

00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:05.990
Vladimir, As always I learn something new every time we talk.

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:12.990
Ok, I Invite you to leave your comments
 remarks in our forum or simply email us,

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.000
