[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.790
PROFESSOR GRAHAM GALLOWAY: In
the developed world, most of us

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.590
take medical imaging for granted.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.550
We have experienced it all our lives.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.780
We see it on television dramas.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.570
We expect it to be provided.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.850
And yet, when our doctor gives
us a slip to get a scan done,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.420
we wonder what it is all about.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.280
For most of us, our
first imaging experience

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.040
is one in which we have
no memory, an ultrasound

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.775
examination during our
mother's pregnancy.

00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:41.970
It is used to assess how old we
are, how fast we are growing,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.350
and if we are likely
to be a healthy baby.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.860
Based on this examination, doctors make
critical decisions about our health

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.982
and the health of our mother.

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:57.290
Then during our life journey,
we have x-rays of our teeth,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.360
or a CT x-ray for abdominal pain.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.390
It may be bone scans
for stress fractures

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.150
or routine mammograms
as a screening tool.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.450
My name is Professor Graham Galloway.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.790
And I'm group leader
for Biomedical Imaging

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.410
at the Centre for Advanced Imaging
at the University of Queensland.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.350
In this course, we will introduce
you to the fundamental principles

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.250
of all these imaging
technologies and also give you

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.030
a tantalizing glimpse of
the future of imaging.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.180
We'll see how these different
technologies complement each other

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.010
and why we need so many different tools.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.190
We'll find out more about
magnetic resonance imaging

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.730
and how we increase the contrast of
the image to help in the diagnosis.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.000
You might have heard about
functional MRI and its role

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.200
in neuroscience and psychology.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.700
Can we really see what you are thinking?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.760
We will do some chemistry using
sophisticated automated equipment.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.940
And you will learn about radio
isotopes, cyclotrons, and hot cells.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.729
As you'd have guessed,
all these techniques

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.560
generate a huge amount
of data, so much so

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.360
that we're talking about an
explosion of information.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.290
The challenge is to store
and analyze this information.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.890
This is where visualization becomes
so important from simple two

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.130
dimensional black and white
images to spectacular 3D

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.830
dynamic color images
you can fly through.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.550
So who will be interested
in this course?

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.900
It may be that you were concerned
about your health or the health of one

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.090
of your loved ones and you want to know
why there are so many different imaging

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.190
machines and what they
do and how they work.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.960
Or perhaps you are considering a
career path in medical imaging.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.160
You could be a teacher looking for ideas
to interest your students in science.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.590
Maybe you're a decision
maker wondering why

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.240
it is necessary to spend
all these health dollars.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.160
Or then again, you could just be
interested in understanding something

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.900
of the technology that
you hear about every day.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.200
Whatever your background
and whatever your interest,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.250
we hope that you will find
this visually exciting course

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.800
stimulating, informative,
and relevant to your life.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.398
