00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.460
Sometimes a game doesn't click with you no
matter how amazingly it's presented, and let's

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.209
not mince words, Super Lemonade Factory is
immaculately presented.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.480
From the detailed low fidelity pixel art to
the groovy chiptune soundtrack, all the way

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.289
to the intriguing story filled with interesting
characters.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.380
The thing is though that every aspect of a
game needs to work in tandem to deliver a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.920
memorable and enjoyable gaming experience
and in the gameplay department, at least for

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.530
us at AppSpy, Super Lemonade Factory falls
a little short.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.200
Let's explore this.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.469
The game is like a simple version of the 'Lost
Vikings' formula.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.310
Both Andre and Liselot need to reach the exit
in each stage.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.329
They both have different skills and need to
work in tandem to achieve the end goal.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.269
Andre can dash through giant crates, while
Liselot, can not only double jump, but talk

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.650
to the factory workers who are trying to impede
your progress.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.199
Talking with them can reveal interesting insights
into the overall story and the characters,

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.780
but at the end of the day, touching them will
still knock you back to a checkpoint or make

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.500
you restart the level.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.130
The game is controlled via on screen buttons
and swiping across the screen will change

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.050
from Andre to Liselot and vice versa.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.820
To traverse the level more quickly, you can
also down swipe to piggy back along, although

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.750
both characters can not use their signature
moves while piggybacking.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.890
The premise is solid enough, but it feels
like instead of making the most of what Andre

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.570
and Liselot can do, the levels seem to be
going through the motions.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.110
Blocks pushed off a ledge to use as a stepping
stone, elevators with spike walls, most everything

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.830
is something that we as gamers have seen hundreds
of times, and it makes the experience of traversing

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.530
through this World War Two time stamped exploration
of labor and love not what it could have been.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.610
Again, this is just our impressions, and to
a vast majority of gamers this style of game

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.400
could be fresh and engaging, and if so, there's
no reason not to give Super Lemonade Factory

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.000
a try.
