Hi, I am Eugenie. 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.130
Today I am making iced green tea latte and bubble tea. 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.160
First, in a bowl add in 1 ½ teaspoons of matcha, green tea powder, 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.960
and 2 tablespoons of hot water. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.370
And stir until melted. 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.660
Brewed green tea can be also used but matcha has its own distinctive flavor and taste. 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.160
So I highly recommend to use matcha.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.000
In a shaker add in matcha mixture, 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
2 tablespoons of acacia honey, 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.410
1 cup of milk 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.580
and ½ cup of ice cubes 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.620
and shake well. 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.910
Or you can also use a water bottle with wide mouth instead of shaker.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.220
Now pour in a serving cup. 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:38.120
It’s excellent with 2 scoops of high quality green tea ice cream. 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:47.930
And you can also make bubble tea just adding about 1/4 cup of giant black tapioca pearls. 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.000
Check out my another video, how to cook chewy boba. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.830
Then you will need a fat straw rather than a regular one.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.120
Bon appetit.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.120
I really love iced green tea latte especially in hot summer.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.120
