Hey, guys, Dr. Axe here, Doctor of Functional
Medicine and Founder of draxe.com.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.830
Today, I'm going to talk to you about one
of my favorite essential oils, and that's

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.050
peppermint essential oil.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.070
Peppermint oil benefits are incredible.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.730
The uses of peppermint essential oil have
been proven for thousands of years.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.070
I want to start with this, and this is going
to surprise you I bet.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.620
When I started looking into essential oils
and their health benefits, I knew they were

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.270
used throughout history for over 5,000 years.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.239
I knew they were beneficial, but I didn't
know how many medical studies there would

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.350
be on them.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.730
When I went into PubMed and started looking
at the medical literature, I was shocked to

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.100
find out on peppermint oil alone there are
over 1,200 medical studies.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.300
So over a 1,000 medical studies on this essential
oil in proving that it helps heal your digestive

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.249
tract, that it improves your breath, that
it fights cancer.

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:03.609
Some incredible benefits there of this essential
oil.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:10.890
What makes peppermint oil so powerful is it
contains a compound called [mentho] or menthol.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.940
This compound has been shown to act as an
analgesic on the body, reduce inflammation,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.170
and act as an antioxidant.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.630
I want to share with you some of the best
ways to use peppermint oil.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.300
By the way, peppermint oil is one of the top
two used essential oils in the United States

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.130
today along with lavender essential oil.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.210
But peppermint oil, one of the most common
ways I use it is as a natural breath freshener

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.360
in my natural toothpaste recipe.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.120
What I do for my natural toothpaste is I mix
coconut oil with baking soda in equal parts,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.820
let's say a tablespoon of each, along with
about 20 drops of peppermint oil.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.090
Mix that together.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.680
That's what I use for my natural toothpaste
at home using peppermint essential oil.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.330
The other way I'll use peppermint essential
oil is just as kind of a natural mouthwash

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.530
or breath freshener is I put one drop in water
and drink it down.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.900
It freshens the breath.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.740
Another way peppermint oil has been shown
to benefit your health is by naturally boosting

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.750
your energy levels.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.390
In fact, there was a recent medical study
that found by just smelling peppermint oil

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.900
it naturally increases your energy levels.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.710
My wife carries this around in her purse with
her.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.460
Before we go into a workout, sometimes we'll
smell it.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.600
I know a professor, and this is incredible
as well, who works with his students and he

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.090
actually diffuses cedar wood oil and peppermint
oil during his class, because cedar wood oil

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.280
has been shown to help ADHD symptoms and improve
focus.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.140
Peppermint oil improves his energy and concentration.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.150
So he actually diffuses this oil in his classroom
to help his children focus while they're test

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.150
taking.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.610
So, this is great for that reason as well.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.030
Peppermint oil has also been shown in medical
studies to help soothe irritable bowel syndrome

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.780
and leaky gut like issues.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.520
If you struggle with digestive issues, peppermint
oil can really help soothe and cool your digestive

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.520
tract.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.130
Just one to two drops in water taken daily
is greatly beneficial.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.240
Or, you can actually just put it right on
your skin as well.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.320
Another great thing to use peppermint oil
for is to open your airways for bronchitis,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.930
allergies, or asthma.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.550
You can mix peppermint oil with eucalyptus
oil and use it as a natural vapor rub.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.290
So again, a tablespoon of coconut oil, five
drops peppermint, five drops eucalyptus, rubbing

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.620
that on the chest is a natural vapor rub,
helps open up the lungs and airways.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.590
It's also great during allergy season whether
you just put a drop under your tongue, or

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.970
do it in water, or rub it again on your neck.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.040
It really helps open the sinus airways and
lung airways helping you breathe better.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.590
Also, it can help eliminate headaches.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.560
If you've got headaches, mixing three drops
of lavender oil, three drops of peppermint

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.150
oil on your hand, and rubbing them on your
neck area actually has been shown to naturally

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.150
help relieve headaches.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:09.480
It also can be used if you're making your
own at home muscle, sort of a muscle rub.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.370
In your at home muscle rub, peppermint oil
is one of the best along with frankincense.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.780
You can mix that with some coconut oil.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.720
If you've got sore muscles or sore joints
after a workout or even arthritis, you can

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.900
rub peppermint oil mixed with coconut oil
right on the area and it can naturally relive

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.900
pain.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.240
I could go on and on.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.830
With over 1,000 medical studies done on peppermint
oil, we know it's greatly beneficial.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.860
I wanted to offer you guys a gift for a limited
time only.
