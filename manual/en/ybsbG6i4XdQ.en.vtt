00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
So you're going out on the town, and you
never leave home without your every day

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.269
carry.  This is a nice place and you've
been told that that damn knife isn't

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.519
coming.  Fine I guess I'll just leave
it!  Wait, this isn't one of those

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.340
restaurants that makes you kill your meal before you eat it?  You did say the

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.800
Olive Garden right?  In that case you can
just bring a new pocket knife the Ganzo

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.369
g722.  Weighing in at a mere half a pound
of stainless steel and g10 scales it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.090
seems a reasonable compromise.  So let me just make sure the Bowie is out of the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.670
question too? No? Okay, I mean that's cool.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.649
So yeah this is a pretty hefty pocket
knife and probably the most imposing

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.030
thing to come in the color orange since
the Great Pumpkin.  But it also comes in

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.180
tactical black and tactical green.  Oh wait,
actually they don't use the word "tactical."

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.969
I think I read that wrong.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:59.329
Alright so it's heavy, but how big is it?  Here is the total length open and closed.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.750
The width and the thickness of the knife
minus the clip.  The blade length, the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.150
spine thickness.  Needless to say this
thing is razor sharp right out of the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.759
box.  Which it should be, because now you can slice casually through all those

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.850
random things you like to do when you
get a new blade.  Nothing wrong with that,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.619
right?  So what kind of steel and
materials are we looking at here?  Well

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.670
at the time of the review the knife is about 20 bucks.  So expect the popular

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.619
440C stainless.  That said,  the edge is fine and I found I could cut through a ton

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.380
of shit and the blade stayed pretty sharp. Long-term testing will see how well it can

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.650
be  made to hold up with regular maintenance.  But it has a heavy-duty frame lock to keep

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.210
the blade solid and in place.  Because the
blade is huge it's super easy to deploy with

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.159
the thumb studs.  The action is fluid and smooth and gives you a nice solid click when it locks.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.110
The frame lock is easy to disengage.  While the knife has a ton of mass, it's very well

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.540
balanced and fits nicely in my hand.  The
knife pushes the boundaries of what size

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.409
knife gets a clip and it would probably be
better with the sheath but it's still

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.950
smaller than my iPhone 5s. The clip is 
nice and tight and carries deep in your

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.670
pocket, so it doesn't appear that big- if
don't count the bulge.  As it comes out of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.709
the box it's a tip up carry with the
stainless steel frame on the outside and

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.430
the blade facing back. Which is not ideal
for deployment. The clip can be moved

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.430
so it's on the scale side but still only tip up.  Which tip up is the way most people

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.510
carry them anyway. I prefer blade forward so I either need to switch the clip or

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.129
carry it in my right pocket using my fifth
jean pocket.  Which makes it more

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.250
conspicuous, but now it's easier to match
your orange shirt, with something right?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.270
Because that's a reason people
buy knives?

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.890
So here it is compared to a few other
Ganzo knives and my Spyderco. Oh and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.160
here it is next to a Gerber Paraframe knock-off.  Which is the only other frame lock

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.240
knife I currently have.  The Paraframe rubs the liner, which now that I say it, it
sounds kind of dirty.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.700
Ok so this review has been a lot of
talking, with no action.  So let's do the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.720
obligatory hair shaving test, because so
far there hasn't been any gross body

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:21.050
hair close-ups.  Cool.  First here's a super scientific stick test.  First you get a stick,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.950
preferably from the ground- and see
how long it takes you to cut through it.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.470
Roadkill works too, although I didn't
have any on hand for this review.  So

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.500
just whittle all the way through.  Cool.  Ok now, let's

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.320
see if we can find a shrub to, uh, "prune."
Personal safety side I'll just chop through

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.330
the tree in the name of "knife review
science."  I figured you'd seen a lot paper

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.000
and cardboard cutting- so hopefully this
isn't as lame.  Ok so while I am chopping the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.750
crap out of this bush.  Is there anything else you should know?  Well, no blade play

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.670
out of the box, to speak of.  Solid frame
locking and deployments. It feels nice in

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.560
my hand.  There was a smidge of looseness after repeatedly smashing the bush

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.110
at full force.  But it was easy to remedy
with a bit of tightening.  In fact, after

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:25.180
all that chopping and hacking it's still
sharp.  No dings or edge rolling present.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.860
More shaving shots.  Yes this is after the
abuse.  That's about it.  The knife is

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.770
a very solid buy for under $20. It should make a great field knife.  Maybe it's

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.850
a bit too short for some game dressing.
But it's my new hiking knife.  I wish I had

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.570
something bad to say about it, sorry.  Hey,
