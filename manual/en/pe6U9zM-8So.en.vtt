00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Our Katya has been killed, Pasha.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I wouldn't know whether 
I'll be able to reach her grave.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Pay her a visit after the war ends, ok?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Uncle Misha, I ...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
For the light of the Sun,
For the beautiful days,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
For the native house,
For the country,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
For the Mothers,
For the bright eyes

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We've been departing for the war.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:25.000
For the Mothers, for the bright eyes
We've been departing for the war.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
No one of us has known
As far back as yesterday,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What did we have destined
By the fate

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But the hour has come,
And there has come the time

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
To join the bloody battle
Against the enemy.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But the hour has come,
And there has come the time

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
To join the bloody battle
Against the enemy.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So let the mortal enemy
Be afraid of me

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I keep an amulet at my hurt,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I haven't made a step
towards the God yet,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But if I need, I'll do it.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I haven't made a step
towards the God yet,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But if I need, I'll do it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.000
OUR DEEPEST GRATITUDE GOES TO THE
SOVIET PEOPLE - THAT DEFEATED FASCISM
