00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.920
Ho, stop!

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.440
The appartment remains as it is! HAAAH!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.880
And nothing will change!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.600
I want to play Unreal Tournament!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You motherfucker!

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.640
I'm a real gangster, I once rapped for fun.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.440
Peace out. I'm out.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.560
I really like to fuck.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
I don't like it at all.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.100
Fucking! That's it!

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
Fuck the squaw. Bam babam. You have to smack her.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.360
The ass has to blabber

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.600
The balls have to smack against the cunt, dude!

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.960
Err, it's such a bit more erotically.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.880
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.960
It's such a thing...it's my thing and I 
 also celebrate it, when I do it.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
Do you think you're funny with your fucking manner?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.440
Errr, NO!

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.360
Make me something to eat and after this you 
 clean up. Just as it should be.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.840
I've invented the word "Porn Rapper".

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.000
Porn Rap!?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.800
Porn Rap.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.360
Fuck me and shut your mouth!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.560
The children's room also remains as it is!

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.520
You chief-eerr-goat!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
300 things I don't like about you

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.100
The apple pie

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.120
So...do you like it or is there a problem?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.760
Baby, uuh...this apple pie...delicious...de-li-cious

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.920
And what do I get from you? Only shit

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.680
shit

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.440
shit

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.920
shit

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.920
And that's the truth.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.300
NO, I'm talking now!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.400
I'm angry because it's about our purchasing.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.080
Because we...allegedly by her...you see, what she has adressed... (there 
 is also no real sentence in German ;)

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.640
No, err what, bri, brutra...

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.760
It's my household!

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.360
We manage it in this way!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.720
Stop! Otherwise she gets her ass kicked!

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.720
Shut your mouth!

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.100
Everything in here remains as it is!

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.120
And there is no way to joggle it!

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.480
Whether you're here AND not!

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.960
(insert anything you want) not done (insert anything you want)

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.720
and it remains as I want!

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.560
Whether you like it or not!

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.640
The appartment remains as it is!

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.680
I almost shit my pants.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.080
No! Now, shut the fuck up!

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.800
For us...strong language is common practice.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.480
The stronger...the err er er better!?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.800
Crafty bitch, can stay where the pepper grows (can go to hell)
