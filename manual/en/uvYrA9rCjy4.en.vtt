[Rage Quit intro theme]

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.820
Gavin: Hey, I thought I was in charge of the mouse.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.200
Michael: Uh, fuckin' look FORWARD, Gavin, so I can walk!

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.480
Gavin: Is that--? That's a fence.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.940
Michael: That's a fuckin' fence. Turn around!

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.700
Gavin: Hold on, hold on.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.300
Wha-? Well, who put my torch down?!

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.540
Michael: It's a f- It's- Are we gonna start with this again?!

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.940
Gavin: It's not flashing!

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.740
Michael: IT'S A FUCKING FLASHLIGHT! WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION IN ALAN WAKE, FOR GOD'S SAKES!

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.740
IT'S NOT A FUCKING TORCH!

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.540
You want to look around at all, so we can-?

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.540
Gavin: So, is there like a compass or- Which way is it? Is it just-

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.480
Michael: I don't know which way it is! That's the whole point of the game! We gotta find the fuckin' paper!

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780
Gavin: Well, how did we get here? I didn't see a car or anything!

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.640
Okay, let's go between-- oop--

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.220
Okay...nope.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.740
Michael: Fuckin' walking along staring at the ground looking for fuckin' paper in the woods.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680
Gavin: Oh, there's a cricket! Is that a clue?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.780
Michael: Dude, we're gonna fuckin' find paper somewhere.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.880
Gavin: Dude...what are we gonna do once we've got 8 pages? We gonna read it?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.140
Maybe it's a flipbook.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500
Michael: Yeah, maybe it draws a picture of me shooting you in the head.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.720
[Gavin chuckles]

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.200
Gavin: Kind of weird if that's what it was. Glad I spent the whole night in the woods for that.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.720
I know what we should do. Stop walking.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.740
Michael: Yeah?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120
Gavin: Let's wait for twenty-f-- Let's wait for twelve hours.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.840
Michael: Shut up, you idiot!

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.940
Gavin: The sun will come up!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.120
Michael: IT'S NOT SKYRIM, YOU FUCKIN' MORON!

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.440
Gavin: Oh, it's an open area! We're onto something here.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.700
So I guess because I'm steering the mouse and you're doing the keyboard...

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.200
Michael: Yeah?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.300
Gavin: ...it's the equivalent of you giving me a piggy-back in the woods.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.000
[Weird Gavin noises]

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.420
Michael [sighing]: Oh my God, I hate you.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.720
Michael: God, this would be fuckin' exciting if we could find one piece of fuckin' paper.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.460
Gavin: Should I be looking up more? Or is it--

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.740
Michael: It's not IN THE FUCKIN' TREE. THEY'RE  ON THE TREE, LIKE THE TREE TRUNK!

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.240
Gavin: Alright--

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.080
Michael: You can't climb trees! Gavin, you can fucking walk and look around in this game.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080
They're not gonna be up in the Goddamn trees.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.400
Gavin: A-Alright, chill.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400
What's this? A plane? What is it? Is this a plane?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.820
Michael: I don't think it's a fuckin' plane. It looks like a tank or something.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.580
Gavin: It doesn't help that the sunlight is on the screen, and you've got fingerprints all over your screen.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.980
Michael: Don't fuckin' bitch about my-- AHHH

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.180
[Excited shouting]

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.400
Michael: Okay, we got it! Okay.
Gavin: "Don't look, or it..."

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.980
Gavin: That's-- That's terrifying.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.740
Michael: Well, just shut up and pick it up, stupid. It looks like you drew that, you moron.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.320
Gavin: I can't stop looking at it.
Michael: Fucking scribblings of a fucking two-year-old child.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.660
Gavin: What do I do with it?
Michael: Click the mouse, for God's sakes, and take it!

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.120
Gavin: Aahh!
Michael: Fuckin' God. Now get the fuck outta--

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.960
[Deep rumbling noises]
Michael: Oh, shit.
Gavin: What was that?

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.920
[Deep rumbling noises continue]

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.680
Gavin: What's that noise?
Michael: That's the ominous music of you--

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.020
Gavin: AHHHH! What'd I do?

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.360
Michael: You turned the fuckin' flashlight off.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360
Gavin: Oh. Uh, I didn't know you could do that.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.760
Gavin: Now it's a flashlight! Ohh-ohh! Strobe!
Michael: Oh my God...

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.480
Michael: FUCKING STOP!!

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.880
Gavin: We're back! Okay.
Michael: Got the flashlight?

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.880
[SCARY PIANO CHORD]
Gavin: AHH!!
Michael: OHH!! What the fuck was that?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.760
[Static noises]
Gavin: What is--?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.340
[Both scream (loudly)]

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.480
Michael: YOU RUN AWAY, YOU IDIOT!!
[Gavin still screaming]

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.600
Michael: Good job running away there, Gavin.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.760
Michael: We got one-- We got one piece of paper...
Gavin: What the hell??!

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.540
Michael: ...took twelve fuckin' minutes.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540
Gavin: I don't want to play this. This is scary!

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.280
Gavin [giggling]: That is terrifying! D'you see that?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.620
Michael: YES, I saw it!!

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.440
Gavin: Okay.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.180
God!

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.680
My heart is POUNDING!

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.540
So, if we stand still, then is he gonna--

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.420
Michael: You have to RUN AWAY! You were like, "OHH! THERE HE IS! LET'S STAND STILL!!!"
Gavin [incredulous]: WHAT?!

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.820
Gavin: Why're you telling me to run?! I'm just holding the torch! You've got the legs!

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.180
Michael: You have to LOOK in the direction to run away, Gavin!

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.400
I can't run away when you're staring at him, fucking asking him out for brunch.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.000
[Gavin chuckling]

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.220
"A fucking spot o' tea out by Big Ben?"

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.140
Gavin: So, if I just turn off the light when we see him, and then we just walk away?

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.520
Let's practice walking in the dark.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.220
Michael: You're looking at a tree.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.660
Gavin: Oh, sorry. Excuse me.
Michael: Thanks.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940
Michael: Wait, was that it? Right there! To your right. Right there.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.880
Gavin: Okay, okay.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.620
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Stop moving.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.040
Michael: I'm stopped! For fuck's sakes, let's go!
Gavin: Alright, alright, alright....

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.680
Gavin: So we're gonna haul asshole in this direction, and I'm gonna grab it and then turn the torch off.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.680
Gavin: Okay, ready?
Michael: It's a flashlight. Yes.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.420
Gavin: We can make it flash if you want. Ready?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.040
Gavin: RUNNN!!
Michael: Go go go GO GO GO!

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.500
[Deep rumbling begins]
Michael [snickering]: Why are you flashing it?
Gavin [snickering]: Disco! Disco!

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.840
Michael: You're looking at the ground.
Gavin: I don't want to look him in the eye. That's why.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.600
Michael: He's BEHIND us!
Gavin: Is he?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.700
Michael: Yeah, he'll always be behind you.
Gavin: Oh! Well, fuck, let's go then!

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.000
Michael: Don't run towards the thing that has the glowing eyes and fucking eats you?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Gavin: Ah! Oh! I got turned around! Did we turn around?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Okay, it's scary if you put both ears on your headphones. I was only using one.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.780
Michael: Dude, I only use one ear half the time.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.140
Gavin: You use half the ears...half the time?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.820
Is he like-- If we stand still, is he gonna take us?

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.160
Michael: Probably.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.200
Gavin: Alright, this is....

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.760
...MOVE!

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.440
Michael: We found ONE page! There's EIGHT!! For fuck's sakes!

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.360
Gavin: Alright, we're going back this way now.
Michael: How are you supposed to fucking find anything?

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.600
[SCARY PIANO CHORD]
[Michael and Gavin screaming]

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.200
Michael: HOLY SHIT!!

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.300
Michael: RUUUUNNNN!!!!
Gavin: AAAHHHHHHH!!!!

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.920
Michael: GO! GO GO GO GO!!

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.520
Gavin: WHERE AM I?! AHHH!!
Michael: OH MY GOD!!

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.160
Gavin: I SAW HIM!!
Michael: I SAW HIM!!

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.720
[More incoherent screaming]

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.940
Michael: GAVIN, STOP FUCKING WITH THE MOUSE!!

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.320
Gavin: We got this.
Michael: Holy shit, she's like breathing heavy because she's gonna get FUCKED UP.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.940
Michael: Holy crap!
Gavin: UGH!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.060
[Deep rumbling is still going]
Gavin: Is he a giant? Why's he- Why are his footsteps so big?

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.620
Michael: Let's fuckin' stop and ask him.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.920
[Quiet static noises]

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.740
[Static noises]
Michael: Oh, run away. Run away. That's a bad sound.
Gavin: Yeah, that's a bad sound.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.760
Michael: Turn the light on. Run away.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.660
Gavin [giggling]: It was getting all crackly. It's like he was right there.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.760
Michael: You're fuckin' like pissin' yourself in your seat!

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760
Gavin: Well, it's probably because I need to poo, and I don't want to overdo it.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.580
Michael: Well you're gonna poo your pants. I hope you fucking SHIT yourself in this video.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.540
Gavin: Alright, let's-- Wait, tease it. Like, walk back and look around because I don't want to have to turn--

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.240
Michael!

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.040
Micool!

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.240
Go f-further back-- Walk backwards!

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.240
Michael: Ohh, it's static-y. Grab it and run!
Gavin: OHHH! OHHH!!

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240
Michael: Run!! RUN!!!
Gavin: OOHHH MY--!

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.240
Michael: Will you fucking stop?!

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.100
That is a STROBE light, not a FLASHlight, you idiot!

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.080
Gavin: Are we walking towards him?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.080
Michael: I don't know! I can't see! Look around!

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080
Gavin: What d'you mean look around?! I don't want--
Michael: Look around, and then--

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.900
[Static noises]
Gavin: OHHHH!!!!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.280
Michael: Fucking CHRIST!! We're at the tree!

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.960
Why did I give you the mouse?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.440
Why do-- Why are you controlling where we look?

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.380
Gavin: Uhh...

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.000
Michael: I feel like you should've been in charge of like the fuckin' pen or something.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
[Gavin laughing]

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Gavin: I should've been in charge of reading the note.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.500
I'm less scared now. I feel like-- So looking at him doesn't do anything?

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.100
Michael: I guess-- Well, I dunno.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.100
Gavin: Or does he actually have to get near you?

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.700
Michael: I don't-- You-- Every time we see him you go, "OHHH!!"

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.360
I fuckin'-- I couldn't tell you.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.940
Gavin: I'm just not learning anything from our experiences with him.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.200
Michael: We are not fucking finding *shit*.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.860
These fuckin' pages are barren like fuckin' Gavin's sex life.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.300
How big is this fuckin' forest?! FUCK!

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.300
Fuckin'-- Will you look around?!

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.660
You're just looking str-- All I'm doing is walking, we're getting to the fence, and then you're turning left.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.660
That's what we've been doing for ten fuckin' minutes.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.440
Gavin: That's how you solve a maze is you keep going left!

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.100
Michael: You gotta go through the MIDDLE of it to find the fuckin' notes, not dance around the perimeter...

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.160
...fuckin' the fence the entire God damn time!

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.380
Gavin: Oh, I guess that only works in mazes and not woods.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.620
Michael: We're-- We're gonna find all the fuckin' papers when you're staring straight at the fuckin' ground--

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.300
Gavin: Well, sorry, but there's only trees in front of us.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.140
Michael: THAT'S WHERE THE PAGES ARE!!

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.140
Michael: They're in front of us!
Gavin: We haven't found a single page on a tree, you donut!

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.920
Michael: Well, we found them up high in front of us--

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.820
Gavin: Well I can't see because you're hand is in front of the screen--

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.180
Michael: Well, I'll fuckin' put my hand in front of your fuckin' face when I shove my fist down your fuckin' throat...

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.780
Michael: ...and then I put my foot up your ass.
Gavin: At least I'll still be able to see if it's down my throat.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.620
Gavin: Actually, your elbow would be in front of my eyes, wouldn't it? Never mind.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.260
