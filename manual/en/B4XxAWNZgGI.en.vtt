00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.900
Very loosely based on the Stephen King short
story of the same name, this science fiction

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.450
actor horror film tripled its $10-million
dollar budget when it was released on March

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.710
6, 1992.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.890
King was so unhappy with the adaptation however,
he successfully sued the producers for attaching

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.730
his name, citing that the film "bore no meaningful
resemblance" to his original short.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.529
For better or worse, Brett Leonard directs
the ambitious project, with opens with a wordy

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.589
title-card explaining how the future of the
year 2000 will be populated with widespread

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.070
use of a technology known as "virtual reality".

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.470
A concept which was apparently, novel and
exciting some 20 years ago.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.560
Future James Bond player, Pierce Brosnan stars
as an eager scientist, who converts his neighborhood's

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.820
mentally challenged landscaper into a violent
genius through the application of computer

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.770
science, paired with some fancy drugs.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.950
As the lawn boy who's constantly taken advantaged
of, even sexually, Jeff Fahey does a decent

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.899
job exhibiting the slow transformation from
dim-wit to mastermind - and you can tell he's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.250
gotten smarter, thanks to his stylish new
haircut, and tucked-in shirt!

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.100
Brosnan meanwhile makes the best of an empty
script, and at least makes the story as believable

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.860
as possible, who remarks on his scientific
advancements, "I think I've discovered a new

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.560
planet... but one I'm inventing instead of
discovering.".

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.940
The under featured, and poorly acted supporting
cast includes Jenny Wright, Geoffrey Lewis,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.960
Jeremy Slate, and an early appearance from
Dean Norris as a mysterious, and uncompromising

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.190
"director" character.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.020
The familiar, and adequately paced "sudden
acquisition of brainpower" story holds up

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.760
well enough, but it's the extremely dated
visuals of a Fruity-Loops colored VR-environment

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.640
that drags the entire thing down.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.170
Indeed, it's pretty hard to take any film
seriously when wearing a fluorescent track

00:01:31.170 --> 00:02:02.920
suit, and dicking around inside a Super Nintendo
is considered "intellectually advanced."

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:14.310
The 
tragic outcome of Fahey is apparent from the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.000
outset, which means the 103-minute experience
feel more like a chore than actual entertainment...

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.310
by the halfway mark, I was just ready for
it to be over.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.310
Dan Wyman's melodramatic soap opera style
music doesn't do the R-rated picture any favors

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.310
either.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.250
A climatic, and virtual battle that involves
a VFX shot of a lawnmower mouth inside a brain

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.000
is particularly ridiculous, and the final
straw on what could have been a very interesting,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.230
and exciting movie.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.440
Instead, we're left with bad performances
from good actors, wasted potential, and a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440
pissed-off novelist.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.100
"The Lawnmower Man" might be terrible, but
it's a passable entertainment, worth watching

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.280
for the morbidly curious.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.230
I thought it was LAME.
