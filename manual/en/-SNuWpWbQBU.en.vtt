This tasty, tender chicken curry is easy to cook,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.960
tastes great and will speed you on to your dream weight.

And best of all,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.280
you can eat as much as you like and never feel hungry.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.340
So let's get started!

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.680
Chop all your ingredients into similar sized pieces.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
Place a non-stick frying pan onto a high heat.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.000
Once the pan is hot, add the veggies and chicken,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.420
and stir fry for 2-3 minutes.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.070
Keep everything moving,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.860
and add a splash of water if it starts to stick.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.920
And don't worry too much about quantities -

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.720

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.990
Then simply add your curry spice,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.280
chopped tomatoes,

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.409
and stock.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.229
Then simmer for 30-40 minutes

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.929
until the chicken is cooked through.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.000
For extra creaminess,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.800
stir through a healthy dollop of fat-free yogurt

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.500
and sprinkle with fresh coriander.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260
Serve straight away with plenty of rice.
