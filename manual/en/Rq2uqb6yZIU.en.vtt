Hello everyone and welcome to this new video presentation !

00:00:14.977 --> 00:00:19.946
Today I will talk you about an HeadSet sent to me by the online store named AirsoftPeak.

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:28.746
It is from the brand "Z-TAC" and is called "X-62000 Neckband Headset".

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:39.059
His reference from Z-TAC is "Z047" and you can find it directly on the site AirsoftPeak

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.279
by using the reference "12192".

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:53.165
This article comes in two colors, black and dark earth, and is compatible with all Z-Tac's PTT.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:58.605
The PTT is not provided, that lets you choose the appearance of your PTT.

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:09.518
For your information, the system is the Airsoft copying of the X-62000 model from THREAT4 brand.

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:14.728
And as you can see, it is broadly conform with the original model.

00:01:15.648 --> 00:01:24.388
Note that the product is sent to you in a very large cardboard box with the colors of the manufacturer,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.546
allowing to receive it in good condition...

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:41.621
I'll unpack this article and I'll take the opportunity to tell you that the online store AirsoftPeak offers you

00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:49.701
a voucher worth 5 dollars on your next order placed by using the little coupon code that I will insert

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:53.497
on the top right of this video.

00:01:54.357 --> 00:01:55.954
Here ! So thank to them !

00:01:56.544 --> 00:02:20.470
This Headset is a neckband style. It is supplied with replacement ear plugs, in case you lose one.

00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:32.605
Its low profile size allows you to wear it under an helmet, a gas mask, or balaclava, etc...

00:02:33.524 --> 00:02:38.479
It is made of high quality nylon and weighs only 400 grams.

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:51.953
To adjust the system to your head, there are two settings.

00:02:57.792 --> 00:03:01.343
The first is a screw at the blow level ...

00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:03.883
... Here.

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.450
Adjusting the "head width".

00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:27.432
The second is the dual scratch on the top of the skull.

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:38.308
In addition to its compact size, the main advantage of this headset is the ability to quickly isolate themselves

00:03:38.308 --> 00:03:49.043
from the radio to listen to the close sound environment, since you only have this part in the ear.

00:03:49.853 --> 00:03:54.949
Simply remove it and you are disconnected.

00:03:57.375 --> 00:04:05.934
This is something more difficult to do with the type Sordin or Peltor helmets.

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:11.167
There, you simply remove an ear plug... or even both.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.684
However, this system has no "Noise Cancelling" function.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.281
And this is the visual once mounted on the head of Bob, of course with ear plug in your ear.

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:33.763
So you'll understand that this headset is a good alternative to what I would call the big headset (Peltor, Sordin, etc ...).

00:04:34.103 --> 00:04:36.743
Light, it will be quickly forgotten on your head.
