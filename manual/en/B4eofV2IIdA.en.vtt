00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.530
&gt;&gt; [Background music] The world is in the
middle of materials revolution.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.700
Advances in this area are crucial to the continued
vitality of countless industries.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.700
In the Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering,
we apply the basic principles of chemistry

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.460
and physics to understand the structure and
properties of materials, and we design processes

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.150
to meet the needs of our modern technology.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.700
&gt;&gt; Tim: I'm Tim Carruthers, and I'm a senior.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.650
Materials science, since it's kind of a mixture
of chemistry and physics and engineering,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.449
I think anyone that actually wants to apply
that, actually make finished devices, that

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.250
materials science is a really good field.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.040
It's kind of a nice way to do some lab work
and some manufacturing work.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.950
So I came to materials science after working
as a glass artist for ten years, so I could

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.609
have a technical side to complement the creative
understanding I had.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.620
But I also wanted to try to help contribute
to reducing our impact on the environment

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.269
through studying materials science.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.610
There's such a large amount of energy from
the sun that hits our planet every day.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.230
Even in a place where it's cloudy, you're
still getting a lot of energy from the sun,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.830
and so there's just constant free energy coming
in, so if we can figure out a way to use that,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.170
we could drastically reduce our energy usage
and our need for fossil fuels.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.950
I'm working in a research group under Dr.
Alex Jen.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.590
Our group focuses on using unconventional
materials to make electronic devices.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.250
And so I'm actually working in the portion
of the group that focuses on making solar

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.860
panels from kind of plastic-based materials
so that they can be made more affordable so

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.320
that more consumers can actually buy them
and use them.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.660
One of the main benefits of these is that
they can be made on flexible substrates, and

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.260
so you could have, then, a solar panel that
you roll up and put in your backpack, you

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.480
know, out in the field, and you just want
to get on your laptop and lay in the grass

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
some place so that you can power your computer
that way.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.719
And that's one of the key components of engineering
is kind of using ideas from research science

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:19.310
and implementing them into solutions that
will actually be used by society and will

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.129
make a positive impact on the world.
