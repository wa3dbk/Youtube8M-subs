00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.640
Text: ACLU presents aclu.org Since 1977, Florida
law has barred gay people from adopting.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.690
However, Florida does allow gay people to
serve as foster parents.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.690
Martin: What are you guys for Halloween?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.690
What are you?

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.690
Children: Batman.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.410
Leslie: Martin Gill and his partner have been
foster parents to young brothers since December

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.610
of 2004.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.730
They live in Miami long with Martin's partner's
biological son who is a teenager.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.000
Martin and his partner were originally told
that the placement of the children would be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.430
temporary, just up to a couple of months because
there were relatives who had expressed an

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.620
interest in adopting the children.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.340
At that time, the boys were four and four
months old.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.260
Martin: From the moment they walked in, boy,
they were a neglect case and I could see that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.090
was true.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.650
The four-year-old had the whole top of his
head.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.829
He looked something like me.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.620
He had male pattern baldness because this
top of his head was covered with ringworm

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.760
to the point that his hair was no longer growing
up there.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.610
It was all flaky and yellow.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.340
He just looked terrified, traumatized.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.630
In fact, it was about two weeks, for two weeks
he didn't speak at all.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.830
Today, he's a very happy child.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.030
He smiles a lot.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.290
He has a lot of friends.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.740
I had a report just yesterday from his teacher
that he was talking too much to the other

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.229
kids, and I had to tell the teacher that makes
me happy because here is a child that for

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.979
the longest time wouldn't speak at all.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.540
Then when he began to speak for the first
several months he was very depressed and didn't

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.920
seem to bond with anybody.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.360
Now his teacher's giving me reports that he
talks too much and he's got too many friends.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.940
That really makes me feel good.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.490
Leslie: After being in the care of Martin
and his partner for over a year or so, it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.090
became clear that the boys were not going
to be able to be re-unified with their biological

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.680
relatives, and that they were going to be
free for adoption.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.020
Once that happened, the state would have an
obligation to place the children in a family

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.509
that could adopt them, but because of the
law banning adoption by gay people in Florida,

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.510
Martin and his partner would be ineligible,
so they were concerned that the children would

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.810
be torn away from the family they had become
so bonded to.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.510
At that point, Martin and his partner came
to the ACLU, asking for help.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.950
Martin: We had a trial date coming up and
we felt it necessary to explain what adoption

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.230
is in terms that maybe a four-year-old and
an eight-year-old would understand.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.830
The older of the two, all of a sudden he had
just this look of pure contentment on his

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.299
face and he said, Poppy, we're going to have
the same name.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.699
We're going to have the same last name, and
I said, yeah, we're going to be a permanent

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.889
family and we're all going to have the same
name.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.570
He sat there and he wrote out his new name,
two pages.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.110
He filled up at least two or three pages for
the next half hour, he wrote that name and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.420
he was smiling and he was happy.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.580
At that point, he just got it.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.220
It's a hard concept to know what being adopted
is at that age, but he got it.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.060
We were going to be a family and having that
name to bond us, the name Gill would bond

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.060
us as a family.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.060
Text: In November 2008, a Florida judge ruled
the gay exclusion unconstitutional and granted

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.060
Martin's petition for adoption.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.068
