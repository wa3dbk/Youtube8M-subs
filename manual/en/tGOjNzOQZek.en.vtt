00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:11.707
- Hi. My name is Grace Hwang

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:14.928
and I'm an educator here
for school programs.

00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:16.320
For a student that hasn't really

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.721
been introduced to modern art,

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:20.139
I think this painting can
be a little bit challenging.

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:22.841
Usually for students, I try
to break it down for them,

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:25.014
to see that Picasso here
is really interested

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:27.818
in taking a human body
and translating it into

00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:29.320
colors and shapes.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.475
Your eye starts to look for
things that are familiar,

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:34.053
like oh, I see a face, I see some eyes

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:35.864
and then slowly, these different shapes

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:38.177
kind of come together and then, you see,

00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:39.517
like there's this mirror

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:41.146
and I think that's really interesting,

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:42.507
that moment of discovery for them

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:43.600
when they're like,

00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.941
"This is a girl and she's
looking at the mirror

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:47.119
"and the mirror is telling her

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:48.724
"something different from real life."

00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:51.975
She looks really sad or she
doesn't like what she sees

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:53.906
or it's showing her her true emotions

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:55.348
and it's really exciting because

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:58.111
that is a direct
interpretation and I ask them,

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:00.155
"Well, how did you get there?"

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:01.626
Ya know, we start
talking about the colors.

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:02.642
They're so dark.

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:04.665
Her eyes no longer have pupils.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.016
They're sort of sunken and deep set.

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:10.882
The discovery that I've made
in just studying this painting

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:15.602
is the background, this crazy
diamond and circle pattern,

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:17.697
of it being a harlequin pattern

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:20.074
and knowing that Picasso himself,

00:01:20.074 --> 00:01:23.104
thought of himself as like
a trickster or a harlequin.

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:25.881
And so, that the background
is a metaphor for Picasso.

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:27.875
When the students can go there,

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.204
I'll offer that bit of information

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:31.695
as a discovery that I've
made myself through research

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:33.491
and it's just really interesting because,

00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:34.656
you know, maybe for some kids,

00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:36.304
they're like, "That's too out there.

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:37.911
"That's crazy. I'm just
gonna stick with like,

00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:40.025
"this is the girl, this is
how she perceives herself,

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:41.610
"and that's what it means for me."

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.299
And then some people will be like,

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.140
"Oh, this is how Picasso
perceives this woman,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.433
"young woman looking at
herself in the mirror."

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.946
What I love about art,
especially modern art,

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:52.474
is that it meets you where you are.

00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:53.673
Like, if you're ready to go there,

00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:54.948
it'll invite you to come in.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.081
And if you just wanna
keep, stay where you are,

00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:59.839
it'll say, I'm with you there too.
