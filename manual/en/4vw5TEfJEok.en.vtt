00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:10.887
So when I think of L.A. I think of palm trees...

00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:12.828
Luxury cars...

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.809
Sunny beaches...

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:19.205
And what place to get my blonde ambition on, okay?

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:23.558
I was able to do that and get 'er done during my stay in Los Angeles.

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:31.599
And Toni and Guy were the lovely people that brought my dark, lovely locks up to an L.A. platinum blonde.

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:37.099
Bye hair! See you... see you another day.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:38.252
It's going.

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:42.070
I'm at Toni and Guy, this is going bye-bye!

00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:50.439
Okay, so this is Nikki, she's my colorist. Thank you so much, Nikki!

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:55.555
She drove in just to hook your girl up and get her blonde as blonde can be, okay?

00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:59.447
So you can see here she's working it in, she gets it all over my hair.

00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:01.340
And it's bye-bye black!

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:06.895
And this is Jazmine, oh my goodness!

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:08.460
Thank you so much, Jazmine!

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.101
I met Jazmine at the Beautycon event. Holler!

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:16.740
So this is what I look like--I'm looking like a toothbrush with toothpaste on my head.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.209
And I think we left the bleach on for about 30 minutes or more, maybe 40.

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.976
I can't remember.

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:26.916
And Nikki's gonna wash it all off and reveal my color!

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.150
I'm gonna be fierce for Fashion Week, bro!

00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:33.918
This is what happens when you go to L.A.! You go blonde!

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:39.871
Okay, so this is what it looks like when the bleach is out. Pokemon yellow.

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:48.027
Not cute! But don't worry, we get this R.Kelly-pee-pee-on-you yellow, to a nice ashy blonde.

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:53.388
And Nikki was about to do that by putting in a toner! This is all so new for me.

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:56.424
Toner, this is step 2 of the proccess.

00:01:56.424 --> 00:02:01.410
And it basically just tones the yellow down and gets it more of an ashy blonde.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:09.492
And we were gonna go another step lighter, but I was just too afraid, so we left it here.

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:17.190
And I actually like this color--it's like an ashy blonde. I was totally going through an identity crisis with this blonde.

00:02:17.618 --> 00:02:22.671
Which is why I didn't go platinum blonde. I wasn't used to this look--it was like shaving my hair off all over again.

00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:24.815
Who am I?! Who is this woman?!

00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:28.295
They were asking me if I wanted to go lighter and I was just like, 'ehh.' I didn't want to risk it.

00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:31.955
NIKKI: Tell us what you think, Maya!

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:33.033
MAYA: Is this video?!

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:37.642
I'm at Toni and Guy and I just got my hair done by Nikki!

00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:40.305
I'm having a mild identity crisis!

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:41.502
NIKKI: Do a little dance!

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.131
MAYA: Oh, Miley! Oh Miley!

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.722
NIKKI: No, no, that one didn't work!

00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:47.819
MAYA: VMAs!

00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:51.488
Version 2.0, shameless!

00:02:52.065 --> 00:02:57.668
A week later I came back here to New York City, and my color kind of transformed.

00:02:57.668 --> 00:03:04.165
I don't know if it was a result of the sun, but I decided to go platinum white which is what I wanted originally.

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:07.583
So I headed over to the Toni and Guy location in Hoboken.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.283
We're just gonna turn this from yellow to more... platinum blonde.

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:15.820
Yeah, platinum blonde.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.206
And my head is itchy, so I hope my hair doesn't fall out.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.588
And this is my second colorist, Alexandria.

00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:27.483
She was pretty fearless with my hair, and very confident that we can go platinum.

00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:30.189
That's a really hard color to get to when you have black hair.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.501
Anyways...

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:34.568
This is not a good life. Bleach... no.

00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:40.985
So this is the bleach in my hair--again, I can't remember how long I sat with this stuff in my head for.

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:42.797
I think it was like, 30 minutes.

00:03:43.142 --> 00:03:46.187
Okay, this is the shampoo and conditioner they used on my hair.

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:51.348
I believe they compared it to like, eating raw veggies. That's how clean this product is.

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:53.735
So there we go, that's the color.

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:59.674
And again, after we bleached it we had to tone it because hair has yellow undertones.

00:03:59.977 --> 00:04:04.384
And this is what it looks like. I'm giving you all shades of Storm! Storm realness.

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:05.702
I'm happy with this color.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.322
And I can't remember her name, but she is so lovely and styling my hair for me!

00:04:12.322 --> 00:04:14.822
With my, you know, my little tryin' to be pompadour.

00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:16.444
And that's the final look, guys!

00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:19.226
First it was the curly life, now it's the blond life, I don't know.

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.859
Special thanks to Toni and guy, you guys can check them out--they have a YouTube page.

00:04:24.859 --> 00:04:26.258

00:04:26.258 --> 00:04:29.633
