Hi Brian…from AV-Express here.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.620
I was just trying out the Get Together a Portable
Bluetooth Music System from House of Marley,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.269
yes that Marley!

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.029
The Get together is an easy to use, amazing
sounding Bluetooth Portable system.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.849
It features a good looking, compact and environmental
friendly design.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.490
When opening the box you will see a very nice
solidly built speaker system.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.190
The first thing that jumped out to me was
the attractive natural bamboo panels and the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.420
fabric wrap around the sides of the portable
speaker.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.500
The fabric is made from organic cotton, recycled
plastic bottles, and reclaimed hemp!

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.570
And who knows more about hemp and the House
of Marley then our special guest today?

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.930
We are thrilled to have via satellite, the
one the only, Bob Marley!

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.119
AVX: Hi Bob, thanks so much for taking time
to join us today.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.119
How are you?

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.119
Feeling good?

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.119
Bob: Yeah!

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.220
AVX: Great, so glad to hear it.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.590
Well we are very excited for you to join us
today.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.509
We wanted to talk to you about The House of
Marley’s Get Together.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.969
A Jamming Bluetooth Portable music system
we know you love.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.080
We would like your thoughts on comparing the
Get Together with this product from Bose called

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.340
the sound link.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:40.719
Bob, take a moment to listen the Bose. (music
plays) So Bob, it sounded a little lean to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.469
us, what did you think?

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:50.049
Bob: Well yeah things kinda lean depends on
expectations.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.149
AVX: And if compared to the Get Together,
which you have heard obviously, did the Soundlink

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.500
sound better?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.070
Bob: Nah not to me

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.530
AVX: Not to us either Bob, not to us either.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.410
Bob, you got your Marley Audio Get Together
from AV-Express.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.009
What was it like to work with them?

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.150
Tell us how the customer service and product
knowledge was.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.550
Bob: It's like paradise, beautiful.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.420
AVX: We are glad to hear that Bob.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.720
Well we cannot thank you enough for taking
time to join us in helping spread the word

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.190
about the Get Together from your house, The
House of Marley.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.850
We hope to have you back soon to review some
of your other great products.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.760
Now that sounds good right Bob?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.520
Bob: Yeah!

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.220
AVX: Well folks, the great Bob Marley ! What
an honor!

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.640
It is not often you can talk to a legend like
that!

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.910
Well that was special folks.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.950
The Get Together is special too.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.740
The portability of the Get Together from House
of Marley makes it easy to get great sound

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.120
anywhere!

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:06.150
Your bedroom, deck, pool, tailgating, a picnic
or even here on the beach

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.730
Earlier I mentioned the great looking solid
bamboo panels.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.070
You can easily notice two 3.5 inch high output
woofers integrated on the front as well as

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.810
the two 1 inch tweeters.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.500
These drivers together deliver rich deep bass
and clean and clear details.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.610
On the back panel, there is a tuned port for
improved bass and better speaker efficiency.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.170
Also you will notice a few other things going
on in the back.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.950
A USB power output connection, allows you
to charge your phone or device.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.510
An auxiliary input allows for devices to connect
to the speaker without using Bluetooth, saving

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.350
your battery life of your smart phone.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.460
Or connect an older model iPod, a portable
DVD player or even a TV.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.280
Further down is a place to plug in a charger
that comes with the Get Together for when

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.200
you are not using the built in long life 8
hour rechargeable lithium Ion battery.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.500
An indicator light in the back turns green
to let you know if it is fully charged, or

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.540
it turns red if being charged.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.300
There are easy to see and use top mounted
controls.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.150
A simple pressing of the Bluetooth icon for
3 seconds will emit a tone.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.739
Turn on the Bluetooth on your device and you
should see the Bob Marley Get Together option.

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.350
Select and that will do it!

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.229
Listen to Pandora, XM or iHeart Radio or your
stored music.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.120
Also on the top is a power button and volume
controls.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.749
However your device is the main control for
volume.

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.590
Another good thing House of Marley has done
with the Get Together and virtually all of

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.889
their products are using environmentally friendly
materials.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.310
Natural woods and recycled fabrics wrap around
the portable Bluetooth speaker.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.370
Marley Audio smartly calls this fabric wrap
REWIND.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.460
Glad to see they are using earth friendly
materials that look good and are sustainable.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.879
The House of Marley Get together is a well
built, great sounding portable Bluetooth audio

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:04.879
system.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.220
Smart looks and materials along with easy
to use functionality make this a great choice

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.220
for your music.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.090
We know Bob is proud to have his name on this
one.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.069
The Get Together comes with a 2 year parts
and labor warranty and be assured AV-Express

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.919
is going to back this quality product.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.180
