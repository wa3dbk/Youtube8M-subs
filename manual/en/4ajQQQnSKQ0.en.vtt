00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.520
swim officials play an important role
in fair and equitable conduct of a

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.180
swim meet

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.469
it is their responsibility to know and
understand the rules of the sport

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.710
and apply those rules in competition it
is equally important to remember the

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.500
golden rule of officiating

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.510
the swimmer always gets the benefit of
the doubt

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.390
the butterfly stroke has technical rules
that apply to the start

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.570
the stroke the turn and the finish

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.670
let's look at the rules that govern the
butterfly

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.440
after the start the swimmer is allowed
one

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.129
or more leg kicks but only one arm pull

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.510
under the water this pull must bring the
swimmer to the surface

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.680
as mentioned a swimmer may kick as many
times as they like underwater

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.690
as long as the swimmer's head breaks the
surface

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.820
before or at the 15 meter mark

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.399
the 15 meter mark should be well marked
on the lane lines

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.619
so the official can clearly see if a
swimmer is submerged

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.740
longer than 15 meters

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.670
from the side of the pool the stroke judge
shall observe that the head breaks the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.780
surface of the water

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920
before or at the 15 meter mark

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.970
this swimmer surfaces well before the
15 meter mark

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.079
this swimmer comes to the surface right

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.840
at the 15 meter mark

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.240
in this example the head breaks the
surface beyond the 15-meter mark

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.920
this is not legal and requires
disqualification

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.549
both arms must be brought forward over
the water and pulled back simultaneously

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.619
these swimmers are complying with the
rule

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.820
this swimmer is not legal because the
arms are not moving simultaneously

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.159
 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.420
in the butterfly the arms must recover
over the water

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.280
all up-and-down movements of the legs and
feet must be simultaneous

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.560
one foot may be higher than the other

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.330
if the foot position changes the
official must observe an

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.900
alternating action for a
disqualification this swimmer is legal

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.230
this is an example of observable
alternating action

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.060
and is a violation

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.409
a scissors or breaststroke kicking
movement is not permitted from the side of

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.000
the pool

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.159
the best position to observe a butterfly
race is slightly behind the slowest

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.840
swimmer

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.080
with a clear view of all the assigned
lanes

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.220
after the start and at each turn the
swimmer's shoulders must be

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.930
at or past vertical towards the breast
this swimmer is past vertical towards

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.580
the back

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.120
to determine if the swimmer is past
vertical towards the back

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.530
the official must observe the relative
position of the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.430
upper shoulder to the lower shoulder
sometimes the distortion from the water

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.060
and the movement of the water can
interfere with an observation

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.200
when the swimmer leaves the wall

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.580
the official should watch the feet leave
the wall and then check to see if the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.870
proper body position has been attained

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.489
remember if you are not completely sure
of what you observed then the swimmer gets

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.810
the benefit of the doubt

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.110
the turn judge at the end of the pool
should observe that the swimmer uses the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.030
proper stroke

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.590
into the wall and after the turn back
the other direction

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.660
each backwards pull must be followed by
an over water recovery

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.700
sometimes a swimmer will miscalculate
their distance from the wall

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.130
and make an underwater recovery to make
up the distance

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.180
these swimmers are in violation since
their backward pull is followed by an

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.580
underwater recovery

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.110
this is not legal

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.220
the touch shall be made at the turn or
finish

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.380
with both hands simultaneously at above

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.739
or below the water surface

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.980
the hands don't have to be on the same
plane

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.500
but must touch simultaneously that is
one hand can be above the water and one

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.100
below

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.670
as long as the hands touch at the same
time if the hands do not touch at the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.570
same time

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.350
this is not legal and will result in a
disqualification

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.000
remember

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.800
you judge the touch by the hands after
the last pull into the wall

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.630
you're not concerned with the position
of the shoulders as long as the swimmer

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.250
remains

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.730
at or past vertical toward the breast

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.860
remember the swimmer is permitted any
number of butterfly kicks

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.000
the first arm pull brings the swimmer

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.720
to the surface the head must break the
surface

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.640
by the 15 meter mark the arms must
recover

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.280
over the water breaststroke or scissors
kicks

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.460
are not permitted the swimmer may turn
in any manner

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.010
but the shoulders must be vertical
toward the breast when the swimmer

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.960
leaves the wall

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.970
both hands must touch simultaneously

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.680
at the turn and the finish you can see
officiating videos for all strokes
