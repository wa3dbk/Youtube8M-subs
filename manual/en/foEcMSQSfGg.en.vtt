00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.920
Why do women bodybuilders have deep voices?

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.420
It is because of the testosterone.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.890
Are you sure that the testosterone is to blame?

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.559
Normal women cannot build muscle to the extreme
that male body builders do.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.840
Female body builders are either injecting
testosterone or have unnaturally high levels.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.340
And testosterone makes the voice lower.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.449
When a guy hits puberty, testosterone levels
rise.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.800
He builds more muscle, starts growing facial
hair and his voice drops.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.440
And he starts to suffer from periodic drops
in IQ when his blood starts to flow elsewhere.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.120
Don't all men have high levels of testosterone?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.620
Male body builders may have high levels of
testosterone, but there are some who inject

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.460
it or other hormones or drugs to build up
even more muscle.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.180
And women who are body builders have to add
to it, because their bodies don't make enough

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.039
testosterone to come out looking like a body
builder.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.559
Women can be fit without using drugs.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:57.879
That's true.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.130
But looking lean and fit, like a volley ball
player, isn't the same as having massive pecs.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.080
So women body builders have to use testosterone
to get that look.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.370
And with significant, or prolonged use, it
starts to alter the body.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.940
They get massive muscles.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.870
And they start developing male secondary characteristics.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.100
The voice box changes, like a boy's does during
adolescence.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.540
They still have breasts.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
Only because the breasts had already developed.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.850
But the reverse happens when a man takes lots
of estrogen, often developing breasts because

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.500
the hormones trigger secondary sexual characteristic
growth despite your genetic gender.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.710
OMG, that's horrible.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.110
If she's got a deep voice, isn't she going
to grow a beard?

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.380
Ever heard of the bearded woman?

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.190
These were often women with unnaturally high
testosterone, big, burly and bearded.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.450
But female body builders are hairless.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.820
So are the guys, for the same reasons.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.590
They're all waxing, shaving and oiling to
look good for the judges.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.120
But now she may have to shave her face and
chest?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.940
Oh, disgusting.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.799
Funny you don't think about how she's altering
her very body in an effort.
