00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.600
Are you tired of hauling watering cans
back and forth

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.680
only to see your plants still withering
away by the sun's intense rays?

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.100
Have you become entangled, entrapped by
never ending irrigation hoses?

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.980
Is your water bill making you think twice
about starting that vegetable garden?

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.390
Then we have the solution! This new and
improved product is made of 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.050
state-of-the-art nano-fibers

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.250
that not only trap moisture and
protect the soil from excessive heat,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.349
but it is a 100 percent biodegradable,

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.910
improving soil fertility and texture. It's
called:

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.129
mulch! And for three easy payments of...

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.610
mulch has so many benefits it may seem too
good to be true.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.809
Especially since mulch can be obtained
for free. If you have not been mulching

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.140
now may be the time to start! We'lll see why.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.879
I'm SiloÃ© Oliveira, and I'm striving
to create low maintenance

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.590
sustainable systems for food growing in my
suburban homestead.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.059
Previously you have seen me planting
seedlings I had started

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.190
indoors into a Hugelkultur bed I had
constructed and fertilized. And although

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.369
it would seem that the only thing I
have to do now is wait for harvest time,

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.479
while watering the garden as it grows. I
would rather do more of the waiting 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:17.890
and less of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.860
the watering. So there is one more missing
part to this planting process,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.049
that I feel is essential and without it, 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.600
you could be setting yourself up for failure:
Mulching!

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.250
What is mulch it's any matter that you
cover the soil with.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.330
So it could be wood chips, dead leaves, grass clippings,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.450
Even rocks and gravel or synthetic
pellets like shredded tires,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.530
although I would never recommend using
synthetic mulches.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.619
I'm using grass clippings I collect
after lawn is mown.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.149
Number one reason start using mulch:
water! A 1 to 3-inch layer of mulch

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.899
can dramatically increase the water
content

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.280
on the top layer of soil. It shields the soil
from the sun's rays,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.160
preventing the evaporation of moisture.
Because at this moist environment more

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.450
roots grow in the top layer of soil

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.530
which happens to usually be the most
fertile zone.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.800
Giving you plants a boost in growth. Ensuring enough mulch

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.120
is somewhat of a challenge. But by looking at your surroundings with new eyes,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.790
you may find great source for cheap or
free mulch.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.069
I'm scavenging. There's a public parking
lot across from my house with grass

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.099
around it that is mown every three to
four months,

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.660
just when the grass is big enough that
it creates beautiful hay.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.200
I wait for it to dry for a few days. Then I go out with the wheelbarrow and rake

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.420
to collect this precious albeit
overlooked resource. This is reason

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.300
number two

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.610
for using mulch: to use materials
that would otherwise be treated as

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.319
refuse:

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.959
something people are accustomed to collect to tidy up their lawn and throw away,

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.290
as a beneficial resource. Other
possible mulch sources could be straw,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.269
if you live in rural areas,

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.720
or wood chips from a tree service
company if you live in the city.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.960
Fallen leaves can also be used. I like to
use grass clippings,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.930
not only because it happens to be a more
abundant resource where I live,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.590
but because unlike wood chips, it breaks
down faster, improving the soil texture

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.620
and feeding it.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.260
This would be reason number three as
mulch breaks down it increases the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.460
amount of organic matter in the soil.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.319
making it less compact, easier to work with, and easier for roots to grow.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.760
If you're using leaves or wood
chips it is better to let them break

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.390
down for at least a year.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.580
Freshly fallen leaves are high in lignin

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.750
and thus, take more time to break down.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.770
They tend to create a compacted impermeable layer,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.750
that from my experience ends up
attracting lots of slugs. Fresh wood

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.010
chips can rob nitrogen from the soil,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.819
as its carbon-rich matter starts
decompose. Here's a very important tip:

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.640
never use leaves or wood chips from black
walnut trees and its family

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.900
including pecan butternut and bitternut

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.340
as they contain a chemical compound
called juglone

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.990
that stunts the growth of other plants. I
apply

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.900
a good blank layer about two inches thick
to ensure good moisture retention.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.400
This stable moisture right in the root
zone of plants will increase the amount

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.979
of life

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.289
in the soil bringing up more earthworms
that fertilize the soil with their

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.240
castings

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.470
and increasing the population of beneficial fungi

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.449
protozoa and bacteria that breakdown
nutrients for plants absorption.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.599
Of protozoa and bacteria

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.319
Well son, I'll tell you of a time when your forefathers colonized this land.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.400
You see, there was no mulch!

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.729
You young kids have it good. Those were terrible times!

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.500
Look grandpa!

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.629
Oh no! it's the sun! It burns!

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.780
This increase of beneficial life forms
in the soil

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.800
is reason number four for mulching. 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.370
As for reason number five, by protecting the
soil from rain and irrigation, not only

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.050
you prevent erosion and soil compaction,

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.730
you also diminish the prevalence of
certain fungal diseases like

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.490
early tomato blight. Fungal spores hide in
soil

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.270
and are lifted to leave as water drops
splash up. This may seem to contradict the

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.520
old idea of cleaning up all debris from
your garden, keeping the soil bare,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.850
to minimize disease. Although there is
truth to that as certain bugs and

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.400
diseases

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.550
overwinter in garden debris, and
sometimes by breaking

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.020
the life cycle of pests by clearing the land
can help stem outbreaks.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.660
By taking a more hands-off
approach, 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.910
and imitating nature where productive soils
are always covered,

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.060
we can achieve good results fighting
pets through biodiversity,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.340
increasing the population of beneficial
and predatory life forms

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.560
can help control pests. The goal is to
get to equilibrium.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.470
And of course you'll end up losing a crop
here and there,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.710
But you'll end up gaining a lot more. The
sixth and final reason,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.600
which happens to be one of the most
important if you want to establish low

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.770
maintenance gardens,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.800
is that mulching drastically reduces the
amount of weeds. by keeping the soil

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.169
covered by a couple

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.949
inches of mulch, weed seeds in the soil
are shaded out,

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.449
and are less likely to sprout. And if you
combine mulching with the concept of

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.070
planting closer together,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.250
you barely have to weed and you will not
have to water so often.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.990
I've sown, cleared, dug, fertilized, planted
and mulched and now all I have to do,

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.880
besides occasional watering is to wait
for harvest time.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.580
By following these simple techniques you
too can try to start growing more of your

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.470
own food

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.729
even if you've never done it before, now
is the time

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:02.070
to start!
