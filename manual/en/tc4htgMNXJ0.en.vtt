Hi this is Joe Bruzek from cars.com

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.460
we're here with the 2014 chevrolet
corvette stingray and by now you've read

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.890
our review and you know it's blazingly
fast

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.949
it looks like a million bucks except for
the rear end

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.519
we're still kind of deciding on that but
anyway with all the new features

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.170
technology and performance you can make
this a seventy thousand dollar quartet

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.670
if you really want it and that's nonzero
690 19 grand sport

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.540
we have some favorite features and also
some features that we could do without

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.219
that you can use to keep this car closer
to its 52 thousand dollars starting

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.989
price after you pick the color the first
thing you want to do is option 2 12

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.539
hundred dollar multimode exhaust

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.800
now that option bypasses the muffler's
for an amazing sound

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.399
yeah

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.109
one of the reasons you can skip a few of
the features is that the Corvette's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.069
standard feature list for fifty two
thousand dollars with destination isn't

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:14.179
too shabby at all

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.009
you have this configurable dashboard and
this new 8-inch touchscreen that work

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.179
pretty well together and it's all new
and its standard if you want a really

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.049
complicated layout with all sorts of
data like tire temperature tire pressure

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.039
and acceleration numbers you can have
that but if you just want a tachometer

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.810
you can do that too

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.129
it's all digital and configurable the
previous Corvette seats weren't really

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:40.429
that comfortable and they weren't too
supportive on the racetrack

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.329
these new seats are much improved over
the old ones

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.329
these are the basic GT seats with the
base leather you can get a variety of

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.950
options on the seat including a napa
leather which is very high quality

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.079
leather that looks really good

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.489
you can also get a competition seat
which has more aggressive bolstering and

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.090
is overall more of a race see compared
to this touring seat

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:12.440
one feature you don't have to pay for is
notable all new and standard is the lt1

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.040
engine now what would a Corvette video
be without talking about the engine and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.549
this 455 horsepower v8 now uses direct
injection variable valve timing and

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.160
cylinder deactivation not only be
powerful anywhere in the rev range we

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.209
step on it but it's also fuel efficient
at 29 miles per gallon on the highway

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.209
with the manual transmission

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.540
those who take full advantage of the
removable roof will especially like how

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.160
it's made out of carbon fiber this year
it's super light weight you can take it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.580
off you can put it in the trunk and when
it's in the trunk you can even lift it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.320
up to store stuff underneath the base
package is impressive enough but if you

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.970
want to add a little customization and
some more luxurious features be prepared

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.340
open up your wallet many of the options
aren't public art if you want heads-up

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.600
display

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.840
guess what you're shelling out four
thousand dollars for the two LT package

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.840
or eight thousand dollars for the three
LT package

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.410
now the 2lt on our tester also has
memory seats heated and ventilated seats

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.620
as well as heated side view mirrors the
three LT adds a leather-wrapped interior

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.959
package as well as a security system
plus it opens up options like the carbon

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.200
fiber interior and a micro suede
interior

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.150
now both of those options are about a
thousand dollars and the carbon fiber it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.920
you can feel free to skip you know they
want to go for a racy vibe and add that

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.480
carbon fiber to the inside but it just
doesn't look genuine even though it is

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.650
chevrolet says it's real carbon fiber
just doesn't look the part on the inside

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.680
if you want to get something that looks
genuine

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.800
if the microfiber suede interior it
looks really good high end but it's only

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.750
available on the three LT one of the
options buyers will like they go back

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.650
and forth with is should i buy the z51
now the z51 isn't absolutely capable

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.410
track package if you plan on going to
autocross track or a road course

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.180
yes absolutely it's a performance
bargain for fifty six thousand dollars

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.979
when you option

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.050
the magnetic ride control suspension

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.970
the z51 packages track ready with an
electronically controlled limited slip

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.340
differential dry-sump oiling various
coolers and specific wheels tires brakes

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.060
uniquely gear transmission and an aero
package

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.310
the amount of grip on the track is
mind-blowing considering its heavier

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.040
than the 2013

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.870
and narrower tires than the grand sport
but is just as track ready

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.910
even though the optional magnetic ride
control suspension has adjustable

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.450
firmness dampeners for comfort or track
settings

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.800
there's not a whole lot of difference
between those modes after a few hours on

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.760
the highway z51 roughness kind of wears
on me and it's a lot different than the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.710
base model the base model

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.650
Nnanji 51 is that highway cruiser that
you could drive all day getting out of

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.670
the see if you want and into the base
model car is like stepping out of the

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:31.010
mazda miata and into a catalog but if
you want that z51 look you can

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.270
absolutely option

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.270
the rear spoiler that's unique to the
car on the baseball

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.180
the 2014 Corvettes main objective is an
unrivaled performance to dollar ratio

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.680
and that's something which it doesn't
disappoint it's just unfortunate a lot

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.630
of desirable options are lumped into
very expensive packages because that

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.190
takes this budget super car and makes it
not so budget friendly

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.980
yeah

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.260
yeah
