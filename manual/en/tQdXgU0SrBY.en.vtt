Hi my name is Jim DeYoung. I'm with Fat Cats
Family Bowling Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.430
You can reach us on the web at FatCatsFun.com.
I'm also here on behalf of ExpertVillage.com.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.609
We are going to be talking about fitting for
gloves, the reason to get gloves, and the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.839
equipment that you use. Right now I've just
got a little forearm band on. It keeps my

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:29.680
forearm tight so end up trying to grip the
ball too hard and causing me to tug the ball.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.550
We'll talk about tugging in a little bit.
Gloves, people use gloves mostly to have more

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.820
of a grip on the bowling ball. Some gloves
come with a wrist guard so it keeps your wrist

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.930
straight so when you come through the ball
it keeps your wrist straight the entire time.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.120
But me, I've learned how to overcome that
so I don't use any gloves. Some people use

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.329
the gloves because the bowling ball actually
will cause calluses? to your hands and make

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.430
your skin nice and rough. So they wear the
glove so the glove is all rough on the ball

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.909
instead of their hands. Like I was just saying
about this forearm guard, it keeps my grip

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:22.310
from getting too strong. So if you end up
gripping the ball too hard it caused you to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.100
follow through awkwardly so you won't get
the correct follow through the ball. I'm going

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.190
to throw one really quick to show you what
I mean about that. I'm going to grip the ball

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:44.220
really really hard and I'll show you what
happens when that happens. I ended up going

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.290
to the left side of the head pin instead of
staying on the right side. For right handers

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.369
the pocket is the right side of the head pin.
For left hander?s it?s the left side of the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.550
head pin. So basically what ended up happening
is I actually ended up missing my mark out

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.610
here by two or three boards to the left which
caused it to hook over to the left side.
