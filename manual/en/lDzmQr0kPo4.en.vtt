00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.410
The last bit of knitting we have to do on
the Sleep Sack is to add the collar, and in

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.820
this example, I’ve done it in a contrasting
color, and in this example, I’ve done it

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.430
out of the same color of yarn.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.189
So either is fine, of course.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.570
So, let’s get started.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.910
With the wrong side facing.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.510
I’ve already picked up, as you can see,
a few of these stitches.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.522
You’re going to want, well first of all,
with right side facing, you’re going to

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:46.680
want to find the very center of the front
section of the yoke.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.470
And then with wrong side facing, starting
at that spot, just over from that spot, you’re

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.229
going to want to pick up the number of stitches,
pick up and knit the number of stitches the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.390
pattern tells you.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.540
And I’ve left a few here so that I can go
over this with you.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.010
You’ll take, you just need one needle for
this.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.140
You put your needle in through both legs of
the V, running along the top of the collar

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.210
edge there, wrap it and pull it through.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:22.170
You go into the next one, both legs of the
V, wrap it and pull it through, all the down

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.900
to the very last one.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.710
It’s not quite a V at the very last one,
because we have the icord edging, but I just

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740
stabbed my needle in there and did it.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.620
Now this is tricky, trust the pattern here,
because if you start to over think it, you’re

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.540
going to think you’re doing something wrong.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.960
I have the right side of the sweater showing
here. This is actually the wrong side of the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960
collar.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.090
So you’re going to turn the work, and work
a wrong side of the collar, with the right

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.820
side of the sweater showing.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.530
Let me show you why that is.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.130
Because if we unfold the collar here like
this, right side, wrong side.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.680
It’s so when it folds over, we have right
side showing on both the collar and the sweater.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.330
Get what I’m saying?

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.330
Okay.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.869
Oh, one more thing I’ll show you while I
have this here.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.950
You’ll notice that the collar has the same
icord edging to help it lay flat that we had

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.730
here at the back opening.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.989
So we’re going to continue slipping three
stitches at the beginning of each row to give

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.989
us this edge.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.510
Okay.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.519
So, I’m on a wrong side row, and my pattern
tells me to slip three with yarn in front,

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.430
which sets me up for a purl row.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.459
Gives me my edge.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.260
I’m going to purl one stitch, and then place
a marker, which I don’t have one handy right

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.579
now.

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.879
Just slide a marker on this needle and purl
across the rest of the stitches.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.810
On the next row, of course, I’ll slip three
with yarn in back to create the icord edging

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.299
on the other side, doing exactly what we did
at this back opening.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.010
The important part about doing the collar
is just trust the directions, the instructions

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.920
are correct, even if it doesn’t feel right.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.469
And you need to keep a row count of where
you are in the collar because things happen

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.469
pretty quickly.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.319
It’s a little tiny bit of knitting, but
there are a lot of twists and turns with the

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.579
edging and the shaping and stuff so, um, just
follow the directions.

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.760
And once you finish one side, you’ll go
ahead and do the other side.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.269
The last thing you’ll want to do before
you present this as a gift is to wash it and

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.749
block it.

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.969
And, it really depends on what fiber you’re
using.

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:48.709
If you’re using 100 percent wool or superwash
wool, the collar and the whole sweater is

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.400
going to block out really nicely with a flat
collar and everything else.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.030
For the samples that I’ve knit here, I’ve
used a microfiber blend and a wool blend on

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.519
the two different sweaters, and I’ve found
that when you’re working with those fibers

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.189
that it really, if you really want to give
something shape, and have it hold, the best

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.559
thing to do is to use an iron.

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:14.150
And that’s what I’ve done with both of
these little sweaters to get the collars to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.510
really be flat and perfect.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.880
And that pretty much sets it.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.770
You can’t use an iron directly on a synthetic
fiber.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.220
So what I did was I turned it on full steam,
and I used a linen dish towel between the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.259
um, the sleep sack and the iron, and then
pressed it down, and that was all it took.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.720
Synthetic fibers and wool are really very
different in that way.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.300
Wool, you just get it wet, pat it out the
way you want it, and it’s going to stay.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.300
This is very different.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.729
And then the last thing you’ll do is to
sew on buttons of your choice to match the

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.030
yarn that you’ve used.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.270
And then that’s it! You have a Sleep Sack
to present as a baby shower gift.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.699
