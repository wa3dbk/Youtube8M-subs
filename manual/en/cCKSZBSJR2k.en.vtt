Hi there, it's Michael from ScriptBully Magazine,
and former production company reader, and

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.820
in this short video I'm going to go over the
No.1 secret to writing a screenplay

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.680
that's unique,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.719
Grabs the attention of Hollywood talent,

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.599
And has the potential to make you very, very
wealthy.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.880
Are you ready?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.970
Okay.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.470
Because the formula is quite simple.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.580
Your script must be:

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.769
106 pages long

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.779
It must involve spaceships and trucks that
turn into robots...

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.310
Your script must contain not one, but two,
cross-dressing roles for

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.710
Adam Sandler and/or Eddie Murphy.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.680
And, most importantly, on page 47 there must
either be a kiss with

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.800
a vampire and/or an attack on a Soviet nuclear
installation.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.980
Follow these guidelines, and you are guaranteed
to write a script that makes

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.390
you money.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.390
What's that?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.770
Ridiculous, you say?

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.550
Well, of course.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.040
But is it any more ridiculous to write a script
according to a five-act

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.460
formula created back when Star Wars was released.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.290
Or plot your story with an 87-part beat sheet
matrix you got from a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.530
back issue of Writer's Digest at your local
library.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.370
The real secret to writing a professional,
kick-ass screenplay is stop looking for a

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.370
secret.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.370
A quick fix.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.370
A shortcut.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.370
A paradigm.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.409
A paradigm is defined as: an example serving
as a model;

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.409
or pattern.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.900
But here's the thing about patterns.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.540
Artists rarely use them in the
act of creation.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.640
It's only later, when the buzz wears off and
the hangover starts,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.520
that critics look at a work and say, oh, he's
using the old 12-act

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.930
midpoint Josephy Campbell mythic structure.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.240
They're missing the most fundamental point
of all.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.050
Cover bands don't rule the world.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.950
Do you know anything about jazz?

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.240
I'm not a huge fan, but with enough red wine
I can getin the mood..

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.810
Anyway, here's the thing about jazz:

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.960
If you can play the notes perfectly to a song,
just like Miles or

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.240
Monk or Chet Baker or Kenny G......you know
(the legends)...

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.659
If you can master the form as the greats did...

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.500
You can, if you work really hard, end up with
a gig at the Tuscon Ramada on a Thursday

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.500
night.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.590
But if you can build on what came before you..and
create

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.150
something new...something nobody has ever
seen or heard before.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.819
You can change the world.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.970
You can create a new paradigm.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.469
So, the no.

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.870
1 secret to writing a screenplay that doesn't
suck, will

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.999
make you money, and totally rock the movie
business is: don't

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.569
worry about secrets.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.409
Worry about creating interesting characters,
characters that only you are capable of dreaming

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.230
up,
and put them in impossible situations.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.769
Don't focus so much on your act-ii midpoint,
and think more about that...what the hell

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.849
gets me really mad and upset.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.239
What would I be willing to die for, or maybe
kill for.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.650
And write about that.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.819
Trust me, there'll be gold there.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.189
Now I know what you're saying...

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.560
This all sounds really nice.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.169
But what about structure?

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.169
What about outlining?

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.840
What about rising action...and plot points..

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.150
Okay, here's the best secret I know about
that stuff.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.421
Here, in my opinion, is all the structure
you really, really need.

00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.309
You ready?

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.309
Come closer?

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:10.090
Your screnplay needs a somebody who must do
something that they really don't want to do

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.719
or else something really bad will happen.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.829
Now the something they have to do must be
the last thing they want to do.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.599
They only do it..because they fear the “something
really bad” will happen.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.980
And that's worse.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.940
Now if somebody told me, okay, Michael you
have to eat chips and salsa

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.200
everyday for a month or else the Russian Mob
will kill you.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.599
That wouldn't be very hard.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.790
First of all, I love chips and salsa.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.409
But let's say they said...I had to rob the
7-11 down the street or else the mob

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.409
would get me.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.340
Or...I had to break into Sea World and ride
a polar bear.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.950
Or..I had to call my psycho ex girlfirend
and take her to my high school reunion.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.909
Or...i had to watch all three Twilight movies
in a row with a theatre full of thirteen-year

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:55.909
olds.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.560
Those would be very difficult choices.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.129
And the more difficult you can make it on
your character, the more interested the viewer

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.129
will be.

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.849
And if you keep working at it.

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.189
Eventually all the act breaks and plot points
will take care of themselves.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.669
But you gotta have that simple formula.

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.870
Another example: (I've used this one before)

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.870
My uncle is an insurance adjuster.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.539
Very conservative guy.

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.669
Now what's the last thing he would ever want
to do.

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.449
Shave his head and go to a punk-rock festival.

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.319
That'd be the last place I could ever see
him.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.460
But what if he did it...to find his runaway
daughter.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.810
Now...we're getting somewhere.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.270
We could play it as a broad 7th-heaven type
family comedy,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.129
We could play it as a dark, David Fincher-type
thriller.

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.069
We could do it as a musical, as an Olsen twin
vehicle.

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.560
The genre doesn't matter.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.020
What matters is the impossible situation.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.470
And I'll bet you and I could spend a satruday
at starbucks and

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:07.840
come up with a competent structure for our
Punk Rock Dad script.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:36.360
But you gotta have 
that basic foundation.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.650
Now if you're the type who just can't enough
