00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.830
Day after day the skyline

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.600
get covered in dark blue.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.220
The horizon vanishes and reappears.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.520
In your eyes I can see a glimpse of the things to come,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.570
but offering my hand to you was in vain.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.150
"And the world is changing.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.200
Ideals clash with reality. The world is going to the end.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.120
Wings dancing in the deep darkness sky"

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.520
Now the only way left is to look up to a dead end sky.
Wings dancing in the deep darkness sky"

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.550
(In a world as dark as a raven's night)
Now the only way left is to look up to a dead end sky.
Wings dancing in the deep darkness sky"

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.100
(In a world as dark as a raven's night)
Now the only way left is to look up to a dead end sky.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.290
So I'll...

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.930
beat my wings and fly straight to you

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.070
until they breed a flower that can destroy any ideal.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.290
The world I used to overfly no longer exists, it disappeared,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.550
so I want to keep it in my chest,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.450
I know you'll lose Real World.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.870
If I took a picture of a backward sky,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.670
it'd be like watching a flower that ever lived.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.730
I'll let the flowers float in the wind up high in the sky,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.650
so the world can see its Last Blue Sky.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.640
(A sky that will be the Light of the End)
so the world can see its Last Blue Sky

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.890
So I'll...

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.530
beat my wings and fly straight to you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.670
until they breed a flower that can destroy any ideal.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.790
The world I used to overfly no longer exists, it disappeared,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.110
so I want to keep it in my chest,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.740
I know you'll lose Real World.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.870
I'll keep my journey even with hurt wings
I know you'll lose Real World.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:49.520
until I get back My Real World.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.200
The Flower will become the thing breaking an ideal.
until I get back My Real World.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.440
The Flower will become the thing breaking an ideal.
