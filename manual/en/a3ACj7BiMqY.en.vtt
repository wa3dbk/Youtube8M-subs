00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.379
Today, we are cooking a light and milky dessert..

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.973
.."White Pudding with Bread"

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:20.635
Let’s see the ingredients now.

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:22.574
Then we will see how to cook it.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:24.029
Ingredients:

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.786
1 pack of toasted bread

00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:29.462
For the Syrup:

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.866
1 + 1/2 cups granulated sugar

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:35.237
1 + 1/2 cups water

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:39.860
1 tsp lemon juice

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.478
For the Sauce:

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:44.235
1 cup granulated sugar

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:47.157
2 tbsp flour

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:50.233
4 tbsp cocoa

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.606
1 + 1/2 cups water

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:55.506
For the Milk Pudding:

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:57.494
1 liter milk

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.861
1 cup granulated sugar

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.080
1 cup flour

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.125
1 tbsp butter

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:08.922
1 pack vanilla

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:12.719
The ingredients list may seem a little bit complicated,

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.098
but it is very easy to cook this dessert.

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:22.009
There are 3 main processes; syrup, sauce and pudding.

00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:27.127
Let’s start to cook it by preparing the syrup at first.

00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:33.138
We are pouring 1 + 1/2 cups granulated sugar and..

00:01:33.138 --> 00:01:38.372
.. 1 + 1/2 cups water into the pot.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.832
We are boiling it by stirring constantly, until it reaches the right consistency.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:52.197
The syrup has reached the boiling temperature..

00:01:52.197 --> 00:01:55.332
..so we are adding the lemon juice in it.

00:01:55.332 --> 00:01:56.833
We will boil it for 5 more minutes.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:58.550
Then, we will remove it from the stove.

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:01.654
Now I am turning of the heat.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:11.864
I am pouring it into a different bowl to make it cool down faster.

00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:18.722
The syrup is cooling down now, so meanwhile we can place the bread slices into the tray.

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:25.872
We can let some spaces between the slices.

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:36.294
I have filled the surface by the half slices also.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:42.848
Now we can pour the cool syrup all over the bread slices.

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:52.719
While the bread slices are soaking the syrup, I am preparing the sauce.

00:02:53.593 --> 00:03:01.674
I am pouring 1 + 1/2 cups cold water, 4 tbsp cocoa..

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.747
..2 tbsp flour and 1 cup granulated sugar into the pot.

00:03:12.747 --> 00:03:15.872
I am mixing it by a fork, you can use a beater also..

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.969
.. until it turns into homogenous, before turning on the heat.

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:25.246
It has turned into homogenous.

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:30.364
So, I am turning on the heat and setting it to medium level.

00:03:30.947 --> 00:03:36.228
I will cook it by stirring constantly, until it reaches the pudding consistency.

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:44.072
This is the consistency which we want to reach.

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:48.672
We can remove the sauce from the stove now.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.418
After the sauce, it is the time of cooking the pudding.

00:03:54.725 --> 00:04:04.514
I am pouring 1 liter cold milk, 1 cup granulated sugar..

00:04:05.848 --> 00:04:09.247
..and 1 cup flour into the mixture.

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:14.409
I am mixing these cold ingredients before turning on the heat..

00:04:14.695 --> 00:04:18.726
.. until the mixture turns into homogenous.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:22.228
Ok, it has turned into homogenous.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:26.527
So, I am turning on the heat and setting it to medium level.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:32.175
I am cooking it, until it reaches the right consistency.

00:04:33.144 --> 00:04:36.459
I am keeping on cooking the pudding.

00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:39.065
As you have noticed that, I have cooked the sauce before the pudding.

00:04:39.432 --> 00:04:42.205
Because, we want the sauce cool down..

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:46.807
..while I am cooking the pudding.

00:04:53.024 --> 00:04:55.654
You can see the holes over the pudding’s surface..

00:04:56.453 --> 00:05:00.018
..so, I am adding the vanilla  and 1 tbsp butter now.

00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:16.307
I am turning the heat off and mixing the pudding for a while.

00:05:16.658 --> 00:05:20.973
As you know that, it is very important to whisk the pudding for a long time..

00:05:21.814 --> 00:05:23.375
.. for cooking Turkish style white pudding.

00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:27.034
So, we will whisk it for a long time.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:30.801
We are whisking the pudding for about 7 or 10 minutes.

00:05:47.272 --> 00:05:50.966
It has reached the right consistency.

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:53.301
You can see the bubbles all over the pudding.

00:05:53.698 --> 00:06:06.553
We can pour it all over the bread slices, which have already soaked the syrup.

00:06:09.328 --> 00:06:11.595
I am placing the pudding all over the bread slices by the spoon..

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:15.892
..you need to be patient a little.

00:06:26.098 --> 00:06:30.156
After placing the pudding all over the bread slices..

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:33.156
.. it is the time of the sauce.

00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:37.350
We have mixed the sauce time to time, after cooking it.

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:43.138
It is for preventing the butter layer over the pudding.

00:06:43.616 --> 00:06:47.697
I am pouring it all over the surface.

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:14.562
Well, it is the White Pudding with Bread!

00:07:15.403 --> 00:07:18.831
After refrigerating it for 2 hours, you can slice and serve it.

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:24.087
I hope that you will try and love it.

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:26.317
Bon Appetite! Afiyet Olsun!
