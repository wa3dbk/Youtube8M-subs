Hello, my name is Luis Estrada, and I am a
software developer. In this video, I'll show

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.810
you how to convert a picture from one format
to another. I am using FrontPage. FrontPage

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.810
is a registered trademark of Microsoft, a
company to which I have no affiliation. Keeping

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.980
your images file size as small as you can
will make your web pages load much faster.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.800
In this page, I will insert this bitmap image
into the page. The problem with this file

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.329
is that it is about three megabytes in size
and it is a very large image. We will use

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:55.680
FrontPage to make the image smaller by resizing
it and changing its format. Insert the picture.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.920
Click on the picture and grab from any of
the corners to reduce its size.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.030
Now, right click on the image and select Change
Picture File Type. There are many image formats

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.450
to choose from. The first one is GIF. This
is the best option for computer generated

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.380
images or drawings that have only a few range
of well-defined colors. GIF images are usually

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.490
small, and they are used in logos or small
animations, like blinking buttons, arrows,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.200
and text. The next option is JPEG. This is
by far the most popular image format used

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.310
on the web. It is the best option for photographs,
and it produces high quality pictures with

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:52.909
small file sizes. The other two options refer
to the PNG format. PNG was created as the

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.180
evolution of the GIF format. It provides a
greater compression and smaller file sizes.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.579
The main difference with the GIF format is
that PNG does not support animations. The

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.750
other difference is that while PNG images
are widely supported with modern web browsers

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.850
and applications; they are not as widely supported
as GIF images. Whenever you choose either

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:30.030
of the formats FrontPage calculates the changed
size.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.420
In this case, it appears that the JPEG format
will result in the smallest file size. Additionally,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.250
you can select a quality setting that also
reduces the file size. Let's try for example

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.340
a sixty percent value. When we press the OK
button we would have converted a three megabyte

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.810
bit map image into a JPEG image of just a
few kilobytes. When you save the new page

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.490
FrontPage will ask you for the location to
store the new picture, and you will have the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:14.800
possibility of changing the file type again.
I am Luis Estrada,and I have just showed you

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.530
how to create a multimedia website using FrontPage.
