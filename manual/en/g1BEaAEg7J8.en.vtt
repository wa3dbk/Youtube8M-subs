00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.780
So you've been watching me on TV for a
while and now you want to start turning.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.180
This is where it all begins, in a garage.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.950
It's a lot less money than a larger lathe,
but it still does a lot of great

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.360
projects. Most lathes come with a pulley
system and in this one I have two pulleys.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.529
Whoa talk about intimidating, even for an
experienced woodturner you can get lost on

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.269
this Isle. You can get free wood by going
to a tree service. You can use that wood

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.140
to make bowls and other things. Now before you start turning, make sure you sharpen

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.560
your tools. And why do you sneak up on a bead? Because you can't make this in one cut.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.420
So does this look familiar? This is where
we shoot our show. Now my lathe is front

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.060
and center.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.450
AllIi do in the shop is turn, so that's
important to me

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.850
my tools are within reach. I have
cabinets for storage right here. If you come

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.230
over to here, this is my sharpening
station which is very close to the lathe.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.510
That makes it nice and easy to come over
here.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.750
It also if you notice, has good lighting
so that way I can see what I'm doing.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.080
For a beginning turner, if you're not quite
sure if this is your thing, I'd recommend

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.310
going with a mini lahe.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.180
It's a lot less money than a larger lathe,
but it still does a lot of great

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.950
projects like pins, cups, little bowls,
candlesticks. You can make about anything

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.090
on here. You're only limited by the size
of it, but one thing to keep in mind too

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.010
is, as you go along,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.460
you're going to do bigger bigger
projects. Possibly, so you move into maybe

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.350
a midi lathe and this lathe is a very nice
stout lathe. It has a good swing and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.250
distance between centers and I'm going
to get into all that explained to you.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.470
There are literally hundreds of choices,
dozens of manufacturers. One thing that holds

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.240
true though, make sure you get high speed steel. That steel will hold an edge for a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.420
long time and makes your turning a lot
more enjoyable.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.470
Now there are six tools I recommend for
a beginning turner. You're gonna want to do spindle

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.330
and bowl turning. To start off with the
spindle turning, I recommend a roughing

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.080
gouge. This one's one and a quarter
inches.This is the first tool you're

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.560
going to use when you're trying to make
a blank round piece of wood round on

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.280
your lathe. Now the next tool I recommend
is a spindle gouge. This one is three or

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.690
three-eighths of an inch and it is the
thing that makes the shapes, it makes the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.970
beads, it makes all the fancy stuff when
you're turning something on the lathe.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.959
This piece of wood right here is a good
example. This is cut, you can make a bowl out

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.700
of it right? But look what happened, it
cracked. The wood is wet when it's

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.739
brand-new and green. So it's losing
moisture like, that so it cracks. What you

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.110
need to prevent the cracking is
something called green wood sealer and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.470
it looks a little bit like milk, but it's
an emulsion and what it does is it helps

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.350
seal up the pores of the wood.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.250
The woods kinda like a straw and it starts
leaking all that water, well that will

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.080
keep it from cracking, it'll slow it down.
The other thing though is you can't turn

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.890
a bowl straight from that the beginning.
You've got to do what we call a rough

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.120
turn. You have to turn the bowl to this
shape, keep it kind of thick. Now all we

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.740
have to do here in Oklahoma, is put this
bowl in here with a bunch of shavings

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.700
and that'll let the water slowly come
out of the wood, so after about three or

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.960
four months, you can turn this to finished
bowl. Just make sure you close the bag up

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.300
really tight and store it in a cool dry
place.
