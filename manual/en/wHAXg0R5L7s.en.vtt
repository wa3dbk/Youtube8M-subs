00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:11.308
Girl, you're so beautiful,

00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:14.443
and I'm so glad to know

00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:18.158
that the price of binoculars

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:21.873
has gotten so very low.

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:25.170
Girl, I'm so glad to see

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.468
you changing out here from the street.

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:32.044
Someday you'll be in the perfect

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:36.548
situation for us to meet.

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:39.474
But until then...

00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:42.957
I'll be watching you...

00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:46.765
Out here from your tree...

00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:49.691
That's a nice bra.

00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:51.688
You're gonna take a shower.

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:53.685
Oh yeah, snap!

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:56.053
It looks like you are.

00:00:56.053 --> 00:00:59.907
And I'll say one thing to that:

00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:02.787
Happy Valentine's to me.

00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:06.177
Girl, I know where you go

00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:09.939
when you're doing your laundry.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.096
I know you do it at half past 1:00,

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:16.159
and I have seen you pee.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.459
I know what brand you buy

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.083
when concerned 'bout feminine hygiene.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:28.143
I've salvaged pieces of your hair,

00:01:28.143 --> 00:01:30.210
and I've eaten them.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.296
It tasted good.

00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:37.733
I made myself a scrapbook

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:41.494
of things that I have taken

00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:44.792
from your house.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.950
I wait 'til you leave for work

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.270
and then I sneak in

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.740
and I'll raid your med cabinet...

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.841
Happy Valentine's to me.

00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:01.069
Girl, I'm writing you to say

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.459
I can't take another day.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.988
We'll be together alive or

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:11.332
maybe in another way.

00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:15.047
Marry me; I'm in love.

00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:18.055
Please don't get a restraining order.

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:22.060
Legal action's not necessary.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.979
Why do girls think I'm scary?

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.397
Seems they all do...

00:02:29.397 --> 00:02:32.741
Maybe you are different...

00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:36.456
Or maybe you are not...

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.451
And I'll stay alone...

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:43.190
Up here in your tree...

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.023
Watching you undress...

00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:49.419
And I'll say one thing to that:

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.453
Happy Valentine's to me...

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:57.935
That was like the fourth stalker this week!

00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:01.696
I think I should maybe get some blinds for my windows.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.374
Some blinds will do...

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:18.490
(sigh)
