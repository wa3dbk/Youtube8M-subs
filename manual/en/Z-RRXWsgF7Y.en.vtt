00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.480
Hey Leo bro, dude I have been looking all
over for you, where have you been man?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.340
Wait, wait a minute, what is this on my foot.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.290
This is disgusting man.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.240
Mikey you just stepped in some pieces of some
radioactive ooze, I have been trying to get

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.130
Raph to clean it up for weeks.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.660
Awe, Dude this is so gross man, how are we
going to get rid of it.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.150
Wait a minute, why donâ€™t we get Donnie to
pile it in the Shellraiser and drive it off.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.020
Da da na an, hey guys I am here to clean up
all the ooze right here, so where do I start?

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.840
Donnie, you can start by collecting all of
this right here.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.640
Alright let me see if i can put this one right
here and oh my.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.690
Leo, hey there is way to much ooze stuck in
the Shellraiser, how much more do we have?

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.630
Well we still got a lot more Donnie, it looks
like, one two three four five six seven.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.670
fifteen more pieces.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.090
Well you know what, this is not working out,
the Shellraiser just isn't big enough.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.310
We're going to need a different vehicle to
get rid of all of it.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.909
Ah lets see, how am I going to get all the
ooze in the Shellraiser, probably got to modify

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.350
it some how.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.440
Donatello need help.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.630
Hey, Metal Head I was just figuring out how
we get fit all the ooze in the Shellraiser.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.290
Metal Head knows how.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.829
Metal Head will help Donatello.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:39.030
Metal Head must smash Shellraiser, smash,
smash, smash, smash, smash, smash, smash.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.600
Metal Head, what did you do?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.770
You just smashed the Shell Razor and ruined
it.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.039
Now we flip smashed Shellraiser, Metal Head
I see what you did, you made the Shellraiser

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.770
into a recycling truck.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.429
Now we can easily transport the ooze out of
our sewer lair.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.799
Guys, check it out, I turned the Shellraiser
into a recycling truck, now lets get this

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.490
ooze out of here.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.229
And the final piece, uh alright that is the
last of it.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.799
So long guys, now say hello to our mutation
ooze free sewer lair.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.989
The toy featured in this video is the Ninja
Turtle Half Shell Heroes Shellraiser which

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.290
mutates itself into a recycling truck.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.709
This also comes with a little Donnie action
figure who is wearing a pair of protective

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.709
lenses.

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.349
And check this out, this is a two in one vehicle
who turns himself from a Shellraiser into

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.940
a recycling truck.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.719
These are so cool that everyone has gathered
to see the mutation.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.719
Now these little vehicles are pretty cool,
all the tires do spin, let's just spin it

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.719
around here.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.830
Here is the front carrier, the front door,
all of this doesnâ€™t open, but you can put

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.480
somebody at the very top, which I'm gonna
show you in just a sec.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.090
It also has that little knob so you can place
it over the hole of Donatello right here,

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.239
so he can stand in place.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.010
Now here comes the fun part, what we've all
been waiting for, lets take Donatello out,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.220
and you just push in the tops here and these
easily fold inward and you can see, now they

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.799
are smashed and out the other side comes the
recycling truck, and now we can put Donatello

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.730
in the cab of the recycling truck.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.010
Now lets check it out, the wheels are the
exact same but the recycling truck does look

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.850
a little bit different, its got a white front
cab with a blue carrier in the back there.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.969
it says NYC New York City Recycling.

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:31.499
Now lets transform it back, we first have
to take Donatello out, and then spin it back

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:33.280
around, you can push the backside down.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.620
You can see now those pieces fold in and the
Shellraiser is back to normal.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.950
