00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.420
Leo?

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:07.536
What's up, bro?

00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:08.624
How are you?

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:10.355
So long no see.

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.459
Look! You are...

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.158
-different.
-Liked it?

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.315
Is it a discman?

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:18.736
Sure! I just listen to discman.
Best thing ever.

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:21.895
-The best sound quality.
-I get it, worst quality.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.270
Worst but nostalgic.
A good bad one.

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.618
I only use scratched CDs
because of the natural remixes.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.211
It's very interesting.

00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:32.754
-I get it. So you still have CDs?
-Just CDs.

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:36.277
I have a CD stand, furniture
I ordered for storing CDs.

00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:37.987
Like this. This is rare.

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:40.192
The best of 1997.

00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:41.497
-See?
-Masterpiece.

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:44.838
There's Tony Braxton
with Vanessa Rangel.

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.000
There's Lighhouse Family.
The guys composed for the CD.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.090
Respect the artist's
choice.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.757
Some songs are made for the CD,
for a bad quality,

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:55.198
-compact sound...
-I get it.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.392
I've thrown mine away.
Can you believe?

00:00:57.393 --> 00:01:00.227
-Listen at my place.
-Deal! Give me your number.

00:01:00.228 --> 00:01:01.480
Write down my beeper.

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:04.123
-Beeper?
-The best thing is a pager.

00:01:04.124 --> 00:01:06.587
Pager isn't that thing
you call a central

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.278
and send the message
through a woman...

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:11.099
That's it! Much better!

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.496
They don't know if you are online,
if you've read the message,

00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:15.914
no blue check marks...

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:18.546
Besides, the woman
improves your messages.

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:20.707
She's like a consultant.
It's classy.

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:24.023
You send her, she edits,
and eventually censors you.

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:26.578
The other day I called her
a little drunk.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.537
I was sending a message
at 3 am to a girl.

00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:31.856
She said my voice
was pasty.

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:33.734
"Are you sure you want
to send it?"

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:35.769
I gave up and did well.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.549
It would be embarassing.
She was saved.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.311
-Ten times better than Whatsapp.
-But for sending pics,

00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:46.575
-and videos are impossible.
-For pics, there's fax.

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:48.015
So you still have a fax.

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:50.218
Best thing ever.
The best sensation.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.839
It beepes, and you:
"What will come out?"

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.731
The paper comes
smelling plastic.

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:58.666
Sometimes nothing comes,
just numbers, pure art.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.603
One day I sent
my girl my dick pic.

00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:02.603
So your girlfriend
also uses fax?

00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:04.897
Of course!
Her, and all ICQ friends.

00:02:04.898 --> 00:02:06.035
ICQ?

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:15.062
HI, HONEY!
I MISS YOU.

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.027
I'M SENDING
A PIC OF ME! =)
