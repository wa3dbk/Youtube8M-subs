Feed the Earth, save the World!

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:11.102
Actually, composting is a chemical process in which the microorganisms break 
 down materials with the help of oxygen and heat. 

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:45.972
A sufficient oxygen supply is very important, otherwise the materials start to decay. 

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:25.127
Moisture is also important, otherwise the microorganisms run dry.

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:10.894
What do you think, you can compost?

00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:12.821

What is compost used for?

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:57.840
Prevent the burning of leaves

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:07.360
What else should you know about composting?

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:07.740
You have to rotate the compost material.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.010
You have to sprinkle the compost material with water.

00:02:16.464 --> 00:02:18.460
Which one would you choose?

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.880

So, composting is a...

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:03.280
So, composting is a chemical process in which 
 the microorganisms and enzymes...HEY! DON'T LAUGH THERE!

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:09.730
Actually, composting is a biochemical process, in which the microORGASMS...microorganisms....
Ok, try it again.

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:17.120
Feed the Earth....Hey Victoria! What on Earth....
