00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.700
From ship-to-shore, from inland objective, we'll
take the marine infantry wherever they

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.450
need to go.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.129
We'll cover them wherever they need to
go, and that's what we do.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.770
This all behind me it's a six by MRAP. It holds seven in the back, two the front and also you could also put a

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.579
gunner. These vehicles make
significant impact on the Marines in

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.930
countries, the ability for them to go over certain terrain, the heavy armor that you out on it,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.410
things happen and they're still okay.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.180
The vehicle behind me, that's a MATV. It's part of the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.750
MRAP family which stands for
mine-resistant ambush-protected. The very

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.440
important they bring speed mobility and
firepower to the flight they can go a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.739
lot of places and other armored vehicles
tracked vehicles like tanks and stuff

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.920
like that can't go.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.380
A LAV-25, which is
what we ride on, it has a 25 millimeter

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.140
gun on it. We have a bushmaster chain gun, shoots up
to 200 rounds a minute.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.950
We have two different types of rounds that we shoot. Armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.960
The tank is the tip of spear. We
keep the tanks running and keep up in the front of the fight.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.500
This is a M1A1. The tank has one main gun,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.130
which is a 120 mm round. It also
has a 50 cal machine gun as well

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.869
was a coaxial machine gun which is also another 50 cal.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.720
AAVs are out here as a breaching device, a breaching vehicle to reduce a anti-tank ditch or a

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.400
optical firm so the follow-on forces can
get through and complete Commission.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.780
The AAV is a proven vehicle. What an AAV does it
enables the MEU, and

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.720
the United States to project its power
forward no matter what the obstacles.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.980
We can take a beach under enemy fire we can
move 10,000 pounds of equipment per

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.480
vehicle humanitarian supplies to a short
that might otherwise be unreachable.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.150
We've got TRAMs which is a big front end
loader. We've got the MCT, Medium Crawler Tractor that's

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.650
a bulldozer. We're also using MTLs which
is a multi terrain loader. This right here

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.670
by far one of my favorite pieces in the Marine Corps. It's called the  It's used mostly for

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.000
material handling,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.340
lifting iso containers.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.980
Well this is my record. It's a MK-36 used for touring all types of
vehicles. This truck and do it all

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.230
basically roll around with mechanic
everywhere we go

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.930
so we can fix trucks tow trucks and
whatever needs to get done will get done.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.160
This is the LVSR. The thing that is unique about this vehicle
is the engine is on the back of it and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.370
not the front. These joystick right here
allow me to take this flat right here

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.690
and put a flat on the ground so that
other Marines can unload it without

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.830
having to use any other equipment. The
less Marines on the ground better so as

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.160
long as we can do it with a vehicle that's
keeping those Marines protected behind

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.520
armor, it's much safer for the Marines and let
the vehicle do its job.
