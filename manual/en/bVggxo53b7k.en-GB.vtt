Hey!

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.625
Today I am doing a vlog
type of video

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:12.779
as I was quiet bussy this
week doing different projects

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:18.786
Some things did not work out
the way I wanted

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.227
That's one of the reasons I
have not uploaded any

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.542
videos this week.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.900
Anyway!

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:29.174
I decided to share a little tip
with you.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:33.229
I think lots of people will
find it handy.

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:37.837
Around two months ago I bought
this "Samsung" camera

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:44.033
to do quick video and one of
the problems I found was

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:47.607
that it does not have a
flip-out screen.

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:49.257
So, when you're filming
yourself, you don't see

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:51.468
where you are, basically.
Sometime you might be

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:55.562
sitting a little bit too much to
the left or too much to the right

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.255
That can waste lots of time

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:03.622
when you film 10 minutes
of video or more

00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:07.298
You realise that you're actually
not in a shot.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.269
Let me show you
what to do.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:20.093
Here I have a mirror
attached to a bracket

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.135
Bracket came from another microphone.

00:01:31.335 --> 00:01:37.709
Good thing about this mirror is
that you can move it

00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:39.778
You can tilt it Up or Down

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.953
That's very handy.

00:01:49.195 --> 00:01:50.891
Hello!

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:56.328
Result is not perfect, but
it does the job

00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:59.874
At least you can see
where you are.

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:03.031
I am pretty happy with result.
