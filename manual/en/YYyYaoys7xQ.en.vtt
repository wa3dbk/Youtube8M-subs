TURNS - Flip Turn Variations

00:00:05.725 --> 00:00:06.667
Flip turns.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.294
Once you've learn how to get your feet over, you may think you've got that mastered.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.302
But think again.

00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:17.009
Although there's nothing wrong with the standard flip, how could we devote many drills to the standard flip.

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:19.885
There's nothing wrong with searching for that extra edge.

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:29.267
Over the years we've seen elite athletes take the standard move and find a way to make it their own to develop a style that feels more productive to them and having the legs come fairly close together.

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:31.976
Why do it:

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:38.710
We love to encourage you to experiment all the time with your technique, sometimes the things that you're most satisfied with.

00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:42.725
You'd be tweak just a little bit more to keep you from getting complacent or stale.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.626
Remember! You have to always think more about the things you've turned into habits.

00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:50.387
There's always a chance you've made a habit something incorrect.

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:54.129
In other words, don't get lazy even with the things you think you've really got.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.184
How to do it:

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.690
Start with your standard flip turn which means your feet are next to each other as you come over.

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.555
But this isn't your standard flip to play along with me here.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.320
The feet come over easily and prepare for the push.

00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:07.077
Nice job!

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.118
Now, let's try something that Karlyn Pipes-Neilsen taught us, the split foot turn.
(The couple divorced in 2009, so Karlyn Pipes)

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:16.340
Keep your feet about shoulder-width apart as they're coming over.

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:18.618
What could be the benefit to this type of turn?

00:01:18.977 --> 00:01:22.581
Well, since the feet aren't connected, each of them creates a smaller area.

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:25.015
And this can potentially allow you to spin quicker.

00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:28.430
You feel also laid in the wall very stable position.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.581
How about trying a Tom Dolan turn.

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:35.021
Tom used to cross his feet during the flip.

00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.931
What could possibly be the advantage for this?

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:43.444
With the feet crossed, the trailing foot can be hidden from the front leg, from the resistance of the water.

00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:45.469
This can allow pretty quick turn.

00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:49.460
When the feet hit the wall, they'll be a bit crisscrossed as you begin to push.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.184
But your body will un-coil like a knotted pretzel, twerking you over to your side for the first powerful pull.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.385
Hide the feet totally.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.176
One fun trick is to try doing a flip turn while keeping your feet as close to the surface as possible rather than flipping them high in the air.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.570
What can be the advantage to this?

00:02:06.657 --> 00:02:10.500
The closer your feet are to the surface, the tighter you're going after get your body.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.798
And the tighter you get your body, the faster you can flip, and hence a quicker turn.

00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:17.450
How to do it really well(the fine points):

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.317
When you think about it, all of these are fine points.

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:24.006
Give them all a try and find out where each one is a benefit.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.787
And find out how awkward they all feel in their own right.

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:29.096
Are any of these turns meant for you?

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:31.104
You'll never know unless you try.
