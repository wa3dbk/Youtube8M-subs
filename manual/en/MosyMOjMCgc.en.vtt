00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.620
Sucker For Temptation

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.620
This random dude pulled me aside.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.050
I said fire away I've got nothing to hide.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.740
What's the secret to your game.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.531
He said I'd play chicken with a crazy train.

00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:01.780
I've walked the fine line between the gutter
and the glory.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:24.380
And that's all there's is to my story.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.540
Two days later fucked up abroad.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.640
I raised the stakes with a stolen credit card.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.860
Oh what a crazy night, I played my cards alright.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.860
My stack was getting high and so was I.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.860
Well that's the thing with a bad reputation
word goes around

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.860
what can I say, I'm a sucker for temptation
you just got to know, when to get out!

00:01:33.860 --> 00:02:38.684
Broke to the bone and my last train's gone
I fled the scene just before the mean riot

00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:39.684
like a rolling stone
I'm hungry and I'm cold, lord knows I'm growing

00:02:39.684 --> 00:02:40.684
old
I don't care what hand you deal me, I will

00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:41.684
never fold

00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:43.019
I just came in from the cold
I took off my hat and hung up my coat

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:52.230
give me a bottle of your finest wine
start dealing the cards and stop wasting my

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.230
time

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.230
Well that's the thing with a bad reputation
word goes around

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.230
what can I say, I'm a sucker for temptation
you just got to know..

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.230
Broke to the bone and my last train's gone
I fled the scene just before the mean riot

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.230
like a rolling stone
I'm hungry and I'm cold, lord knows I'm growing

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.230
old
I don't care what hand you deal me, I will

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.230
never fold

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.241
I've walked the fine line between the gutter
and the glory
