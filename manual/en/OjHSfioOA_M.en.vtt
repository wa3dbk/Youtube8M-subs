00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:02.143
[music]

00:00:02.143 --> 00:00:04.251
Legendary golf course designer Pete Dye

00:00:04.251 --> 00:00:06.630
is redesigning the Ackerman Hills Golf Course,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.652
which will be his second at Purdue University.

00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:12.511
In the late 1990's he worked with golf course superintendent Jim Scott

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.127
to transform the old north course into the Kampen Course.

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:22.080
And the idea was, they wanted to change a hole on the north course

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.893
so I went to see the President.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.472
Told him that we needed 7 or 8 million dollars.

00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:35.729
Finally I said to him I'll do my work for zero.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:38.147
And I'll bring in the people.

00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:42.176
Then for some reason I said I'll raise the 7 million dollars for you.

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:45.149
He jumped out of that chair, shook my hand and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.186
that's the only agreement I've ever had [laughing] for this project.

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:53.786
I didn't know the first time I met Pete that he said

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.189
we're going to build this with students.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:02.239
We hired 32 students along with some other skilled labor to come in and build Kampen.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.271
Now what we're going to do on Ackerman is, we're still going to have the agronomy students,

00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:08.383
and the student involvement - we want that.

00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:13.271
Now we're going to bring in some skilled labor to do the heavy dozing and things like that

00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:17.650
so we get that done and then we'll be able to have the student involvement.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.686
That will be so good for the resume- it's just one of those things.

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.567
You don't get the opportunity to build a golf course,

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:30.664
but you definitely don't get an opportunity very often to build a Pete Dye golf course.

00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:33.154
So what Pete has done, he's come in there and

00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:36.317
he's actually using the same plot of land but he is crossing over.

00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:41.102
Using some of the ravine, using some of the topography that is there

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:45.617
and created - it is just a magnificent golf course.

00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:51.528
It's still playable. We're going to keep the member's tees, if you will, up front where they're at now.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:57.211
But then we've got the length for the collegiate player, to challenge the collegiate player.

00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:05.859
The Ackerman course there's some extra length that was available, the school had

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:11.074
and they can put two or three holes in there.

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:15.739
And that opened up the Ackerman course to make it a lot easier to walk.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.324
His vision and what he sees, his lines, his cuts, his shadowing and

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.631
everything else I've never ever seen that.

00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.830
His bunkering and all that.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.896
Obviously he's not going to have a lot of hard cuts on the Ackerman Allen course.

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:32.258
He's going to have bunkering but it's going to be very subtle, very mild.

00:02:32.258 --> 00:02:35.067
It's still very playable and I think we've got it to work.

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:38.200
Now we've just got to put it together.
