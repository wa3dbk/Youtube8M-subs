ERIKA STORM WASSER:
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.320
It's me, Erika Storm Wasser,
Spaces' social guru.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.590
So over the course of Urban
Gardener, you guys left a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.000
bunch of comments
and questions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.730
And now that harvest season is
officially over, it's about

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.370
time we got back to you.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.580
First up, after watching the
hummus rooftop garden, users

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.060
sloc27 and dela75 asked,
how do we make this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.550
hummus rooftop garden?

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.710
SpacesTV, please show us how!

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.240
Well, despite what I originally
thought, Denton was

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.510
not actually referring to
the Mediterranean dip.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.360
But what he was talking about
was the rooftop garden humus,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.740
which is an organic material
that they use.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.870
And it's actually
food for plants.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.280
But it's also mixed with
a lightweight gravel.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.690
And that creates a less

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.640
weight-bearing load on the roof.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.340
And that is how you
would create your

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.980
humus rooftop garden.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.910
But next season of Urban
Gardener, we're going to be

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.000
sure to do a lot more how-to's
and really explain everything.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
As far as doing a green rooftop
garden yourself, this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.360
one needs to be professionally
installed, mainly because you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.820
have to really make sure they're
waterproof because

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.150
green roofs actually store
water rather than

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.590
sending them to sewage.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.700
Next up, in our episode about
the crazy sculpture courtyard

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.180
garden, user Sharonie11 sent
us this little nugget.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.040
Hibiscus?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.840
How do you grow hibiscus
in Brooklyn?

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.910
Well, Sharonie11, we have
the answer for you.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.020
Hibiscus actually comes in a
lot of different varieties,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.510
one of which is specifically
made for Brooklyn

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.140
temperatures.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.940
If you go to a gardener,
it's between zone

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.460
four and zone five.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.970
And it is called hearty
hibiscus.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.370
So there you go.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.320
Moving right along, in our
episode about how to compost a

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.120
green garden, inspired user
mbechea asked, am I the only

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.260
one who thinks the host here
is a little strange?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.080
Not trying to hate.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.840
Well, we asked around, and it
turns out, it is only you.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.960
So, yeah.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.360
This next question has boggled
us and confounded us.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.700
But we stuck in there and
we have an answer.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.070
On the episode where there's an
outdoor atrium where a room

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.940
used to be, user urbanecologie
asked, where are

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.980
those chairs from?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.121
He admired the white chairs that
Denton was sitting on.

00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:13.280
And the truth is,
we have no idea.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.425
It turns out they were purchased
in an antique sale

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:16.930
in Maine by the owner.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.930
But since you like the look, you
should know that they have

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.190
pretty similar options in the
Russell Woodward Sculptura

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.410
chairs and the original Knoll
Harry Bertoia chairs.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.760
We also found the Loop Chairs
from Urban Outfitters, but I

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.220
don't even think they
make them anymore.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.130
So you're going to have to
Craigslist or Google.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.690
All we did was go, metal
white outdoor chairs.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.260
We found them.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.970
Oh, actually, the owner
of the garden doesn't

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.020
even want them anymore.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.420
And if she finds something
better, she is willing to sell

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.170
them to you.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.060
So if you really want
them, let us know.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.080
And we will put you in touch.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.700
Also from that episode, user
TouristInExile asked, how you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.170
maintain structural integrity of
the floor and still keep it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.310
in line with the floors
on either side?

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.170
How deep the soil layer?

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.670
Is the space between the
beams filled with soil?

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.400
And is hallway intact or did
you have to go through the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.370
atrium to get to one
of the rooms?

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.510
He then asked for my firstborn,
my social security

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.300
number, if my hair is
natural colored.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.630
No-- first, the obvious.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.210
This kind of a garden requires
a professional installer

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.715
similarly to the green roofs,
but with an actual

00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:20.990
architect on hand.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.080
Again, this is mainly because
it has to be really

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.540
well-sealed and waterproof.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.005
And you have to be very careful,
as these atriums and

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.145
green roofs store water instead
of sending it away.

00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:33.200
That said, you only need between
two and four inches of

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.612
soil, depending on what
you are planting.

00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:39.010
And lastly, the atrium was
actually self-contained and

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.125
had the house surrounding it.

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:43.760
So you needn't walk through
to get to other rooms.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.560
Finally, from the episode about
how to plant an urban

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.980
garden, user TouristInExile
asked us this question.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.440
If I buy a plant and keep it in
the pot, how long do I have

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.030
to plant it in the ground?

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.860
I'm thinking about something
like an azalea.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.600
And can perennials
winter in pots?

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.830
That, in fact-- two questions.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.960
But first, you can keep a plant
in a pot indefinitely,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.970
as long as it has fertilizer,
water, and light, you're fine.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.570
Azaleas are actually used often
on roofs, so make sure

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.390
you have ample light
for that one.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.800
As far as wintering perennials
in pots, absolutely.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.000
Soil is soil.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.269
Find out what you want to plant,
if it's an indoor or an

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:24.890
outdoor plant, and get to it.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.810
Other than that, the
pot is fine.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.112
And lastly lastly, user dela75
asked, Why don't you come film

00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:33.362
in my garden?

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.860
Congratulations, dela75.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.890
That is it for Urban Gardener,
season one.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.410
We will definitely be doing an
Urban Gardener season two.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.410
So stay tuned.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.410
Keep watching Spaces for all
great home and design shows--

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.085
like my show, and
Spaces, with me.

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:54.900
And keep sending
your questions.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.020
Comment below.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.640
Find us on Facebook,
Pinterest, Tumblr.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.370
Come to our house.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.860
Knock on the door.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.740
I don't know, just saying.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.510
Keep them coming.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.470
We will try to find and
dig up the answers.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.370
Dig--

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.510
really, dig?

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.840
That's the best we can do?

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.110
-Dig, like gardening.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.510
You get it--

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.780
like, dig?

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.030
ERIKA STORM WASSER: I guess
that's the best we can do.
