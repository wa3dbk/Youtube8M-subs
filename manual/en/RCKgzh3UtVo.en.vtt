00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.970
A rev limiter, the more time you spend on
it, the more it costs you in a race.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.130
Knowing when to shift is critical to keeping
your vehicle in the optimal power band, and

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.920
saving expensive engine components.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.760
If the TAC you purchased did not come with
a shift light, or you prefer your OEM TAC,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.250
a digital shift light might just be what you're
looking for.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.359
Today we're going to install and test a digital
shift light from MSD on our project 666 Mustang

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:43.379
and show you exactly how easy it is to install
and test.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.620
The MSD DSL shift light is compact in size
to allow for a variety of mounting locations.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.670
It features an easy to view LED read out,
making it simple to adjust for a desired shift

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.370
point and the wiring, as simple as connecting
three wires, that's it, the first step of

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.869
the install.

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.230
Mount the shift light with the included bracket
making sure to still access the buttons on

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.659
the side of the shift light, the wiring has
the simple 12 volt switched power source,

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.210
ground, and TAC signal.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.770
Take note, if you have a vehicle that has
a distributor-less ignition set up like the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.869
GM LS or Ford mod motor, MSD includes a GMR
pick up to properly convert the TAC signal

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.130
from the coil pack.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.920
This pick up will typically hook up to a coil
positive wire with an output TAC signal wire

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.289
hooking to the DSL shift light, plus a ground
wire.

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.420
Fairly simple so far right?

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.259
Well that was the difficult part.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.380
With the MSD DSL shift light mounted and wired
up, programming the lights is the last step.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.969
Pressing the two buttons simultaneously puts
you in programming mode, the first step, adjust

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.939
the activation RPM for the shift light, next
adjust the cylinder count and fine tune the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.799
shift light illumination to your desired intensity.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.780
Setting it to zero will turn off the shift
light while nine will give maximum brightness.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.260
Once the shift light is wired up, it's time
to test it out, MSD recommends starting at

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.000
a low RPM to make sure the RPM on the shift
light corresponds with what the TAC is displaying.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.400
With everything checking out properly, move
the shift light a few hundred RPMs below the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.860
desired shift point to allow for adequate
reaction time between the shift light's illumination

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.400
and the time it takes to shift.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.760
In a matter of one hour you can have your
MSD DSL shift light mounted and ready to go.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.489
Now when you hit the track you can keep your
eyes on the track, knowing the MSD shift light

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.370
is going to be there when you need to grab
that next gear.
