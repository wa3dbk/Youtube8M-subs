00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:06.430
With the finishing touches complete the Sony
Centre for the Performing Arts unveiled its

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.030
thrilling renovation just a few weeks ago.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.950
The theatre looks brand new - the transformation
is remarkable. To me that was the biggest

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.010
achievment that we could accomplish;
Take an old theatre, restore it back to its

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.410
original beauty and make it look new at the
same time.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.070
All new seats, 3200 new seats, designed in
12 different ways, and we also have wood on

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.529
the seats that are made to match the wood
on the walls and they're all acoustically

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.400
perfect seats.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.430
1700 beautiful cherry wood panels every one
of these panels was hand restored. They were

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.540
sanded, they were restained, and finished
with 5 coats of shellac.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.909
We put in 89 high-end Sony monitors throughout
the theatre. And there's more! What we wanted

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.890
to do was take this old building and make
it new again but at the same time preserve

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.790
the heritage quality.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.790
After more than 2 years of work this historic
building now integrates exciting new technologies

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.780
with its architectural beauty.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.610
Dan, now that the holidays are upon us I hear
that you're bringing in one of my all time

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.930
favorite Christmas cartoons as a musical.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.360
We are indeed, absolutely, and there it is.
Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.820
the Musical.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
It's going to be fantastic. I saw the show
on Broadway a few years ago. It is great,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.420
wonderful, wonderful family show and it's
going to be here for lots of performances

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.250
throughout December.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.680
When you come to the theatre you'll be walking
into Whoville basically which is fantastic.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.920
The set is gorgeous. You can see the kids
screaming with excitement when the Grinch

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.530
comes out and scares everybody.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.530
It really brings forth the whole vision of
Dr Seuss. It almost looks like the book is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.450
literally on the stage, it's really quite exciting.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.550
And there's an incredible children's chorus
in the show, a bunch of little kids from Whoville

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.049
including Cindy Lou and all of her friends.
The kids in the audience sing along with all

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.229
of the numbers that people know in the show
 .. and of course "You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch"

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.229
is obviously one of the most famous and popular
songs and everybody gets into it.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.500
It's almost a very interactive production
with the audience really chiming in with the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.640
actors and having fun.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.640
Magnificient sets, amazing costumes and a
heart-warming story that everyone loves.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.340
