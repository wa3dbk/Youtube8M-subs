Welcome to how to cook that I am Ann Reardon

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.560
Today hello kitty has made it to the top of
the cake request list ... with just a few

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.110
of you asking for a hello kitty cake
All right here we go

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.059
You're going to need one quantity of italian
meringue frosting because it is brilliant

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.050
white and it's light and it's fluffy it is
just the perfect frosting for this cake.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.679
If you haven't made that before there is video
recipe showing how to do that just click on

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.260
the link in the description below this video
to go to howtocookthat.net and all the recipe

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.680
quantities and the video explaining how to
make it is there for you.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.300
You will also find the cake sized hello kitty
template there.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.890
So print that out, cut one of the sheets through
the nose and bow and use that to line it up

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.059
with the second sheet and sticky tape it into
place.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.350
Then cut out the face completely and this
is going to be our guide for how big to make

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.989
details and exactly where to place them.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.949
You are also going to need two 20cm cakes,
you can use vanilla, chocolate, red velvet

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.170
whatever your favourite cake is.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.770
Take one of the cakes and place the cheek
of the kitty against the edge of the cake

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.190
and make note where the nose is because that
is the central point of the face and cut the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.200
cake straight down at that point.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.910
Take your second cake, put it under the first
one and cut it to exactly the same size.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.390
turn it around, join them together and you
will have the right width for your cake.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.320
Then out your template over the top and using
that as a guide trim off a small amount, just

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.550
a tiny bit at the top and bottom just to straighten
up the middle edge there.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.200
Next use one of your off cut pieces to cut
two ears, again use your template as your

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.810
cutting guide and then you're going to need
to round off the lower edge of the ear so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
that it fits snuggly against the round cake.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.550
Put them in place and then use your template
to cut around again and get it exactly right.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.030
The simpler a cake design looks the more exact
it needs to be to make it look good.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.890
Trim your ears to the same height as the height
of the cake by slicing some off the bottom

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.170
of the ear.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.600
And then you can put your ears to one side
for now.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.810
And slice through the cake in the centre so
it gives you two layers.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.060
Put a smear of italian meringue on your cake
board to stop the cake from moving around

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.280
and put your bottom layer in place.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.060
Now I am adding a thin layer of strawberry
jam between the layers, you can use lemon

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.370
curd or any other filling of your choice.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.580
Then add the top layer of cake and clear away
any crumbs so they don't get stuck in your

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.580
frosting.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.700
Pile some of your italian meringue on top
of the cake and spread it out over the top

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700
using a spatula or a palette knife.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.600
Then spread it down and around so that you
cover all the sides get more frosting out

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.030
of the bowl if you need it you've got plenty
there just make sure you keep a little bit

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.940
because we will need some later.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.590
Then using a flexible piece of plastic smooth
off the cake.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.590
If you go to a stationary store you will find
plastic folders or document pockets there

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.510
that you can cut up and use for this purpose.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.920
Then use a pallette knife to smooth the edges.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.760
Now for the messy bit, take one ear at a time
and cover it in frosting on the base and the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.900
sides.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.431
Put it into place and then use your spatula
smooth cover the top and smooth the sides

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:17.060
of the ears to give the slightly pointy kitty
ears shape.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.030
To make your whiskers take some licorice and
cut it thinner and use the template that we've

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.630
got to measure the length of each whisker.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.230
Cut a longer thin strip of licorice and use
it to outline the face.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.950
Now if you don't have any licorice that is
long in a roll like this in stores near you

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.950
or if you don't like licorice you can always
use black fondant for this just roll it out

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.130
thinly into a long snake and outline it.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.980
Because it is a cartoon character they always
look better outlined because that's how they

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.340
are drawn.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.070
Then hold your template above your cake, now
don't touch the cake or the icing with the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.810
template just hover it over the cake and hold
your whisker in position, then move the template

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.950
and put the whisker down in place.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.710
And repeat that on the other side.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.050
This will just help you get it exactly how
it is on the drawing so that it looks like

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.590
hello kitty.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.240
Make an oval nose out of the licorice for
the nose and again use your template as a

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.870
guide of where to place it on the cake.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.040
Cut the two eyes out of licorice again you
can use fondant if you'd rather and then place

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.430
them on the cake in exactly the right spot.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.840
To make you bow you're going to need two 60g
balls of fondant and one 20g ball of fondant

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.380
in the colour of your choice, most often you'll
see it in red or pink.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.450
Take one of the larger balls and squash one
end of it between your palms just as shown.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.070
And then put it on your template and flatten
it with one hand while supporting the top

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.070
edge of it with the other hand so that you're
keeping it within the shape of the template.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.330
Repeat that for the other side to the bow,
squash it and then flatten it and then keep

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.770
it in the shape of the template.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.780
Next take a teaspoon and make an indent on
each side of the bow, just like you'll see

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.870
on the picture of hello kitty.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.351
And then take your 20 grams of fondant and
roll it into a nice neat ball, place it in

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:22.419
the centre and flatten it slightly to get
it to the right size using the palm of your

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:23.470
hand.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.900
Gently pick up your bow and place it on your
kitty.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.639
You're nearly done just
take a small amount of italian meringue and

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.900
mix it with some yellow colouring, put it
in a ziplock bag, twist the top of the bag,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.400
cut off the very corner Then hold it low in
the centre of the nose and pipe frosting in

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.040
to fill the nose and you might need to use
your finder to smooth it off.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.040
It's kitty.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.870
Next week we have a dessert video and then
following week is chocolate so if you haven't

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.650
