00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.780
I really don't understand if you
couldn't stop the guy in a top hat before,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.880
how does Clara jumping in your
time stream suddenly fix the problem?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.560
Yeah for real.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.250
It just does! I don't know she's the impossible girl.
So do you two just sit here?

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.110
Every day? How do you not get bored?
So what are you doing here Mr. Doctor?

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.020
Well, being a Time Lord, I've saved entire
planets time and again.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.790
I'm basically a superhero for the
universe. So i thought id take a little break.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.849
Drop on by and say,

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.890
You're welcome, gentleman.
You save planets?
All the time. Yes.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.600
Well my planet exploded. So what's the deal Ah yes!

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.530
Krypton! Sorry about that. Fixed point in
time. I couldn't interfere.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.480
Very difficult to explain.
Hmm. convenient.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.199
Yes. Yes it is. Just like your utility belt,

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.199
as they say.
Just like your magic wand.
It's not magic the sonic screwdriver...

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.609
and I bet you'd love to have one!

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.640
No. I'd have a bat-screwdriver.
What would a bat do with a screwdriver?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.780
You could have saved Rory and Amy!
What? They lived happily ever after!
You abandoned them in America.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.420
Is he always like this?
AMY!

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.480
I would have gone back for you!

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.700
Because I'm Batman!
Sorry he's kind of passionate.
She's so hot.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.930
Attractive companions! Yes! One more
item on the superhero comparison.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.460
As I said...

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.790
You're welcome.
So what's next doc?
Oh I don't know more the same I suppose.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.370
Always running always saving.
Probably get a new body soon.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.000
Big adjustment period really.
Well, let us know if you ever need any help

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.330
with a Dalek or something.
Oh I don't think that would be necessary.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.620
Why not?
Because you see it's hard to snap a Dalek
neck, when they don't have necks to begin with.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.920
 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.250
Oh snap!
More like no snap! haha. You see what I did there?

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.640
You're all right Mr. Doctor.
Ha Ha Ha.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.000
You guys are never gonna let that go are you?

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.000
Now seriously, go back and save Amy.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.000
Super Cafe- Who's a Hero

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.100
Hey! You wanna know my secret identity?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.640
No! No! Out! How did you even get in here?
Because I'm Batman!

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.640
 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.540
 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.420
