00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.740
I love to eat.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:13.719
I like just about everything and to me cuisine
is really one of the signal achievements of

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:20.170
our society.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.680
Plants play an essential role in that process
by giving us the goods, the fruits and vegetables

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.119
that provide much of the raw material for
our cuisine.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.050
And yet plants themselves never get to experience
cuisine as we do.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.280
And to me that seemed always to be kind of
a shame I suppose that they should give us

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.800
something as extraordinary as they do and
not get it in turn.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.720
So I started to think about how planets might
get their own form of cuisine that would go

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:11.550
beyond the everyday experience that they have
of gouging themselves on sunlight.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.280
If you think about it our cuisine is simply
a fancy way in which the basic nutrients that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.560
we need are articulated in balance with each
other to provide an aesthetically pleasing

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.430
experience.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.720
I figured that there's no reason why you can't
do the same thing for a plant, given that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.520
plants are consuming the full spectrum of
sunlight and that different parts of the spectrum

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.160
give plants different essential elements in
their diet.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:01.130
So I started to look at some of the leading
cookbooks by Julia Child and others and trying

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.950
to reverse engineer from those cookbooks the
various ways in which different ingredients

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.840
work together, the way in which different
food stocks that are necessary for our sustenance

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.280
are put together to transform them into cuisine.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.420
At the same time I started looking at sunlight
and the way in which different parts of the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.290
spectrum are essential to plants and plant
respond to different parts of the spectrum

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.500
in different ways.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.850
And then I started to map the one onto the
other in order to make a photosynthetic cuisine,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.530
a photosynthetic restaurant for planets.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.349
The idea was to build a meal that the plant
would experience over the course of the day

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.370
by filtering sunlight through colored filters.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.680
Where the order in which the colors were exposed
to the plant would be the cuisine that would

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.650
have all of the nutritive value that the plants
would get were they exposed to the full spectrum

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.100
for the entire day but would put those nutrient
in relationship to each other in a way that

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.129
would have a sort of culinary satisfaction
in addition to simply a metabolic satisfaction.

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.670
So in the case of a comfort food for plants
or a French sort of style cuisine, a Continental

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:38.480
cuisine what I can do is I can take the sunlight
that occurs over the course of the day naturally

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.220
where it moves from more in the red to more
in the blue range and then back again.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.250
And I can increase the redness and the blueness.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.640
And I can make it so that it's a more extreme
version of what happens in nature.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.040
Or I can switch it up.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.239
I can make it so that the plant is constantly
surprised and that surprise becomes, in the

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.400
way that avant-garde cuisine works, part of
the pleasure of the meal.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.620
So I opened a restaurant in the town of Sacramento
California at the Crocker Art Museum out in

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.620
the Gardens.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.729
There were hundred-year-old rosebushes that
had always been gouging on sunlight just as

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.930
it came down to them from the sky.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.660
Had never had a cuisine of their one.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:34.680
And I built some filters into the garden that
were oriented according to how the sun arcs

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.289
across the sky.

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.499
So that naturally, over the course of the
day, the plants get a meal that involves many

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.020
different colors.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.539
And then since not every plant can go to Sacramento,
in fact they can't travel at all for the most

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.479
part, I decided that plants at home should
have the opportunity to have a photosynthetic

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:55.520
cuisine as well.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.520
I made a TV dinner for plants that was broadcast
over public access television in New York

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.020
where you can put your plants in front of
the TV and the colors that appeared on the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.199
screen provided the plants with a full meal.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.300
It's pretty weird when you see a plant enjoying
a gourmet meal.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.860
Maybe a little bit off-putting, possibly even
upsetting.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.399
This is something that is specific to us,
to our culture.

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:29.310
This is something that we do with plants and
to plants.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:37.599
And when we see a plant doing this, having
a great meal, I think that it has the effect

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:44.830
of taking us outside of ourselves and allowing
us to reorient ourselves.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:52.979
To think about what it is that makes our cuisines
so special that makes a meal so special.

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:59.999
And more broadly what is it that makes our
culture what it is.

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:03.870
What is it that makes us humans is really
the question that you end up asking at the

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.499
point that you start finding characteristically
human activities being performed by other

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:11.219
species.

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.250
Because when you see another species doing
something that is so particularly human and

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.749
it hasn't been anthropomorphized but rather
has been specifically deliberately brought

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:30.490
into their domain according to their needs,
you find yourself sort of in a parallel universe

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.349
where you can look back on your own world,
on your own habits and they no longer look

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:37.349
so familiar.

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:38.919
They're no longer so routine.

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:47.599
I think that we can do this every day and
it doesn't take putting up a bunch of filters

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:49.199
in a garden in Sacramento.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.580
It doesn't necessarily even take building
something literally.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:04.610
Simply the act of contemplating the transposition
of something that we take for granted to another

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:15.629
species is enough to make whatever was so
totally obvious as to be essentially invisible

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:16.629
to us.

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:25.800
And to make it suddenly strange enough that
we can grapple with it and that we can reconsider

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.319
it in new ways.
