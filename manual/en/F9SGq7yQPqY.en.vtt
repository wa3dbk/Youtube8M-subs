00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.320
 In this video we will learn to make mechanical assembly light follower robot. 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.359
 I leave on video link where we learned to ride the circuit, 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.240
 And here's another link where we learned to see how it worked 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.079
 electronically circuit. 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.239
 If you have not seen, it is better to see these videos before. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.100
 The first thing to do is to separate assembly with sensitivity 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.460
 photo of the two resistors. 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.500
 If I leave and when I get light by the photo resist on the right side, 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.020
 the photo resist on the left side you will reach to notice. 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.260
 Then it will not work. 

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.859
 Touch design a system that separates. 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.799
 That is the light that comes on the one hand Alance not see the other and vice versa. 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.239
 That is what we catch a role, 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 I enrrollamos, 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.519
 we get the photo resist, 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.960
 we put the photo resist in the funky paper, 

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.239
 the sealed with tape 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.359
 and make a diagonal cut. 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.859
 We installed this way on the circuit. 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.079
 So the light will come on the one hand, 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.620
 but the other side can not enter. 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.380
 If they can be painted black here it is much better. 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 We do it for the two photo resistors. 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.400
 This optimization is already done for both sensors. 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.519
 Inside are the photo resistors. 

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:43.039
 Now we will install the engines. Cut out a piece of cardboard 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.179
 that more or less the width 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.200
 the pROTOBOARD 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.900
 and in this, with a piece of tape, 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.820
 amarro moto reducers on either side. 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.480
 Tape engine 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.739
 and tape for the second motor. 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.759
 Enough so that they are fixed. 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.639
 Then I take a rubber band, put engines 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.159
 PROTOBOARD below, 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.340
 not placed far behind that or else the car never aa lift. 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.800
 Best one-third. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.600
 Later we will place here the weight of a battery 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 9V. That will allow us 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.780
 the carriage lift. Lame elastic band, 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.219
 I bent double, 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.300
 the step by the first motor 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.840
 and stretched to pass over the other engine. 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.760
 Then I flip 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.580
 and I've been to the bottom. 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.659
 And engines are installed. 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.699
 Remember that when connecting van crossed. this engine 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.299
 goes with this circuit 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.780
 and this with this one. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.199
 Now I connect the wheels to the geared motor 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.620
 At the time of buying the gear bike is good buy tires, 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.640
 to engage once easily. 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.539
 If I want to remain fixed I placed a silicone point 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:26.679
 to keep them fixed. 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.620
 Finally we need to install the nine-volt battery. 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.640
 Put it in the back to counterbalance, we raised bands, 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.300
 and install. 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.639
 In the market sold a connector for this type of battery, I do not have, 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.939
 so I'll connect 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.780
 with some alligators. 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.180
 Connect the positive 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.879
 and connect the negative. 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.740
 the robot to start working and is ready. 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.159
 Remember to give it a "like" the video. 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.340
