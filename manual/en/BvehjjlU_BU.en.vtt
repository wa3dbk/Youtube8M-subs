00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.960
How to Do Water Aerobics.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.750
If sweating in a stuffy gym has turned you
off to exercise, give your workout a splash

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.980
of fun in the open air with a low-impact alternative.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:26.900
You will need Pool or lake Swimsuit Towel
Sunscreen Sunglasses Hat Water weights Resistance

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.000
gloves Floating belt Friend Shorts (optional)
and top (optional).

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.780
Always consult a physician before attempting
to do any exercise or exercise plan.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.090
Step 1.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.960
Choose a suitable location such as a public
or private swimming pool, or a sandy-bottomed

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.580
lake near your home.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.040
A water aerobics routine can be done almost
anywhere for free and on your own.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.390
Step 2.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.700
Be prepared for your water aerobics routine
by wearing a comfortable swimsuit and bringing

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.170
a towel, sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat -- especially
if you're going to be outside in the sun.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.380
If putting on a swimsuit has you anxious,
a pair of shorts and a lightweight top will

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.939
work just as well.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:10.939
Step 3.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.170
Create a routine that includes a five to 10
minute stationary jog as a warm up, followed

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.590
by some jumping jacks, flutter kicks, frog
kicks, and wide stance sprints through the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.560
water for a great cardiovascular workout.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.200
Step 4.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.499
Incorporate equipment such as water weights
and webbed resistance gloves to increase the

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.100
drag of the water.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.619
This will create a more intense workout that
will tone and firm up those flabby arms and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.619
legs.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.249
Wear a floating belt in deeper water so you
can focus on the workout rather than trying

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.579
to stay afloat.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.880
Step 5.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.259
Start out slow by only submerging your body
halfway.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.420
Practice the moves and exercises of your routine
before going into deeper water.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.799
The deeper you can go, the better the workout
will be.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.310
Did you know In 1907, Annette Kellerman wowed
audiences at New York's Hippodrome as the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.570
world's first underwater ballerina, paving
the way for women's synchronized swimming

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.869
years later.
