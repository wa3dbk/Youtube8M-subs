this comes first and by the name of
marina i believe the out when she

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.620
introduced herself to be i can
understand her but she has actually

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.590
student from columbia and she's going to
poor profit college known as the

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.110
artistic institutes

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
now a lot of people are familiar with
the art institute uh... and it has been

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.849
underlies courtney recently admin by the
department of education and by federal

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:22.730
authorities

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.260
uh... but this particular student goes
to the art institute of philadelphia for

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.250
animation she says that this was her

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.350
i guess only op center she thought it
was really option when she was nineteen

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.270
email and she was pregnant

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.110
so these schools of course have the
commercials where they say that they

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.260
cater to you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.760
and unfortunately some students fall for
it while she wants to share her personal

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.660
experience

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.640

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.380

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.910

made up because it supposedly when

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.310

distant

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.070

for a meeting date right to use your
word

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.890
they community will be these the things
that they were going to be paid for that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.220
defeated the meat

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.580
for it meant to school in the n_b_a_
anything primitive that animation

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.110
studios wheatley baby teaches begin
sounded material with steve that its

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.450
ability to move to be a six week that
would begin to be futile teaches

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.490
everything but the film we don't have a
lot to do with the minister enemy and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.450
tilt maybe two years up the new school
agee and abusing animator because i'd

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.530
actually tried to be doing that many
nations before the resided beech me

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.910
anything

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.170
paley did you want some forty fading
into just splash being filmed

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.380
and skin deal with and i a north wallace
opposite isn't on the exam so far and

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.180
that's how it works in the school if you
want to know if any do you have to be so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.860
far bins are going to be permitted to be
able to get to a job when you get out of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.779
school

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.939
so she's been extremely upset and i
wouldn't blame her for being upset

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.129
because the cost tens of thousands of
dollars for many of the programs apnea

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:26.989
institute

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.410
for instance if you're going there opt
for dot interior design i knew someone

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.330
who went there for interior design she
said she's hold me now this is based on

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.489
what she told me that her tuition with
forty thousand dollars

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.120
eight-year

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.999
which is ridiculous you know anglican
unless you are the most amazing interior

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.629
designer on the planet

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.849
you're not gonna make uh... announced to
cover that tuition after you graduate to

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.549
pay off those loans in time so you see a
high number of students going to these

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.540
for-profit colleges are graduating from
these for-profit colleges and they have

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.749
uh... high percentages student loan
defaults and we've talked about before

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:06.219
i'm not good for you guys are the
details but i'd like that we finally got

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.699
video from a student who actually goes
to one of these institutions cousins

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.289
even to read new york times articles or
look at investigations done by the

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:18.109
department of justice and say yeah the
school seems sketchy but i want to know

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.199
what the quality of education is out
these institutions and it's great to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.579
hear from a student who actually has
experience these things will come from

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.370
the difference

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.219
with the differences between these are
the schools like

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.399
tons loves school

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.859
uh... you know more traditional school
right we always talk about

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.359
but the thing is you hope that you get
something for and that's were always

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.859
comes and who was a law union failure of
causal forever to you know there's lots

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.479
of schools that animals don't get the
bad rap

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.659
but now

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.659
missus businessman whatever's promised

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.709
and that a bare minimum cuz i mean every
school says they were going to commit to

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.839
a certain continued up

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.499
the thing is is

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:59.819
i guess i wouldn't expect this i
wouldn't expect to school to actually

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.359
physically give me a job like going fine
employer and say here's a good person

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.879
gooden and uh... higher and you'll be
needing you'll put me in the resume

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.730
you'll continue process you'll share
your skills

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.289
at least issue committee and that's what
i think dismal within my experiences of

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.709
the schools will be looking at you with

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.129
damn near an unlimited amount of

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:25.430
think american context so that you can
least video how to get into the game

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.949
absolutely stupid behaved heads up to me
and has you up to the right people and

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.449
you have to work for me

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.740
you know how do you brought up the fact
that you also took out student loans and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.889
you know people will look at

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.050
usc which is where you want and i'll say
how is usc different report profit

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.230
called you know it's it's a private
college

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.430
but how's it different it's different
because they think wrecked its an

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.260
accredited university

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.389
it has the significant amount of

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.039
credibility a great reputation right and
you've got a quality education yes he

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.729
took out the loans but you didn't get
something in return and also your school

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.809
is not run by investors

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:06.889
okay people who haven't interest in
making a profit not

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.449
giving you a quality education that's
what you see a for-profit some of the

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.969
book amend obviously they were made
money

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.050
and then uh...

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.129
amigo building things to get managing
remote as long as it's

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.539
a dual focus you still also didn't do
what you do then the offices you that it

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.999
that i cope to indonesia malaysia
indonesia blatantly you're right on

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.860
target those mailers

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.849
was no it's not a school that i will
also money and there was more than

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.610
willing to put a worker

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.199
they need a first while that's true and
look at the because another really

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.270
important distinction for you guys

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.999
any type of profit that

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.250
private colleges like usc make

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.460
that money

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.509
has to go back into the university keep
in mind that non-profit colleges are tax

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.099
exempt anything if you are going to be
tax-exempt there are certain www so you

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.020
have to follow and one of those rules
are that if you make any type of profit

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.990
dot profit has to go back into the
university with for-profit colleges it's

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.620
completely different what ends up
happening is if you make a profit you

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.229
get to spend that money however the hell
you want so what happens in a lot of

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.810
these institutions is they take thirty
percent of their revenue and made that

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.620
statement

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.979
marketing

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.159
okay and the market to students

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.859
uh... they market to potential students
and they treat him like complete idiots

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:20.919
in the commercials

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.210
they assume that all of these people are
complete bombs who acted need huge

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.910
mistakes in their lives and they have no
other choice so that's what really

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.320
happens in four profit colleges
