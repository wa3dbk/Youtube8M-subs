Hi, I am Tatiana from Sony and
this video will show you how to use the

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.040
HDMI display function on your Xperia Tablet Z.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.900
HDMI display is a function on the Xperia
Tablet Z which allows you to connect

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.369
your tablet to a computer

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.039
or monitor via an HDMI cable. In HDMI
display mode, the display of your tablet

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.779
will be broadcasted to your TV or
monitor as well as the audio

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.999
if your external display has attached
speakers. This is useful if you would

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:37.159
like to watch movies

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.859
or browse the internet on your tablet
while being able to view your display

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.600
on a larger screen. To do this you will need your Xperia Tablet Z,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.039
an HDMI cable, monitor or TV with an HDMI

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.979
in input, power cord, and MHL

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.289
micro multi port USB to HDMI adapter.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.489
To get started,

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.719
first make sure that both your TV and
your tablet are turned off.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.719
Now connect the USB end of the MHL multi
port adapter to the USB port located on

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.600
the side up your tablet.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.450
The other end up the MHL multi port
adapter is used to connect

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.549
a regular HDMI cable to. Then connect the
other end up the HDMI cable

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.609
to the HDMI in input on your TV.

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.780
Use the tablet's power cord to connect to
the multi port adapter

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.780
and the other end to the wall outlet.
Turn on your TV

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.460
and select the proper input using the TV
remote control

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.600
or the front of the TV. Switch through
the inputs until you find the input you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.939
have the HDMI cable connected to.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.819
Turn on the tablet and you will see the
tablet displayed on the TV screen.

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.969
When your tablet is in HDMI display mode,
rotating of the screen will be disabled

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.350
and all control will still need to be
performed through your tablet touchscreen.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.769
To stop HDMI display, simply unplug the
multi port to HDMI adapter

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.940
from the tablet and your tablet will
return to normal mode.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.319
