00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.100
Go mobile! 
Ericom introduces AccessToGo enhanced with

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.660
Ericom's Blaze RDP acceleration technology
 so you can easily and quickly access your

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.620
centrally-hosted Windows desktops and applications 
using your Android tablets and smartphones

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.709
from virtually anywhere.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.679
For example, with just a few taps, you can
 connect to Microsoft Word, Excel or PowerPoint

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.050
in no-time - here's how

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.670
First, I'll launch AccessToGo.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.099
Then I'll choose a connection which uses 
Ericom Blaze which enables me to communicate

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.890
up to 10 times faster than with regular RDP,
especially when working with graphics-heavy

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.350
applications and content.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.690
Once I connect, I see my desktop.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.719
I can resize and position the desktop using 
gestures.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.989
And I can access files and menus either by 
touch or by using the pointer tool for greater

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.629
accuracy.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.629
Now I'll use Microsoft Word to edit a document 
- on my Android tablet.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.420
I can adjust the screen size and position
 it,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.420
I have access to menus,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.860
I can scroll through the document -

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.470
I can use the full keyboard and also click 
for additional options

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.409
In its Blaze-accelerated mode, AccessToGo
 uses up to 90% less bandwidth than any other

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.630
similar product, making it the fastest mobile
 RDP client, providing the best

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.200
user-experience - It's as simple as it 
should be! - both from Android tablets and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.229
as you can see - from Android smartphones.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.509
Ericom AccessToGo is also available for the
iPad, iPhone and iPod, delivering the same

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.560
accelerated performance. 
You can also take advantage of the Free Ericom

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.210
Secure Gateway, enabling users to connect
 to their desktops from anywhere, without requiring

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.119
a VPN connection. 
For IT administrators, Ericom AccessToGo simplifies

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.780
access management for any number of mobile 
devices, and it also supports connection brokers

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.830
including Microsoft RDCB, VMware View and Ericom's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.630
own PowerTerm WebConnect. AccessToGo provides 
secure and on-demand access to terminal servers,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.270
and physical or virtual desktops or workstations, 
simply and effectively.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:38.100
