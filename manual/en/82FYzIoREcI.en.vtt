00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.159
We're here across the street from the
headquarters of the Humane Society of

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:04.020
United States

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.020
And today, we're gonna play the Pet
Shelter Wheel of Misfortune.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.710
Have you ever heard the Humane Society
of the United States?

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.480
Yes. Yes. Yes. No I have Not. Ok, I want to
take just a minute to show you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.539
one of their commercials, and then I'm gonna ask you a couple questions.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ Advertisement Playing ♫

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.269
How did that commercial make you feel?

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.440
A little sad, but happy. I actually

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.510
rescued my own dog. You know it
makes me feel good that there are people

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.190
out there doing something for all those
animals that are abused and neglected.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.789
It's sad, and it's heartwarming at the same
time. Based on that commercial that you

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:50.450
just saw,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.640
what would you say the Humane Society
for the United States does? I would say that

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.520
it works to help the animals that are
abused, or are

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.170
not being fed, living on the streets... types like
that, and helping them find a home.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.320
Rescue and give treatment to
abandoned animals. I think about more

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.840
about neglected dogs and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.289
cats, and more animals that are pets as
opposed to just animals in general.

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.700
Definitely animals that you'd have as pets. Okay, how much of their budget,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.090
of their donation budget, would you say
that the Humane Society of the United States

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.500
gives to help support

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.510
pet shelters. 75 to 85 percent? I don't know, I

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.680
would say maybe 75 percent. You would
hope it would be around 90 percent.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.340
I'm guessing almost all of it. Alright, we're
gonna come over here, I'm gonna show you something.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.950
Okay. Would it surprise you to find out
that only 1 percent,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.990
1 percent of their budget, actually goes
to helping local pet shelters.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.010
Yes, that's pretty depressing. It's crazy.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.310
I'm not surprised by it. The way they
advertise it,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.229
you would think it would be the opposite.
Seeing this, how does that make you feel?

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.170
Wondering where the other 99 percent goes.
It makes me a little discouraged, and probably not

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.500
want to donate if

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.280
most of my money won't actually go towards the pets. It's misleading,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.250
and it's dishonest. Would you find that
this would be an acceptable usage of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.850
your money?

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.240
No. Do you think that your money would
be better spent donating to local pet

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.759
shelter?

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.370
Yes, definitely. I'd probably go direct to the source, direct to a local shelter.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.459
We want to give me a chance to raise
some money for local pet shelter. So

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.100
we're gonna do is we're gonna have you give our

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.700
Pet Shelter Wheel of Misfortune a spin. If you
can hit the 1 percent,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.510
we're gonna donate two hundred dollars to
local pet shelter. I know it sounds

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.959
difficult but, we're gonna go by the
Humane Society of the United States' standards

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:26.570
on this one.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.730
Go ahead and give the wheel a spin.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We might get really close!
