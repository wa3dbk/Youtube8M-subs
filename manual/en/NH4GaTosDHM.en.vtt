00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.900
The Rollerblind- We'll show you what it looks
like 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.700
So it starts off with the mans right arm and the ladies left arm. The lady steps
in with her right foot, wraps in tight and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.280
lifts her left leg. Here the gentleman's supporting
the lady with his right arm around her side

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.460
and he catches her raised leg- with his hand
and the bottom of his forearm. We'll show you to there.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.300
Once in the position the lady
is holding a lot of her weight with her left arm.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:59.519
And keeps her feet tucked together. From
her the gentleman completes a full turn

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.600
and when ready to move on he takes his hand and
wraps it around the bottom leg. From here

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.600
the lady simply unrolls. The man makes sure
that he maintains a strong grip with both

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.980
hands. Now it's nice to unravel and left you
arm stretch out- it just finishes the lift off.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.720
So we'll show you what it looks like from
start to finish.
