00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.689
Start by painting your nails a dark purple.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.640
This one by China Glaze is suitably murky
for a witch I think!

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.949
Then choose an acidic, toxic shade of green.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.140
Dab it on the tip of your nail, working back,
making the dots smaller as you go to make

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.870
it look like a splash.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.260
If you want to add spiders to your design
then remember to make a larger green area

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.530
on a couple of your nails for them.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:01:12.420
I'm going to add a few pieces of chunky glitter
to make the potion look more magical.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:26.860
...and now it's on to the eyes.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.610
To make a dot big enough I'm going to the
end of my detail brush dipped in some acrylic

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.060
paint.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.940
Now that can take quite a long time to dry
so to help the process just dab at the centre

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.591
with your brush to remove some of the paint.

00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:47.060
While they're drying let's do the spiders.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.600
A black dot for the body, then carefully paint
8 legs.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:12.690
If you're rubbish at painting freehand just
miss out the spiders completely.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.360
Finish them off with some red eyes.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.069
Back to the eyeballs, they need to look a
little more scary so with a detail brush and

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.000
a tiny bit of red paint, gently add some veins.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.520
Remember you can always go back with your
white to fix any mistakes.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.060
Then you just need to dot in the iris.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.489
They look much better if you put them to the
side, not in the middle, and make every eye

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:55.310
look in a different direction.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.750
Protect with topcoat, and you're done!

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.160
Bye :)
