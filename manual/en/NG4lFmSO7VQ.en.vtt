00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.470 position:67%
MILES O'BRIEN: With so many products and so
many stores and websites, how do we

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.600 position:58%
decide what to buy and where to shop?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000 position:67%
SHOPPER: I like that it's right across from
where I usually go to class,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.170
and it's really convenient.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.130 position:69%
MILES O'BRIEN: Whether it's the convenience,
good service or finding the best deal,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.630 position:66%
storeowners want to know what attracts you
to their stores and what it takes to keep

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.770
you coming back. Turns out, there's
a science to all of this.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.130 position:67%
RAJEEV SHARMA: Look at the amount of things
which are trying to grab your attention.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.270 position:70%
MILES O'BRIEN: With support from the National
Science Foundation, computer scientist

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.670 position:75%
Rajeev Sharma and his colleagues have developed
software that breaks down shopping behavior much

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.970 position:75%
like websites do. His company, VideoMining, uses
overhead cameras like these to put together

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.100
a top-down view of how people shop
and what they buy.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.200 position:72%
RAJEEV SHARMA: Basically what VideoMining
does is use a software along with cameras that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.000 position:86%
are mounted on the ceiling of stores, to track shoppers
as they move around in the store and create

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.500
data that helps us understand how
shoppers are shopping.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.400 position:66%
MILES O'BRIEN: The software creates maps
of a store's traffic patterns by digitally

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.270 position:77%
analyzing the video. Cameras like these are
positioned directly above, and picture resolution

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.400 position:70%
is intentionally set low so that all shoppers
remain anonymous.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.070 position:66%
RAJEEV SHARMA: Can not identify individual
shoppers. Computers actually watching the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.870
video and generating numbers that
represent the shopper behavior.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.700 position:70%
MILES O'BRIEN: The idea is to show retailers
and manufacturers the best areas in the store

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.530 position:80%
to place products, and how to create a comfortable
place for people to shop. Sharma identifies trends.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.700 position:73%
For example, people prefer wider aisles when
they shop. Women take a lot longer to shop than

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.400
men, and except in a few cases,
brand loyalty is on the wane.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.000 position:67%
RAJEEV SHARMA: We can see people coming in,
going between brands and picking up the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000 position:72%
product based upon price, based upon other
attributes. By providing the data to retailers

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.670 position:70%
and manufacturers, they can design the stores
to match the shopper's interest.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.370 position:80%
MILES O'BRIEN: The software was initially created
to monitor the elderly and disabled in their homes.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.530 position:67%
Now it's keeping an eye on shoppers, giving
businesses a scientific leg up in the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.030 position:66%
rat race of figuring out how best to serve
their customers and keep them coming back.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.370 position:59%
For Science Nation, I'm Miles O'Brien.
