00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.940
Anthony: Hi I am Anthony.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:28.689
Gayle: 大家好，我是Gayle。

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.530
Anthony: And Gayle, if you remember last time,
we caught our way up Huashan to see this beautiful

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.860
sunrise in the morning.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.580
Gayle: 对。

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.950
Anthony: Unfortunately that was not to be.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.460
Gayle: 啊，下雨了。

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.390
Anthony: Rain, fog, all the elements were
against us. So I had to run for cover and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.660
purchase a pink poncho to keep dry.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.620
Gayle: Oh

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.180
Anthony: But I think going down the mountain
was a little bit more dangerous than going

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.240
up the mountain. It was just like a big slip
inside going down the mountain. So you know,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.730
I was a little upset. I didn’t get to see
my sunrise, so I was pouting but then I realized

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.280
you know, it’s not – my life isn’t that
bad. I could have this guy’s job.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.760
Gayle: 对，太辛苦了。

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.640
Anthony: Yeah. This guy – Actually you know
this job looks bad but the retirement benefits

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.110
are great and this guy, I mean he looks like
a 100 but in reality, he is probably more

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.150
like 200 years old but you know everybody
says, a mountain a day keeps the doctor away.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.990
So everybody is trying to get off the mountain.
I am one of them and if you look, everybody

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.550
looks like a bag of skittles. Everybody has
got the right idea, get these ponchos and

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.630
whoever was selling these ponchos made a killing
that day. That’s what I am for sure.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.470
Gayle: 这是哪儿？

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.780
Anthony: I am taking the shortcut of the mountain.
I am taking the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.560
Gayle: 缆车。

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.520
Anthony: The cable car and we are descending
through the fog. Luckily, I came out all right,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.690
got off the mountain in one piece, I didn’t
die. My mom will be happy about that. So I

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.990
had to figure out, okay how do I get back
to Beijing. There is only one way to go and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.680
that is sleeper bus.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.680
Gayle: 长途汽车。

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.390
Anthony: And these guys are smiling because
they are kind of be robbing me in the middle

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.909
of the night, actually that’s a lie. What
was cool about this bus was the entertainment

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.739
if you notice the flat screens, pumping Chinese
Siccums all night long which actually had

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.930
a good effect because it put me right to sleep.
I woke up in Beijing the next day happy as

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.519
a clam. So you should go to chineseclass101.com,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.180
Anthony: Bye bye.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.120
Gayle: 再见。
