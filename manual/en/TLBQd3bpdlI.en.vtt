00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:07.349
-[Voiceover] At this small farm Diego Calcabrina

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:08.742
and his assistant Elena

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.420
make goat cheese.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.107
- We have three or four different types of cheese.

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:16.127
The first one is a fresh cheese.

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:19.424
The second one is the same cheese but with a

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:22.907
very wide skin.

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:29.348
The last one, the name is Caciotta, and is a little spicy.

00:00:29.348 --> 00:00:32.669
^I choose to produce goat cheese because I like it.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.641
(gentle Italian tempo)

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:37.666
-[Voiceover] Diego's passion for goat cheese is unusual

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.046
in Umbria, a region known more for sheep

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:42.009
and cow's milk cheeses.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.773
Without a local tradition to draw on

00:00:43.773 --> 00:00:45.721
Diego had to go to school to learn the craft.

00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:57.345
(gentle Italian music)

00:00:57.345 --> 00:00:59.381
Diego takes me on a tour of the barn.

00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:00.833
- Do you make cheese everyday?

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:04.118
- Everyday in the Summer and the Spring

00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:08.843
and every couple days in Autumn.

00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:10.108
-[Voiceover] Diego's love for the animals

00:01:10.108 --> 00:01:12.255
and the care he puts into the cheeses

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:14.392
has made the farm a success.

00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:15.727
- What's his name?

00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:16.853
- Rocco.

00:01:16.853 --> 00:01:17.503
- Hi Rocco.

00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:18.362
- Rocco.

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:19.988
(laughs)

00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:21.361
- Rocco is the boss.

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:22.809
- He's supervising.

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:26.788
- Yes that's supervising around 150 goats.

00:01:28.244 --> 00:01:29.881
-[Voiceover] The work is hard.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.238
The goats need to be milked everyday from

00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:34.009
February to November.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.081
In the late Fall they are bred

00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:38.456
and they spend the Winter gestating.

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:41.962
In the Spring, the baby goats, called kids are born.

00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:45.734
(whistles)

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.207
Throughout the year the goats spend a lot of time outdoors.

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:53.599
Eating through the rich grasses and wild grains

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.466
that grow in the Umbrian fields.

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:59.601
Diego and Elena do have a little help with the goats.

00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:01.598
A Border Collie named JJ.

00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:03.722
I asked him if it was hard to train JJ

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:06.044
to work with him and the goats.

00:02:10.984 --> 00:02:13.258
(whistles)

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.168
(Diego speaks foreign language)

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.302
-[Voiceover] The goats eat the grass and make the milk

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:23.543
to make the cheese.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.477
What could be more beautiful and simple?

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:28.210
Umbrian riches from the land.

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:29.564
- We work hard.

00:02:29.564 --> 00:02:30.203
(laughs)

00:02:30.203 --> 00:02:31.561
If you wanna come here,

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:34.301
I'm here with my hand open.

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:36.766
(Italian music)
