00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Renu Khator was born in Farrukhabad 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
a small town in northern India, this community was 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
very traditional in its customs and maintained a strong 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
caste system. If you tell another Indian that I am a  

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Marwari, because that's the caste that I come from. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They just stand there with their mouths open wide,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because they cannot believe that somebody from 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that clan and community and being a woman 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
could be in the work force in this manner today.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Renu was raised with two siblings and lived in a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
large home made possible by her father’s successful 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
legal business. In fact, in her extended family 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
were many lawyers. I have always admired my father,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
for the way he handled the most difficult situations,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but then I think my mom had a great influence

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
on me, because she's the one that never let me feel

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that I was a woman and could do certain things. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I mean for her I was as important, my education was

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
as important, my exams were as important as my brothers.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In the traditional manner of her region Renu 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
attended an all girl’s school until the ninth grade 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
at which point students made a choice between higher 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
education in commerce, science or liberal arts. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
She wanted to go into the law or medicine but

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
her father was against such professions for a girl. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Luckily a liberal arts school for girls 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Kanpur University opened near-by and she 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
enrolled with the goal to be the very best. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The only thing that I wanted to do that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
was my obsession passion, and that was

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to get the highest degree possible. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Why I can't tell you because I didn't have 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
any role model to see, but that was just 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
one of the things that attracted me like magnet. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
A door to a masters degree opened, when

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
she received a special Indian government scholarship, 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the only problem was that it meant she would have 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
have to leave home for Allahabad University.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When I won that, I told my dad, I mean look

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
even the government of India understands that I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
should do higher education, I should go for it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So, my father and I we had several arguments,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and many members of my family they did come 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
along on my side. And I finally went to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Allahabad University, and that is where India's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
political leaders were being groomed. I was very

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
attracted to that so that’s where I went. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
From the beginning of her college years,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Renu displayed a great talent for writing.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The subjects she tackled were drawn from the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
turbulent times in India. I think

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I just had a desire to express particularly on

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
women's rights particularly on role of the family

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and some of the political things I saw around me.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Because when I was growing up India went

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
through several wars. However, I didn't have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
an outlet for it so that is how I think I took

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
on writing and just sent my poem for publishing.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I was 15 years old when the first one got published,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and I think that was the time my dad paid attention

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
he said 'oh my goodness'. Renu's father was paying

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
attention when another milestone approached, 9 months

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
into her masters in Allahabad University he decided to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
commence the process for an arranged marriage for Renu.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
When he chose my future husband he didn't go with very

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
typical traditional choice which is to marry in

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the same level of family, wealth, cause my father

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
was quite blessed. He figured out that I am 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
one of those people whose going to need her

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
own space to grow, so he looked for somebody who's

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
going to provide me space, and sure enough his gamble

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
turned out very good. Suresh Khator was a graduate

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
student at Purdue University, and after their marriage

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
he took Renu back to the United States and Indiana

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to finish his PHD in industrial engineering.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
For 19 the year old Renu her whole world was changing.
