00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:04.637
<i> In 2012, Jon Taffer</i>

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.841
<i> was called in to rescue
 Extremes Sports Bar and Grill,</i>

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.677
<i> a bikini bar teetering
 on the brink of failure.</i>

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.446 line:0%
We were in debt $180,000.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.515
<i> The bar was dilapidated.</i>

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.717 line:0%
We had a lot of issues--
Terry drinking all the time.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.787 align:start size:78% position:22%
Are we doing this?
Cheers.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:24.156
<i> Jon immediately took charge
 and addressed the major issues</i>

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:27.260
<i> between owner Terry
 and manager Gary.</i>

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.695 align:start size:59% position:41%
We have a great GM.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.430 align:start size:63% position:38%
We empower him,
and we have systems.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.501
I started trusting him more
and things were outstanding.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.470
Narrator:<i> By implementing
 new food, drinks,</i>

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.706
<i> as well as uniforms
 for the bartenders...</i>

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.474
Woman:<i> The uniforms
 that Jon gave us we liked.</i>

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.343
They were cute
and complimenting.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:47.547 line:0%
<i> Turning the once failing
 Extremes into Second Base,</i>

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:51.050
<i> and as a result,
 sales skyrocketed.</i>

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.385
<i> However, at the height
 of their success,</i>

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.488
<i> Second Base was thrown
 a curve ball</i>

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.157
<i> and began losing
 $4,000 a month.</i>

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.760
Powerhouse sports bars
moved within a mile.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.728
<i> Obviously they must have
 listened to Jon, too.</i>

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:05.431
Business took off for them
and declined for us.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.666
Narrator:
<i> As sales dwindled,</i>

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.135
<i> Terry and Gary
 began blaming each other</i>

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.870
<i> for the shrinking
 customer base.</i>

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.806 size:81% position:41%
Put some money in the bar.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.908
<i> So focused on paying
 off his debt,</i>

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:19.479
<i> Terry failed to reinvest
 any money back into the bar.</i>

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.315
<i> Once again,
 the bar began to fall apart.</i>

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:23.683
Gary:
<i> With business declining,</i>

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.285
I was not able to
maintain the kegerators,

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.788
buying product,
plumbing started going bad.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.723 align:start position:0%
You gotta do something
with this bathroom.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:33.793
Gary:<i> Terry just said,
 "There's no money.</i>

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.861
There's no customers.
Go back to the bikinis.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.598
<i> That's what I made
 my businesses off of."</i>

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.032
Narrator:<i> With the clock
 winding down</i>

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:42.568
<i> and having been rescued
 by Jon once already,</i>

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:45.138
<i> Second Base is in need
 of a pinch hitter.</i>

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.675
The bar does shut down,

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:51.277
we'll probably have
to file bankruptcy.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.478
Narrator:
<i> Faced with the embarrassment</i>

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:54.647
<i> of a re-rescue
 and the possibility</i>

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.815
<i> of closing
 Second Base for good,</i>

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:59.119
<i> Terry has agreed to pull
 back the doors,</i>

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.721
<i> bust open the books,
 and make a call for help</i>

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.190
<i> to "Bar Rescue"...</i>

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.925
<i> again.</i>
