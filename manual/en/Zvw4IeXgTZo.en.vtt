Hi everyone! Welcome back to my channel. My
name is Perla DelMar and today I am going

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.250
to be doing an unboxing of the Clarisonic
Pro for you guys. I just got this in the mail

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.650
and I am very excited to open it up. I decided
to wait so you guys can be surprised with

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.540
me as far as whats going to be inside. Obviously,
I ordered it so I do kind of have an idea.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.210
But as far as the packaging and how they sent
it to me. I wanted to share that experience

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.210
with you guys. So lets go ahead and open it
up. Yay!! So I did get the Clarisonic at a

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.149
special price because I do work for a Steiner
Education Group School. So that's why you

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.149
see the not for re- sale and also its a professional
trail because I did get it at a special price.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.729
I love how they put the bubble wrapping on
it so it doesnt get messed up with the shipping.

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.270
I only had two options to get the white or
the pink on soo I decided to get the pink

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.060
one. Even though I am not a huge huge fan
of pink and a lot of people are surprised

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.670
by that because I am super girl so they dont
really understand why I dont like pink so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.670
much. It came with the white brush head which
is actually for sensitive skin types you can

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.029
see here the outside is white and then the
bristles. You can see the difference in the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:50.689
bristles. I did order a few more besides the
ones that came with this package. So I will

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.689
show you guys those as well. This gray one
is for normal skin types. You can see the

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:06.749
difference as far as the bristles go. They
are a little more seperate than the sensitive

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:13.749
skin type and you can also tell because of
the gray on the outside. The blue is for very

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.530
sensitive skin types. So any skin type that
is super super sensitive so that would be

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.530
like maybe Rosacea or possibly a skin type
that is acneic and can not take a lot of pressure

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.760
on the skin. So a lot of people that maybe
have papules; red little raised bumps. This

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.420
would excellent for them and this one you
can see the bristles are a little bit closer

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.420
together and then its a lot softer as well.
Now because my skin is neither normal skin

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.540
type or sensitive I decided the deep pore
cleansing brush head because I have more of

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.540
an oily T- zone to normal in the outer portions
of my face. I am acne prone because I have

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.870
an oily T- zone. So I decided to get the deep
pore one that they have. This one you can

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.290
see the outer portion is white and then they
also have the blue bristles. You can see these

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.430
are a little bit more seperate than the other
ones are so this is the very sensitive and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.430
this is the deep pore the bristles are a little
bit harsher than the very sensitive brush

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.569
heads. The Clarisonic Pro also is a body tool.
It also cleanses the body and this one came

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.620
with a gray large brush head. One thing I like
about the Clarisonic Pro you dont have to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.660
change any settings when you are changing
the brush head. You just take this one off

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.069
and once you put the this one on. It knows
you put a different brush head on there and

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.100
automatically turns on to the settings that
the brush head uses. This one is specifically

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.599
for the back the shoulders or you can also
use it for your elbows or your knees and then

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:30.599
your feet as well. My package also included
a trail of the refine skin polish which is

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.960
a body scrub and it also came with a face
cleanser which is used specifically to clean

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.050
your face. As far as what skin types can use
this I believe they make it purdy general

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.599
for all skin types but it does say that it
helps for oil control and impurities that

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:59.599
your skin may have. Also of course the charger.
All of Clarisonics tools are waterproof. However,

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.330
the chargers are not. So definitely don't
submerge this or put it anywhere it can fall

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.009
in the water. For example the sink or the
tub. You don't want to put it anywhere near

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:21.009
there can it can be an electric hazard. Thank
you so much for watching. Till next Thursday.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.970
I hope you have a wonderful day and I love
you guys bye.
