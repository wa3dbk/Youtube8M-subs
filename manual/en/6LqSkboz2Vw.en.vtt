00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.340
My name is Mohsen, I study mechanical engineering.
(Music)

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.330
I liked physics and science since primary
school, and mechanical engineering is about

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.140
mechanics and physics and basically all technologies
have to do mechanical engineering. So I really enjoy it.
(Music)

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.309
My dad knows some people here, some company
that offers sponsorships, so I applied and

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.480
got the scholarship to Malaysia. And I had
to choose between many universities, and two

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.329
of them came to my mind.
One was Monash, and Curtin. So at the end

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.329
I researched, found out Curtin's engineering
is better, so I chose Curtin.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.850
At the end of my second year, um, I will be
transferring to Perth, and will be doing my

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.770
second two years in Perth.
(Music)

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:23.249
I think employers nowadays are seeking, um,
not only good students with good academics,

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:30.249
but also good, um, it shows how involved a
student is, and how much the student cares

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:37.369
about their community, which, and succeeded
a real project before graduating.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.369
(Music)
I see myself, um, leading, managing a company

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:56.009
that I started up regarding green technology,
which would be helpful for humankind and our

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.229
planet. So I'd like to save our planet, to
have a little part in saving the planet.
