00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.380
Forget about exoplanets -- there could be
exoMOONS with liquid oceans.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.730
Maybe even alien jellyfish!

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.150
Hello, I'm Ian O'Neill, Space Producer for
DiscoveryNews.com, and I'm commandeering the

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.240
DNews studio to talk a little about aliens...
or more specifically, potential alien worlds

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.740
that could support life.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.779
You may have heard all the kerfuffle about
Kepler-186f.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.230
This Earth-sized exoplanet was discovered
orbiting its red dwarf star within the habitable

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.230
zone.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.360
This is exciting because IF the exoplanet
is rocky and IF it has water, there's a good

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.360
chance that its atmosphere could keep the
water in a liquid state AND possibly support

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
life.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.109
This is the first Earth-sized exoplanet discovered
inside a star's habitable zone!

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.340
Awesome, awesome, awesome discovery!

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.810
Kepler-186f was detected by NASA's Kepler
Space Telescope, but it's not really a discovery

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.300
of a "second Earth" -- we simply do not know
if that world is as barren and cold as Mars

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.550
or a broiling hellhole like Venus, two worlds,
by the way, that orbit the sun in its habitable

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.860
zone, but are FAR from being habitable.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.300
So, for me, there's another really cool possibility
for potential life-giving worlds out there

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.781
in the galaxy other than looking for habitable
exoplanets, and it doesn't depend on how far

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:17.720
away from the heat of their star they are.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.340
Remember the world of Pandora in the epic
movie Avatar?

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.760
Well, that wasn't an exoplanet, it was in
fact a moon orbiting a massive exoplanet.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.750
These moons are what astronomers call "exomoons."

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.880
Our solar system has some fascinating moons
orbiting Jupiter and Saturn that, may not

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.152
look like the science fiction rainforest moon
of Pandora, but they do have vast sub-surface

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:41.950
oceans beneath their frozen crusts -- the
water is heated to a liquid by tidal forces

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.860
squeezing the insides of the moon creating
a heat source -- no sunlight required!

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.010
Jupiter's moon Europa, for example, has an
ocean and some astrobiologists think that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.520
the environment is ideal for not only microbial
life to thrive, but complex organisms may

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
be evolving there.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.020
If you've seen the movie Europa Report, you'll
know what I mean.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.870
If you haven't seen it, I won't spoil the
ending.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.870
Promise.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.060
Also, most recently, it was revealed that
Saturn's moon Enceladus also has a subsurface

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.371
ocean and its internal tidal heating drives
the dinky world's famous water plumes, so

00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:18.510
there could be some kind of cosy life-giving
environment there too.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.730
Earlier this month, astronomers made the first
ever detection of a moon in orbit around an

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.730
exoplanet.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.870
They discovered it using the cool method of
"microlensing" -- that's when a planet or

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.379
star passes in front of a distant star, briefly
amplifying the starlight.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.810
Astronomers saw a little bump next to the
lightcurve of the microlensing event.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.530
They believe that this bump is the first direct
observation of a moon in orbit around an exoplanet.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.530
Although there was little doubt that exomoons
do exist, it's always awesome to get some

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.530
observational evidence.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.319
There's no word about whether or not this
exomoon has any habitable qualities like Europa

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.580
or Enceladus, but I can't help but wonder
about what may appear to be frozen exomoons

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.120
that actually have hidden oceans containing
life.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.120
Time to launch some ice drills to Europa,
for, you know, research.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.840
Just don't take a swim.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.310
Does this get you excited for the next exomoon
discovery?
