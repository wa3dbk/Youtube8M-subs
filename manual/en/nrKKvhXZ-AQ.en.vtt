00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Banana (speaks like a minion, or tries at least lol)

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.556
WHat up guys! Welcome to Slow Mo Lab!

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:04.036
The minion movie is coming up

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:06.400
So today we are going to do something super exciting

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.953
I love the minions, they always excite me

00:00:08.953 --> 00:00:11.536
So I created one that is edible, it's an edible minion

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:13.528
I did it on my Inspire To Cook channel

00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:15.048
Check it out at the end of the video

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.364
But I though how could I return the favour to the minions

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:19.288
And I though, I'll excite them as well

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.700
With a firecracker

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.512
And we'll film it in slow motion

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.716
At 25000 frames per second

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:25.772
Let's do it

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:28.096
As you see it's a cool edible minion

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:29.512
I am actually going to pinch off a little bit

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:32.116
And eat it so you can see that it's actually edible

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:33.871
Umm, hmm hmm

00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:34.744
Very sweet

00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:37.104
We have the firecracker tied up to the back of the minion

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:38.700
ANd it' s ready to get excited

00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:46.073
Minion exploding

00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:48.876
Let's check that out in slow motion

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:49.524
Master

00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:52.992

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.800
