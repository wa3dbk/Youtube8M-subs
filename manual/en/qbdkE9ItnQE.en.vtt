Hi this is Alia, and we are here with super chef Sandra.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:38.270
Today we are doing a green bean salad. 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:51.275
In a large pot, pour water, add salt, and bring 
 to a boiling point on high heat. 

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:53.539
Blanche the fava beans, green beans, and peas. 

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:56.777
This means that you put them in the boiling water for 2-3 minutes. 

00:00:56.777 --> 00:01:01.248
Then remove them from the boiling water with a strainer 
 and shock the vegetables in an ice bath 

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:04.869
(a large bowl of water with ice cubes) to stop the cooking. 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.200
The vegetables will stay crispy.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:32.454
Thinly dice the shallots and chop the mint leaves.  

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:35.727
Squeeze the lemon to get lemon juice and add to the bowl.

00:01:35.727 --> 00:01:49.780
Add the vinegar, olive oil, and mix all 
 the ingredients until well incorporated.  

00:01:49.785 --> 00:02:04.750
Add a few leaves of purselane (optional).

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:18.550
Mix all the ingredients. Serve in a nice plate.

00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:37.650
Bon Appetit!
