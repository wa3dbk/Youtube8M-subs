00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.530
Is THIS our planet’s twin?

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.250
Check out all these Lunar Eclipse photos!

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.770
And someone has a biiirthdaaaayyyy!

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.010
Hello space fans!

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.750
Welcome to another edition of space fan news!

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.960
What’s this I hear about the twin of Earth
being found?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.320
Well let’s slow down a bit and see what’s
been announced.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.660
On the 17th of April, scientists with the
Kepler Space Telescope hosted a live teleconference

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.100
sharing the news that they have confirmation
of an exoplanet that is roughly the same size

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.040
as Earth AND in the habitable zone of its
star.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.460
But what does this MEAN?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.971
Well, first off let’s look at its star.

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:53.130
This star is an M dwarf star, also known as
a Red Dwarf, though I didn’t see any signs

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.820
of Rimmer or Kryten nearby.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.290
Not only is this M dwarf star smaller than
our Sun, it’s also much cooler.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.560
Now I know what you’re thinking, if it’s
so cooler, how can it really be inside the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.630
habitable zone?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.830
Well that’s the kicker, the planet Kepler
186f has an orbit around the size of mercury,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.380
meaning that it receives enough solar radiation
that it could potentially…

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.770
POTENTIALLY… allow for liquid water to be
on its surface.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.180
I underscore potentially for a few reasons.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.970
Firstly, only know that this planet is about
10% larger in DIAMETER than the Earth, but

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.940
have no idea of its mass, and thus its composition.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.950
Furthermore, we have no knowledge of its atmospheric
conditions either.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.960
It could be thin and wispy like Mars or thick,
choking and acidic like Venus’s, caught

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.580
in a runaway greenhouse effect.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.920
There’s just simply not enough data to know
if this planet is a twin, cousin, or whatever

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.170
family tie metaphor you want to come up with.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.909
That’s not to say that this isn’t HUGE
news, though.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.019
M dwarfs are the most abundant type of star
in our galaxy, and so since we’re able to

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.919
confirm rocky planets do indeed orbit these
ruby beauties, then it’s very possible that

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.580
more and more Earth-sized planets will be
found in habitable zones around their stars.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.260
Thousands of you joined us for our live coverage
of the total lunar eclipse!

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.709
While I was hosting live here in LA, we were
joined by David Dickinson of Florida and Astrophysicist

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.900
Katie Mack from Melbourne Australia!

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:54.450
Pictures flooded into us from Twitter and
Google+ during and after the live show, and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:10.129
we wanted to take some time to show them off
for you here on YouTube.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.430
Enjoy!

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.659
Guess who just turned 24?

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.659
Well…

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.200
I’m sure a lot of you out there did, but
what I’m talking about is the Hubble Space

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200
Telescope!

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.409
On the 24th of April, 1990, the Hubble Space
Telescope launched from Florida on board the

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:24.809
Space Shuttle Discovery.

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:30.659
It was originally scheduled to launch in the
1980s, but the Challenger disaster placed

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.549
all Space Shuttle launches on hold.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:46.419
After its launch, five service missions were
made to Hubble, including its final one where

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:52.739
the Wide Field Camera 3 was installed, supercharging
the space telescope to see in a huge chunk

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.870
of the spectrum, including ultraviolet and
infrared.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.889
Hubble has given us such an amazing new way
of looking at our Universe.

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.540
The Hubble Deep, Ultra Deep, and Extreme deep
fields revealed that what appears to be empty

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.760
space is actually teeming with galaxies.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.620
This allowed us to get a better understanding
of the formation and evolution of galaxies.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.100
On top of that, Hubble was used to observe
the accelerated expansion of the Universe,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.380
for which the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics
was awarded!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.960
Even today, we’re finding new ways to use
Hubble, now utilizing the way space-time acts

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.750
like a lens due to the dark matter in extremely
massive galaxy clusters.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.180
We’re able to look even further back in
space and time than we ever thought imaginable!

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.630
So here’s to you, Hubble.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.220
Happy 24th!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.050
