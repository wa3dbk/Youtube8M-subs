00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.260
HELLO FRIENDS!

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.760
This time, we´ll show you how to disassemble the dashboard in a Chrysler Touring 300C

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.980
And well, the very first thing we need to do is to move the steering wheel so we have the space to work

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.180
when we need to disassemble the dashboard

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.760
and the first thing we´ll need to remove is the cover from the space where we insert the key

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:35.940
we´re going to pop it out by using a flat screwdriver and being careful to not to damage the piece since it´s very fragil

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.260
go all the way around until we´re able to remove it

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.620
before you remove the piece; pay attention in the position it is

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.340
so when you place it back you get no problems

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.700
as you can see it has the signs lock, accesories, on and start

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.520
what you need to see is that when you place the piece facing downwards

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.880
it has two long rods by each side

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.800
these letters have to be facing upwards and these long rods

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.800
need to be inserted

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.440
in a straight line

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.580
here inside, you cannot see it but it has a base where these long rods need to be inserted

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.920
and so when we put this piece back; it needs to be placed in the right position

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.980
so we won´t break the clips and have further problems

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.180
after removing that piece; we´re going to continue with this panel below

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.880
it´s supposed that we need to remove the whole piece

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.020
but in this case we´re going to remove only the upper cover

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.840
insert the screwdriver and pop the piece out to the front

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.640
it comes out just by poping it out

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.680
do the same in both sides

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:12.280
pop it out in this way so we can work better with this cover over here

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.220
to remove this piece we will need to pop it out as well. Just pull it towards you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.720
and being careful to not to break it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.840
let´s do it first by this side

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.900
there is not problem with this piece since it´s flexible enough to not to get scratched

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.620
and let´s pull it towards

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.860
once it is loosen; let´s take it out upwards

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.060
like this

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.420
after removing that cover; we´ll see two screws holding the stereo

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.140
sorry, the dashboard I meant

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.260
and we´ll remove them using a phillips screwdriver

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.600
it´s this one and this one over here

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.900
once we´ve removed those screws

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.420
insert the screw in the upper side of the dashboard and pull it forwards

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.540
and pop out the staple it has

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.740
which are these small clips that are in the upper part of the board

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.700
that´s why we need to do it from the top side ofthe board

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.060
after poping them out; just pull it forwards to remove the dashboard

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.740
I think I will need to use both hands; wait a second

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.940
it seems it´s stucked

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.560
I´m afraid I will take a bit longer to remove it

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.020
I´m sorry about the inconvenient

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.480
since I have nobody to help me and I will need both hands to get it

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.840
Well, to end this up

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.240
you just need to pop the dashboard from the upper side

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.740
you need a bit of pressure but make sure you won´t break any of the clips

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.440
please make sure you do it carefully so you won´t have any further problem

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.380
Well, that´s it. I hope I have helped you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.640
If you have any comment or suggestion

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.820
or something you think I may improve

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.980
I know I still need to improve when editing  the videos but I´ll work on it

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.180
and it gets easier for you to disassemble some parts of your car

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.300
So, this is it

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.460
SEE YOU IN THE NEXT VIDEO!
