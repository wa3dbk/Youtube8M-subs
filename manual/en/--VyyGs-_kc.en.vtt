00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:04.233
DESCRIPTION: A graphic of the
Perkins logo

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:07.067
swoops across the screen,
revealing a chapter heading:

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.067
HASTY: So there are lots of
visual clues

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:18.267
for visual learners just in how
the page is laid out.

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:21.600
And for braille readers, there
is braille formats

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.000
to also give them as many of
those same clues as we can

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.033
to help them organize the
information that they're reading

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:34.133
into groups of things, into task
lists,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.900
the same as a visual learner
has.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.567
DESCRIPTION: On the open pages
of a science textbook,

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:41.467
we see an illustration of a cell
with a cutaway

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:45.167
allowing the reader to see the
organelles inside.

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:47.967
As the camera tilts up, we see
the corresponding page

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:51.500
in a braille textbook, which
includes tactile graphics

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.100
of the cell and its structures,
and braille labels for each.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.433
HASTY: If, for instance, you
have a worksheet page

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.667
where there are instructions for
what it is you do

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:04.133
with the next five sentences,
those instructions

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.667
are set off in a certain way so
that you know where

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.000
the instructions are and you can
find them pretty easily--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.367
you can go back to them in a
testing situation, for instance,

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:16.100
a multiple-choice testing
situation.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.133
The question is written in a
certain place,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:23.200
and then the answers are written
in a certain arrangement

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.500
so that they're easy to... easy
for the braille reader

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.933
to go through and read them and
make the choice

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.400
so that they can read it as
efficiently

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.567
and as quickly as possible.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.933
DESCRIPTION: In a science test
book, printed illustrations

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.133
of two single-celled organisms
are shown.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.333
A number of multiple choice
questions are below

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.133
the illustrations.

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.900
On the facing page, there is a
raised line drawing

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.667
of the same organisms, and the
questions are printed

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.167
in braille below the drawings.

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:56.500
HASTY: As in print, if you look
at a textbook, we see

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.300
new words in a pink box over in
the margin, or the words that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.533
are in the glossary are all
written in bold or they're all

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.967
written in red ink or whatever.

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:08.633
There are braille symbols that
are written just before

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.000
the actual word that tell you
that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.400
there's something about this.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.333
And it's another piece of
instruction we have to let

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:18.933
students who don't color vision
understand what that means.

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:21.933
What is... what is... does red
ink symbolize?

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.667
What is it the symbol for?

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:25.567
So that when they see that
symbol, they know that

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:28.000
that means that those are new
words and they're probably

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.433
going to be on the test Friday
morning.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:34.267
Or that that word is in the
glossary, because it's in bold.

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:35.933
So you can go there and look it
up if you're not real sure

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:37.233
what it is.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.200
And you might have to do... go
there and look it up

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.367
for your assignment at the end
of this chapter.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:44.767
DESCRIPTION: Fade to black.
