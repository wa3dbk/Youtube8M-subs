00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.030
 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.120
 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.250
Hey, I'm Rob with skis.com and snowboards.com. I'm here with

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.300
John our Giro rep. Today we're talking about helmets.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.430
More and more people are wearing helmets out there now. John, why

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.520
should people choose the Giro Edit?
Great question. 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.590
In reference in your thing about more people wearing helmets more today than ever. I think

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.780
any more you stand in a lift line or a tram line you actually see more people with a helmet than without.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.900
And if you look at the course of history over the last 15 years, this category has blown up,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.010
the products evolved. Super lightweight, really comfortable and, in this case, you can even adjust

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.070
the internal environment so on a cold day or a warm day...

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.220
Why the Edit? Giro's In-Mold technology. Super fit engineered so we

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.320
know for a fact it's got the right shape, right fit. It's an integrate to a goggle

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.390
seamlessly which is really cool.
That is very cool. And you were talking,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.450
real briefly, about adjusting the ventilation.
Yeah.
Very cool feature on this

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.580
and that's Thermostat Control from Giro.
Yeah, and that's in part with

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.670
In-Mold technology is it gives us infinite range how we channel the air through the helmet.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.770
So this actually has really three kickers. Number one is a Stack Vent so

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.950
instead of dropping a lid on the pot here and blocking the venting of your goggle,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.080
it actually helps, helps your goggle draw air away from it.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.160
So it pulls the air through, it actually then channels the air through the helmet - put fresh air in

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.230
stale air out, and then on those cold blustery days you can even lock down

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.380
the Thermostat Control so warm environment internal. And again,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.510
those Super Cool Vents are configured throughout the helmet for the best performance there.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.590
Very cool and now talking internally, inside the helmet,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.650
it has a great liner.
It does. It's probably my favorite beanie that I own

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.800
is the sub-liner beanie in here and it's actually from a material called X-Static.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.910
It's an anti-microbial, kills the cooties so you've got a fresh helmet all season long.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.010
Very cool, and now talking even more with the fit of this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.130
helmet, the Rock-Lock 5 Adjustment, great adjustment.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.260
It is. I've had it on my Giro bike helmet for years. We introduced it last

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.340
year on the Montaine and the cool thing with this is, it's crazy lightweight,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.410
it gives you 360 degrees of wrap and even, you know, again, on the chair,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.590
whatever, it's micro-adjustable. You just fine tune it in to get just the right

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.730
fit each and every time. One other cool thing not everybody knows,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.810
every Giro helmet that has a fit system is vertically adjustable so if you've got,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.880
ya know, I always call it gaper gap or you got a nose press from either a big or small goggle,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.030
you can vertically adjust this and any other Giro helmet.
And that's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.060
huge being able to adjust it to fit with your goggles is so huge. And

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.140
going back even a little bit with that Rock-Lock 5, this is a super, super lightweight 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.310
helmet.
Lightest weight helmet we've ever built with a fit

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.470
system. That is crazy, so if you're the hard charger, doing maybe a little boot pack, 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.580
skinning in the backcountry, getting ready to build an edit, you actually have a helmet

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.670
that's lightweight and you're going to want to wear it. Now crazy enough, if you decide to take it off 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.750
for some reason because you're doing a really long hike, we've actually built, just like the Montaine,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.860
a TripClip with a carabiner, you literally, when you're ripping through the airport,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.970
you can pull this bungee through and in a matter of seconds,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.050
you can clip it right onto your backpack or right onto your belt so when you get to

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.230
the top it's not full of snow. Again, that's called the Giro TripClip which we created

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.380
last year on the Montaine and the Lure.
That's such a great feature and it's a subtle feature that's easy

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.480
to overlook and one of the other great features that when you're just looking at

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.550
this helmet, and maybe don't realize, is the new GoPro mount.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.700
Yeah.
And you can use with this helmet.
I was just at a trip with my sons

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.840
skiing and amount of, you know, excuse the language, gay-dars, you see on top of the helmets

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.960
that big huge...is absolutely unnecessary in this helmet. With the Edit,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.000
you've actually got a GoPro hard mount that we co-labbed with GoPro that mounts

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.050
right on the front of the helmet and they tell us that's the best angle, best point-of-view you

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.150
want to lock it up on. So right there.
Perfect. This helmet

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.210
is loaded with features, is a great helmet,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.390
again, more and more out there. Perfect helmet

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.520
to maybe introduce you to helmets or that higher end guy that

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.600
wants to show off to his buddies. So, again, thanks John.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.700
This is the Giro Edit. I'm Rob from skis.com and snowboards.com.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.790
Thanks for joining us.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.870
 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.248
