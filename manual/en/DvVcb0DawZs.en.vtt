Hi, I'm Marlene Spiegel, founding team leader
with Wildtree. I'm here on behalf of Expert

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.320
Village and today I'm going to show you how
to make a scrumptious side dish for those

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.540
wonderful barbecues. It's going to be grilled
pineapple. So let's get started. First I'm

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.259
going to take each of the pineapple and brush
them with a natural grape seed oil. Did you

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.550
know grape seed oil has half the saturated
fat of an olive oil? And that it is medically

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.250
proven that it will reduce cholesterol if
you use it daily in your diet. I want to do

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:48.240
both sides because we are going to flip these.
Then when I am done with this, I'm just going

00:00:48.240 --> 00:01:02.890
to use my little salt and pepper deal and
just season them a little to taste. Then it

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.940
is time to throw them on the grill and I am
using an indoor grill, but you can do this

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.850
on the outside and they look real pretty when
they have the lines going across. I'm going

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:31.250
to flip them so I can salt and pepper the
other sides. I'm going to cook them about

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:56.549
a minute on each side and we will salt and
pepper a little more and you will start to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:09.950
feel them getting a little tender. Now you
can make these in circles or in halves like

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.519
I have here. I left the core in, but you could
cut out the core. I left it in because when

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:27.099
you grill them normally it gives you a tender
feel, tender just like the rest of the pineapple.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.439
This is excellent as a side dish with barbecue
chicken, hot dogs or hamburgers. A little

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:43.959
healthy and a little sweet. So if you are
eating a Cajun hot dog or hamburger, it will

00:02:43.959 --> 00:03:12.859
bring the tone down. And I just arrange them
and just serve them as a side dish with your

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.219
meal. This is excellent for outdoor weather
cooking.
