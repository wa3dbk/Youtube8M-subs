advantage on those bets and the
best strategy for playing the game

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.720
before the flop. And now, here's michael
shackelford

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.850
Let's talk about Ultimate Texas Hold 'em

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.030
this is a poker based game based on
texas hold 'em poker

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.720
but the player plays only against the
dealer.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.130
The game starts where the player makes

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.680
an ante bet

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.270
and a blind bet, they must be exactly
equal

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.560
and the player may also make an optional
side bet called the trips bet.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.530
after the players have made their wagers
the dealer will give

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.890
each player two cards, two hole cards and
deal five community cards

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.140
face down just like in

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.610
texas hold 'em

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.790
the player will check his own two cards

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.070
and at this point

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.840
either make

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.200
a raise bet equal to four times his
ante wager

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.230
or he may check

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.590
If the player does make the raise wager
he's done he can't do anymore raising

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.140
and the dealer will turn over

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.080
the flop, the first three community cards.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.040
At this point if the player has not
already made

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.180
a raise bet he may do one at this
point but he can only do it for two

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.360
times

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.290
his ante bet.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.340
Then the dealer will turn over the turn
and the the river cards the fourth and the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.519
fifth community cards

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.050
And at this point any player who has not
already made either raise

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.459
may either raise

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.489
one-time his ante bet or he may fold.

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.319
Then the dealer will turn over his two
hole cards and both the player in the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.299
dealer will make their best five

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.919
card poker hand out of the seven cards

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.319
and the higher hand will win.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.569
The dealer needs to have at least

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.139
a pair to open, if the dealer does not
make at least a pair

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:40.099
the dealer will push back the players
ante bets which will automatically push

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.999
Then if the dealer

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.059
does open

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.019
or whether or not he opens

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.180
the dealer will compare

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.389
his poker hand

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.569
to the player's poker hand, the higher
one wins.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.979
If the player has the higher poker hand

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.869
then the raise bet will pay even money

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.779
if the dealer has the better hand

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.749
the raise will lose

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.369
and if the dealer has

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.009
if it's a tie, then it will be a push

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.130
same thing

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.460
for the ante bet

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.179
assuming that the dealer opened. It pays
even money if the player wins

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:15.019
Now the blind bet is a different story

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.430
there

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.659
it goes by a pay table

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.419
if the player has at least a straight

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.119
and beats the dealer

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.739
then

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.429
the blind bet will pay according to the
pay table posted on the table

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:32.729
if the player does not have at least a
straight which is most of the time

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:37.379
then if the player wins the blind bet will
only push, if the dealer wins

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.829
the line bet will lose

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.179
So the blind bet obviously is where the

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.229
dealer's house advantage comes in.

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.140
Where the player's power comes in

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.650
is the player has

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.549
the ability to make a big raise bet
early on if he gets a good hand.

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.349
The house advantage

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.569
in ultimate texas hold 'em which
probably nobody knows perfectly

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.410
is

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.599
2.18%

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.349
that means that for every dollar the
player bets on the ante

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.089
he can expect to lose 2.18 cents

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.289
The trips bet

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:16.619
pay is based only on the poker value of
the player's hand

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:19.829
and to win on the trips bet the player
needs to get at least a three of a

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.909
kind.

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.630
The usual pay table

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.680
on the trips bet goes three, four, seven,
eight, thirty, forty, fifty

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.219
If you see that pay table which you
probably will in a live game

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.189
the house advantage on that bet is
3.50%

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.419
On some

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.830
of the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.050
units that don't have a live dealer but
have a big video screen and you play

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.419
against a computer monitor

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.400
then they have a stingier pay table that
goes three, five, six, seven, twenty, forty,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.690
fifty.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.310
That pay table has a house advantage of
6.18 percent.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.169
Next let's talk about the strategy for
ultimate texas hold 'em

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.770
I'm only gonna talk about

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.650
the strategy for the first decision
point because it gets really complicated

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.929
at the second and the third decision points

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:13.079
at the first decision point, the player
is allowed to raise three times or four

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.190
times

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.520
his ante bet

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.090
but the player should never make the
small three x

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.809
raise because

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:23.309
if he gets

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:25.099
really good

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.440
hole cards to begin with

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.799
he should always make the full

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:31.680
four x raise much like if you double
down in blackjack

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.810
you should never double for less if
you've got a good hand

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.649
put out all the money you can out there

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:40.080
here are the hands for you should make

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.570
the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.340
raise bet after you see your two
hole cards and before the flop

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.340
if you have any pair

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.439
except duces

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.939
if you have

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.029
an ace high

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.409
if you have unsuited king

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.330
five or better

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.999
unsuited queen eight or better

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:05.259
or unsuited jack ten

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.219
if you have a suited king high

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.889
if you have to be suited queen six or
better

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.930
or a suited jack

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.639
eight or better

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.410
if you don't have any of those hands
that i just said

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.879
then you should check

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.370
and the dealer will turn over the flop

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.870
and then eventually the river and turn so
you may be making one of the

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.630
smaller raise bets later

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.159
the strategy

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.620
for the second and third decision points
are pretty complicated

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.620
i have some really complicated
strategies on my website

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.709
that advise on when to do it

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:44.499
however

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:47.360
through the las vegas advisor

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.759
they sell strategy cards for ultimate
texas holdem

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.969
is a very concise and powerful strategy
which i highly recommend i regret i

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:56.970
didn't think

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.069
of this strategy myself

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:04.319
but this is a great strategy available
through the las vegas advisor

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.909
