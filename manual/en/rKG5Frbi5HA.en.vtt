00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi I'm John for Strings By Mail and
I'm here to talk to you about those times

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.690
you may not be inspired enough to pick up
the instrument for the usual reason

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.300
of practicing to become a better player
and at those times

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.850
perhaps you could be inspired instead by
thinking about how it's making you a

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.040
better human being

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.990
so I want to give you three examples of
that the first is that

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.200
it's putting us in the state of mind
in helping us to learn to achieve the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.000
state of mind

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the great mystics have encouraged in their
followers on the path to enlightenment

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.269
throughout the ages 
the second is

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.469
it brings us face to face with and
thereby gives us the opportunity to

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.649
overcome what is widely regarded 
as one of the greatest challenges

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.609
of being human 
and third it teaches us to think

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.780
and perceive in the ways that the 
greatest minds have thought

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.859
and perceived throughout history 
so let me elaborate

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.139
that state of mind of the Mystics 
it's being one

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.420
with the experience we are in 
it's being completely present in the now

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.549
it's what happens when we're focused on
what we're doing without distraction

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.759
releasing potential distractions as they
come up and we suddenly feel like

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.140
two hours was only five minutes and the
challenge the great challenge we face

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.329
it's the ego for when else are we more
tempted to compare ourselves

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.750
we tend to look at the person who's more
advanced than we are

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.570
and potentially become discouraged or

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.439
we look at them and start picking at the
flaws to bring them down closer to us

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.579
or we look at the person who is
currently not as advanced as we are

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.890
and we think at least I'm doing better
than they are and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.189
sort of push them down in a way to 
lift ourselves up

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.659
instead we could be looking at that
person is more advanced and be

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.780
purely inspired not bothering about
their flaws but looking at the beauty to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.369
carry us forward and lift us up

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.280
and we could look at the person who's
currently not as advanced

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.679
and just think about how much better
they could get and help encourage them

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.869
we have the choice

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.110
whether to let this inevitable 
juxtaposition become a

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.120
comparative competition driving us
all downward or an

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.450
inspiring awareness of unity that 
lifts us all upward

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.650
now this

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.150
most outrageous claim to think and
perceive in the ways of the greatest minds

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.700
I'm going to need backup on this so I
will bring to the witness stand

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.850
Albert Einstein 
brilliant mind of

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.750
the 20 century who changed our
perception forever especially through

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.970
his relativity theory

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.540
and here's what he had to say about the
discovery of the relativity theory

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.240
he said 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.330
"My discovery
was the result of intuition and music

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.180
was the driving force behind that
intuition. My discovery was the result

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.920
of musical perception."
musical perception

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.220
he's not talking about making your hands
work better he's not talking about

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.320
memorizing a great piece of music

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.450
he's talking about truth about how when we
bring a balance between our own emotions

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.710
the structure of the piece

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.240
and represent it through expression in
dynamic, rubato and vibrato

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.470
that we have such truth
that reach directly to

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.740
the heart of our listeners

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.240
much as he had to balance the forces 
he was picturing

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.410
in his mind and his being of Physics 
in a way that was musical enough

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.910
for it to be true 
so

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.210
the next time you need a little 
extra inspiration

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.260
maybe one of these ideas will help 
and if along the way

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.560
we at Strings By Mail can provide you
with the music the strings

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.300
the accessories
or even a little advice that you need

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.330
please don't hesitate to be in touch 
I wish you an inspired practice

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.080
and I thank you for watching
