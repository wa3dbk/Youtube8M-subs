00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.320
Today, we're making a pizza that's absolutely
sublime.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.460
We're going to start with pan-roasting three
kinds of mushrooms -- shiitake, oyster, and

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.010
brown beech -- until they are deeply flavorful.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.930
And we pair the mushrooms with a garlic confit
spread, which is out of this world, and homemade

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.930
ricotta.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.930
Have a sparked your interest and your appetite?

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.310
I hope so.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.370
But first, you'll need to make your pizza
dough!

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.940
And I made a video that takes you through
all the steps and gives you great tips for

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:41.730
making the perfect thin-crust pizza.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.690
To prep the shiitake mushrooms, cut the stems
off and then cut the caps in quarters.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.399
Oyster mushrooms come in these small clumps,
so you'll want to cut the base of the clump

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.980
off and then tear the mushrooms in 1-inch
pieces.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.719
(You can leave the small mushrooms whole.)

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.361
Brown beech mushrooms also come in clumps,
so cut the bottom of and then separate the

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:10.460
mushrooms, but leave them whole.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.650
The stems of the mushrooms are too fibrous
to eat, but they are very flavorful.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.690
So don't throw them away... freeze them, and
use them next time you make stock.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.450
Put the shiitake mushrooms in one bowl, and
in a separate bowl place the oyster and brown

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.850
beech mushrooms.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.000
To cook the mushrooms, I recommend you use
a non-stick pan -- a titanium surface is best.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.920
Otherwise, the mushrooms will stick to the
bottom of your pan, and you won't be able

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560
to cook them properly.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.340
Heat your skillet over high heat and add the
butter.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.480
Once the butter is melted, add the olive oil
and the shiitake mushrooms.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.520
Toss the mushrooms until they are well coated
with the butter and oil.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.820
We're starting with the shiitake because they
take a little bit longer to cook.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.320
Now, spread the mushrooms in one layer.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.009
Saute the mushrooms for a couple of minutes,
until they've wilted and begin to turn golden.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.750
You see what's happening?

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.400
The mushrooms have wilted and they are starting
to turn golden.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.749
So now add the balance of the mushrooms.

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:25.910
Toss again until all the mushrooms are well
coated with the butter and oil.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.219
Continue to saute at high heat until the mushrooms
are golden-brown.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.519
This will take about 6 to 8 minutes.

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.450
When you cook mushrooms, you've got to remember
not to toss them too frequently.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.860
Otherwise, they become mushy.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.270
Look at our mushrooms!

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:53.379
They've got a fantastic golden-brown color,
and they smell amazingly good.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.560
So now we're ready to season them.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.999
First, sprinkle with the salt, and then with
freshly ground pepper.

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:09.260
Toss again and transfer to a bowl.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:19.510
One last thing: we need to prepare the winter
savory.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.620
Remove the leaves from the stem.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.489
This winter savory comes from my garden, and
I absolutely adore cooking with it.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.019
But if you have a hard time finding some,
you can use rosemary instead.

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:39.829
Now, hold the leaves as tightly as you can
and finely slice.

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.519
And now coarsely chop.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.849
Once you've shaped your pizza and placed it
on your peel, you can spoon half the garlic

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:57.150
confit on the dough and then spread it over
the whole surface.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.779
My goodness, I wish you could smell this!

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.620
Now top with half the mushrooms.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.669
By the way, when it comes to making thin-crust
pizza, less is more.

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.220
So make sure not to load your pies with too
many toppings.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:25.229
Then sprinkle with the ricotta, the winter
savory, the salt, and freshly ground black

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.680
pepper.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.900
Now here comes the tricky part.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.479
Place the peel all the way to the back of
the stone.

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.960
Give it a quick jerking movement so it slides
off the peel, and then shake the peel to slide

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.910
the pizza off.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:50.080
Let's take a peek... ooh, our pizza is ready!

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.639
And to take it out of the oven, all you have
to do is to slide the peel right under it.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:03.330
As a last touch, sprinkle the pizza with the
Parmesan shavings and drizzle with the garlic

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.350
confit oil.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.729
Bon apetit!
