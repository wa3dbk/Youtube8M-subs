00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.400
hey Luis remember that anti-gay family
that literally sailed out to sea to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.170
escape

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.090
what they considered to be homosexuality
taking over society

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.840
then they ended up like a good I don't
know but they they were at a supplies

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.429
they got caught in a storm

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.289
some Venezuelan crude like cargo ship
had to help them

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.550
it was a complete disaster they're
planning to leave

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.740
again there was an interview on Troon
use with the required alls

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.980
andric interviewed Sean gastonia a who
is I guess the dad and he saying he and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.260
his wife and children might be leaving
again

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.320
and they might do it on a boat again
listen to this and this time the problem

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.770
is

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.670
%ah is some kind of Christian
persecution christians I guess are being

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.610
persecuted now in this country

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.809
listen to this from the radio show do
you get the impression

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.640
shown that term persecution against
Christians is some

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.329
is going to be a reality soon yeah here
in your area

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.660
in the US art I already have jobs but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.590
through all the hoops you have to jump
through dispersed researcher food banks

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.510
are you up to date me haaa 38 do to help
your neighbor

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.720
listen to stop there the hoops you have
to jump through in order to start a food

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.240
bank

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280
are indicative of anti-christian bias
okay well thats it's an interesting pay

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.710
above pointing to anti-christian bias
let's listen to a little more

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.080
you know it's it's it's already happened

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.619
are you making plans

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.470
to to to make another attempt to leave
the country

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.500
oh yeah I'm statement work on getting

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.869
you report right now yeah so you plan on
sailing again

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.610
I had so we're going to play it up there
are no Asians who is

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.140
now the story of Peter Parker said
working witnessed

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.180
its stock years par with the food so it
doesn't matter what

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.079
what happens were good strapped you know
what Lewis

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.850
maybe it's smarter to avoid the boat
this time so you don't end up marooned

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.759
somewhere in getting picked up by
Venezuelans or something like that there

00:01:58.759 --> 00:01:59.649
anti-gay

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.040
their racist and xenophobic and they
believe that there is anti-christian

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.880
bias

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.390
I would recommend maybe just take a
plane somewhere the problem of course is

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.069
you'll probably end up somewhere

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.890
where you don't like the people because
you're anti-gay and xenophobic

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.700
it's a troubling situation isn't what
they perceive

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.540
as I Christian persecution may just be

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.989
idiotic person yet but I i and you know
what they almost killed their children a

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.379
lot

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
now and now they're going to attempt to
kill their children again someone please

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.500
take the kids away

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.800
burmese more Louis they're getting a
bigger boat this time

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.410
well unless its I like I have a titanic

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.069
no I don't I don't think they're going
to be doing too hot on

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.030
its it's just amazing a I I don't even
know what else to say anyway

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.910
