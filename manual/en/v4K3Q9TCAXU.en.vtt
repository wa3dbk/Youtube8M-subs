Hi YouTubes! So for those of you who are following me on Twitter and Facebook and stuff

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.680
you already know that I'm still sick, but I wanted to upload a  new tutorial anyways

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.000
but I sound a little bit weird so sorry for that

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.640
and thank you for all the sweet comments on my Aprils Fools video because I was also sick that day

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.790
so I was sleeping in my bed and everytime I woke up I just checked and read all your comments

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.020
and I was laughing so hard so thank you so much

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.740
and today I'm going to show you a camouflage manicure so lets take a look at that tutorial

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.140
As my basecolor I'm using OPI Did You Ear About Van Gogh?

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.360
I think this polish looks perfect as the base color for his manicure

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.120
but a dusty light green would also look really good

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.630
This polish needs two layers to be fully
opaque

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.770
When I'm done I'm going to wait a little while till my basecolor is totally dry

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.560
The next one is from the Deborah Milano Pret a Porter collection and it's number 51 Khaki Green

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.140
Take your dotting tool and start making the first spots

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.160
You can make a couple of small spots or a few bigger ones, that's up to you what you think looks best

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700
This is OPI A Taupe The Space Needle

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.240
Now we're going to do the exact same
thing as the previous color

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.540
It kinda looks a little bit like poo right now but I promise you that it will look better once we are done

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.360
This is Green Generation

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.780
Don't just place the colors next to each other, also apply one color over the other to make the design look better

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.320
Make sure that you don't apply a light color over a really dark color because the color can change

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.980
If you don't know if you can layer some color try them on a piece of paper first to see the result

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.900
Now it's time to add some black and I'm using number 71 Total Black

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.860
This is the last color I'm going to use

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.120
Freehand nail art always looks really lumpy

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.700
but when you apply the topcoat everything looks smooth again

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.929
I'm using my eyeliner brush and acetone to clean up the mess I made

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.010
And now my favorite part topcoat time, make sure that you don't put any pressure on your brush

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.410
keep it floating above the nail, and apply a generous amount of topcoat

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.560
Now it's time to enjoy your manicure

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.040
So thanks for watching and I will see you in my next video. Bye bye!
