00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.110
This is SolidWorks Flow simulation where
 we simulate engine intake manifold

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.249
valves opening and closing at each
 cylinder port

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:12.269
We can use this information to visualize
 the flow traversing the manifold and

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.109
color it by local speed or pressure to 
evaluate the manifold design
.0:00:18.109,0:00:21.529
We can simulate the openings at the
 ports by dropping the lid

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.470
pressures below ambient over a period of
time.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.329
We assume a firing order, calculate a 
total period for one cycle over the rpm

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.460
we want, and develop a timing sequence
 for pulsing the pressure drop
.0:00:35.460,0:00:39.140
We can develop the data sets in Excel 
for example. The different colored

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.720
columns on the spreadsheet represent 
time and pressure values for each port.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.510
Here's a graph showing the drop in 
pressure at one of the ports.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.190
This next graph shows all four pressure 
drop curves.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.520
We will copy the data from the
spreadsheet into Flow Simulation in a

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.640
moment
.0:00:55.640,0:00:58.809
To set up a transient analysis in Flow 
Simulation,

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.789
right click on the input data icon and choose general settings. Just check the

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.340
time-dependent option as shown here.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.260
Next, right click on the input data icon once again and choose calculation

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.090
control options.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.210
In the dialog select the maximum 
physical time entry and enter a value

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.070
for the end of the cycle, and click ok. 
Now let's look at the boundary

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.080
conditions. We have the inlet environment
pressure of "101325"0:01:26.080,0:01:27.440
Pascals.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.820
Notice the tag pointer with the value 
on the lid showing on screen. Next

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.450
we have the pressure boundary condition
sshowing on each of the cylinder ports at

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.270
the lid for each port.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.500
Note the tags on screen have the word
dependent on them
.0:01:40.500,0:01:44.229
This is because the pressure on each
lid is dependent on time and uses the

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.130
Excel spreadsheet contents for each one.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.939
We set the lid pressure of port number
three back to ambient to show how to do

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:51.920
this.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.030
If you right click on the boundary
condition and edit definition,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.390
you can see the face selected, and the
environment pressure item selected.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.880
Simply click on the f of x button to
open a dependency dialogue.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.349
Here in the pull down menu we choose the
function of time option "table"

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.109
to use the contents of the Excel
spreadsheet.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:19.109
Go ahead and switch over to Excel and
simply copy the spreadsheet data
.0:02:22.019,0:02:26.480
Now switch back to the Flow Simulation
and place your cursor in the first cell.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.040
You must use the control-v on your
keyboard

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.529
to paste the data into the table.

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.540
Click on the preview chart option to
show a graph of the data for

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.059
verification and you can okay the
dialogues

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.279
do this for each lid and you can run the
analysis
.
