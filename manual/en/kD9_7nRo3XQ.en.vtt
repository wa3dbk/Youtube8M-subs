00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:07.770
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.987
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:23.509
First, let’s make the sauce.

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:27.376
Combine the sake and mirin in a pot 

00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:31.122
and turn on the burner.

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:35.606
Bring it to a boil 

00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:37.743
and allow the alcohol to evaporate 

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:40.783
until you can’t smell it anymore.

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:46.428
Then, combine the mixture and the soy sauce in a bowl.

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:50.026
Stir and slightly cool the sauce.

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:55.907
Add the chopped garlic clove 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.176
and ichimi, red chili pepper.

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.261
And stir to mix.

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:09.969
Next, remove the firm skin 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.628
between the cap and the pod from the okra.

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:21.642
Wrap each okra with the pork belly slice.

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:27.523
Then, lightly squeeze it to help hold the meat together.  

00:01:28.324 --> 00:01:32.042
You can also use asparagus, shishito peppers, 

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:36.381
sliced bell pepper or eggplant instead of the okra.　

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:40.060
And now, let’s cut the vegetables.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.339
Remove the stem end of the bell pepper.

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:46.408
And cut it in half lengthwise.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:52.444
Trim off the stem end and remove the seeds.

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:56.391
Make small cuts along the top 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.563
and press the bell pepper to make it flat.

00:02:09.397 --> 00:02:12.551
Next, pierce the onion with bamboo sticks 

00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:15.665
until they reach the core as shown.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:21.682
Then, cut the onion between the sticks, 

00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:25.434
slicing it into 1cm slices.

00:02:29.772 --> 00:02:31.421
Place the sliced pumpkin 

00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:36.096
and boiled corn on the cob into a plastic bag 

00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:40.342
and add the olive oil.

00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:46.425
And toss to coat evenly.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.462
Next, drizzle the olive oil 

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:55.216
over the sliced onion and bell pepper.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:59.014
And thinly coat them with a kitchen brush.

00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:05.202
Then, flip the slices over 

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:10.237
and coat the other side with the oil.

00:03:12.443 --> 00:03:15.573
Now, let’s enjoy the Yakiniku.

00:03:16.043 --> 00:03:20.463
Heat a griddle and arrange all the vegetables on it.

00:03:24.492 --> 00:03:28.378
And now, place the beef slices onto the griddle.

00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:35.013
Short ribs and round are popular cuts in Yakiniku.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.103
And add the okra wrapped in pork.

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:46.938
Now, flip the beef over.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:50.725
Mmmm... Looks so delicious!

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:53.293
I can’t wait to try the meat.

00:03:54.527 --> 00:03:58.809
Flip the vegetables over also and brown the other sides.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.463
Now, the beef is ready.

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.767
If you want to make the sauce sweeter, 

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:23.809
we recommend adding honey to taste.

00:04:38.108 --> 00:04:41.908
Sprinkle the salt on the okra wrapped in pork.

00:04:41.908 --> 00:04:45.625
And squeeze the lemon slices over it.

00:04:56.566 --> 00:05:00.833
Oiling the vegetables beforehand will help cook them evenly 

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:04.936
and you don’t need to add extra oil while cooking.

00:05:04.936 --> 00:05:08.638
Corn on the cob and pumpkins are pretty firm 

00:05:08.638 --> 00:05:13.018
so don’t use a ceramic knife otherwise it will snap.

00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:14.748
Good luck in the kitchen!
