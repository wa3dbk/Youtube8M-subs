00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.420
So today, we're going
to talk about enzymes

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.390
and all the different
kinds of reactions

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.330
that enzymes can catalyze.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.320
But before we do that,
let's review the idea

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.540
that enzymes make biochemical
reactions go faster.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.600
And if you look at a
reaction coordinate diagram,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.930
you'd notice that enzymes
speed up reactions

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.830
by lowering their
activation energy.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.090
Now, enzymes are generally
named for their reactions, which

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.810
is convenient because it makes
it a lot easier to remember

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.900
what an enzyme does if
someone gives you its name.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.660
And a great example
of this is that one

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.770
of the enzymes involved
in DNA replication

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.310
is called DNA polymerase, which
is named as such because it

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.880
acts on DNA and specifically
makes polymers of DNA.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.180
Now, the suffix "ase"
is usually just one

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.800
that you find at the end
of most enzyme names.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.190
Now, another great example
is that the enzyme that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.080
catalyzes the first step of
glycolysis, which you may

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.820
remember is the reaction
between glucose and ATP

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.530
to form glucose-6-phosphate
and ADP, is called hexokinase.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.230
And "hexo" refers
to the number 6,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.209
which is a reference to glucose
being a six-carbon sugar.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.900
And "kinase" is a term
referring to enzymes

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.650
that add phosphate functional
groups to different substrates.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.270
So overall, hexokinase
adds phosphates

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.080
to six-carbon
sugars like glucose.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.995
Now generally, every enzyme
has a very specific name

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:22.770
that gives insight into
the specific reaction

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010
that that enzyme can catalyze.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.330
So we can actually
divide most enzymes

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870
into six different
categories based off

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.630
the kinds of reactions
that they catalyze.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.750
Now, our first group is
the transferase group.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.800
And the basic reaction
that transferases catalyze

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.540
are ones where you move
some functional group, X,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.380
from molecule B to molecule
A. And a great example

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.260
of one of these reactions occurs
during protein translation,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.820
where amino acids
bound to tRNA molecules

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.830
are transferred over to the
growing polypeptide chain.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.910
So in this case, A refers
to our amino acid chain,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.300
B refers to our tRNA, and X
refers to this lysine residue,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.330
which is being
transferred from B to A.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.960
And this reaction
in particular is

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.580
catalyzed by an enzyme called
peptidyl transferase, which

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.440
is an appropriate name since
it is a transferase involved

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.130
in making peptides.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.180
Next we have the
ligase group, which

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.345
catalyzes reactions
between two molecules,

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:24.520
A and B, that are combining to
form a complex between the two,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.840
or AB.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.120
And an example of a
reaction using a ligase

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.790
that you might be familiar with
occurs during DNA replication,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.430
where two strands of DNA
are being joined together.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.060
So in this reaction, A and B
represent the two separated DNA

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.160
polymers, which are being
joined to form a single strand.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.770
And this reaction
in particular is

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.750
catalyzed by an
enzyme called DNA

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.015
ligase, which is
named since it's

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:51.670
a ligase that works
on DNA strands.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.579
Now our third group as
the oxidoreductase group,

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.370
which is a little
different from the others

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.820
since it actually includes two
different types of reactions.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.200
And these reactions involve
transferring electrons

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.540
from either molecule
B to molecule A

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.480
or from molecule A
to molecule B. Now,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.000
we say that an oxidase
is directly involved

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.990
in oxidizing or taking
electrons away from a molecule,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.330
while a reductase is involved
in reducing or giving electrons

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.710
to a molecule.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.120
And we call these enzymes
oxidoreductases together

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.160
because they can
usually catalyze

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.950
both the forward and
reverse reactions, which

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.560
is why I used equilibrium
arrows here instead of just

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.000
a normal single-headed arrow.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.790
Now a great example of an
oxidation reduction reaction

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.230
occurs during lactic acid
fermentation, where electrons

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.070
are either passed from NADH to
pyruvate or from lactic acid

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.480
to NAD.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.810
Now, this reaction is
catalyzed by an enzyme

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.160
called lactate dehydrogenase.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.450
Remember that the
word "dehydrogenase"

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.740
refers to the removal of a
hydride functional group.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.510
And that's the same as saying
the removal of electrons,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.640
since hydrides are
basically just hydrogen

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.300
atoms with two electrons on
them instead of just one.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.160
Now, this enzyme
is given its name

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.610
since it's able to remove a
hydride, or remove electrons,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.210
from a molecule of lactic acid.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.500
Next, we have the
isomerase group.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.600
And enzymes in this
group are typically

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.450
involved in reactions where
a molecule, like molecule A,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.630
is being converted to
one of its isomers.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.600
And an example of this
type of a reaction

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.300
is the conversion of
glucose-6-phostate

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.780
to fructose-6-phosphate,
which is

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.040
one of the steps of glycolysis
that you may remember.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.940
Now, this reaction is
catalyzed by an enzyme called

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.450
phosphoglucose isomerase,
which is appropriately

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.340
named since it creates
isomers of glucose molecules

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.840
that are phosphorylated.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.720
Now, our next category is
the hydrolase category.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.430
And hydrolases use
water to cleave

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.720
a molecule, like molecule A,
into two other molecules, B

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.120
and C. And a great example
of one of these reactions

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.890
is the hydrolysis reaction that
can occur to peptide bonds.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.930
And if we have this
lysine-alanine dipeptide here,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.040
it could be reacted
with water to form

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.610
two individual amino acids
that are no longer bound.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.590
And this particular
hydrolysis reaction

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.560
can be catalyzed by
a class of enzymes

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.390
that we call serine
hydrolases, which

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.420
some people call
serine proteases.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.580
And they are named this way
because they are hydrolases

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.295
that use a serine residue as the
key catalytic amino acid that

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:30.460
is responsible for
breaking the peptide bond.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.140
Now, our last category is
a little more complicated

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.140
than the others.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.310
And it's the lyase group.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.890
Now, lyases catalyze the
dissociation of a molecule,

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.880
like molecule A, into
molecule B and C,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.830
without using water
like hydrolases would,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.130
and without using
oxidation or reduction

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.330
like an oxidoreductase would.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.410
And one example of a
reaction catalyzed by a lyase

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.680
is the cleavage of
argininosuccinate

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.000
into arginine and succinate.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.730
And this reaction takes
place during the urea cycle,

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.210
which you also might
be familiar with.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.370
Now this specific reaction is
catalyzed by an enzyme called

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.810
argininosuccinate lyase,
which is appropriately

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.210
named because it is a
lyase that catalyzes

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.460
the breakdown of an
argininosuccinate molecule.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.960
Now, it's important to recognize
that since lyases don't

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.550
use water or oxidation
to break a bond,

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.630
they need to generate either a
double bond between two atoms

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.340
or a ring structure in a
molecule in order to work.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.210
So what did we learn?

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.810
Well, first we learned
that enzymes are sometimes

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.730
named for their reactions.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.260
And next we learned about the
six different types of enzymes.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.960
We have transferases, which
transfer functional groups

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.080
from one molecule to another;
ligases, which ligate or join

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.050
two molecules together;
oxidoreductases,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.520
which move electrons
between molecules;

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.570
isomerases, which
convert a molecule

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.510
from one isomer to
another; hydrolases,

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.240
which break bonds using water;
and lyases, which break bonds

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.729
without using water and
without using oxidation.
