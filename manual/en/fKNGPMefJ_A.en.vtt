00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.179
So today we’re going to take a common soldiers
ration and we’re going to turn it into three

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:22.449
different meals, a soup, a stew and a hash.
The foundation of our stew and our hash, we’re

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.950
going to use salt pork, and the foundation
for the stew, we’re going to use fresh beef.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.090
So the salt pork we’re using today is a
salt pork that we prepared in an 18th century

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.309
manner. When it’s time to use the salt pork,
you have to soak it. You have to take several

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.989
hours, soak it in water, change the water
out, soak it again, until it’s ready to

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.069
use. If you don’t soak it several times
and get all the salt out, it’s inedible.

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.379
So, the big difference between a soup and
a stew is how much water we use when we prepare

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.379
it, and the first thing we have to do is to
get this water going, get it boiling. I’ve

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.370
got 6 pints of water starting to boil here
for the soup, and I’ve got 3 pints for the

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.270
stew. Let’s start out with our soup.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.660
While our 6 pints of water is getting ready

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.940
to boil here, I’m going to brown our salt
pork in a little bit of fat.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.340
I’m going to let this set and sear a little
bit. Browning this meat first will release

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.820
a lot of the flavor. So we’re doing this
in small batches. If we do too much at once,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.380
we can’t get it to caramelize properly.
It releases too many juices.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.900
Once your salt pork is browned, it’s time
to dump it in your boiling water. If any scum

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.310
develops on the surface, scrape that off.
You’re going to let this boil about 15 minutes.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.880
Now that our soup has boiled about 15 minutes
with the meat in it, it’s time to add some

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.840
other things. I’ve got some carrots here
and some parsnips. We’re going to add those.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.009
So there’s the carrots, part of our parsnips.
From our pocket spice kit, we need to use

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.529
a little bit of salt and pepper.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.100
Oh yeah, it’s looking good.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.319
It’s also now a good time to add a bay leaf
if you’ve got it and we’ve got a little

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.379
bit of cider vinegar, just a splash or two
of cider vinegar will really set this off.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.510
Now that we’ve added these things to our
soup, we’re going to moderate the fire a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.170
little bit and let it simmer for about an
hour.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.660
Now that our soup has simmered about an hour,
it’s time to throw in some cabbage if we’ve

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.680
got it and I’ve also got a little bit of
rosemary and thyme. I’ve got a little bundle

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.860
here that I’m going to throw in. You don’t want to put this stuff in too soon or it’ll destroy the flavors.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.159
Many period recipes for soup like this will

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:15.239
call for bread to be cubed up and tossed in
at the end, kind of like dumplings.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.540
We’re going to let this simmer for another
15 minutes

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.659
For this recipe I’ve got about a half a
pound of dried peas here. We soak these overnight,

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.419
so they’re going to be ready to cook.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.090
So I’m starting out with about a half a

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.669
pound of beef here. This should go really
nicely with our peas. Coating this meat with

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.529
flour and then browning it will help thicken
up the stew.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.909
So now that our beef is well browned, we’re
going to add that to our 3 pints of boiling

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.099
stew water and then we’re going to add our
peas. Let’s get this beef in there without

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:20.699
losing any of it. There we go. And now we’re
going to add the peas.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.350
So now that our stew has boiled for about
15 minutes, we’re going to add some potato,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.870
some onion and some parsnips, along with some
salt and pepper.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.140
We’re going to let that simmer for about an hour.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.620
You’ll know this stew is ready when the

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.540
peas break down and the stew thickens up and
that really is a matter of how long you’ve

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.770
soaked your peas. If you haven’t soaked
them at all, this might take 2 or 3 hours,

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.000
but if you soaked them it won’t take as
long. While our soups and stews are simmering

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.740
here, let’s start the hash.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.160
Our hash is a fairly simple dish. I’ve got

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.350
some finely diced salt pork here. I’ve already
browned this up with some onion and I’m

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:22.750
going to take a couple of parboiled or already
boiled potatoes. I’m going to dice these

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.070
up and mash them. Put them in with that.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.940
We also need to add a little bit of milk to give it some liquid to work with.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.980
If you happen to have some allspice, it makes a wonderful addition to the hash.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.160
I’m going to form this up into patties and fry it in our frying pan.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.420
Well, there we have all three dishes finished.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:09.720
We’ve got a salt pork soup and the salt
pork really has a wonderful flavor. The saltiness

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:19.850
balanced out with the other flavors actually
extremely good. Here’s our salt pork hash.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:26.030
It may not look great but let me tell you,
it is my favorite on the table here, the salt

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:32.000
pork, very tender, just the right amount of
saltiness, along with the potatoes and the

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.710
onions, definitely a favorite. So the last
dish here was the stew, this is the beef and

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:48.980
peas stew and it thickened up rather nicely.
The peas add their own kind of sweetness to

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.930
it. The beef is excellent in here. Any one
of these things you will definitely enjoy.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.390

used, you can see on our website or in our
