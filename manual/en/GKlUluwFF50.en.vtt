00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.900
By this time, you've probably heard
about something called RDA.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.100
And you may be wondering how this
acronym relates to actual students.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.400
Here’s Erica.
She has a disability.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.950
Maybe it’s a learning disability,
a developmental delay,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.840
or maybe she experiences challenges
in the emotional/behavioral arena.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.310
But like many students
with disabilities in Wisconsin,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.190
she’s not reading as well as
we’d like her to.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.610
Her family and her teacher
know that literacy is essential

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.119
to her quality of life
after high school.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.980
They want to see her
apply for jobs, write emails,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.850
add her voice
to our democracy.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.470
Erica’s enrolled in special education,
and her school follows the rules

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.660
for special ed to help her
get to success.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.989
In the past, those rules
amounted to making sure

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.670
certain actions were
taken by the school.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.800
But there was never any guarantee
that these steps were

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.280
the only ones needed to actually make
the difference for this particular student.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.540
That’s the thinking
behind RDA.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.570
It's a federal initiative that stands for
Results-Driven Accountability.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.400
Now Erica’s ability to read is
a requirement in and of itself.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.270
Schools have a responsibility
to make sure that measurable learning

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.140
really happens for
students with disabilities.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.390
In Wisconsin,
we’re focusing on literacy,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.350
so we think of RDA as
Reading Drives Achievement.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.400
Whatever you call it, it really just means
insisting on high expectations

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.630
for students with disabilities,
like we do for all other students.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.080
The focus on
students’ learning

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.509
meshes with lots of other
initiatives happening today.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.970
In fact, the DPI’s special education team
has formed new partnerships

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.299
with various education efforts
around the RDA goal.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.439
And it’s part of the special ed team’s
new way of doing business.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.520
So you can count on
hearing more about it,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.320
and there will be
opportunities to seek support.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.400
If you’re a teacher, you might
wonder if there’s anything

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.150
you’re expected to do
differently because of RDA.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.340
Good news.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.740
The best way for schools to
succeed in this new world

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.470
is to use those same best practices
many educators are already

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.170
trying to employ for
students with disabilities.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.520
Universal design for learning.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.940
Strong literacy instruction.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.139
Culturally responsive curriculum.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.779
Meaningful access to grade-level
standards-based education.

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.599
Strategies for
family engagement.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.379
Collaboration between special
and general educators.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.059
A multi-level
system of supports.

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.010
And positive behavioral
interventions and supports.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.400
Everyone loves to see
a student with disabilities

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.669
open up options
for their future.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:32.569
Beyond that, schools will also like
to see gains on their school report cards.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.559
And teachers will see themselves make
progress toward any of their educator

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:40.079
effectiveness goals that relate to
students’ outcomes in special education.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.069
- By working together, I know
that we can increase literacy

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.659
for our students with disabilities
here in Wisconsin.

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.569
- Folks, this is a great opportunity
for a new focus.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.919
A new focus on outcomes
and results and opportunities

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.620
and supports for our
kids with disabilities.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.660
Let’s do this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.200
