00:00:01.386 --> 00:00:02.421
Mrs. Collins?
Yes?

00:00:02.487 --> 00:00:04.123
Dr. Earl W. Tarr.

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:05.224
Captain Jones sent me.

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:07.728
l consult with him
from time to time
on juvenile cases.

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:09.162
May l come in?

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.397
Yes, thank you for coming.

00:00:11.462 --> 00:00:13.265
l was beginning to think
he didn't believe me.

00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:16.705
Well, l'm here now,
and we'll put all
that to rights.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:19.539
Where's the boy?

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:24.310
Ah! There he is.

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:27.313
A handsome young man.

00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:29.850
He has your eyes,
doesn't he?

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:32.152
And a little bit
of the nose.

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:35.556
Very fit, in spite
of all his travails.

00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:38.927
A very resilient boy
you've got here,
Mrs. Collins.

00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:41.560
l thought you were
here to help me.

00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:43.129
Well, l am.

00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:46.633
Captain Jones said that
the boy had been through
some severe physical changes

00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:48.233
and asked me
to drop in on him

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.904
to reassure you
in your time of
motherly concern.

00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:56.378
My motherly concern is
not for him because
he's not my son.

00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:01.616
Now, statements like
that will hardly help
the boy's self-esteem,

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.082
now will they?

00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:07.088
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?

00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:09.021
Yes.

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:11.456
Come.

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:14.927
Against the wall.

00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:20.332
CHRISTINE: He's
three inches shorter.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:22.869
Ah, well...

00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:27.474
(STAMMERING)
Hardly a mystery,
Mrs. Collins.

00:01:27.538 --> 00:01:31.847
We've known for some time
that trauma can affect
the growth of children.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.080
Given the stress
of the past five months,

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:36.616
his spine may have
actually shrunk.

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.653
lt's uncommon,
but it's within
the realm of possibility.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.689
And circumcision?

00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:50.965
Very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:53.800
After all, circumcision
is hygienically sound.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.172
Must have been
quite traumatic
at the time.

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:02.209
No wonder
he's submerged the memory.

00:02:04.642 --> 00:02:05.677
l...

00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:10.085
You see, there's a perfectly
sound medical explanation
for all of this.

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.519
But it's right for you
to raise the questions.

00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:16.623
You need to be apprised
of all changes the lad
went through

00:02:16.687 --> 00:02:18.757
during his absence.

00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:22.096
Wouldn't l know
whether or not
he's my son?

00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:24.563
l'm the mother.

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:27.600
Which means
you're in no position
to be objective.

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:32.574
You are looking
through the prism of
extreme emotion at a boy

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:35.242
who has changed
from what you remember.

00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:37.343
He isn't the same boy
that left here.

00:02:37.408 --> 00:02:39.545
Just as a boy
that goes off to war
and then returns

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.447
is not the same anymore.

00:02:41.512 --> 00:02:46.188
And a mother's heart,
driven by intuition
and emotion,

00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:48.688
sees these changes
and rebels,

00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:51.724
insists that
this isn't your son.

00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:55.127
Doesn't change the facts.

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:03.203
l'm willing to put my theory
to the test of objectivity,
Mrs. Collins.

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:05.404
Are you?

00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:14.814
CHRISTINE: It Ă­s
absolutely outrageous!
