00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
"Which Parts of the Mediterranean Diet Extended Life?"

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.114
How might adding a few nuts to one’s daily diet, in this case about four walnuts,

00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:16.854
almonds and hazelnuts cut one’s stroke risk nearly in half? ≈

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:21.974
Well, olives and nuts are plant foods, and as such packed with antioxidants,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.320
raising the antioxidant level of our bloodstream,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.974
resulting in lower fat oxidation and free radical DNA damage,

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:33.534
but what’s happening inside people’s arteries?

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:38.080
Researchers measured the amount of atherosclerotic plaque in the neck arteries

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.400
going to the brain in folks who for years were eating the added nuts,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.940
or added extra virgin olive oil, or neither to their daily diets.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.640
In the control group, the plaque got worse,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.980
which is what happens when one continues to eat an artery-clogging diet,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.794
but there were no significant changes in the added extra virgin olive oil group,

00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:01.654
and the plaque in the added nut group appeared to get better.

00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:04.960
The nuts appeared to induce a regression of the disease,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.054
or at least a significant delay in the progression.

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:12.653
Now the nut group was still suffering strokes, but only half as many,

00:01:12.653 --> 00:01:16.060
perhaps because the reduction in plaque height within the arteries on extra nuts

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.380
was indicating a stabilization of the plaque rendering them less likely to rupture.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.154
Adding nuts to our diet may also improve endothelial function,

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:31.714
boosting the ability of our arteries to dilate naturally by about 30%.

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:36.555
If you look at the baseline adherence to Mediterranean diet principles,

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.574
and control for things like smoking and exercise,

00:01:38.574 --> 00:01:44.054
there were only 2 factors significantly associated with reduced heart attack and stroke risk,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.600
more vegetables and more nuts.

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.633
No significant association with the olive oil or the wine

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.440
or the fish or cutting back on soda and cookies,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.040
Among the individual Mediterannean diet components, only increased consumption of vegetables and nuts

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.314
were related to reduced cardiovascular events.

00:02:05.314 --> 00:02:07.294
On the one hand, cutting stroke risk in half

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.140
just by eating a handful of nuts a day is pretty amazing,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.940
but those in the added nut group didn’t appear to live any longer overall.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.260
And other studies have suggested that frequent nut consumption

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.674
may indeed extend life, for example the Harvard Health Professionals studies,

00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:28.694
involving a whopping 3 million person-years of follow-up over decades,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.820
found nut consumption associated with fewer deaths

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.240
from cancer, heart disease, respiratory disease,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.120
and most importantly fewer deaths overall,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.100
confirmed by all the other big major prospective studies, as of 2014,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.733
with a new one just published.

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:47.001
17,000 people followed for 5 years and those who ate nuts

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.700
had less than half the risk of dying.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.940
Maybe this is just because people may eat nuts

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.720
instead of meat, eggs, and dairy, and that’s why they live longer?

00:02:58.773 --> 00:03:02.293
Well, no, since even vegetarians that frequently eat nuts also

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.500
have a dramatically reduce risk compared to those that don’t.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.320
So what’s going on here with the PREDIMED study showing no longevity benefit from nuts?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.000
Did they just not wait long enough?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.234
Well, just because people were randomized to the nut group

00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:20.809
doesn’t mean they actually ate more nuts,

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.769
and those randomized to the other groups didn’t necessarily stay away from nuts.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.840
If you re-analyze the data comparing the death rates

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.320
of just those who actually ate more nuts to those who actually didn’t,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.600
nut consumption was indeed associated with significantly reduced risk of death.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.200
If you do the same kind of post hock analysis with olive oil,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.880
even with the extra virgin, no benefit in terms of living longer.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.220
This is consistent with how Ancel Keys,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.720
the so-called Father of the Mediterranean diet, viewed olive oil.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.300
He thought of its benefit more as a way of just replacing the animal fats,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.960
anything to get people to eat less lard and butter.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.420
What are the best kinds of nuts?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.174
The greatest benefits were attributed to walnuts,

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:05.475
particularly, it seems, for preventing cancer deaths.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:07.915
Those eating more than three servings of walnuts a week

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.855
appeared to cut their risk of dying from cancer in half.

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:16.154
Now it’s just a matter of communicating the research to the public.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.560
All the major cancer groups emphasize a more plant-based diet,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.340
remarkably consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines for healthy eating.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.880
The far-reaching positive effects of a plant-based diet—including walnuts—

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.760
may be the most critical message for the public.
