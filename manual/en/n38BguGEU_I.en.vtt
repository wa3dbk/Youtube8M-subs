Hi, it's  Klaudia

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.240
Today I want to show you how to decorate Styrofoam egg in decoupage technique, which will be an interesting decoration for Easter.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.140
We will need:

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.760
Styrofoam egg,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.360
acrylic paints,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.280
napkin,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.620
decoupage glue,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.180
ordinary brush and sponge,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.600
toothpick skewers

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.860
and ribbon.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.480
Let's start!

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:32.300
Such ordinary white styrofoam egg painted by acrylic paint in a cream-colored and waited until it dries.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.860
Now glue the napkin

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.140
Ripped out napkin before, applied to only one upper printed layer

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.740
I add to the egg and glue with glue to decouopage

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.220
The glue is dry and the egg is ready, but decorate it with acrylic paints with a sponge

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.440
To stick skewers added a ribbon and now I dig the stick in the bottom of the egg.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.960
My Easter decoration is done

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.120
