00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:03.210
Now that we have audio,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.850
let's add some animations in our project.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.869
Let’s start by animating the sun.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.979
In order to do so, click the layer sun

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.669
and click add animation.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.779
The animation window appears.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.660
Here you can name the animation,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.269
or even accept the name proposed by 
Kwik.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.710
And select the type.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.499
For this first animation, let’s use
Linear.

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.590
The Keyframe Info shows the current position 
of the sun.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.370
Anytime you move it

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.680
Kwik will automatically save that.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.040
But the most important thing here,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.739
is the End Position, as it is in

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.370
Linear animation.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.350
Let’s move the sun 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.170
a little bit higher.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.590
You can do so, for example just

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.020
by moving the Y line.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.080
Now the sun is a little bit 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.730
higher.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.210
Let’s move the sun closer to the
Africa name.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.260
It’s fine here.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.530
You could also do that just by entering numbers
Here.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.770
The return to start position after play

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.750
should be used anytime that you decide to
have the current layer returning to its previews

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.870
position

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.940
it's not the case for his sun. So let's uncheck
it.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.670
The alpha again is just for the ending position,
so let's keep it up as a hundred percent as

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.790
the sun will always be showing up.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.720
The duration

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.270
is the time from start to the end
position, so let's say the sun will move up

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.030
from the original position

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.079
to the end one,

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.720
in three seconds.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.750
Starts,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.860
helps you to define if the animation will play
as soon as you start the movie

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.030
Or if it will need to 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.890
wait until a button starts it.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.439
In this case let's just accept when page starts.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.450
The delay also tells Kwik to wait a little
bit

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.110
a few seconds before starting the animation

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.670
Or just start as soon as

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.150
the movie starts, let’s wait two seconds

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.489
with that, let’s create.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.549
As you can see here animation sun

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.989
is already in the project,

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.479
and the sun came back to its original position.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.919
As I mentioned, you can even say, let’s start the sun

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.069
here

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.979
And move it, from the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.359
back of

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.359
The plants for example.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.639
Kwik knows that although we changed the original 
Position of the sun

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.819
the end position is the one saved.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.099
Anytime that you decide to

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.769
review your animation, you do not need to create it
again,

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.029
just double click it.

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.749
and you will see everything here.

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.609
The next animation

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.919
is the cloud, so let's click the clouds here
and let’s say

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:29.239
Animate the cloud, we will still use the linear here,

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.999
but the only thing that we're going to do now
is to move

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.689
the x position of the cloud to off screen.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.230
Meaning that again the cloud will 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.739
cross the screen.

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.769
in this case we want the cloud to return to its 
original position when the animation

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.309
finish. So we are going to leave this Check here.

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:56.500
Also the duration will be ten seconds, it’ll be a slow

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.379
move across the screen.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.119
And at this time we are going to use the Wait request.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.749
Again when the movie starts, nothing is going to happen
to the cloud,

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:12.439
It will be there until something happens, we are going to 
tell

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.879
a button later on

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.639
what to do with this cloud.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.259
Let’s create it
