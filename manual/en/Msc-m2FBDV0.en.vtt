00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.330
I don’t think I’m breaking news by telling
you video games aren’t always the most original

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.600
form of entertainment.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.180
They’re always based on something else or
they’re continuing an older one...their

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.380
names have more numbers than a calculator.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.440
So given the choice, I’ll take the original
game over Call of Halo: Modern Battlefield

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.840
7 almost every time.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.870
Those are usually the games that make the
biggest impression on me.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.060
But at the same time, not every original game
is great, not every great game is original...and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:26.790
I really like hot chocolate.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.000
So forget that this iPhone game looks a lot
like...another iPhone game.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
While the blueprint is very familiar, the
finished product ends up feeling surprisingly

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.840
distinct.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840
And chocolately.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:51.619
It’s Coco Loco, and dare I say, it’s better
than Angry Birds.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:03.380
I say that for more than the attention-grabbing
effect of hyperbole.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.790
Coco Loco was clearly built from the same
concept as the platform-defining Angry Birds,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.710
but it makes the concept its own with some
very clever additions and refinements.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.410
In fact, if Angry Birds is the Super Mario
Bros. of the mobile generation in terms of

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.830
its impact and significance, Coco Loco is
like Mario 3.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.130
It takes the same ideas and makes them even
better.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.340
Just released to the App Store, Coco Loco
is the debut project from Twiitch, a new studio

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.160
formed by Blue Tongue and THQ alumni.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.840
It’s fitting to learn Coco Loco is born
from some of the same minds that worked on

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.700
a game like de Blob, because the two games
do the same thing...take an old idea and infuse

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.870
it with really inspired ideas.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.180
In Coco Loco, you play as a group of living
marshmallows who stumble across this wonderful

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.330
new world of chocolate.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.250
Of course, as would any marshmallow, they
make merry among the chocolate bars and jump

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.240
into steaming rivers of cocoa faster than
Augustus Gloop.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.720
But obviously, this greatly displeases the
chocolate gods.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.270
Silly story short, you have to save your marshmallow
friends from their chocolate kidnappers.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.530
And you do this by launching marshmallows,
jelly blobs and all manner

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.330
of friendly confectionaries to attack the
ones who aren’t quite so friendly.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.830
Like Angry Birds, Coco Loco is a physics-based
action puzzler.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.290
But from there, the game forges its own ground.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.370
Sure, you have to pull back and launch things
to rescue other things, but it’s how the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.240
game approaches this that makes it so distinct.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.150
This is a more ambitious game in terms of
its design than Angry Birds ever was.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.209
Its 60 levels require more interaction, and
their puzzles are smarter and frankly, more

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.209
diverse.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.650
A big reason for that diversity is the game’s
use of liquids.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.030
You might have to dump steaming vats of hot
cocoa on your enemies or slice through massive

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.830
towers of jelly, and the physics for all these
different things are spot-on.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.120
The sheer fun factor of the game aside, Coco
Loco is perhaps even more stunning because

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120
of its liquids.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.060
It’s amazing to see these kind of physics
and liquid effects running on a phone.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.470
But the important thing is what the jellies
and jams and cocoa contribute to the gameplay,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.919
and ultimately, that’s what makes Coco Loco
so delicious.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.690
I may prefer originality, but that doesn’t
mean I can’t appreciate applying creative

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.220
muscle to an existing concept.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:55.160
Especially when the end result is one of the
best new games in the App Store.
