00:00:00.592 --> 00:00:01.425
- Hi!

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:05.645
Today I'm going to pull my
tooth out with the boot.

00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:07.228
It's really wiggly.

00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:17.390
And Blakely did it and I promised her that

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.175
if she did then I would do it.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:22.092
So, here I am doing it.

00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:28.225
So what we did is we
died the string to a boot

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:31.383
and we're going to tie it to my tooth

00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:34.583
and I'm going to throw
the boot off the balcony.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:37.430
So we have tied the string to my tooth

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.347
and it's time to do it.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.279
- [Man] Blakely, what's your sister doing?

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:47.446
- She's gonna pull her tooth
out with a boot like I did.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.767
- [Man] Trendsetter.

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:15.645
- [Blakely] Are you
scared like I was scared?

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:16.812
- [Woman] Nah?

00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:20.116
- Just a little bit.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.699
(woman laughs)

00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:27.858
- [Blakely] Drop the boot, drop the boot.

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:29.589
- [Woman] Drop the boot!

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.310
- Give me a countdown from 10.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.977
Like really slowly.
- Yeah.

00:01:32.977 --> 00:01:34.450
- [Woman] Okay.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.794
Going to drop it after one though, right?

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:38.838
- [Family] 10, 9, 8,

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:39.671
7,

00:01:41.037 --> 00:01:42.477
6,

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:43.310
5,

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:45.601
4,

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:46.918
3,

00:01:46.918 --> 00:01:48.100
2,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.576
1!

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.826
- [Woman] Ahhh!

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:52.742
Did it go?

00:01:55.354 --> 00:01:56.187
It didn't pull it out.

00:01:56.187 --> 00:01:57.020
- Yes, it did!

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.020
- [Woman] It did?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.450
(woman laughs)

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.212
- I didn't feel it at all!

00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:04.412
- [Woman] Well it's bleeding
so keep that on there.

00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:06.503
Go look and find a tooth!

00:02:06.503 --> 00:02:09.340
- I schooled you on the timing.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.169
Schooled you on timing.

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:13.752
(woman laughs)

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:19.159
- [Blakely] I want to see
the tooth, where is it?

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:23.362
- [Woman] Is it hooked on?

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:25.112
- [Girl] Where is it?

00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:30.595
- I don't know.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:35.999
- [Woman] Here, just pick it up.

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.582
- Pick the boot up.

00:02:42.942 --> 00:02:44.506
- [Man] Sweetie.

00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:47.089
- [Woman] Wow, it did come out!

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:49.502
- [Man] One more time.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.497
- [Woman] Did it hurt?

00:02:50.497 --> 00:02:51.483
- No!

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:53.290
I didn't feel it.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.373
I did it, I did it right.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.410
- [Woman] Yeah, well we gotta find it.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.735
- I'm shaking.

00:02:58.735 --> 00:02:59.568
- [Woman] You are?

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:00.467
- Now I'm scared.

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:03.858
I wasn't scared before when I did it.

00:03:03.858 --> 00:03:05.423
I didn't even look at it.

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:07.858
I just closed my eyes the whole time.

00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:10.764
- [Woman] I don't see it anywhere.

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:13.680
- [Girl] Maybe Houston got it.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.513
- No.

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.970
- [Man] Blakers, are you proud?

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.803
- Yes.

00:03:23.632 --> 00:03:24.465
- [Man] You proud of your sister?

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:26.541
- [Woman] It's right here!

00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:29.202
- [Blakely] It's right over there!

00:03:29.202 --> 00:03:30.587
- [Girl] It's not even bleeding.

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:32.113
The tooth isn't even bleeding.

00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:34.498
All of the blood is on your gum.

00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:35.412
It's not even bleeding!

00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:36.495
- It's sharp.

00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:45.071
- [Man] It's a beauty.

00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:46.154
- It's sharp.

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:48.999
- I want to see it!

00:03:51.473 --> 00:03:53.070
- [Woman] Wow, it flew way back here!

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.466
Blakely, it must have hit you!

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:55.654
- No, it didn't.

00:03:55.654 --> 00:03:57.506
- [Woman] You were
sitting like right here.

00:03:57.506 --> 00:04:00.089
(woman laughs)

00:04:09.864 --> 00:04:13.649
- And I'd like to make my
very first shout out to,

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:14.482
drum roll please,

00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:15.758
(hands clapping)

00:04:15.758 --> 00:04:20.898

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.440
Houston, let's see your teeth!

00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:29.780
(all laughing)

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.271
(peaceful music)
