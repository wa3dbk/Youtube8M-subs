00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.870
Many times I have been unsure what Jesus would
have me do.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.820
When we are unsure we SEEK THE CLARITY THAT
COMES FROM JESUS THROUGH PRAYER.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.700
A lot of times I have misinterpreted what
Jesus would have me do.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:35.110
But I am learning that EVEN THOUGH I may misinterpret,
Jesus can STILL LEAD ME.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.309
It is NOT a matter of out interpretation,
but it is a matter of OUR HEART CONDITION.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:51.699
If our hear REALLY is with Jesus and if we
really want HIM to lead us we KEEP SEEKING

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.629
HIS CLARITY,
and even if we were starting to walk the wrong

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:03.299
direction, He can work with us and He can
put us back on the right path.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:11.420
I want to give you an example: See, sometime
ago now the Lord Jesus did clearly call us

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.920
to move.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.880
We owned a house and some property, and Jesus
called us to sell our house and to move, BUT

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.360
He did NOT tell us where we were going.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.700
So I assumed that I should be applying for
jobs around the area.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.479
So I started applying for a nearby Costco.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.330
I did not receive ONE call back from the managers
I had talked to,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.189
and I realized that I had misinterpreted what
Jesus would have me do.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.549
We kept on praying and it became clear that
we were not even supposed to be in the area

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.439
anymore,
but He was calling us to clearly move out

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.609
of the area entirely.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.800
Clarity comes when we diligently seek Jesus
IN PRAYER.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.880
IT IS NOT JUST GUESS WORK, BUT IT IS A RELATIONSHIP
WITH JESUS!

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.490
And IF we DO choose to follow Him,
EVEN IF we start going the wrong direction,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.480
He CAN work with us, and He can put us back
on the RIGHT path.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.210
It is NOT a question of guess work or misinterpretation,
but it is a question of IS OUR HEART RIGHT

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.550
WITH JESUS and do we trust Him.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.520
Is YOUR trust in Jesus?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.880
And is your HEART with HIM?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.010
Because if it is HE can lead you EVEN IF YOU
ARE NOT SURE!

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.690
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
