00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
IT'S NOW THE BIGGEST FIRE IN WASHINGTON STATE HISTORY.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
MORE THAN 400 SQUARE MILES.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
THE OKANOGAN COMPLEX FIRE.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
OVERTAKING THE CARLTON COMPLEX IN SIZE.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
AS CREWS WORK TIRELESSLY TO CONTAIN IT.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We haven't had the opportunity to get in there.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
BUT CREWS ARE MAKING PROGRESS.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
GOOD EVENING AND THANKS FOR JOINING US I'M NADINE

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
WOODWARD.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
THIS FIRE IS SO MASSIVE.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
OFFICIALS DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm too old to start over again! But.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
one day at a time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
TODAY.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
MORE FIRE VICTIMS RETURNED TO SURVEY THE DAMAGE AND

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
MUSTER THE STRENGTH TO FACE REBUILDING.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
KXLY 4'S ALYSSA DONOVAN IS LIVE IN OMAK TONIGHT.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
FIREFIGHTERS ARE SAYING THEY CREDIT SOME OF THEIR

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
PROGRESS TO THIS SMOKE.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
THIS IS HELPING KEEP THE FIRE FROM BECOMING MORE ACTIVE----

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
WE'RE TOLD CONTAINMENT STAYED THE SAME OVERNIGHT AT

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
10 PERCENT----  HOWEVER IT THE SMOKE DOES TAKE AWAY

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
SOME VERY HELPFUL RESOURCES.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We will continue to take advantage today of the lid

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that's on the fire right now.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
THE SMOKY CONDITIONS HAVE ALLOWED FIREFIGHTERS TO

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
GET SOME CONTROL OF THIS FIRE.--- 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's a double edge sword, it's helped keep a lid

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
on the fire and keep fire activity down but it also

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
means we can't use our aviation resources because

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
of aviator safety.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
EVEN WITHOUT AIR SUPPORT--- ITS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
24 HOURS.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
TODD PECHODA, INCIDENT COMMANDER

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We're making some good progress on the Twisp River

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Fire, we're able to get some hot shot crews in and

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
cut some line.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE--- RIGHT NOW

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
THERE ARE MORE THAN 12 HUNDRED PEOPLE WORKING THIS

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
FIRE--- AND MORE COMING IN EACH DAY.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
AND AS OF TODAY---- FIREFIGHTER INJURIES ARE NOTHING

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
TO BUZZ ABOUT.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Today there have only been some very minor injuries

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to our firefighters who are working hard--- and those

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
have been associated with bee stings.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
THE TOP PRIORITY RIGHT NOW IS THE TUNK BLOCK FIRE---

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
CREWS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT THAT FROM SPREADING INTO

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
THE AENES inn_ee_us VALLEY.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
HOWEVER THE TWISP RIVER FIRE IS CLOSE BEHIND.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
CREWS FROM AUSTRALIA ARE EXPECTED TO JOIN THE FIGHT

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
TOMORROW---- AS WELL AS CREWS FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
NADINE?
