Hello there unboxers! I'm Sakis Karpas, you are watching the Unboxholics show and this is the LG G Flex, the first curved, flexible smartphone on the planet.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.080
LG G Flex has already been released abroad but it was recently released in Greece.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.500
The first thing we found was the smartphone itself but we'll leave it aside for now.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.400
The package contents are the following: 1. An AC charger

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.400
2. A USB cable

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.700
3. A set of earphones

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.750
4. Replacement covers for the earphones

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.500
5. A Sim removal tool

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.100
6. A Quick-Start Guide

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.950
Let's check out the LG G Flex!

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:29.800
You're not being fooled by your own eyes. As you can see, this is indeed the first curved and flexible smartphone on the market. This is an incredible technology since most parts of the phone like the battery and the motherboard are also flexible. 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:42.800
Although it is not extremely useful, the curved design offers some small conveniences such as more viewing angles and it also follows the shape of the user's head during calls. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:56.300
Another innovation by LG is the self-healing back side of the LG G Flex which means that small scratches will be removed after a few minutes. Yes, it works although we could not test it since this was not our device. 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:08.700
The LG G Flex is quite big and its 6-inch display is the one to blame. Dimensions: 160.5mm height x 81.6mm width x 8.7mm thickness

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.300
Weight: 177g

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.000
In terms of design and overall build quality, we're satisfied although the curved design had us worried but you eventually get used to it.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:29.100
Front side: Screen sensors, 2.1 MP front camera and a calls speaker.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.700
Bottom side: Micro-USB port, a microphone and an audio jack port

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.600
Left side: Micro-Sim card slot

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.500
Top side: 1x noise cancellation microphone

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:53.900
The LG G Flex continues the G legacy by having the power button and the volume button on the back side.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.800
Personally, I still haven't got used to these buttons being on the back side but this is something entirely personal. 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.180
Note: The power button lights up when you press it.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:13.200
Apart from these two buttons, the back side of the phone features a 13MP camera, a LED flash and the main speaker. 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.000
Aside from the fact that the speaker is in a wrong position, its performance is not that decent. 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.800
Let's take a look at the technical specifications. 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.800
LG G Flex is powered by a Snapdragon 800 clocked at 2.26GHz with 2GB RAM and 32Gb available storage. 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.450
Display: OLED technology with HD resolution at 245 ppi

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:47.800
One of the most surprisingly good aspect of the LG G Flex is its 3200mAh battery which after heavy use has lasted a whole day. That means that after average use it can last even more. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.800
The LG G Flex supports all 4G and 3G networks. 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:04.000
Although being curved and flexible could have been be the top thing that we would remember from the LG G Flex, it is not like that at all. 

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:09.150
Incredibly bright, excellent black color levels and amazingly colorful colors is what caught our attention from LG G Flex's display. 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:18.300
If some of you are concerned about the display being 720p, you don't have to worry. The display is still sharp and clear with the average user not being able to tell the difference. 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:31.500
The LG G Flex ships with Android 4.4.2 pre-installed. We hoped that LG would at least have the 4.4.3 version as default but the update for 4.4.4 Android KitKat is probably on its way.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:42.070
When it comes to performance, the Snapdragon 800 processor of the phone in combination with 2GB of RAM is enough to make everything go as smooth as possible.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:51.300
There was a small problem with the double tap awakening of the phone but even if there wasn't any, we doubt if we would use it that much.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:05:12.060
Lastly, we need to emphasize on the excellent performance of the camera on HDR images, beautiful 1080p video with sport mode for fast shots and Audio Zoom on video mode which enables focus on certain sounds.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.700
LG G Flex is available now with a starting price of â‚¬500.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:56.300
This is a unique and powerful smartphone at the same time. It has an excellent display, it is fast, it has a long battery life and incorporates an incredible camera. We think LG G Flex is enough for us. How about you? Tell us in the comments section.
