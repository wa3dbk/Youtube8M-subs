00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:01.820
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.840
explain what parallax
actually is, and then try

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.370
to visualize what
the parallax would

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.030
be like in the context
of observing relatively

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.110
nearby stars.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.580
And then in the
next video, we're

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.840
going to think
about how we can use

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.360
the parallax of nearby
stars to figure out

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.820
how far they actually
are away from us.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.990
So parallax really is
just the apparent change

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.380
in position of something based
on a different line of sight.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.014
So when you see that, while
you're looking out at a car,

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:35.430
you're going to
see that depending

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.434
on how far different
things are from you,

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:39.600
it looks like they're moving
relative to each other.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.474
Right now I'm looking
at my computer monitor.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.930
And if I move my head around
or shake my head around,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.780
it looks like the wall
behind the computer

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.905
monitor is moving relative
to the computer monitor.

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.370
We've all experienced this.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.160
But let's think
about what parallax

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.435
means when looking at stars.

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:56.670
So let me draw the sun here.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.460
And obviously none of
this is drawn to scale.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.150
So let me draw the sun here.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.160
And let me draw the
earth at some point

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.039
in its orbit around the sun.

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:07.580
And we're going to
pretend like we're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.800
looking from above
the solar system.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.480
So the earth will be rotating in
this direction right over here.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.820
And let's say the star that we
care about is right over here.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.770
Obviously, clearly
not drawn to scale.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.810
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.380
going to wait to the
point in the year, so

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.910
the point in our orbit
around the earth, so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.145
that right at dawn--
so we're sitting right

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:38.520
here on the surface
of the earth.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.020
And to simplify things,
we're on the equator.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.200
And let's say that
this star is roughly

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.150
in the plane of
our solar system.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.810
So we're sitting right
here on the equator.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.380
And then right at dawn, right
when the first light of the sun

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560
begins to reach me--
remember, right now the sun

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.440
is lighting up this
side of the earth--

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.210
so right when the first light
of the sun is reaching me,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.090
I'm looking straight up.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.860
So if I look straight up right
when the first light of the sun

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.110
is reaching me, and I look
straight up like that,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.566
I will be looking
in that direction.

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:21.940
Now, so let's say that that
direction that I'm looking at

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.132
is this direction
right over here.

00:02:25.132 --> 00:02:26.590
And then let me
make it clear, this

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.890
is a separate part
of the diagram here.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.170
Maybe I'll do it over here.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.830
So if the night sky
looks like this,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.500
the sun is just beginning
to rise on the horizon.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.300
If I look straight up, I'm
looking in this direction.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.339
So where would this star
be relative to straight up?

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.130
Well, straight up is
going to be like that.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.260
The sun is, the way I drew it
right here, right to my left.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.520
Straight up is just like that.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.390
The sun is just coming
over the horizon.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.650
This star right here,
the apparent position

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.170
of this star
relative to straight

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.810
up is going to be at some angle
to the left of straight up.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.640
It's going to be
right over there.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.052
And obviously the star
won't be that big relative

00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:17.260
to your entire field of
vision, but you get the idea.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.990
Maybe I'll draw it a little
bit smaller, just like that.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.100
So there's going to
be some angle here.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.060
And this angle,
whatever it is, let's

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.210
just call it Theta, that's going
to be the same angle as this.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.710
And when I talk
about the angle, I'm

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.100
talking about if you measure
from one side of the horizon

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.480
to the other side
of the horizon,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.830
you're essentially looking
halfway around the earth.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.470
That would be 180 degrees.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.250
So you could
literally measure what

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.830
this angle is right over here.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.530
Now let's say we
waited six months.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.920
What's going to happen?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.304
Six months, we're going to
be on this side of the sun.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:59.220
We're assuming that our
distance is relatively

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.940
constant at one
astronomical unit.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.720
Now what happens?

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.740
Remember, the earth
is rotating like this.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.280
So if we wait, right
at sunset, right

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.480
when the last glimpse
of the sun has just

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.060
gone away-- because you
can remember, right now,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.602
the sun is illuminating
this side of the earth.

00:04:17.602 --> 00:04:19.060
The sun is going
to be illuminating

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.018
that side of the earth.

00:04:20.018 --> 00:04:23.460
So if we're sitting right at
the equator right over there,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.270
right when the sun is just
setting, we look straight up.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.920
Let me do that in
the same color.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.180
We look straight up.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.230
So six months later when
we look straight up,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.080
where is the star
relative to straight up?

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.847
Well now the star
will be to the right.

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:45.930
It'll be in the direction.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.910
So if this is our field of
vision six months later,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.320
now the sun is setting
all the way to the right,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.010
on the right horizon.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.220
And if we look
straight up, this star

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:06.840
now is going to be to
the right of straight up.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.490
So what just happened here?

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.910
Well, it looks like
relative to straight up--

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.330
and we're looking at the exact
kind of position of the earth.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.310
We're making sure that we're
picking times of year and times

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.970
of day where straight up
is the same direction.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.040
We're looking in the same
direction of the universe.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.810
It looks like the position of
that star has actually shifted.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.197
And let's say that this
is the middle of summer,

00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:38.780
and that this is the
middle of winter.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.571
Doesn't have to be.

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.670
It could be any other two
points in time six months apart.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.050
Then when we look at
this star in the summer,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.330
it's going to be over here.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.080
Summer, it's going to
be right over there.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.871
And when we look at
the star in the winter,

00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.062
it is going to be over here.

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:52.770
And, in general, for
any star, especially

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.520
stars that are in the same
plane as the solar system,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.100
you can find two
points in the year

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.910
where that star is at a kind of
a maximum distance from center.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.810
And those are the two distances,
those are the two times of year

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.060
that you'll want to care the
most about, because it'll

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.060
be most interesting
to measure this angle.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.910
And I want to be
clear, this angle

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.890
here is going to be the same
thing as this angle there.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.150
You can see it's
symmetric this way.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.830
Whatever this angle is going to
be, and you could look at this.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.800
This is an isosceles triangle.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.430
Whatever this distance
is from here to here,

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.902
is going to be the same as this
distance from here to here.

00:06:33.902 --> 00:06:36.110
And so this angle is going
to be equal to that angle,

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.360
and that angle is going
to be equal to that angle.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.010
What I want to do
in the next video

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.970
is think about if we're
able to precisely measure

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.090
these angles, either one
of them or both of them.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.230
And let me be clear, if
this angle in the night sky

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.460
is Theta, and this angle
right here is Theta,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.380
the difference over
here is two Theta.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.350
So one option, if you
want to kind of make sure

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.890
that your number's
reasonably good,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.700
you could measure just
the total difference

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.354
that it is around the center
and then divide by two.

00:07:03.354 --> 00:07:04.770
But in the next
video, what I want

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.850
to do is if you
are able to measure

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.890
the apparent change
in angle here,

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.896
if you were to be
able to measure that,

00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:16.770
how would you be able
to use that information

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.469
to actually figure out
the distance to this star?
