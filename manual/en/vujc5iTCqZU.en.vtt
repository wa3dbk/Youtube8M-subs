00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.110
Matthew heyyy provided me with my
favorite sound-bite

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.190
above the day a by a long shot listen to
this

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.740
Wesley says it seems every time i feel
myself moving closer to Christ

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.410
there is some researchers who provides a
litany of reasons why Christianity is

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.060
false

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.650
the most recent is Joseph Act will who
claims that Christianity did not real

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.830
really begin as a religion but as
sophisticated government project

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.939
he says it is a propaganda exercise to
pacify members are the Roman Empire in

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:32.870
his Inc and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.910
has enchant confessions to back it up

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.390
can you help me understand how to refute
these claims as very easy Wesley

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.430
the Bible says let God be true and every
man a liar

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.440
if man says something that is
contradictory to what God says

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.440
man is lying best on thinkable

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.180
how can you say that so how can you say
that so for example in the Bible

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.330
the anywhere between like seven and ten
times that's a lotta lotta times

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.560
they are lewd to the fact that the earth
is flat so according to Matthew maybe

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.340
well

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.080
Bible overrides met man and these
scientists

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.390
that did all this researching in fact
finding

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.689
but so of course near the Swat not can
be around that came from an

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.090
God says its black tell us what got
always override meant bone

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.170
done drop my can go out there but come
on man

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.820
how can you say that so okay that means
that seven had a dragons exist

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.640
even though there's no evidence that
never been any fossils found

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.840
indicate that never been a dragon period

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.439
non non non non non non but no god says
that's true so it's true even though

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.450
management

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.229
essentially disproven it are the talking
snake as a snake ever talked in human

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.040
history now

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.530
but got a ride man so yes a snake talked

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.390
but how about in the Bible there's
multiple different characters that lead

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.200
to ridiculous ages one guy looks over
900 years all

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.039
is that possible certainly not yet maybe
sign to come along and find a way to

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.150
make that possible but

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.660
no not at all today but no

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.660
the Word of God overrides the word up
man know what's fascinating about this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.280
to mean

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.849
is how laziness now unconvincing its

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.220
because even a lot of Christians in your
mouth you are you say that go

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.830
that's a little extreme because what you
find is that

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.280
up more intelligent modernized religious
people

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.280
they need to twist themselves into
intellectual pretzel to try to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.830
rationalize their belief system saw yet
another thing in the Bible about Noah's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.040
Ark in every animal on a boat even
though less than like five percent of

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.989
the animals in the world were in his
area

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.080
but all they are that was well
allegorical really was an allegory

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.860
was an allegory for what the deeper
truth behind that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.090
well the deeper truth is that you gotta
have animals and the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.379
Petland has nice tits cams know
obviously it's not an allegory because

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.340
my local

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.650
before any I mean mean so clear it so
clear that bad it's so clear that the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.650
Bible is

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.310
a book that was written at a time before
the Enlightenment

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.370
before people really know anything about
the world and they were relegated to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.260
relying on superstitions and fairy tale
told by people to buy other people

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.110
through other people as a line it a game
a telephone down the line in the Bible

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.159
was even written in the time of Jesus

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.620
a and it show are and such

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.940
obvious fiction that for somebody like
Matthew heyyy

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.830
who lives in the year 2013 we have a
good explanation for a lot of these

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.140
things

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.650
friend to say 10 God said that a true
with the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.450
if man says it is false but

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.720
you have to just be totally dating
yourself to believe that
