00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.570
To enhance the drainage that we are building
here, we are going to lay a layer of porous

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:18.320
material and that can be anything. It could
be bulk mulch like you buy at the nursery

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.080
or it could be chipper material that you got.
Say if you trimmed some trees or something

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.840
like that and you had the trunks and things
that were chipped up. We want something that

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.079
is porous that will allow drainage down through
the material. We are just going to put a couple

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.739
of inches probably down to along right in
here, just an inch or so above the drainage

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.240
that we've already established. This will
take up the spaces between the sticks and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:59.090
stuff like that but still allow a very porous
and very aerated area. What I am going to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.611
be able to use since I don't have any chipper
material or bulk mulch, I am going to use,

00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:11.860
I do have some but I am not going to use it.
I have some shavings that is used as animal

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.740
bedding that for one reason or another I had
a little bit too much moisture in them when

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.670
they were originally packaged and so they
are not suitable because of the spores and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.299
that, that are in it to use as animal bedding.
What I am going to do is cut open this bag

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.780
and just dump them in there and you can see
that they are kind of clumped together which

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:48.189
is the problem. Once we get these in, we will
have the layer that we are looking for to

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:57.880
supply extra drainage without being compacted
easily on top of the materials that we have

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.630
for drainage. I can feel that there is quite
a bit of moisture in this particular material.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.720
It was put up probably for one reason or other
with a little too much moisture. Okay that

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.709
is probably what we are looking at. We are
going to spread it out and hope that it kind

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:25.959
of sifts down into the, it's pretty fluffy
but it is going to settle quite a bit. When

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.900
we get our top soil and all that on there,
we are going to probably mound it up a little

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.280
bit so that when we water it, it is going
to settle down. It is going to compress a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.620
little bit. But still this is pretty fluffy
stuff and it will allow for water to penetrate

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.980
without becoming compacted enough to stop
water penetration into our water system that

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.870
we have already established.
