00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Those who are afflicted with the Darksign live forever

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.520
locked in a constant state of death and revival

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.560
But immortality isn't seen as a blessing here

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.080
It's labeled a curse, and with good reason.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.820
Death is replaced by a form of insanity,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.740
a state where humanity is lost and the being becomes hollow.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.220
They no longer have the will to retain their humanity,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.960
to maintain their body, or their mind.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.300
Hollowing is a constant process but

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.140
a point of no return is reached,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.240
where humanity cannot be restored.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.280
We meet Oscar of Astora just before he reaches that point of no return.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.280
"I can feel it coming."

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.440
It's so easy to forget Oscar's role

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.080
but meeting him is arguably the most important thing that happens to you.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.680
Without him you would still be locked away.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.620
He goes to the trouble of finding a key to your cell.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.100
But why?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.800
Well there's a reason.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.200
"Thou who art Undead art chosen.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.260
In thine exodus from the Undead Asylum

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.840
maketh pilgrimage to the land of ancient lords.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.180
When thou ringeth the Bell of Awakening the fate of the Undead thou shalt know."

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200
This is a saying passed down through Oscar's family.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.880
But it's more than just a saying, it's clearly a prophecy.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.120
It says that the Undead who escapes the asylum

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.760
to the land of ancient lords

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.320
will learn the fate of the Undead,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.440
something humanity is desperate to know.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.100
This prophecy is why Oscar is in the asylum,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.860
because if he can leave the asylum

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.840
then perhaps he'll be included in the prophecy.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.840
And if he's a part of the prophecy

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.180
then he may become the one who's supposed to learn the fate of the Undead.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.980
But he can't be sure that it's him.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.460
There are hundreds of other undead

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.880
locked away in the asylum.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.620
So, while he's on the roof,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.020
he attempts to let Undead out of their cells

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.900
hoping to kickstart the prophecy.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.260
But there's something else on the roof.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.360
The Asylum Demon guards the prison.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.600
Have you ever wondered why you find Oscar dying in a closed cell?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.740
There's only one entrance,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.080
and that's a hole in the roof.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.720
He was smashed into this room by the Asylum Demon.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.680
"You are a Godsend to come at this moment, I wish to ask something of you.''

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.380
Oscar tells you the prophecy and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.900
hollows with the knowledge that you

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.860
might be the fated Undead to leave the Asylum.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.840
And he's right, you are.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.820
But what if Oscar had lived?

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.480
What if you had both left the asylum together?

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.540
''Please, come quickly. It is your fate.''

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.840
''A pleasure to meet you, sage Frampt has spoken to me about you.''

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.060
''I am Oscar of Astora, I wish to thank you for ringing the bell of awakening.''

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.780
''I am preparing to leave, I will follow sage Frampt's instructions,''

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.080
''and will seek Anor Londo by way of Sen's Fortress.''

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.420
''May we each fulfill our respective purposes, I hope that we meet again somewhere.''

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.560
''One day...''

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.480
If you believe the prophecy it means that either yourself or Oscar could be the chosen undead.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.240
Both of you meet the requirements, both of you left the asylum.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.800
But as time passes, it becomes more clear that you are the chosen undead, not Oscar.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.200
You're the one who rang the bells, and you're the one who meets the prophecy more strongly.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.240
''I cannot just stay here, I must find my own purpose.''

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.800
Every undead chases a purpose to keep themselves from hollowing.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.960
For Oscar it's different, he's searching for a purpose that's worthy of him,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.920
and this obsession is what will spell his tragic end.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.320
''Well, how long has it been?''

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.960
''Glad to see you safe, but be careful, you must be the same as I.''

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.600
''In search of the grave of Sir Artorias.''

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.800
''This forest is the territory if a fierce band of thieves.''

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.080
''They assault any and all who seek the graves. What if we were to join forces?''

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.480
''How about that? If we work together we may escape the bandits.''

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.640
''Does that appeal to you? Very well, let us keep our wits about us.''

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.960
''One can always do with another pair of eyes.''

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.920
''Things appear to have settled, I was right to partner with you.''

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.800
''I will have a short rest here, feel free to go on ahead.''

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.600
While both of you make it through the world, you triumph before Oscar,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.320
and succeed where it matters.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.120
And finally you make it to the kiln of the first flame,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.480
to either replace a dying god, or to finish him off.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.080
Whatever path you choose, Oscar chooses the opposite.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.920
Driven by a need to be important, he opposes either choice you make.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.760
Whether you finish off the dying god or leave the first flame to die...

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.520
''So it was you...''

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.120
''I had a feeling... I shall destroy you,''

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.400
''as fate has commanded me, foolish pawn of Darkstalker Kaathe,''

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200
''and fiendish dark lord.''

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.720
Perhaps you choose to replace this dying god, and rekindle the age of fire.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.040
''I have waited for thee, foolish slave of the gods,''

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.040
''and pawn of Frampt. I will kill you, and become the true dark lord.''

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.440
Whichever path you choose, Oscar opposes you in his desperation to be included in fate.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.520
A search for purpose is all that he has.
