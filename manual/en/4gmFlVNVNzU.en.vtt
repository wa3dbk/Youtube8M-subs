Hello! My name is Aaron Moon and I’m here
on behalf of expertvillage.com. Today we’ve

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:13.570
been discussing the floor tom and now I’d
like to demonstrate how to break it down and

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.520
how to pack it up. You’re going to need
to do this after a show, gigging out with

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.840
whoever you’re playing with or going from
practice space to practice space. Very simple

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:38.420
and pretty self explanatory, you’re just
going to loosen these legs up, take them out

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:49.579
one by one, I’ll do it here so you can see,
remember when you set the drum up you’re

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.829
going to want to tighten these up pretty tight
so that they don’t scoot out on you in the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.780
middle of a song or middle of practice that’s
embarrassing but it’s also not the best

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:17.189
for your drum. So now that we got the three
of those out you can either keep these in

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.840
a backpack I know some drummers have just
a separate hardware bag so you can keep those

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.950
in there, I have a backpack I’ll be put
in a little later. And this is just a case

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:42.270
for your floor tom, a lot of different brands
make tom cases and you know fairly affordable

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:54.060
and easy to find, it’s patted inside this
ensures that on the way to practice or on

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.299
the way to a gig rolling around in the back
of the van is not going to crack the shell,

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.369
it’s not going dent the rim, you really
want to invest in some nice cases so you’re

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:16.730
not hurting your drum. And you just place
it in like that, sometimes it gets caught

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:29.440
like that but you just lift it over, press
it down, put the top of it over and zip it

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:40.180
up and you should have a handle like this
so that you can lift it, carry it. Some bags

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:49.500
have entire straps and it looks like this,
it has a loop right here and a loop right

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.840
here which would facilitate a shoulder strap
something that will clip on but I just like

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:07.489
to rock with this, does the trick. So for
packing up your floor tom this is a wise decision

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.890
to invest in one of these, it’s going to
keep your drums safe, keep you drum playing

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.330
for as long as it’ll last. So those are
my packing up tips and thanks for joining

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.120
us and we’ll see you soon.
