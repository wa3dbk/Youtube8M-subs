00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.854
Among the many variants of cooking mushroom sauce, you can always choose the variant that your family like the most.

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:12.735
The most delicious mushroom sauce - made from dried mushrooms.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:17.700
And if it's porcini - simply yummy!

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.274
For this recipe, we need:

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:22.014
40 g of dried mushrooms,

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:25.274
50 g of butter, 1,5 tbsp of flour,

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:27.343
1 onion, water and salt to taste.

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:31.608
Other spices are not needed, because the dried mushrooms are enough saturated.

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:37.834
I pre-soak dried mushrooms for 2-3 hours in cold water.

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:41.000
Then I poured out the water and rinsed the mushrooms well.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.048
The mushrooms are soft.

00:00:44.048 --> 00:00:46.015
Now the mushrooms should be boiled.

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:51.050
I shift the mushrooms in the pan.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.375
Add the water.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:58.700
I will need later the mushroom broth for the sauce.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.900
Enough.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.535
Turn on the gas burner.

00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:08.994
If the ring is small, then on a big fire. If the ring is large - on middle.

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:13.900
Add salt to taste.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.300
I have 1/3 tbsp.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.000
Bring to a boil.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.900
Mushrooms boiled.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.500
Boil them for 15 minutes, then turn off the heat.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.715
It took 15 minutes.

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:34.354
Turn off the heat.

00:01:34.354 --> 00:01:39.354
I shift the mushrooms in a separate container.

00:01:39.354 --> 00:01:43.448
So they cool faster.

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:49.100
Don't pour out the mushroom broth. We will need it for the sauce.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.354
While the mushrooms are cooling, we are preparing the onions.

00:01:53.354 --> 00:02:00.935
We need to chop it and fry lightly on a vegetable oil.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.035
Pour a little vegetable oil on a heated pan.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.494
Add the onion.

00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:24.604
Cook it to transparency over medium heat.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.995
While the onion is frying, I am preparing the mushrooms.

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:32.100
I have to chop them.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.100
They have already cooled down.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.134
Cut it into pieces of arbitrary shape.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.294
Shift the mushrooms to the onions.

00:02:51.294 --> 00:02:55.575
The onions are already cooked.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.474
Stir.

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:05.054
Reduce the heat to a minimum.

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:10.500
Cooking for 5-7 minutes.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.967
Now flour.

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:22.954
I've already warmed the griller.

00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:25.000
Medium heat.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Place the flour. I have 1 tbsp.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.334
Fry it till the golden brown.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Do not forget about mushrooms: they have to be stirred.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.600
The flour acquired a creamy shade.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.900
Add the butter.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.000
Quickly stir.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.500
Griller gets too hot. Remove it from the heat.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.900
Quickly add the mushroom broth.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.522
Gradually add and stir.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.100
Sauce immediately becomes thick.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.300
So we try to knead well.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.243
Regulate by yourself a sauce density.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.900
If you add more broth, the sauce will be less thick.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.954
Don't forget: later we will need to add here mushrooms and onions.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.700
I will add all the broth.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.900
During cooking it will evaporate.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.054
We went out on the final stage.

00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:18.115
The sauce is boiled.

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:23.974
Shift the mushrooms.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.200
Boil all together for another 10 minutes.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.595
The sauce is ready!

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.875
Salt is not necessary, because I have earlier salted the broth with mushrooms.

00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:50.700
You can add a little pepper.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.000
Slightly, to taste.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.795
Turn off the heat.

00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:02.155
Cover with a lid.

00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:05.500
Leave the sauce with the lid on for 10 minutes.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.174
Fragrant mushroom sauce will be a great addition to various dishes.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.000
In my case - it's mashed potatoes.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.555
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.000
