This is how you play.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:15.542
You take your iron club and your ball

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:19.178
set your ball down, hold this,

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:23.160
very gently move it and let it,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.065

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.666

We have some leftover
candy from a birthday party

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:44.391
and I can't have it,

00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:46.220

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.439
- Thanks a lot.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.999
It looks delicious.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.554
Hmm picture Dan said
something about candy,

00:01:53.554 --> 00:01:54.793

00:01:54.793 --> 00:01:56.195
- Word of warning,

00:01:56.195 --> 00:02:00.382
try not to give him too
much sugar and goodies okay?

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:03.327
He gets a little hyper when you do.

00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:06.598
- Okay, bring him all the sweets?

00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:07.879
And goodies?

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.587
All right, got it.

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.613

00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:19.823

00:02:21.422 --> 00:02:22.499
So that was good.

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.023

00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:26.015

00:03:14.113 --> 00:03:15.500
