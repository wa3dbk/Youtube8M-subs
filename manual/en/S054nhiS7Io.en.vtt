00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.940
Hello there if you're watching this video
then you probably want to learn how people

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.810
make good source filmmaker videos.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.700
You see people like Zack Scott, James McVinnie.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.389
You see all of them making these amazing Source
Filmmaker animations then you try to make

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:31.180
an animation and it turns out like this.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.260
Don't worry it's a common problem.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.050
It's because there's a lot more to making
the Source Filmmaker video than just being

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.050
an animator.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:45.390
So what you need to do you need to name the
session SFM underscore automatic

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.690
Okay so this is very important its something
that has to be in there.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.960
So now you click the create button now you'll
see it has no map loaded.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.870
First you need to load a map.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.280
Now you can do that by pressing control and
l at the same time.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.210
Now you probably see all these complex things
in their videos.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.260
In all reality they're actually on black void.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.050
Now load black void and I will show you what
they actually do.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.210
Now once black void is loaded this is what
you have to do.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.130
A lot of these big guys say they do what they
like to call scenebuilding, when in all actuality

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.180
they do nothing.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.570
Now you see over here there's this little
line that's hidden.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.680
Valve left this for people they wanted to
know or discover.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.820
That little white line is actually my camera.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.280
Now you see, the camera on this map is a bit
weird.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.590
It defaults out in this little box here.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.761
So what you need to do is when you're in this
little box, you have to go to the animation

00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.800
set editor and create a new model.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.300
Now this model has to be under TF movies you
click on TF movies then scroll down.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.100
First click on the props_mining/rock_001.mdl
And if you scroll up to the top click box.mdl

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.510
Now this is empty.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.409
Nothing's appearing here there's a reason
for that.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.120
This was actually something special Valve
put in place.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.649
The model doesn't appear but it changes a
setting in the Source Filmmaker that makes

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.060
amazing things happen.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.470
Now once you've clicked on box.mdl, spawn
the model and Source Filmmaker may freeze

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.900
up for a second there.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.959
Nothing appears here.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.440
Now what you need to do is go into the element
viewer then click settings, movie settings,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.490
and as you can see, it says "sfm_make_film".

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.150
When I spawned the box after clicking the
rock it added in this setting into the element

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.430
viewer called sfm_make_film.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.840
What you have to do is click after sfm_make_film
and then go over and click this little checkbox

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840
here.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.770
This check box is what they don't want you
to know about.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.849
So let me just press it.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.550
So SFM will freeze up for a moment and now
as you can see it created my entire video

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.910
for me.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.220
Now this is something the big guys did not
want you to know about.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.380
It does everything.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.490
It animates the models, it makes up the idea,
it lights, it does everything.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.680
This is something they didn't want you to
know about, and now I let you know about it

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.650
so I'm going to have to go away now.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.280
They're probably gonna wanna kill me.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.570
See you later.
