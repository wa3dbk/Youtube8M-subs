Hello, hello everyone! Let's quickly get started!

00:00:15.238 --> 00:00:21.473
At first I put a primer on my entire face. With this foundation my skin will stay matte longer.

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:26.044
I put on top of the primer foundation.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:34.355
For more inspiration, you can cuddle with a cat and talk to it about life.

00:00:38.456 --> 00:00:43.692
Then I take powder and get rid of all the glitter on the face, and brighten the skin tone.

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:52.855
Yes, this happens sometimes. When he wants attention, he always gets it.

00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:58.294
With a brown pencil I draw eyebrows.

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:02.363
Guess who's here?

00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:11.007
Don't know what to do so just let him sit during lessons since I can put on makeup just like that.

00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:22.483
But when a cat doesn't know what it wants it then becomes complicated. And such awkward moments happen.

00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:33.295
Alright, I continue to draw the eyebrows.

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:44.049
Now I need the white shadows.

00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:47.265
I put them under the eyebrow and whole upper eyelid.

00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:56.353
Get rid of some with my finger and just like that paint the other eye.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:08.073
Now I take liquid black eyeliner with a hard brush and make quite thick arrows.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.824
And on the outer corners of the eyes do arrows thinner.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.308
Put on the white shadows on the lower eyelid.

00:02:20.594 --> 00:02:25.933
Now I take a pleasant shade of beige color that emphasizes the eyes.

00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:31.951
Put two layers of mascara

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.884
and a single layer on lower lashes.

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:42.784
Good.

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:52.217
Now I need the false eyelashes that I cut in half, and glue them on the outer corners of the eyes.

00:02:57.733 --> 00:02:59.733
I take blush with a highlighter.

00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:06.884
Put it on the cheekbones so that they are barely visible, and the face keeps its beautiful porcelain color.

00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:18.537
Now I need a red pencil, but first I brighten those areas of the lips that I won't paint.

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:23.758
I draw a shape of the upper lip and fill it in one tone.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:33.862
I draw the whole shape and re-fill it. Repeat the process until you get a desired result.

00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:41.202
I take the same shade of lipstick and add a little lip gloss, raze tone.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.046
Again use the light pencil to align the form.

00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:54.438
Brighten the lips with powder so that it looks even richer.

00:03:58.298 --> 00:04:00.993
With a liquid eyeliner draw a mole.

00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:12.737
I put on an ordinary wig, take hairpins, hairrights, twist it and fix all the pins.

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:16.455
You might also use some hairspray at the end, but I'm too lazy to do so.

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:22.120
Makeup is ready.

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:28.563
