00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.400
Okay so if you are lucky enough to find these
kinds of ribs there is usually no preparation

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.029
you can just dump them right into the bowl.
You can give them a little rinsing that wouldn't

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:22.609
hurt.
Whether not you broil them or grill them but

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:30.439
you do have to broil or grill them it doesn't
matter what cut of meat you use. But if you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:38.070
don't live near a butcher that cuts your short
ribs that way we are going to show you how

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.629
to deal with that. You are going to take the
meat side up, bones side down, and you are

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.359
going to split the short rib right down the
middle just like so and then what you are

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.649
going to do is take the inside which is a
little bit hard to see. But do you see all

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.789
that nice marble meat and then go half way
to the inside and cut about half way down.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:10.840
So basically you are butterflying the rib
out. You are going to that as well and you

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.960
can kind of fold it out as you are doing it
and then you are going to take all this nice

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:37.460
rib meat and score it.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.110
When you score it against the bone you can
really go deep you want it to still hold together

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.682
where the part off the bone. You also want
to score the back side you want to cut through

00:01:46.682 --> 00:02:07.859
this layer right here and sometimes a good
butcher would have already trim it off for

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:14.560
you. That is how you butterfly a short rib.
