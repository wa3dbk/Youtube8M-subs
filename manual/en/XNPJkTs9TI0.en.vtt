Hey everybody! My name is Matt and I'm speaking
to you on behalf of Expert Village. Okay,

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:10.280
so we've just uploaded our photos. Now what
we want to do is add a description and tags

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.680
to these. You can do it directly from here,
but I'm going to go up to click on the arrow

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.060
next to you click your photos. You should
see all the photos you've just uploaded. From

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.970
here, you can also add descriptions and tags.
Just click on one of the pictures and you

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.840
should get a screen like this. Up here you
can see this is the name of the photo that

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.780
you've uploaded. By default is the name of
the file. Just click here if you want and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.730
you can title it. I'm going to title it cake.
Then just go ahead and click save. Now the

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.530
name of this photo is cake. Now, if you come
down and put your cursor just below the picture,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.190
it'll click here to add a description. Just
go ahead and click there. I'm going to just

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:10.570
write a description. This is an anniversary
cake. Go down and click save. What this does

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.860
is when somebody runs a search for photos
to look at, what's in the description will

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.390
show up and help them find what they need
to find. When they see the picture this is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.619
what it will say underneath. Next, you're
going to want to add tags. Tags are basically

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.079
descriptive keywords. They also help other
users to search and find your pictures. If

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:48.130
this photo is tagged with cake and anniversary.
I'll write out. Go ahead and add that. Now

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.930
when somebody searches for cake and anniversary,
that will show up. Also, if you click on cake

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.479
it'll take you to this screen and it'll say
see all public photos tagged with cake, so

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:07.890
click there and it'll show you all the other
photos and the data base with the tags cake.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.660
This is really helpful to kind of organize
photos within the Flickr community. On other

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.340
websites, it's a web 2.0 standard and tags
can be very helpful.
