00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
[intro music]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
[water lapping]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Minnesota, we love our water.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.500
[heavy machinery]

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.000
But it's the water you don't see that may be our most precious

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and valuable resource.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.200
&gt;&gt;TONY: We've had wells where people have dumped oil, antifreeze,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.700
paint, we've found hypodermic needles in them.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.000
[water splashing]

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: More than 70% of Minnesotans depend on drinking water from a well.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Whether it's a large well serving a city

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.250
or a small well serving a home or cabin,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.200
all wells lead straight to aquifers beneath the surface.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.000
&gt;&gt;PATRICK: Some wells are over a 100 years old in Minnesota.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Patrick Sarafolean is a hydrologist with the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Minnesota Department of Health

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
specializing in well construction and sealing.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Well sealing must be done by a licensed well contractor

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.000
licensed by the state of Minnesota so well owners first point of contact

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
should be to a Minnesota licensed well contractor

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.500
to have a professional come and assess

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.500
the well and determine what's necessary to properly seal it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
and then to proceed and have the well sealed.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The good news is, people are taking action.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
&gt;&gt; RUSS: Of course the well was sitting over there

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500
and that corner of the house was sagging

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.500
way down and they had filled in a corner with cement.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000
&gt;&gt; RUSS: It was like a steel silo in there.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Homeowner Russ Baker knew he had a well

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500
when he bought his home in 1970.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
But he didn't think much of it until he received a letter

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
from the city urging him to seal it.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.000
State law requires the sealing of unused wells

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and knowing the threat it posed to the aquifer below,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.500
and the availability of grant dollars, it was an easy decision.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
&gt;&gt; RUSS: They came over right away and were very nice,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.000
they went down in the basement to get access to it,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
didn't have to drill a hole in the cement.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They went down in the basement

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.500
and they dropped a line down the well to see how deep it was.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.000
&gt;&gt; CONTRACTOR: Twelve to water.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
[mixer]

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A licensed contractor will pull the pump,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
measure the well,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.500
seal it with approved grout from the bottom up,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
and provide a certified well-sealing record

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500
in accordance with state law.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
Keep in mind, property owners are liable

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
for unused and unsealed wells.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.500
They can be a conduit for pollutants to reach the aquifer,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.500
and some larger wells can be a safety hazard to children and animals.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.500
It is estimated there are still more than a quarter million

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.000
unsealed wells in Minnesota.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.500
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: If the well has been cut off and buried and debris has been dumped in it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.500
it's going to cost a lot more to have it cleaned out and sealed

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.500
than it would to have a well sealed

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.000
that's intact that still has its cap on it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
[water running]

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Determining whether you have a well is pretty simple.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
If your house was built before city water was offered

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
then there's likely a well.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.500
&gt;&gt; RONALD: And we come around the corner and we see the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.500
infamous basement offset room.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:  Wells were often located in basement offset rooms.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.000
Does your basement floor have a concrete patch

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
or a pipe sticking out of it?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.500
&gt;&gt; RONALD: It happens to be underneath this step right here and he's redone the step.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Does an exterior step have a glass block

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
or concrete patch?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.500
Have you noticed a pipe sticking out of the ground in your yard?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500
These are all signs of a well

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.000
A licensed well contractor or health department specialist

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.500
can also help locate an abandoned well.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.000
Once you've located the well, take steps to get it sealed.  It's state law.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.500
&gt;&gt; RONALD: We're going to mix up some cement, and then we're going to pump the whole thing full.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.000
So we fill the well from the bottom up,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that way we're assured that the whole entire well is sealed.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Now is the time to act.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.000
Make a decision that will protect our water for years to come,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.500
for the people who love Minnesota's lakes, rivers and streams

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500
just as we do today.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.000
If you have an unsealed or abandoned well on your property,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
have a licensed well contractor seal it before it causes contamination.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Check with your county, watershed district or city

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to see if grant money is available to help pay a portion.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.500
Call the Minnesota Department of Health

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
