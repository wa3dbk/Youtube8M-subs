[Anthony] Hi I’m Anthony from Huppin’s
and I’ll be talking to you about Sony’s

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.000
NEX mirrorless interchangeable lens camera
system.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.981
The unique feature of the interchangeable
lens mirrorless system is the fact that it’s

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:23.820
lightweight and compact, similar to a point
and shoot, but it still gives you the high

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.119
quality of a traditional digital SLR.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.070
And because the lens is interchangeable it
allows you to pick the best lens for the job.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.710
The Sony NEX mirrorless camera system features
a sensor that is approximately 13 times larger

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.670
than what you’d find in a traditional point
and shoot.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.629
That larger sensor gives your superior low
light performance without sacrificing detail.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.019
The larger sensor also gives you the ability
to utilize shallower depth of field, this

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.559
could help you take more creative photos or
professional portraits.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:06.060
The Sony NEX 3 features a 14.2 high resolution
sensor, it also does 720p high definition

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.680
video, and up to 7 frames a second in still
mode.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.210
The Sony NEX 5 features a full metal body,
it also has a 14.2 high resolution sensor,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.960
it can shoot 1080 high definition video, and
in still mode up to 7 frames per second.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.930
The NEX C3 features a 16.2 high resolution
sensor and in burst mode can shoot 5 and a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.310
half frames a second, it can also shoot high
definition video.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.329
The Sony mirrorless NEX interchangeable lens
camera system features the E-mount this allows

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.219
you to use any E-mount lens on your camera
body.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.500
With Sony’s optional A to E mount adapter
you have access to Sony’s full line up of

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.789
A-mount lenses for your NEX camera body.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.549
All Sony NEX cameras feature a unique tiltable
screen, this allows you to easily take photos

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.840
and videos at different angles or to get rid
of glare from the sun.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.039
They also feature a dedicated HD video record
button allowing you to easily record high

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.840
definition videos.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.450
Another unique feature of the Sony NEX camera
system is the sweep panoramic mode, this allows

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.890
you to easily take high resolution panorama
photos, and you can do it in both a horizontal

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.390
mode or a vertical mode.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.840
With the simple press of a button you can
get on screen tips that give you expert advice

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.830
on how to take better photographs.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.590
