00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.099
When you think of Volvo what's the first thing
that comes to mind?

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.150
Well it's probably either safety or station
wagons.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.590
But the current generation S60 sedan has really
opened up the brand to more than just those

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.890
hallmarks.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.259
And with the all new V60, Volvo also delivers
performance, technology and a new Swedish

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.259
style.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.890
Though the station wagon is a popular bodystyle
in Europe, automakers introduce them to the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.660
States with trepidation.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.550
Rumor has it that Americans prefer the look
of an honest to goodness sedan.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.000
But that perception is changing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.149
Though you’ll hear euphemisms such as Sportback,
and Sports Wagon to describe these utilitarian

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.980
rides, the basic premise of the old fashioned
station wagon remains; you can put more into

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.980
it.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.590
But unlike the boxes of the past, cars like
this V60 infuse curves and athleticism, and

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.309
often come in a much smaller footprint.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.780
The diminutive V60 is the first Volvo to offer
the brand’s Drive-E technology.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.470
Similar to Mazda’s SkyActiv approach to
improved efficiency, this car is powered by

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.549
a 2.0-liter direct-injected turbo-4 making
240 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.030
mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.610
There’s a start-stop feature that’s pleasantly
smooth compared to similar systems and a new

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.340
ECO+ mode that optimizes shift points, engine
control and throttle response.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.700
When activated, it can improve gas mileage
by 5% by also tweaking the start/stop system,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.250
allowing the car to coast farther in certain
situations and deactivating the A/C compressor.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.060
A new electrical power assist steering system
chips in, too.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.070
The result is impressive mileage; 25mpg city/37mpg
highway and that’s on regular unleaded.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.990
The V60 comes in 8 trim levels with 3 engine
options with all but the Drive-E models available

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.810
with all-wheel drive.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.459
Pricing starts at $36,675 while this mid-trim
T5 Drive-E Premier adds leather seats, navigation,

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.549
a brilliant new digital gauge cluster, silver
bright work and special 17” wheels.

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.850
My car contributes a wide range of optional
equipment, most notably these Sport Seats

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.730
which harness Volvo’s hallmark comfort,
heated front and rear seats, a heated steering

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.769
wheel and heated windshield a la Land Rover…so
if you’re sensitive to looking through little

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.609
squiggly lines, forgo the Climate Package.

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.730
The City Safety collision avoidance system
is standard while the Blind Spot Information

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.390
System Package adds cross traffic alert, a
lane change merge aid and front and rear park

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.390
assist.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.470
Total cost as seen here is $43,575.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:59.610
Debuting on this 2015.5 model is Volvo On
Call...a new 3G-based telematics system that

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.320
works in conjunction with Sensus Connect.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.500
With both you get cloud-based apps, an Internet
browser and a Wi-Fi hotspot.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.960
But my favorite feature is the On Call smartphone
app that allows me to remotely start the car,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.590
check my Volvos location and the outside temperature
near the vehicle.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.450
A 6 month complimentary subscription is standard.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.880
Volvo takes a different approach to interacting
with all of these connected features using

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.060
either a knob on the waterfall console or
while driving, by using an intuitive scroll

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.170
wheel and button on the right side of the
steering wheel.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.230
Though a faster 4G connection would have been
the way to go, the system overall works nicely

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.650
but albeit a little slow and looks just as
good.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.100
Configuring the theme of the electronics from
elegance, to eco to sport gives the cabin

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.060
tailored look.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.510
I've really enjoyed my week with the V60.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.810
Volvo has come a long way in recent years
reinvigorating themselves in the premium segment.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.150
This wagon variant of the S60 delivers the
same excitable performance as its 4-door counterpart

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.510
in a package with added versatility.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.930
The turbo and 8-speed are a refined and powerful
combination, the ride quality is Volvo sumptuous

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.329
and the new tech looks great.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.299
It's pricey but this is a car I could see
myself owning and being very happy with.

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.100
A 0-to-60mph time of 6.1-seconds gives you
a very quick little wagon that’s engaging

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.310
to drive yet perfectly Volvo compliant.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.980
Even without the optional sport chassis and
the turbo’s overboost power hitting the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.480
front wheels, the V60 is a car you want to
drive.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.510
I wish Volvo could spice up the dowdy front
fascia to match the attractiveness of the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.060
rest of the body and this interior, awash
in off-black surfaces sullies an otherwise

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.580
smart cabin.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.230
But the V60 will change your opinion of what
a station wagon can be.
