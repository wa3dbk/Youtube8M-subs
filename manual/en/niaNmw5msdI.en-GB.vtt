00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.540
We can first start by placing the legs on  plate by tilting over their sides...

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
Longest wire connects two clips together...

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.020
Corner pulleys have one half route on them to glide the wire on the routes...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.640
Middle length wire comes from the opposite corner to pulley and it has a wire ends with dents on it...

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.100
Spool is placed on the opposite side of rails...

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.140
Spool's dent side needs to stay up, and we need to start winding up from the hole on bottom side first...

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.200
Make sure not to cross over the routes of the spool...

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.720
In order to mechanism function properly, the springs should be compressed fully...

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.060
We can fix the electric motor on top of the spool and secure it with screws...

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.120
Screw holes are on the rail side...
