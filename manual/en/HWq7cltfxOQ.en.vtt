[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.430
HARRY CHEADLE: Everyone I know
reveres Louis C.K. even though

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.470
he's a fat, bald, middle-aged
dude who talks

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.480
about his dick on stage.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.340
That's the great thing about
stand-up comedy.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.400
All that matters is that
you make people laugh.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.230
And like a lot of people who
think they're funny, I've

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.900
always believed that maybe I
could do stand up, too, if I

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.060
only took a shot at it.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.440
That was my first mistake.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.550
My name is Harry, and
I've been a loser

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.890
for most of my life.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.130
I thought I was done with my
awkward phase when Vice hired

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.770
me to write about politics,
culture, and other important

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.260
world affairs which should make
me cool, but it doesn't.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.570
I'm still just a weird kid
who creeps people out.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.375
This is "All Around Losing"
with Harry Cheadle.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.814
So I'm out here in front of the
Sidewalk Cafe where they

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.330
have an open mic every night.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.460
I am incredibly nervous
right now.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.250
I've written my set
list on my hand.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.260
As you can see, it goes
from porn to sex-ed to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.560
Obama at the end.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.400
And I don't think this is going
to go well, but I'm also

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.880
confident this is going to go
well because I'm just a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.120
massive contradiction.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.470
But here I go.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.535
-Make some noise for Harry
as he comes to stage.

00:01:29.138 --> 00:01:30.970
HARRY CHEADLE: You guys are
really attractive out there.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.180
The terrifying part of doing
stand-up is when you get to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.090
the punch lines.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.080
Are people going to laugh?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.120
Are they going to boo?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.910
Are they going to know I have
no business being on stage?

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.490
There almost has to be something
wrong with you to

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.860
expose yourself to a situation
like that.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.180
But surprisingly, the crowd at
the Sidewalk laughed at all

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.890
the right times.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.290
HARRY CHEADLE: Sex is gross.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.600
Sex is just the two weirdest
parts of your body just

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.052
colliding over and over.

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:52.842
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:55.120
HARRY CHEADLE: If I went back
in time and talked to my

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.290
11-year-old self about the sex
I was having, he'd be like,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.985
that's gross.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.600
And he'd be right, and I think
I'd probably go to jail for

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.330
talking to an 11-year-old
about sex anyway.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.022
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:07.950
Even the guy who heckled
me was polite.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.720
I will, and I have a whole
bunch of jokes about sex.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.450
I don't know.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.771
I guess I'm going to keep going
on with the jokes I have

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.735
in my head, if you don't mind.

00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:27.330
Oh yeah, let me talk more
about sex for a second.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.800
Maybe I was just good at this?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.974
Thanks, you guys have
been great.

00:02:29.974 --> 00:02:33.383
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:33.870
-Harry.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.818
It's his first time,
everybody.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.590
HARRY CHEADLE: I didn't do too
badly my first time on stage

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.130
which was surprising because I
blacked out and have no memory

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.770
of the experience whatsoever.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.185
When I came to, it was already
time for my second show at Cha

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:50.920
Cha's Comedy Club.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.110
On my way inside, I ran into Cha
Cha himself, a spherical,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.130
Hawaiian-shirted, comedy
guru who's been in the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.635
business for decades.

00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:00.420
CHA CHA: How long you've
been doing this?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.450
HARRY CHEADLE: I've been doing
like a week, honestly.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.929
CHA CHA: A week, right?

00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:37.162
-Please put your hands together
and welcome to the

00:03:37.162 --> 00:03:38.412
stage Harry Cheadle.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.960
HARRY CHEADLE: When I have sex
it's like I'm a blind man in a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.810
bouncy castle trying
to kill a frog.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.660
It's not clear how that blind
man got in that situation,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.440
like it doesn't make any sense,
like why is he here.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.097
He doesn't have the skills
or the tools necessary to

00:03:57.097 --> 00:04:00.250
complete this task.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.590
There are people out there who
say like, oh, sex is this

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.030
great, spiritual, life-affirming
thing.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.270
Those people have not had sex
with me because when I have

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.120
sex it's not a spiritual
experience.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.440
My second time out,
I died on stage.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.779
Though actually dying is
probably way less painful than

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.870
what I went through.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.910
All Cha Cha's Strom Thurmond
style comedy coaching did was

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.910
distract me with thoughts
of Mexican whorehouses.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.350
Before I did this again, I
would need to get drunk,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.010
really drunk.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.910
I've heard that alcohol is
supposed to make you more

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.530
confident, but instead, eh,
fuck, let me try that again.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.950
Have you heard that alcohol
is a good way

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.330
to calm your nerves?

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.580
It's not.

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.024
-Let's everyone please
give a warm welcome

00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:47.274
to Mr. Harry Cheadle.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.520
HARRY CHEADLE: So you guys are
really attractive for the open

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.980
mic audience, anyway.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.500
Oops, I'm gonna take
this mic off.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.790
The worst thing isn't
not getting a laugh.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.970
Who's going to get
laid tonight?

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.220
Anyone?

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.420
This is going to
go really bad.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.680
The worst thing is knowing that
everyone out there knew

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.090
you were trying to get a laugh,
and that you failed,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.540
and that you're not funny.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.100
Sex is disgusting.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.080
I'll wiggle it around
in there for awhile.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.740
And like, oh yeah, that sounds
great, let do that.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.820
And that's awesome.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.530
Actually, the worst
thing is that you

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.760
keep going after that.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.490
This sex material is terrible.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.585
That was my impression
of trying to do

00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:33.560
sex material, everybody.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.472
It failed.

00:05:35.472 --> 00:05:36.500
That was good.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.590
Someone liked my material
on bombing.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.980
Yeah, let me just talk more
about how bad I suck.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.170
That would be great.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.590
Man, you know, always.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.136
And then but women, man.

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:55.240
Yeah, that stills needs
a little bit of work.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.830
Thank you, guys.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.180
You've been great.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.330
The best part is when
it's finally over.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.200
-Alright, Harry Cheadle,
everybody.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.660
HARRY CHEADLE: This stuff
is the most difficult

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.500
thing I've ever done.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.960
And if anyone can get any laugh
from anybody in front of

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.050
a crowd, that's like amazing.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.970
And anyone who does it for
a long time deserves your

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.030
respect or your pity,
I don't know which.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.280
Jesus Christ.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:30.810
