00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.980
Ho Ho
When it's Christmas time

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.680
everybody's waitin' in a big ass line
To sit on my lap

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.440
And beg for Elmo's, i-pads, and crap
Brats are outta control

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.480
my elves are doing nothing but shovelin' coal
Older girls sit on me

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.080
And get their picture taken ironically
Girl look at that belly

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.920
Like a bowl full of jelly
As seen on the telly

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.400
It sticks out
I come down your chimney

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.600
Though it don't quite fit me
Why do I smell kindling?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.160
Put it out
My doctor told me I had diabetes

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.700
That's what happens when you eat a hundred billion cookies
I still deliver all this booty

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.560
It don't matter if its drizzling, freezing, sleeting, blowin, snowin'
I'm Santa and I know it

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:08.080
I'm Santa and I know it
I got a big ole gut

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.040
I ain't nutcracker but do bust nuts
Girls love the taste

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.540
Of my sugarplums and my candy cane
I got a list of naughty's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.440
It's pretty much a listing of all my shawty's
Wait Let me explain it

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.220
Mrs. Claus and I have a special arrangement
I'm jolly and burely

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.820
I never come early
I'm stuffin' your turkey

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.540
Check it out
When ladies get nippy

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
I'm makin' deliverys
From Dallas to Sydney

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.380
Then I'm out
Single moms are friendly

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.580
Every X-mas eve
When the night comes to and end my sack is always empty

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:51.600
Got a 9 inch beard, and I ain't afraid to grow it blow it show it comb it, stroke it
I'm Santa and I Know it

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.760
Jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle bells
Tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle  elves

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.340
Comet Cupid donner blitzen Rudolph sail
I'm Santa and I know it
