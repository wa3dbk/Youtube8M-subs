00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:54.019
Mr Jon Faine, Master of Ceremonies/Moderator - RMIT University.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.782
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to RMIT University. We're in the former

00:00:56.782 --> 00:01:02.100
magistrates' Court under the very canopy where in 1880 Justice Redmond Barry sentenced

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.415
to death a man who has gone on to become an Australian legend and I speak

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:10.293
of course about Ned Kelly. Welcome to the audience here in the court at

00:01:10.293 --> 00:01:14.019
Federation Square on the big screen and on Channel 31.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:18.169
Kelly went to the gallows just around the corner at the old Melbourne Gaol.

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:22.290
The gaol and this building on the corner of Russell and La Trobe Streets form part of the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.771
National Trust's justice precinct. Now, Ned Kelly's corpse had scarcely settled in

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:33.009
its grave when Melbourne philanthropist Francis Ormond made a public commitment

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.462
to help fund what was called then a Working Men's College. That college, known today as

00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:44.020
RMIT University, opened here at La Trobe Street in 1887, less than seven

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.452
years after Ned Kelly was executed.

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:51.770
Now if the demise of the Kelly Gang marked the end of Victoria's frontier period

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.170
the opening of the college could be said to herald a new era, an era of sober prosperity

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.000
here for Melbourne. Which raises the question that brings us here today, if Kelly had been caught,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.745
sentenced and then hung around seven years later would he actually have needed to

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:15.020
have been executed? To put it another way, if the young Kelly had had the opportunity

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.460
of an education at the Working Men's College would his burning sense of injustice as well as

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.454
his practical and political skills have been put to a different and better use.

00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:31.833
For Ned was it a case of better read than dead.

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:38.291
Today, this debate is being streamed live to Federation Square and simulcast on Channel 31. I'm Jon Faine from the ABC.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:43.013

Manufacturing Workers Union and I invite you, the audience, to be the judge.

00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:26.210
Would Ned Kelly have been hanged if instead he had been educated? Simon Brown-Greaves,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.623
you're one of Australia's leading forensic psychologists with a history of dealing with

00:03:29.623 --> 00:03:34.320
and profiling some of Australia's more interesting and troubled criminal minds, from what

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.654
you know, what we all know of Ned Kelly and his background give us a profiling, if you could,

00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:42.116
of the type of man that Ned was. Did this environment that he lived in contribute

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:46.972
to his life of crime? Did he have a predisposition to murder and rob?

00:03:46.972 --> 00:03:47.971
Mr Simon Brown-Greaves, Forensic Psychologist.

00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:54.453
Thanks, Jon. Given what we know now and looking back and speculating as we must, Ned Kelly

00:03:54.453 --> 00:03:57.862
certainly appeared to be a man who was a product of his context, his environment

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:03.129
and his time and I have to say, in terms of the fundamental thesis, had he received a

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.281
strong and solid education would that have perhaps led to a different outcome? Absolutely.

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:12.724
Verity Burgmann, how educated were people in those times?

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:13.886
Professor Verity Burgmann, Australian Historian and Author, University of Melbourne.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:17.928
Well, in 1861 only about half of school-aged children could read and write.

00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:23.488
In 1872 the situation started to improve when free compulsory and secular education

00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:28.292
was introduced in Victoria and over the next three years 600 schools were built.

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:35.696
However, by this time poor Ned was 18, so he missed out on this very, very, very progressive

00:04:35.696 --> 00:04:36.664
development.

00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:39.238
So what extent was he just a product of his time?

00:04:39.238 --> 00:04:42.902
He was very much a product of his times. He actually had several years' education,

00:04:42.902 --> 00:04:47.565
he passed reading and writing but he failed arithmetic, grammar and geography

00:04:47.565 --> 00:04:53.152
and if you read what Ned wrote you can certainly see that he was not a role model

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:55.714
when it comes to use of grammar and punctuation.

00:04:55.714 --> 00:04:58.840
Although it raises the question whether Ned wrote what Ned has said to have written.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.486
Oh, I think he did. It was transcribed by Joe Burn, who was slightly better educated but he was very,

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:10.234
very much a product of his time in that he was one of the many people who were, after the

00:05:10.234 --> 00:05:16.959
gold rushes had ended, desperately needing to make a livelihood and he was

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:21.794
really a victim of what must be described as the biggest public policy stuff up in Australian

00:05:21.794 --> 00:05:27.401
history, the Selection Acts. These were designed to settle people like Ned and his family

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:31.984
on the land to break up the monopoly of land held by the squatters and,

00:05:31.984 --> 00:05:34.050
in fact, they had exactly the opposite effect.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.422
Yes.

00:05:34.422 --> 00:05:41.402
Between 1860 and 1863 of the 1.8 million acres taken up for selection 1.6 million

00:05:41.402 --> 00:05:46.758
went to squatters because they manipulated the system, they put up dummies,

00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:49.532
they basically got round the regulations.

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:53.453
A great land grab. Margaret Gardner, what does RMIT University offer that might have

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.865
appealed to someone like Ned?

00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:56.915
Professor Margaret Gardner AO, Vice-Chancellor and President, RMIT University

00:05:56.915 --> 00:06:00.682
Well, what it offered then was quite a big choice of subjects and a lot of people

00:06:00.682 --> 00:06:07.722
came to RMIT when it opened in the ... in 1887 to pick up the sort of education they had

00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:11.704
missed out on in earlier years, so although some people came at age 15 there were people

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:16.950
who came who were much older and they picked up the maths, the algebra, the writing

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:23.482
skills. In fact, a lot of the skills that then took them on to other ... to other qualifications but he could

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:29.040
have also ... he could have started ... he could have started in art, he could have started in architecture,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.204
he could have ... he could have begun in metalworking, he could have begun in many

00:06:34.204 --> 00:06:37.917
things in 1887 at the Working Men's College.

00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:41.034
And, Lex Lasry, did he get a fair trial?

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:44.997
Well, Jon, that's been debated now for a long time and of course for lawyers in the modern

00:06:44.997 --> 00:06:49.075
day looking at Ned Kelly's trial the idea that a murder trial can be conducted in a day

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:55.789
and a bit and be fair is almost beyond comprehension and of course he was represented

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:00.235
by a barrister who'd never done a criminal trial before, who was sent up here to get

00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:05.964
an adjournment so that someone with some experience could run the case for him

00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:09.996
and of course Redmond Barry declined the adjournment and made the case run.

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.198
No, it wasn't a fair trial.

00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:15.282
Well we'll see exactly whether or not the outcome could ever have been different as we resume

00:07:15.282 --> 00:07:20.676
our discussion about Ned Kelly, Better Read Than Dead, and may education have made a difference

00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:24.256
to Ned Kelly on Channel 31 at Federation Square and here at the

00:07:24.256 --> 99:59:59.999
Melbourne Magistrates' Court in just a moment.
