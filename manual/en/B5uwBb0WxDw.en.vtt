Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village. Perhaps one of

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.619
the simplest ways to decorate your rain stick
is to simply paint it. You can paint it all

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:24.119
one color. You can paint it many colors. As
you're painting your rain stick, if you're

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.630
using a paper towel tube or another tube that
is not completely smooth or color free, you

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.129
might want to make more than one coat of paint
to cover up some of those stripes. Another

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.800
thing that's really fun to do, before you
paint your rain stick, is to take a nice flat

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.660
rubber band, perhaps a little bit wider, yeah,
a little bit wider and a little bit smaller

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.780
around than this one and put it around your
rain stick several places, so that as you

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.210
paint your rain stick, you're not painting
the spot where the rubber band was. Once you've

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.410
painted your rain stick all the way around,
you're going to want to let it dry, and then

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.900
you can put designs on the rain stick that
you have painted. There are a variety of different

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.020
ways to do this as well. One thing I like
to do is to use sponges. I like the texture

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.481
that they have, and I like the feel that they
give when they put on the paint. One way you

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:27.650
can use a sponge is to take one that already
has its own shape, such as the saguaro cactus,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.281
which may be a little bit large for this rain
stick, but it would be great for my rain stick

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:39.820
that is make out of a mailing tube. I put
a little bit of paint on my pallet, take my

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:54.950
saguaro sponge, put it in my paint, and then
carefully wrap it around on to my rain stick,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.720
and I have my saguaro. Another thing that
you can do is just take a plain sponge, it

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.110
has a lot of little holes in it and just put
it in a little paint and then dab it off so

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.920
you that don't have a lot, maybe mix your
colors a little bit. And then, just dab it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:27.560
on, and you kind of have a design that mixes
your different colors of paint. You can use

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:36.210
a repeating design. You can use a design that
is unique and one of a kind. Y you might have

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.310
one main design that is the stand out design.
You can also use your sponge to continue to

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.870
paint your rain stick, and you don't even
need to paint it with a base coat. If you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.230
just go over it enough times so that you've
covered what's left of the cardboard tube.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.430
Once it's dry, then, always a nice finish
is to have something to wrap around it, whether

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.120
it's yarn or jude or something at the end
to tie it and leave some strings hanging.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:12.670
As soon as it's dry, cap your end, fill your
tube, cap your end, and listen to your brand

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.650
new rain stick.
