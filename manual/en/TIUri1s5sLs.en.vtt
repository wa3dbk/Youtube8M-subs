00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:15.099
Houston and Moskva, and all of the control centres around the world,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.966
from the crew here on board the International Space Station,

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.599
after having served through Expedition 35,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:31.733
it is time to hand over the command of the spaceship to the Expedition 36 crew.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:40.699
When originally thinking about the responsibility of command, I had three objectives.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.533
Number one was the health of the crew – to maintain a healthy group of people here on board.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:51.899
My second was the health of the spaceship itself

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.200
– to spend our months here and, at the end of it, to be able to provide the next crew

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.600
– the oncoming astronauts and cosmonauts – with a functioning and healthy spaceship.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.600
And third was to use this international orbiting laboratory,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.166
this orbiting research vessel, for what it’s for.

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:15.632
And that was to get as much science and utilization done as possible.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:21.433
I can very proudly say that all three have been accomplished in space.

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:27.966
The crew is healthy and happy, and I think any of us would come back, given the opportunity.

00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:31.966
The spaceship is in good shape, and I’ll talk about that in a minute.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:36.632
And, on the science side, because of a tremendous amount of work on board

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:42.099
but a much larger amount of work in all of the control centres and universities

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.100
and businesses around the world that are using the International Space Station.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.433
We set a record for utilization

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:52.899
– the amount of time that is spent and the amount of research done

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.566
in our tenure here on board as Expedition 35.

00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:02.966
But for me, it really all came together in the last three days.

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:09.766
Pavel came to me – Pavel Vladimirovich Vinogradov came to me three days ago and said,

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:16.732
“Chris, I see something out the window. It looks like little sparks or little fireworks.” 

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:23.333
And we went over to the window and looked and saw that the Space Station was leaking something out to space.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:30.133
And had a good look at it, realized that something had gotten worse, talked to Houston.

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:33.733
They looked deeply into their data and saw that we in fact had an ammonia leak

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:35.666
– a very serious problem.

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:42.232
And in an unprecedented display of competence and confidence on the ground,

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:49.699
put together a plan for Chris and Tom to go outside in – gosh, in a record amount of time.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.966
In a day and a half, they were outside.

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:57.632
And the real-time execution of that was what just felt so good to me as commander of this crew.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:01.433
To have Pavel in there helping me [inaudible];

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:06.099
Chris and Tom so ready, even on short notice, to go outside and do something

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.100
that has a high level of danger and extremely complex;

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.933
Sasha was helping… learning the OJT of how an American EVA looks

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:19.299
after having participated in the Russian EVA earlier, helping those guys get out.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.400
And then Roman meanwhile, we have a Soyuz undocking tomorrow!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.866
And meanwhile, Roman is getting that spaceship ready.

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:32.132
All that going on simultaneously so that we could go outside successfully, execute an EVA

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:35.299
and, in fact, as indications are right now,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.200
stop the leak and leave the spaceship even healthier than it was.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.566
So for me, my initial objectives, my dreams for how this might go

00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:49.232
and the realization of what this crew can do together as a group of six men

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:50.699
from all around the planet

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.233
– but what all of those control centres all around the planet can do.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:59.233
For me, this was just a personification of what the International Space Station is 

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:00.766
and what the people mean to it.

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:03.632
This is a human research vessel.

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:06.266
We’ve shared it with millions of people around the world,

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:10.266
and we’ve done our absolute best to accomplish the work on board.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:17.166
And, with that, I would like to pass the microphone to Pavel to say a few words

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:23.632
and then [speaks Russian]  I will give control of the Space Station to Pavel. [speaks Russian] 

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:26.633
Maybe a few words, if you will.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:31.366
[speaks Russian]

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:37.899
We really had a wonderful crew, 35 Increment crew.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:50.100
It is a sad day today to realize that the crew actually is divided into two – 35 and 36 Increment.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.700
The guys are wonderful.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.633
You know, we work together so well.

00:04:55.633 --> 00:05:02.233
Each of them can substitute for another and it’s the strength of our crew in it.

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:06.233
Until now it was one unified crew.

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:08.266
This is the most important thing.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.999
I think we will miss you badly, guys.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.300
[speaks Russian]

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.000
Same here, same here. Thank you, Pavel.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.500
So, from this young Canadian kid’s dreams to be realized to command a spaceship,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.866
on behalf of everybody at the Canadian Space Agency

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:30.432
and the International Space Station program that trusted us to do our job right,

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:32.233
[speaks Russian].

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:44.866
And so I pass command of the International Space Station to Pavel Vladimirovich Vinogradov.

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:46.832
Congratulations.

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:47.766
[speaks Russian]

00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:53.032
Thank you. I accept the command of the Station.

00:05:53.033 --> 00:06:00.033
We will look after it as much and as carefully as all the predecessors and the previous crew.

00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:03.433
And we wish you good luck to our guys tomorrow.

00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:05.266
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:07.599
You guys are now prime crew!

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.266
Prime crew!

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:11.999
Prime crew, now!

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.133
And Houston, that’s the official demarcation that the end of Expedition 35… again,

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:27.966
enormous thanks to everybody on Earth that makes this possible.

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:30.199
It’s been a very special time for us on board.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.133
Thank you very much.

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:36.733
Expedition 35, International Space Station is a fine ship.

00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:38.666
You have an amazing ground team, but

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:43.332
you, the crew of Expedition 35, have been nothing short of tremendous.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:46.399
Not only have the efforts of Expedition 35 been extraordinary,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.433
but you’ve managed to bring us all along with you on your space odyssey.

00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:52.699
And for that, we thank you.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.466
And Chris, as a fellow Canadian, I’d like to say thank you on behalf of Canada.

00:06:57.466 --> 00:07:00.232
We’re extremely proud of you and your efforts.

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:07.833
You have fueled a new appreciation for what the challenges of space exploration have to do and have to offer our planet.

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:11.233
Your leadership has been an example to all of us,

00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:17.199
and your extraordinary efforts to share space with us have inspired us to look back upon our planet, Spaceship Earth,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.000
with a new perspective and respect.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Canada is most certainly indebted to you for your tireless efforts.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.633
To you and your crew, Commander Hadfield, we thank you.

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:32.266
[speaks Russian] Pavel, Vladimir, Mirovich…

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:35.566
[speaks Russian]

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.233
[speaks Russian] Thank you very much.

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:42.899
Merci beaucoup.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.533
Jeremy, thank you – thanks a lot.

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:46.266
We really appreciate it.
