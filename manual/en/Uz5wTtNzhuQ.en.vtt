Hi this Julie with Beadaholique.com and today
I want to show you how to use ribbon crimp

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.400
ends to finish your SilverSilk

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
Right here I have flat SilverSilk. This is
4.8mm across. It does

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.329
come in the other colors and also comes
with a ball chain embedded in it.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.199
We have another video on Beadaholique.com showing how to finish those ends

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.149
for this one I want to show you how to
just really quickly and easily use these

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.559
great ribbon crimps

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:34.780
to finish the end

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.520
and we're going to do a quick project and show you how really it is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.780
to do a necklace

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.659
You're going to want to make sure your ends are even and they don't have a lot of straggly little

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.540
piece of wire. This is all wire. It's very flexible

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.600
which is nice

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.560
you don't want to use scissors. You want to use flush cutters

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.850
and just trim the end

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.370
I want to make sure that both look good

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.370
Then we're going to use some E6000 glue

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.320
I just put a little on a post-it

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.750
I'm going to dip the actual end of the
SilverSilk

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.850
into the E6000

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.410
and then I'm going to inserted it into the
ribbon crimp end

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.210
all the way to the back

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.439
I wanna make sure

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:34.439
it stays straight

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.090
hold it

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.900
make sure that it doesn't wiggle too much

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.800
then I'm going to carefully use my nylon chain pliers

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.800
to crimp the ribbon crimp

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.710
so that side is complete, you can see
it's sandwiched in there

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.689
if you look at these ribbon crimps they
actually have little

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.859
tiny teeth on one side which is gonna
help grip

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.749
and one tip to make it a little bit easier
when you're attaching the SilverSilk in

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.489
there, go ahead and just pre-crimp

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.699
it a little bit so that you;ll have a
little bit less that you have to

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.179
crimp while the SilverSilk is in there

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:31.179
Again dip my end into the E6000

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.930
put it in there

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.589
nylon jaw pliers

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:50.059
going from the side

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:52.949
and crimp

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.769
We've got that trapped in there

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.629
both ends are now finished

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.249
so I'm going to attach

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.209
a clasp. I'm going to do that

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.659
by just opening up a 4mm
jump ring

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.479
putting in a 7mm
jump ring

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:20.119
I'm going to connect this to one end of my ribbon crimp

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:25.399
close it

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:29.759
on the other end I'm going to do the same thing but with a lobster clasp instead of a larger

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:36.759
jump ring

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.789
okay so we actually now have

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.529
a finished necklace

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.449
You could just hang a pendant from here if you wanted

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.219
make a lovely chain

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.919
but you can also

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.299
very easily tie a lark's head knot around a pendant

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.549
and have it attached that way. I have a

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.169
lovely swarovski elements victory. It's one of their
newer creations 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.339
I'm going to divide my necklace in half

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.879
I'm going to take the folded over end

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.559
put it through the hole in the pendant

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.799
and then I'm going to pull my tails
through

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.829
there we go

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.219
pull down

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.470
that is now secure

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.789
Now you have a way of attaching a pendant

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.439
and that's called a larks head knot we actually do have a video on that as well

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.560
on Beadaholique.com if you want to see that a little bit

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.389
slower

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.740
we have just finished a necklace
with a very pretty pendant

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.870
using SilverSilk and finishing the ends

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.050
with these great little ribbon covers and attaching a clasp

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.959
to their end loop

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.659
so i hope you enjoy this video

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.279
