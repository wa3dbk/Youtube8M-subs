00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.760
Hey Doc, we got problems man I need to call command.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.220
Hello?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.300
Earth to Doc.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.380
I mean this place to Doc.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Don't you wanna say hello to our new friend?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.900
What?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.340
Honk.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.940
I don't... I ca.. I can't... I can't... I don't... this is...

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.000
Take your time, this a big moment

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Blarg.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.800
I can't deal with this right now.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.460
Honk.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.660
Shut up you're disgusting.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.000
Doc what is Vic's number?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.500
What for?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.440
For reinforcements.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.620
Wait, unless you've had like specialized combat training in the last ten minutes.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.120
Er.. nope.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.740
Then yeah reinforcements.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.480
Well, I did just change a dirty diaper.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.460
That doesn't count.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.480
I don't know, it was a real doozy.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.180
Number two.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.900
Doc focus, Vic's number, what is it?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.740
Come on Church, everybody remembers Vic's number

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.420
Didn't he ever teach you the song?

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.060
Oh right, Vic's jingle.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700
If you want to talk don't email

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.660
And don't you click click click click

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.840
Just call me up at 555-VICK

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.140
You know, it probably would've been more memorable if it rhymed.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.500
Or if his name actually ended in a K

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.700
Oh music is a great way to learn things

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.140
That's how I studied for the MCAT.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.240
You passed the MCAT?

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.340
Ha ha ha ha, not even close

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.080
But you should really hear my rendition of the Kelly Clarkson song, Miss Independent

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.260
It teaches you all about the lymphatic system.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.320
Dom duh dom, lymphatic system

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.620
Hey, shut up I'm on the phone.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.140
Honk.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.520
And do me a favor, kill that fucking would you.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.300
Blarg.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.540
Hey dude.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.640
Vic, hey it's Church

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.500
This is Vic at 555-VICK, doodly doo. I'm not in the casita right now, so leave your low down at the ding dong hasta.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.880
Hey Vic, this is Church I need to...

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.580
You have reached the voice mail system.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.520
Ugh... Okay okay come on.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.500
To leave a message just wait for the tone.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.400
I know how to leave a goddamn message.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.420
When you are finished recording, just hang up or press pound for more options.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.080
Really? Hang up? No shit.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.460
I was just gonna keep talking until he decided to check his voice mail.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.180
For delivery options press 5

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.200
JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN BEEP!

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.460
To leave a callback number press 8

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.440
To page this person press 6

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.140
COME ON!

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.280
To repeat this message press 9

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.200
I WILL FUCKING STAB YOU COMPUTER PHONE LADY!

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.320
(Tap tap tap)

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.340
That tapping is gonna drive me insane.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.180
We either need get Donut outta there or find a way to kill him.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.820
Donut, can you please stop tapping?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.980
We heard you.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.920
You're crushed and you're in mortal danger, we get it.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.800
I can feel the tapping in my brain.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.200
Well I have to admit it, I'm stumped.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.940
I have no idea how to get him out.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.060
JESUS!

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.940
How long would it take him to starve to death?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.460
When was the last time he ate?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.140
Sarge, didn't you once tell me that you built self-destruct mechanisms into our armor?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.480
Can't you just use Donut's?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.580
No, sadly that's just you Grif.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.820
Although I could activate yours if you'd like.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.660
How would that help?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.700
Well, the situation would be a little less annoying.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.560
You want me to get the activation code sir?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.060
Nah

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.740
The activation code is just, activation code.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.880
Keep it simple.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.660
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.660
(Tap tap tap tap)

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.800
Oh my god, is it getting louder?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.420
(Tap tap)

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.720
I bet the Blues don't have to put up with anything this annoying.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.380
To mark this message as urgent press 11

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.940
THERE IS NO 11 YOU FUCKING WHORE!

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.500
Ooh language.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.500
Men, it pains me as your leader to say this, but I think we need to admit defeat.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.500
Years of experience on the battlefield and I've finally met my match.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.940
I never thought I'd be beaten a ship.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.900
A ship full of enemies maybe

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.240
But never just the ship itself.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.620
Bravo ship, bravo.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.620
Don't give up yet sir, I'm sure we can find a way to...

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.160
Ah Simmons it's hopeless, let's start assigning duties for our retreat.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.980
Uh... sir

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.380
Simmons you can pack up all the toiletries and remaining MREs, but make sure not to mix 'em up.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400
Or we'll never be able to tell 'em apart again.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.280
Sir, you really should turn around.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.520
Sure, and give the ship a chance to rub it in, no dice.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.660
Sir the doors open that means we won, another victory for the glorious Red army.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.280
What?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.560
I mean of course it is, looks like my plan worked

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.380
Chalk up another one in the win column for Sarge.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.260
Hey who's that guy? Let's shoot him.
