00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.680
In this clip we're going to talking about
the writing steps. I guess it's like if you

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.340
paint something you want to get to the point
where you're just painting without thinking

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.260
of it and it's just flowing. But in the beginning
you're thinking about each individual color,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.610
each individual brush stroke, and it's the
same thing with writing, really. We're going

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.300
to kind of break it down into the component
parts, and then, after that, you can have

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.680
it in the back of your mind and fly forward
with it. Now there are four basic steps to

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.080
writing, and you can do them really in any
order and it shouldn't be a structured regimented

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.310
thing. It should be something that is in the
back of your mind, and just something that

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:50.750
you're aware of. The first step is research.
Now the second step is writing, then editing

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.790
and then rewriting, and then you kind of keep
repeating those steps as you go along. In

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.590
addition to that I've broken a couple of the
steps down a little further. Research actually,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.510
to me, comes in two different parts. There's
a research you need to do at the very beginning

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.810
to see if you want to proceed with doing this
play, and also everything you need in the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.560
background to get you started and going on
it. There's another kind of research which

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.340
is smaller, more detailed research along the
way. It might be to do with certain characters

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.430
or certain dress, or certain, again, details.
I think it's important to start off doing

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.650
the basic research you need to do to get the
play started because if you try to do every

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.440
bit of research in the whole play, you might
burn out before you even start, so that's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.860
something to think about. One example of dividing
research into two parts is the play that I

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.900
wrote, "Potter's Point". The setting was a
monument on the top of the hill overlooking

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.880
the ocean that had been there for a hundred
years. It was important to research different

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.869
monuments on coastlines especially, and see
what there was there, what sort of...maybe

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.909
they had plaques, they had a flag pole, they
had picnic benches and a fence in the front,

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:15.489
just physically what was there, and then backgrounds
of them -how long they lasted, what happened,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.269
why some got closed down- that type of thing.
Those I needed to do before I really knew

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.340
that I wanted to proceed with the play. Later
came the other kind of research, which is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.120
the more detailed research. I had two characters
who started meeting up at this historical

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.540
Potter's Point right after World War II, and
they met there every single week. So some

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.879
of the things they would talk about regarding
the war and regarding that time period, so

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.079
that I could do along the way so I didn't
bog myself down at the very beginning. Also,

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.050
the writing process itself is broken into
two parts. One part, which is probably the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.840
most important part of writing, is the creative
part, which is not necessarily typing into

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.150
the computer, but it's thinking up the idea.
It's putting the ideas together, and it could

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.569
be in your special private place where you're
getting the most creative inspiration, or

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.930
it could be driving along the street where
you're getting an idea, but it's the creative

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.889
process, or it might be as you're sitting
in front of your computer. Just that whole

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.109
creative writing process and figuring out
the characters and what kind of conflict they're

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.540
going to be going through. And then the other
part of writing is simply the input. One of

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.019
the reasons for really dividing these four
points is that you can get in trouble if you

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.589
start doing all of these together. You're
doing a little bit of research, you're thinking

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:45.650
up some ideas, you're inputting it, you're
doing some editing while you go along and

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:53.139
kind of rewriting in your mind, and then you'll
start to get bogged down, possibly. So, again,

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.689
whatever works for you is the process to go
with, but I think a good rule of thumb is

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.129
when you're doing writing and especially inputting,
you're finally ready to put all this down

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.019
on paper. You don't want to stop and do little
edits and little spelling corrections, and

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.650
switch a sentence here and a word there -that
can all come in editing. So just get it laid

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.550
out there, and then you might want to jump
right into it and edit it. You might want

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.490
to put it away for a couple days and think
about it before you edit it. But whatever

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.280
you do, those steps are often good to separate
a little bit. And then after you decide what

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.530
you've edited down, what rewrites are you
going to do? Are you going to add characters?

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.890
Are you going to need some stronger conflict,
or a different, more realistic conflict? These

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.610
are all things you can think about. Now you
know these steps and that they don't have

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.450
to be done in any particular order, so put
them in the back of your mind and proceed

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.690
forward and create a wonderful play.
