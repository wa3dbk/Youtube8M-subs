00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Hey guys, it's Kennedy! And for today's video we are doing a Valentine's Day themed cooking video.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.400
I'm going to show you guys how to make your own heart shaped pizza which is super cute!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.020
You can make this at any point throughout the year but I figured because Valentine's Day was coming up that it would be a perfect thing to make.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.920
So if you guys want to learn how to make it then please keep on watching!

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.593
So the things you're going to need to make your very own heart shaped pizza are:

00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:29.580
a pan, depending on how many pizza's you're going to be making. I have 2 here: I have a cookie sheet and a pizza pan.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.580
You're also going to need something to cut the pizza with before you bake it, so I have a pizza cutter and just a regular knife. So be careful with that!

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.900
I have a heart shaped cookie cutter to cut the pepperoni and the meat into heart shapes, it's gonna be super cute.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.520
Then I am using a box of pizza dough, but if you would like to make your own from scratch by all means, it's just I'm using this.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:04.180
It also comes with sauce and cheese, I think, so that's why I don't have any pizza sauce but of course if you make it from scratch you're going to need to get sauce to put on top of your pizza.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:11.140
I have a mixing bowl, I have 1 cup of water, that is what my recipe requires.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:22.340
And then toppings, you can do anything that you would like with this part. But I have pizza cheese and I have a pizza pack so it just has like pepperoni, ham, and salami.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.160
You can put anything that you would like on top of your pizza, like go crazy with vegetables and all that stuff but for the sake of today's video

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.260
I am just gonna be doing different meats and I'm going to be cutting them into shape of hearts, like I've said before.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.420
But that's just what I'm doing today. But when you make it, by all means go crazy. So, let's get started!

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.240
Before you start making your dough, you're gonna want to preheat your oven and the mix that I'm using has me set it at 425Â°, so I have just done that.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.280
This kit also comes with the flour mix, cheese, spices, and the tomato sauce.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.500
 So if you don't want to make this from scratch, like I don't want to make it from scratch today, then you can always pick up a pizza kit like this one and it's just really convenient.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.800
But let's get to mixing it together!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.580
So the first thing you're gonna do is add your pizza mix to your bowl.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.860
Great start.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.280
So if you decide to have a pizza mix like I am, then just of course follow the instructions, but mine just say to add in water gradually.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.960
And you can mix with a fork or your hand, I'm just gonna be using my hands just to form a ball.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.254
And you just gradually add in water, between 2/3 of a cup and 1 cup, it just depends.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.800
And now you're just gonna want to mix it all together, like I have already started doing.

00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:48.034
It's kinda fun.

00:02:48.953 --> 00:02:50.073
And kinda gross.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.000
You'll be able to tell too like if you need to add more water cause it'll be so dry!

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.260
This is my current state.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.480
How rewarding was that?!

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:21.900
So now that your hands are possibly a mess like mine, I am going to leave the dough in the bowl and cover it with saran wrap and let it rise for 10 minutes.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.800
So while i'm waiting for the dough to rise, I have gotten all my ingredients ready to put on to the pizza.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.122
And one of them, like I mentioned before, is gonna be pepperoni, ham, and salami in little heart shapes.

00:03:33.122 --> 00:03:35.508
So I'm gonna cut that right now while I'm waiting.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.320
I think I'm gonna make heart shaped pizza for everyone from now on! 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.860
Not Valentine's Day? Not my problem! You're still getting a heart shaped pizza!

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.614
Maybe...

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.006
Or maybe I'll eat it!

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.880
So I have now finished cutting out all of the meat, and they look super cute in little heart shapes.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.940
So I'm gonna put this to the side until I'm ready to decorate my pizza.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.800
And all of the like exterior of like the heart shapes, I am not going to throw away, I'm just going to cut into smaller pieces and toss on to the pizza as well.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.160
So now that I have let the dough sit and rise for 10 minutes, I have used a little bit of pam and just sprayed the pizza pan that I'm gonna be using

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:28.740
and I also have a little bit of flour in here because this specific kit that I'm using does make 2 pizza's, so you need to have lightly floured fingers

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.840
and separate it into half and then spread it out on to your pan.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.780
So now I have half the dough and I'm just going to knead it out and just flatten it, spread it out on to the pan.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.080
And now that you have your dough all spread out on your pan, you're gonna want to carefully cut it into the shape of a heart.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.860
And the good thing is if you decide to make 2 pizza's then you can always use the leftovers and add it to the

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:20.020
 other pizza and have it bigger or just make smaller pizza's if you just have a little bit leftover, because you don't want to throw it away and waste it.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.920
So, just make more pizza's!

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.760
So i just finished cutting the dough into the shape of a heart and it is super cute, it is tiny so I am gonna be

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.014
making like I said 2 heart shaped pizza's, and if you wanted a bigger pizza which would make sense

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.420
you would just need a bigger pan, but for right now this works very well for me and now I'm gonna start putting all the toppings on!

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.360
So now is the fun part where we get to decorate the pizza, so I have the sauce that the kit comes with

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.160
and so I'm just going to put some on here and spread it out evenly.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.280
Now that I have the sauce on the pizza, I'm gonna also sprinkle some of these herbs on top just before I put on the rest of the toppings.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.740
I am gonna put on some of the cheese that comes in the kit as well as the 3 cheese one that I have because I like a cheesy pizza.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.040
And lastly the fun part is putting on the heart shaped meat, it's so cute. Oh my goodness.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.760
Just feel like a heart eye emoji, like that little heart eye emoji. So cute!

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.040
So when you're all done decorating your pizza, you're gonna pop it in the oven. Of course according to the

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.160
time like of the recipe that you're using or the kit, and my kit is 10-13 minutes so i'm gonna put it in and keep an eye on it. 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.016
So here is the final result of the pizza, it turned out so good! And I am super excited to eat this!

00:07:00.016 --> 00:07:04.553
Like I said earlier, you can add any toppings that you would like. I think next time I'm gonna try adding

00:07:04.553 --> 00:07:07.960
mushrooms in the shape of hearts and see how that turns out.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.713
But, yeah, I am super excited to eat this and it's just a fun way to spice up a regular pizza

00:07:12.713 --> 00:07:15.614
just making it in the shape of a heart. So cute!

00:07:15.614 --> 00:07:19.494
