00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.050
Hi, and welcome to Brain Stuff.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.472
I'm Jonathan Strickland.

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:13.730
And I'm Ben Bowlin.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.900
And Ben, I understand we have
an interesting question today.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.489
Oh, yeah.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:18.280
This is a good one.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.600
All right, so Jonathan.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.230
Are you ready?

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.600
Yep.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.410
That's not the question.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.700
OK.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.350
All right.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.690
How do astronomers
measure distance?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.280
How are they able to measure
how far away a star is?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.840
Ah, right.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.140
So it turns out that measuring
the distance to the star

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.660
is an interesting problem.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.690
So astronomers have come up
with two different techniques

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.370
to estimate how far away
any given star might be.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.870
Now, that first
technique involves

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.750
triangulation, or parallax.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.060
So the Earth orbits
the sun, right?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.560
Yeah.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.450
Well, as it orbits
that sun, there's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.940
a diameter of orbit
about 186 million miles.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.970
So by looking at a start
one day and then, maybe,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.800
six months later,
looking at it again?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.960
Astronomers can see a
difference in the viewing

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.470
angle for that star.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.170
So with a little trigonometry--
which is, frankly,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.740
terrifying to me-- the different
angles yield the distance.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.120
So this technique
works for stars

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.790
that are about 400 light years
away from earth, or closer.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.900
Now, there's no direct
method currently

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480
available to
measure the distance

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.860
to stars that are further than
400 light years from Earth.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.331
But there's an
approximation, right?

00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:24.830
Yes.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.200
And this is a pretty clever one.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.560
This is the second technique.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.780
Astronomers can use
brightness to figure out

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.750
a star's distance.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.520
So they do this
because it turns out

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.760
that a star's color spectrum
is a good indication

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.050
of its actual brightness.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.100
So like blue, white, et cetera.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.370
The relationship between
color and brightness

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.700
has been proven using the
several thousand stars that

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.610
are close enough to Earth to
have their distance measured

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.290
directly, that would be the
400 light years and closer.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.030
So astronomers can
look at a distant star,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.570
determine its color spectrum.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.550
And from the color,
then they can

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.950
determine the star's
actual brightness.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.160
By knowing the actual
brightness and comparing it

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.800
to the apparent brightness
seen from Earth-- that is,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.670
by looking at how dim the
star has actually become

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.539
once its light
reaches the earth,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.630
they can determine that
the distance of the star

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.250
is whatever it happens to be.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.750
Right.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.470
And there's some other stuff
we should probably talk about.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.625
Yeah.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:17.810
I've got some
trivia for you, Ben.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.050
Oh, good.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.550
OK.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.300
All right, so let's talk about
some of the astronomical units

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.570
that astronomers use, including
the astronomical unit.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.750
So the astronomical unit refers
to the distance between Earth

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.300
and the sun, the
average distance.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.050
It's about 149 million
kilometers or something.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.470
Then you've got the light-year.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.840
Yeah, what is a light-year?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.840
So, a light-year is
like a regular year

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.080
but with fewer calories.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.760
Heh.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.330
Actually, of course,
the light year

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.500
is the distance that
light can travel

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.670
through the vacuum of space
within the span one Earth year.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.290
So that's pretty big,
because light's pretty fast?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.790
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.380
We're talking just under
10 trillion kilometers.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.050
That's a pretty long distance.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.430
But I've got something
that's even longer than that.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.610
And that is a parsec.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.180
Hang on.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.120
Is this a Star Wars reference?

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.300
It can be.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.250
But, all right, so,
Parsec in Star Wars

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.480
sounds like it's a unit of time.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.030
It's actually a
unit of distance.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.430
And the way it works is
you talk about the distance

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.030
between our sun and some
other astronomical object that

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.780
has a 1-second arc degree
difference in parallax angle.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.950
Now that essentially means
that when we look at the star

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.200
and we compare it
to the sun, and we

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.060
do that again at another
point on the Earth's orbit,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.900
we get that 1-second arc degree.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.560
That distance actually ends
up being 3.26 light-years.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.910
So it's even longer.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.540
So there you go.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.640
Astronomical units.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.140
Wait.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.290
So the Kessel Run--

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.040
We'll get to it.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.990
We'll get to it.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.140
Meanwhile, while you guys

and then subscribe
to the channel.

00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:55.820
We've got a lot
more questions we're

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.671
going to be answering,
like the Kessel Run.

00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.170
Thank you.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.140
So Ben, the Kessel
Run is, in fact,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.870
a smuggling route in
the Star Wars universe.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.640
Now, the retconned
explanation of why

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.990
Han Solo refers
to the parsecs is

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.755
that this route goes
through several black holes.

00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:13.550
And for a ship to
be safe, it has

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.930
to go around the black
holes as much as possible.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.920
So the safest route is
probably around 15 parsecs.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.250
But Han Solo?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.440
He's a daredevil.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.340
And so he cuts off
several parsecs

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.660
and makes it more of a 12 parsec
or less than 12 parsec run.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.190
Oh, that's the line.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.920
Yeah.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.040
But is that because of
the Force, or something?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.850
No.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.840
Han Solo doesn't
believe in the Force.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.880
He's all skill, man.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.280
It has nothing to do with some--

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.280
It's been a long time
since I watched Star Trek.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.840
So I don't really, I don't know.
