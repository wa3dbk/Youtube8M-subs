00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.620
My name is Mike Jones, and I'm a barista at
Third Rail Coffee right by Washington Square

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.350
Park in New York City.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:22.919
I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making
skills.

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.820
Where do coffee beans come from?

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.269
They are grown mostly in tropical climate
at a higher altitude, at least that's where

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.555
the quality beans are going to be coming from.

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:34.000
There are three main growing regions.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.219
This is Africa, Central/South America, and
Indonesia.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.420
Some of the biggest coffee producing countries
are Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, Sumatra.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.820
There are two main species of the coffee plant
in general, and there's arabica and robusta.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.070
And any specialty coffee is going to be arabica.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.899
There are some robustas that are in recent
years of a higher quality, but still you won't

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.290
really see that at any reputable coffee show.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.180
The arabica is higher growing, lower yield,
more susceptible to disease, and therefore

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.440
a little bit more tricky to process.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.340
So depending on where a coffee is grown, it
can taste vastly different.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.180
Even if it's the same kind of coffee.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.820
Within the 2 main species, arabica and robusta,
there are countless varietals, very similar

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.820
to wine.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.030
So different kinds of trees, different strains.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.160
They're named things like bourbon, catuai,
caturra, there's just an endless amount of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160
names.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.880
It ranges from the altitude to what the weather
was like that year, the humidity to what country

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.880
it's grown in.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.360
It all tastes different.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.140
You can have a Bourbon varietal for instance
that's grown in El Salvador or grown in Kenya

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.840
and it will just taste completely different.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.380
And I think that's one of the really interesting
things about coffee, is just the endless range

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.740
of flavors that you can discover.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.530
And some of them are just not repeatable at
all, it just depends on that one harvest,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.170
that one climate, that one varietal.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.730
And that's what makes it sort of a temporary
exciting special thing.a
