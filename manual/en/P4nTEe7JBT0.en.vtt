hi welcome to quick and easy cooking

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.390
i am mrs. vahchef ragini thumma today
I'm going to show you a simple and tasty

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.140
milkshake with very very riped bananas
and dates in each and every house

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.620
bananas are bought but what happens when
they're fresh like this in yellow color

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.140
everybody would love to eat it once it
discolors into black

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.550
nobody wants to eat it they just throw
it away my son

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.390
number one in that he always says no
mom I wanted

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.710
yellow in color banana even sanjay also
the same thing

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.910
so what I got an idea why I should throw
even even

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.560
I'm sure you also have the same problem
throwing away the ripened bananas

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.159
so instead of throwing the ripe 
bananas I got an idea

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.290
i'm using that ripe banana to make
it fantastic milkshake

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.710
so just plain banana milkshake

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.830
we'll make some twist by adding a little
bit of daters just remove the seed and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.170
add into it blend up a little bit of
sugar

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.610
not too much because there's also give
sweetness and then also has sweetness

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.610
lets blend these two first

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.280
now we are going to add a little bit of
milk this first to make a nice paste of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.280
this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.910
now this is all done now in this we are
going to add the bananas see the fully

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.060
ripened bananas maybe a little bit dark
in color but once you blend it and add

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.870
the milk

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:15.680
it looks like white in color and a
little bit of ice cubes and some more of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.070
milk milk

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.750
it all depends on how much thickness you
want based on that you make it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.470
now this is all done because we add a
date

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.180
this looks a little bit brown in color
but without dates if you're just adding

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.440
the banana and milk

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.180
it would be white now just serve it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.070
see healthy drink is all ready i have
added sugar and I tasted it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.290
it's a little bit sweet but you can skip
the sugar because dates are sweeter and the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.000
banana is also sweet

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.920
so you can just skip the sugar i'm going
to give this power pack energy-boosting

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.250
drink to vahchef so that he can make
wonderful dishes next and show it to you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.900

interesting recipes
