00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.480
To begin the installation on your K&amp;N® air
intake system, turn off the vehicles ignition

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.660
and disconnect the vehicle’s negative battery
cable.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.240
Next, disconnect the mass air sensor electrical
connection and unhook the wiring harness from

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.320
the air box.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.930
Remove the two nuts that secure the throttle
body cover, and then remove the throttle body

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.169
cover.

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:33.200
Now it’s time to remove the bolt that secures
the A/C mounting clamp. Save this bolt, as

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.890
it will be re-used later.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.679
Release the spring clamp, and then remove
the P/S pressure switch vent hose from the

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.920
intake tube.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.530
Disconnect the fuel pressure regulator vent
line from the fuel pressure regulator.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.420
Next, disconnect the crank case vent hose
from the valve cover.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:01.239
Loosen the hose clamps that secure the stock
intake tube to the throttle body and air box.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.170
Now it’s time to remove the stock air intake
from the vehicle.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.659
Install the three provided 1/4” NPT fittings
into the K&amp;N® intake tube.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.219
Next, install the provided gasket onto the
K&amp;N® mass air sensor adapter.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.460
Remove the two screws that secure the mass
air sensor to the stock air box, and remove

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.369
the mass air sensor.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.439
Install the mass air sensor block off plate
provided onto the stock air box. Be sure to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:42.290
install the provided gasket onto the block
off plate before it is installed.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.530
Now it’s time to install the mass air assembly
into the K&amp;N® intake tube and secure it with

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.320
the provided K&amp;N® hardware. It is important
that you install the sensor with the opening

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.929
pointed towards the air filter end of the
tube.

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.060
Install the supplied silicone hose onto the
throttle body next. Be sure to secure it with

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.140
the provided hardware.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.160
Release the four clamps securing the upper
air box, and then remove the upper air box.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.560
Remove the stock air filter, as well as the
three bolts securing the lower air box to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.879
the inner fender.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.659
Next, remove the lower air box from the vehicle.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.150
Drill out the rivet that holds the fresh air
duct to the lower air box.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.730
Remove the fresh air duct from the lower air
box.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.940
Next it will be necessary to trim both sides
of the fresh air duct. K&amp;N® recommends using

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.010
tins snips to trim the fresh air duct.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.760
Now it’s time to re-install the fresh air
duct into the lower air box and secure it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.080
with the provided hardware.
Re-install the lower air box into vehicle

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.180
and secure it using the factory bolts.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.540
Next, install the K&amp;N® air filter into the
lower air box.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.299
Install the upper air box and secure with
the factory retaining clips.

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.720
Place the silicone hump hose onto the air
box and secure it with a hose clamp.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.950
Install the K&amp;N® intake tube into the silicone
hoses at the throttle body and air box securing

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.069
them with the K&amp;N® provided hose clamps.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.970
Connect the open end of the 4mm silicone hose
to the NPT vent fitting installed on the K&amp;N®

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.269
intake tube.

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.500
Connect the open end of the 4mm silicone hose
to the fuel pressure regulator vent port.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.980
Connect the P/S pressure switch vent hose
to the NPT fitting installed on the K&amp;N®

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.799
intake tube, and secure it with the factory
spring clamp.

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.239
Install the supplied crank case vent hose
to the NPT fitting on the K&amp;N® intake tube.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.579
Next, install the open end of the crank case
vent hose onto the factory fitting on the

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.579
valve cover.

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.410
Secure the A/C hose mounting clamp to the
K&amp;N® intake tube with the factory bolt removed

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.459
in step #4.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.700
Reinstall the engine cover using the factory
nuts.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.400
Re-connect the mass air sensor electrical
connection.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.260
Reconnect the vehicle’s negative battery
cable.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.320
Be sure to double check and make sure everything
is tight and properly positioned before starting

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.039
the vehicle. After 100 miles of driving check
the nuts and bolts and retighten if necessary.
