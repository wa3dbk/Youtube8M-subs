00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.530
We're demonstrating the EuroTool Power Punch
today. This is a heavy duty tool

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.460
used to punch through all kinds of soft metals
up to sixteen gauge.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.779
The tool kit comes with seven punches and
seven corresponding dies

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.090
in sizes from three thirty seconds through
nine thirty seconds.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.980
This tool is set up and ready to demonstrate
so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.039
let's do that now.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.680
I have a piece of copper sheeting here.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.940
Set it between the jaws of the tool and just
draw down on it. Punches very easily

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.630
and I remove the piece.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.490
And you can see we've been using this
a little bit today.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.250
I'll now show you how to change

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.620
the punches and the dies. It's very easy.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.430
Unscrew one piece here.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.720
Remove the punch.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.720
Exchange it for another size.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.950
Screw it back in.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.990
And then change the the di as well.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.159
Screws back in easily and you're ready to continue.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.070
And it has a depth gauge here as well

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.740
and that's used

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.570
and it's adjustable so you could punch anywhere
accurately on your piece.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.570
We're been using this quite a bit in the workshop
here at Beadaholique.com. Here's your nine thirty second size.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.690
After you punch through your pendant or
whatever material you want to use,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.870
these are the cast offs but you can
actually use these as jewelry components. You can

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.100
punch through here with the three thirty seconds
size and use these as pilots.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.880
The idea is that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.110
you don't have to throw these pieces away.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.459
So that's it. Very easy to use. Great heavy duty tool.
Really useful.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.030
