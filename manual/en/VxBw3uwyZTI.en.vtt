00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.110
Take me!! Desire me

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.180
Take me!! Begin with my body

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.820
Take me!! To wherever this sound echoes to

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.530
Take me!! Kiss me.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.120
If we could sink into each other, more deeply than anyone else

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.780
Take me!! To the future

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.800
Take me!! To your heart

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.300
Take me!! To the point that even hurtful words

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.850
will melt and be forgotten in this sweet poison

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.360
A simple call sends shivers down my body

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.960
With my velvety hands I touch

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.400
your fragile, pale skin

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.800
I overlap your wounds with mine,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.720
and then we sealed a deep kiss

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.750
I'm not one to follow the scenario

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.420
With a clear voice

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.950
Love me, passionately, doubtlessly move your body

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.720
I can't hide my sigh; all I want now is a little moment

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.100
Take me!! A precious

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.940
Take me!! Melody is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.500
Take me!! Soothing my loneliness repetitively

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.800
Take me!!  It may be transient, but I still want to seal a promise with you and fall in sin

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.700
Take me!! Feel it deeply

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.580
Take me!! I'm floating

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.200
Take me!! We're losing our reason to each other

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.900
Let's ascend to the sinful light that we desire

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.240
Your provocative wink captivates me

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.910
Just like a sparkling butterfly with fresh wings

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.500
Hold me tight

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.400
I searched for what I wanted with my instincts

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.070
and took a bite off a fruit grown from the tree of passion strongly

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.850
so that I can express myself to you

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.580
Take me!! Desire me

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.300
Take me!! Begin with my body

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.840
Take me!! To wherever this sound echoes to

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.840
Take me!! Kiss me.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.370
If we could sink into each other, more deeply than anyone else

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.140
Take me!! To the future

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.070
Take me!! To your heart

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.740
Take me!! To the point that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.590
even hurtful words

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.040
will melt and be forgotten in this sweet poison

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:40.570
Take me!! Lalala...

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:55.120
Take me!! Lalala...

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.560
Take me!!

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.950
I sing for my beloved

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.750
I sing for you, my love
