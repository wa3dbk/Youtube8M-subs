KARA MUUU CHO

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:14.987
Today I'm going to try Kara Mu-cho Mexican style WILD SPICE CHILLI flavour

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:21.383
I generally love spicy food so this should be okay I think

00:00:22.197 --> 00:00:25.283
Please enjoy this WILD slightly different SPICY flavour!

00:00:33.207 --> 00:00:34.411
Looks like this

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.425
Let's see what they're like

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:54.780
Duncan do you wanna try?

00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:03.500
I've had quite a lot but still not feeling the spice

00:02:09.518 --> 00:02:10.500
Yum

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:20.430
Spicy? 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:21.980
No

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:23.360
I know right!?

00:02:24.826 --> 00:02:26.370
I'm kind of disappointed 

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.210
Not spicy at ALL

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:31.370
I'm trying to eat the whole bag but

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:33.840
I'm kinda tired of eating them already

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:34.810
Yeah there's a lot of them

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:37.170
They are pretty tasty though.

00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:46.410
I guess they are spicier than the original Kara Mu-cho

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.580
but they're not that spicy

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.180
They kind of taste like BBQ flavour potato chips

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.220
Just a bit

00:02:59.776 --> 00:03:02.400
Even though there's no meat flavouring in these...

00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:05.830
Is there even BBQ flavour in Japan?

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:07.560
I think so.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.230
Verdict: not spicy 

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.240
We're disappointed

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:17.090
This much left....ahhhh I'll work hard to finish them

00:03:58.842 --> 00:03:59.830
Yummy?

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:02.800
Is it good?

00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:04.280
So-so?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.380
It's good, isn't it!

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.110
ATE THEM ALL TAKE THAT UNSPICY CHIPS!

00:04:51.113 --> 00:04:57.040
And I just realised that this bag is 544 calories hahahaaaa..aaaa

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.450
So this is today's dinner. 

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:08.790
They were a little spicy but not what I'd called Mexican spicy 

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:08.790
They were a little spicy but not what I'd called Mexican spicy 

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:11.500
And they're pretty yummy. 

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:13.970
But uh...share them with a friend XD
