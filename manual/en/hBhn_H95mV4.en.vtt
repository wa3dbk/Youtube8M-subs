00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.529
Today on this 2006 Ford F-150 were going to
be installing Draw Tite Hitch part number

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.360
75506 and this installation will also apply
to the Hidden Hitch part number 87418.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.039
Before we get started with our hitch installation
we are going to show you a couple final install

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.950
dimensions, which are going to help make choosing
your hitch accessories a little bit easier.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.750
From the top of the receiver tube opening
to the ground is going to measure 17-1/2 inches,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.199
and from the center of the pin hole to the
clear the rear edge of the bumper is going

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.590
to measure right at 3 inches, and now we will
go ahead and move on to installation.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.579
Were up under the vehicle and the first thing
I have done is go ahead and lower down the

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.999
spare tire to give us some extra working room.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.149
Starting over here on the drivers side of
the vehicle, the F-150 has a bumper reinforcement

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.320
thats attached to the bumper and the frame.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.059
On the rear facing here we have an oblong
hole that were going to be using as our rear

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.589
most attaching point, and if we follow forward
on that bracket theres the second hole here,

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.500
and that will provider our forward most attaching
point for the hitch, and thats actually going

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.710
to be the same attaching point were going
to be using on the passengers side of the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.160
vehicle as well.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.589
We have the factory installed saddle brackets
here, one on the drivers side, and one here

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.189
on the passengers side, and those will provide
our final attaching points for the trailer

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.189
hitch.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.950
Now that weve showed you where the mounting
points are we can start putting the hitch

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.119
up into position.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.620
Were going to start by attaching to the saddle
bracket here, well be using the 2 inch long

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.630
bolts along with the conical washer, well
be inserting the bolt from the outside of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.460
the bracket towards the middle of the vehicle,
and on the other side we will be attaching

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.150
with a conical tooth washer and hex nut.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.340
Well move next to the reattaching points on
the bracket, and again we will be using the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.820
2 inch long bolts with a conical tooth washer
inserting towards the front of the vehicle.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.090
And then on the front side of the bracket
we will go ahead and add the provided spacer

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.759
block, conical tooth washer, and hex nut.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.220
For the forward reattaching point on the bracket
we will be using the smaller 1-1/2 inch bolts

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.869
that are provided with the kit, and with these
you will be inserting them from the inside

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.950
of the vehicle with the threads pointing out
toward the frame.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.280
For the forward most attaching point on the
reinforcing bracket we will be using the smaller

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.351
1-1/2 inch bolts that are provided with the
kit and a conical tooth washer like with the

00:02:09.351 --> 00:03:23.030
other fastening points.
