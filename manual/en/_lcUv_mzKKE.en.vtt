00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.080
Hi everyone , I'm Tommy Neer with Bauer Roller
Hockey, today here with Total Hockey and State

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.200
Wars to tell you about the new 1XR skate.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.220
Today we have some great new features in our
1XR skate, we've got a new Form Fit tongue

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.430
with a curv composite insert. The tongue being
lighter weight allows us to provide a better

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.650
fit and a lighter product overall for this
skate to perform at it's highest level.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.170
We also have a revolutionary liner with the
37.5 technology it allows it to dry up to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.649
5 times faster than any other skate liner
in the game today.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.079
We've also got a 3-D aluminized curv composite
quarter with a new x-rib pattern providing

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.370
a great fit, great stability and agility to
the skate. The one difference between the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.559
1X ice skate and the 1XR Roller Hockey skate
would be that we provide abrasion specific

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.930
abrasion guard to allow for durability with
this product considering it's made for roller

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.949
hockey.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.449
The new Bauer Speed Plate is the industry
leading proprietary technology. The Bauer

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.760
Speed Plate features a recovery alloy that
provides the player with a revolutionary custom

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.860
fit for the entire foot. The precision fit
allows the skate to become a part of the foot

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.790
enabling the player to achieve optimized balance
and stability, resulting in higher top end

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.020
speed and ultimate efficiency.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.240
Another great feature would be the full light
weight composite out sole that allows for

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.790
great transfer of energy as well. The Kryptonium
chassis down here at the bottom of the skate

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.829
is very light weight, strong and stable product
for any high end roller hockey player to make

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.920
sure they're performing at their highest peak
level.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.259
Great piece below the boot here would be the
Revision Variant Plus wheel that we feature.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.060
This has a torus technology allowing for flex
and agility and then we have the new high

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.079
end urethane on the outside providing maximum
grip and speed.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.159
Thanks for taking the time to check out the
new 1XR make sure you head down to Total Hockey

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.520
