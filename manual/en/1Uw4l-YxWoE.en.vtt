00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:13.586
The Natural Parks in Bulgaria

00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:20.718
In Bulgaria there are eleven natural parks,
which are annually visited by more than 10 million people.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:28.824
Vitosha, Rila Monastery, Golden Sands, Vratsa Balkan,
Rusenski Lom, Strandzha, Shumen Plateau,

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:38.566
The Blue Rocks, Persina, Belasitsa and Balgarka are real natural oasĞµs
which had preserved the unique wild nature of the country.

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:42.334
The oldest natural park is Vitosha.

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:47.952
It covers almost the entire mountain
and spreads on an area of 27,00 ha.

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:54.009
The "Vitosha" Park is a real emblem of the capital -
with the stone rivers typical for it,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.538
the natural spruce forests and the
largest peatland complex in the country.

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.285
The highest peak of the mountain
is Cherni Vrah.

00:01:01.987 --> 00:01:08.753
Every year about three million people visit Vitosha,
by turning it into the most popular protected territory in the country.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:15.326
The only natural complex consisting of two protected
territories in Bulgaria is situated in Rila Mountain

00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:19.131
and includes natural park Rila Monastery
and National Park Rila.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.595
Forests, high mountain meadows,
alpine localities and high peaks

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:29.497
surround the dearest church temple - Rila Monastery,

00:01:29.852 --> 00:01:32.382
which had given its name to the natural park,
which is visited by more than half a million tourists annually

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:38.182
and it is one of the Bulgarian treasures in the UNESCO List
of the Global Cultural Inheritance.

00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:43.824
Another unique natural complex is
the natural park Vratsa Balkan,

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.812
where the highest limestone rocks
on the Balkan Peninsula are located,

00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:53.920
as well as more than 500 caves, among which are the wonderful Ledenika
and unique monuments of culture,

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:58.125
such as the Cherepishki Monastery,
with wall-paintings of the 14th century,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.382
situated in the south-easternmost
part of the country.

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:05.506
The endless green sea of rounded ridges, covered in forest,
embrace unique Bulgarian settlements, such as the village of Balgari and Brashlyan,

00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:14.470
which had preserved authentic national customs,
style of life and occupation.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.962
Endless are the forests, covering the Shumen plateau,
which is the highest one in North Bulgaria.

00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:23.472
Naturally fortified and protected,
it had been inhabited since antiquity,

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.369
and here were housed Thracian settlements,
and rock monasteries on the slopes.

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:33.471
The most unique preserved historical site is the
Shumen Fortress, which had existed for about 3,000 years.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:41.555
When we talk about Bulgarian history, we immediately think of
the natural parks "Balgarka" and "Sinite Kamani",

00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:48.413
which attract tourists with their cultural inheritance,
wild nature and specific landscapes.

00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:54.249
The youngest natural parks "Persina" and "Belasitsa" also offer
experiences for admirers of nature.

00:02:56.275 --> 00:03:02.531
In "Persina" visitors can see unique for Bulgaria
by-river wetlands along the Danube,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.430
and in Belasitsa - the great diversity of broad-leaved forests
of our country which spreads on three countries.

00:03:07.803 --> 00:03:13.875
The natural parks "Rusenski Lom" and "Zlatni Pyasatsi" are
famous for their incredible nature

00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:20.239
and their rock monasteries
- "St. Archangel Michael" - a site included in the UNESCO List

00:03:18.986 --> 00:03:25.839
of the Global Cultural Inheritance and "Aladzha Manastir".

00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:28.421
Carved high in the rocks, they are a part
of the cultural inheritance of the 13th-14th century

00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:34.555
and they attract thousands of tourists
every year with their unique vision.

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:39.489
The natural parks in Bulgaria are hospitable
for all admirers of ecological tourism.

00:03:41.123 --> 00:03:45.523
They offer thematic routes for the admirers
of nature and biodiversity,

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:49.358
and for those who desire to get to know better
the preserved flora and fauna,

00:03:49.592 --> 00:03:53.692
programs for the youngest ones, and forest schools;
and some of them, like Vitosha also offer specialized routes for disabled people.

00:03:53.926 --> 00:04:01.926
They are the real wealth of Bulgaria,
where unique natural and cultural resources are preserved,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.560
and they turn the country into a desired
tourist destination.
