00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.090
My name's Jamel.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.830
I was in the Navy and I was the
Aviation Boatswain's Mate.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.420
There was a lot of noise,
a lot of long hours.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.900
We did at least 16-hour days.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.740
I got married while I was in
Ordnance School in Florida.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.900
I was going nine
months a year.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:30.150
That took a toll on my
family and on myself.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.240
During deployment, you had up to
anywhere near 5,000 people

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.310
on that ship from all over,
who are away from their

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.270
families and going through
a lot of frustrations.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.110
A lot of combat, a lot of
fighting, but not with enemies

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.060
of other places, amongst
ourselves.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.020
You were placed in dangerous
situations.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.880
But you were on a ship,
so you couldn't leave.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.170
And you might not be
able to sleep.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.030
Getting back was a big
turning point.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.610
I was really looking forward
to getting back.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.410
But when I did get back,
things were different.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.920
About three months afterwards,
me and my wife separated.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.050
My children were different, my
wife was different, at least

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.740
so I thought.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.690
Once I got around other Veterans
and I heard their

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.240
stories, and I began to hear
things that sound like me,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.510
things that I had gone through
and things that I was

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:43.870
experiencing, that was when I
began to realize, Jamel, it

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.040
might have been you.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.680
They recommended that I go to
one of the Vet centers.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.170
And I did.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.900
And they were saying that I
might be possibly suffering

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.080
from post-traumatic syndrome,
you know?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.420
PTSD.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.540
And they helped me realize
that you need to talk to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.820
somebody, you need to get some
help, you need to work this

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.570
out, you know?

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.570
That was the turning point
there, going to the VA center.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.080
I've actually seen counselors,
and therapists, and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.770
professionals who were able to
help me at the Vet centers.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.780
There is a connection,
absolutely, I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.360
think, with all Vets.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.010
Regardless of what branch you
were in, regardless of what

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.060
you went through and did.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.920
There's a connection.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.310
The people who I began speaking
to were people who

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.470
had lived it, or living it,
and were just genuinely

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.570
wanting to help you
the way that they

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.160
were helped, you know?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.600
The VA was able to help
them, and they're just

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.830
looking to help you.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.330
I turned to my church.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.480
And they helped me with my
faith, and my belief to also

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.770
not take things to my own hands,
and to use prayer, and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.990
to begin to change myself
for the better.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.320
I'm actually engaged
to be married here

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.980
in about two months.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.710
She's a great mother, a great
women, and she's been a great

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.580
help with me and my
new walk of faith.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.840
There's life after the
military, you know?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.360
And there are people who
are willing to help us.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.270
If you're going through
something and you feel like

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.370
you've changed, or
some symptoms,

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.650
then go speak to someone.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.350
Go get some help.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.920
Speak to some fellows Vets,
speak to the Vet center, speak

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.350
to someone in faith
and get some help.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.536
The combination is a great
support team--

00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:55.000
the church, the Vet
center, and my

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.530
fellow Vets, and family.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.630
It all came together to help
me be where I'm at today.
