00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:02.910
The Best Website for Men's Clothing Deals_
Dappered.com Wins Hands Down!

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.910
- Video Blog Review

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.189
Hi, this is Antonio Centeno over at “Real
Men, Real Style” and today I’m going to

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.730
be doing a video review of dappered.com.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.610
Dappered has been around for about a year
and a half and is run by Joe Weber and he

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.160
first came on my calendar when he did some
guest posting over the art of manliness at

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.170
primer and at the effortless gent.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.920
And I’ve seen Joe positioned this website
as they go to place on the web for finding

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.039
great deals on men’s wear.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.300
And I think he – you know I like his philosophy.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.780
Fashion is temporary and expensive.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.350
Style is timeless and affordable and it seems
like he positioned dappered to be the go to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.940
site not just about information because there’s
a lot of the sites out there.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.649
But Joe focuses on bringing to your attention
the best deals.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.820
And these are deals that may only be around
for 24 hours or be around for you know or

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.670
coming up here in the next month.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.420
But he really wants to be the place where
you come and you know okay here’s an up

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.820
and coming deal and he brings it right to
your attention.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.800
And I can – this is probably one of the
better ones because I like how whenever he

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.580
does comparisons of clothing, he updates very
quickly if the price is changed as we can

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.020
see here the price has gone up by $76 or $75.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.620
And he brings those updates right through
and you could see he’s already had two updates.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.470
These articles like a couple days old and
I actually know he did these updates probably

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.500
within the first day.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.290
Another powerful thing about dappered.com
is Joe is really cultivated in the community

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.330
and so you can see we got 35 comments.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.380
He comes in here and add some comments but
he’s got a number of men who come in here

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.640
and he make it even strong because these other
guys are out there looking for deals and bring

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.130
to other people’s attention other deals
which Joe might not have noticed.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.490
Now he also isn’t afraid to jump in and
provide us with information.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.820
I like the way Joe does it.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.340
So he talks about a new movie called “Drive”
and the star Ryan Gosling.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.470
Very sharp dressed man, you’ll see him on
the cover of GQ and Esquire but Ryan he says

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.140
how can – you know we take Ryan’s look
and imitate it.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.890
And so he goes piece by piece from the watch
to looks like the Levi’s slim fit trucker

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.750
jean jacket to the shirt to the trousers to
the jeans to the sunglasses down to the boots

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.030
and the gloves.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.280
So if you want to be – understand how to
put together outfits, this is now also a great

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.420
site and what I really love is he links you
right to the websites where you can pick up

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.230
the item if you so chose and he gives the
price.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.750
Now I went through this article quickly and
I love it because I didn’t really hit about

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.600
one thing Joe does is he gives you sometimes
multiple options.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.910
And he says okay you can get this jacket over
to the left for $285 or this one here to the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.650
right for $225 and this is going to be the
difference in what you are getting.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.370
Another thing, Joe doesn’t just stop at
clothing.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.990
He gets in to drink.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.880
He talks about grooming, shoes.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.760
Here he’ll talk about travel and bags.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.120
Again he’s got certain codes that you can
even use and save on and get a discount.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.840
The normal price, the sale price and again
the powerful thing is you can look in the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.160
comments and people will let you know which
coupon codes works, which ones are expired.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.190
Perhaps where you can even find a better deal.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.800
Here he is talking about drink.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.450
Follows – on the drinks he doesn’t necessarily
follow the same formula.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.620
This is more information on the most wanted.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.020
This is where he starts playing with list
and you can see here in September of this

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.680
year he is basically saying okay here are
the five most wanted items for the last few

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680
months.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.470
And so this is if you’re a bit short on
time, you can just go follow Joe’s advice.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.310
Now here we can see – Joe’s actually probably
the model in here and the great thing is okay

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.470
you may be asking okay here’s Joe.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.470
I see him.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.880
I see how this fits.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.500
What size – what I love is that Joe is actually
given us his measurements.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.160
And so probably more measurements than what
we needed there Joe but are appreciated.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.720
And so we get an idea of how his built and
how the clothing fits him.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.690
Another thing I love about dappered.com is
that this little column that they have about

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.190
ask a woman.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.710
And Joe brings in Beth, an old friend of his
and Beth goes in to detail and gives us the

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.980
female perspective on commonly asked questions.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.919
Now it’s broken up in a category so accessories,
clothing, drink, grooming, shoes…

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.740
…too expensive travel, watches, women, etcetera.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.570
This is one of the – I think the weak points
about dappered.com is that some of these – a

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.120
lot overlapped.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.931
So if you go through one category, you’re
going to see the same article that you perhaps

00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:16.910
on another category.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.250
But it’s things like this that kind of just
make up for.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.160
I love his ridiculous model captions and this
is where he gets the people involved in on

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.560
how Joe’s has developed such a strong community.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.270
You can see obviously that’s a ridiculous
picture and he asked people to come in chimes.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.280
You know give their take on what the caption
should have been.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.830
Some of them I can’t repeat but you see
26 people jumped in there.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.520
So and finally he’s got a threat or what
he would call an up to date form without a

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.520
bunch of snobs in it.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.230
So this is something – it’s a lot smaller
and more intimate the way you are going to

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.401
see over at style form or ask Andy.

00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:03.370
And you may not get an immediate response
but you can get a pretty quick response.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.440
Looks like most people are getting replies
to and you can see that it’s pretty active

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440
again.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.500
Not super active but then again I know he
just started this and he’s got over -- almost

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.130
300 topics just under 2,000 post.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.100
Dappered also got a Facebook page.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.120
Another way to engage the audiences, stay
up to date if you don’t want.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.251
He also got an email list which you can get
therefore you get email sent right to you

00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:29.680
and he’s on Twitter.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.450
So Joe has made it really easy to stay in
touch and just staying on top of deals and

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.530
if you’re the kind of guy looking for deals,
I highly advise you either get on the email

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.530
list.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.710
Get on the RSS, feeder or just like them over
at Facebook.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.320
All right, well that’s my review of Dappered.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.820
I gave it a two thumbs up.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:55.040
A great website and I see a lot of positive
things in dappered.com’s future.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.820
This has been Antonio Centeno with “Real
Men, Real Style”.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.080
Take care.
