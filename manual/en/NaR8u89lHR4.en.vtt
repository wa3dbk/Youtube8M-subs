Episode 743 How to Make a Doll Soccer Field

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.700
For the soccer ball: 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.749
we'll be using a foam ball.

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:35.970
You can use small ones or big one depending on the
size of your doll.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.580
You can also use a ping pong ball for larger dolls 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.800
like American girls.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.200
To make the ball 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.800
Start by drawing a small pentagon in the center

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:52.819
then make extended lines on each vertices

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:00.179
Draw another pentagon at the tip of each line 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.800
And repeat until you there is no more space on the ball

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.680
To make the net cut straws or wooden dowels 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.650
to a height that will match your doll's height.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.650
make a frame attaching them together by using transparent tape

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.440
cut a piece of netting or tulle about the same size of the frame 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.760
and glue or sew it 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.350
to the frame

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.520
make 3 more frames for the sides and the top

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.520
and attach them together to form the net

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.040
you will need two nets one for each team

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.820
home

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.540
To make the field

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.740
you can use the printable templates from our website simplekidscrafts.com 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.369
and printed to fit the size of your doll or you can make your own field.

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:21.369
Draw and cut strips of cardboard

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.800
attach them using transparent tape

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.360
and on the reverse side decorate forming the field lines

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.400
by using white paper, cutting strips of paper

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.860
 as needed and shapes

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.900
and attaching them to the field

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.700
repeat for the other side of the field

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And now you have a portable field that you can take literally anywhere

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.100
To make the fence draw and cut strips of cardboard

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.000
If you want you can paint them

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.800
and then glue on ads on them

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.500
The ads can be downloaded from our website simplekidscrafts.com 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.819
to make one long strip you can glue on additional strips together 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.730
then make them fit the field by folding them 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.780
to match the same size and shape of the field

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.819
the cardboard bended into a rectangle will stand on its own.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.129
and that's it! Well this is the end of the video, I hope that you enjoyed it!
