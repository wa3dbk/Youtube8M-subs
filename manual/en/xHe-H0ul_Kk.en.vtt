00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.950
G'day I'm Brett.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.490
Now things are starting to heat up here down
in Australia

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.260
so I've ordered this.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.860
It's a product from Engine Watchdog called
a TM2 audible engine temperature alarm.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.019
This differs from your normal temperature
gauge as it monitors temperature directly

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.539
from the block using a simple sensor.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.180
It comes with a built in alarm so you set
the maximum temperature that you typically

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.210
run at

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.030
and if it goes above that the alarm will sound
warning you before your temperature gauge

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.070
even begins to move.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.800
So we'll put it in and see how we go.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.510
The kit contains everything you'll need for
the installation.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.050
Start by removing the fuse box cover

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.120
and then peel back the interior to expose
the firewall.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.090
Thread the sensor through the grommet

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.000
and feed the cable to an available bolt.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.920
Be sure to retighten any bolts to their specified
torque.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.800
Mount the unit with double sided tape or screws.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.030
I chose to hardwire the unit and install a
1 amp inline fuse.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.909
With the ignition on the maximum alarm temperature
displays for 2 seconds

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.430
before showing the current temperature.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.490
To change the maximum alarm temperature hold
in the button till the desired temperature

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.500
is displayed.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.680
The alarm sounds when the maximum temperature
is reached.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.450
A short drive around town

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.280
and the temperature runs at around 87 degrees
celsius.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.210
I took my truck out for a weekend camping
at Cunninghams Gap and exploring the Toowoomba

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.690
ranges.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.150
Plenty of big hills out there to put my engine
to the test.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.110
The alarm worked perfectly

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.120
reaching a max of 97 degrees celsius.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.819
I've set my alarm a few degrees higher than
this.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.469
I'd highly recommend getting one of these
units.
