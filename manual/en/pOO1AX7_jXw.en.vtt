00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.480
“Child Molesters are very tenacious people.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.920
They love molesting childs.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.820
It's crazy.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.000
It's like their favorite thing.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.660
I mean, it's so crazy, because when you consider the risk in being a child molestor,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.700
speaking not of even the damage you're doing, but the risk-

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.280
There is no worse life available to a human

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.600
then being a caught child molester.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.120
And yet they STILL DO IT.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.020
Which from you can only really surmise

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.480
that it must be really good,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.560
I mean, from their point of view

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.720
from theirs, not ours, but from their point of view.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.600
It must be amazing!

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.340
For them to risk so much...”

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.360
Is that joke offensive?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.940
Some people seem to think that it is.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.700
“What if victims are watching?
What if victim's parents are watching?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.060
It's such a sickening thing that happens to people

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.860
that I know comedians try to push the limit

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.260
and they sometimes take risks
and they don't work,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.340
but I think with something like child molestation
it's just not funny and he's too clever

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.140
like he could come up with a thousand different things.”

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.880
What are we really asking when we ask whether a joke, or a tweet or an image is offensive or not?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.440
We're not asking really whether someone was offended, are we?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.880
No. 
We're asking if what was said was morally right.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.680
How could somebody determine that?

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.240
How do we know when a joke, for example, is morally wrong?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.420
“..and I feel there is no forum that is acceptable for this! 
Ever!

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.920
I know somebody that was molested at three years old

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.380
Three years old, and there's nothing funny about it. No nightclub, no place ever deserves to have that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.140
be made fun of.”

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.560
That person seems to think that it's the effect of the joke that matters because child molestation is such

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.340
a sensitive subject, because the harm caused is so gruesome and lasting, because any lighthearted

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.500
mention of it could in some way diminish the suffering of victims or bring that pain back.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.040
Child molestation, as a topic, should be wholly avoided in the realm of comedy.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.000
Now that's certainly a persuasive argument. Comedy's purpose can't be to cause pain to innocent victims.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.740
But of course, that wasn't the purpose of Louis C.K.'s joke in the first place.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.780
It wasn't his intent.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.300
“It just comes down to one question: Intent. It's all about intent. It's only about intent.”

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.740
In that clip, Ricky Gervais argues the opposite of effect being the moral judge of a joke

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.680
and instead says that it's the comedian's intention that really matters in the end.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.060
Clearly, Louis C.K.'s intention in that joke is to use comedy to get us to think about society's attitude

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.840
and treatment of pedophilia.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.840
Perhaps, he intimates, that we revile this demographic too blindly, taking solace in our normalcy

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.100
when we know that the complexities of sexuality mean that the urge to pedophilia is not something chosen.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.880
Never does he forgive or validate the act. He takes it for granted that child abuse of any kind

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.780
deserves the harshest scorn and retribution.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.780
This, I think, is the intent and for many, the effect of this joke, a subtle indictment of our smug righteousness

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.260
and our fear of the lawlessness of sexuality in civilized society.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.900
Indeed, jokes are uniquely designed to deliver messages like this. They sneak into consciousness

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.360
past the barriers that normally defend against ways of thinking that threaten our comfort.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.880
Now, that’s not to say I totally agree with Gervais that intention is all that matters.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.720
Clearly it isn't. We have to be aware of both the intention and the unintended consequences of what we say.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.700
We all know that too often, those in privilege define the boundaries of morality,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.640
without taking into account the decidedly different experiences of those who've been subjugated

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.960
or marginalized or worse.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.820
These debates about political correctness and comedy have been happening more and more frequently

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.300
as the Internet has given voice to more and more people.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.820
I'm always amazed at how the arguments devolve so quickly into two opposing camps.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.580
One side will raise a concern about a joke and the other will come down hard defending jokes at all costs,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.580
lamenting the never ending encroachment of PC police and social justice warriors on free speech.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.320
“They just wanna use these words- ‘that's racist,’ ‘that's sexist,’ ‘that's prejudiced’

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.100
- they don't even ---- talking about.”

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.820
What all this says to me is that morality is messy. It shifts and changes.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.080
Now people often say that something went over the line, but there are no lines in morality.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.780
There's a no man's land, a nebulous fringe of very, very tough questions.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.160
The way I see it, great comedians are like detectives.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.920
Take a look at Luther or any other detective movie or TV show and it's easy to see that, as a society,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.840
we're sympathetic to the idea of letting detectives bend the rules for the greater good.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.780
This is because we understand that justice, like morality, is abstract. Detectives are trained

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.860
to navigate the swamps at the edges of justice and we give them the leeway to do so.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.260
My opinion is that our best comedians should be given the same reasonable leeway with morality.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.000
I don't know how the culture determines who's allowed to do this. There are no easy answers for that.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.620
I think when a comedian is inducted into the profession's highest ranks, we just sort of know,

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.680
though I see how unsatisfying an answer that is.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.420
Other than that, all we can do is look at the jokes, their intent, their effect, and whether or not we're laughing.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.400
But if we want our collective morality to remain nuanced and progressive, we have to let comedians

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.960
near the things we find uncomfortable or perhaps, even wrong.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.980
Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching. I wanted to let you know that I am

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.540
producing the Nerdwriter full time now, so I'm devoting all my time and effort into making the best

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.540
possible stuff for you, stuff that I think is, I hope, a cut above the torrent of content that is being pushed out

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.820
on the Internet everyday. So if you think that the Nerdwriter is something that you're not seeing

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:26.100
anywhere else online, on YouTube, I want to ask you to please support the channel by clicking here,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.920
here and pledging to my Patreon page, as little as a dollar. Everything helps.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.000
I should let you know that Nerdwriter's always going to be free, so if you can't afford it,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.420
I don't want you to pledge. But if you have a little bit left to spare, it would be much appreciated.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.800
So, thank you so much and here are some more videos.
