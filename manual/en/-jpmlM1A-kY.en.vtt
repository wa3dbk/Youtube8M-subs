00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:17.285
One of the first things you should do when
you encounter problems with your hard

00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:20.563
is to run a SMART test. SMART stands for
Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:25.485
Technology. It is something that is built
into your hard drive that allows it to

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:33.711
analyze itself and report to you any
problems it is having. Here is a hard drive

00:00:33.712 --> 00:00:40.907
Let's check its SMART status. Its basic
health check is "PASSED," however, this

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:46.112
is not always a good indicator of hard drive health.
If it is failed, for sure

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:49.908
you have serious hard drive problems. If
its passed, you still could have hard

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:56.552
drive problems, but just the beginnings.
To get more details, right click on your

00:00:56.553 --> 00:01:03.927
hard drive and select view details. In
the window that appears, you will see

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:09.252
quite a bit of information about your hard drive.
There are two specific tabs

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:14.436
that you need to take a closer look at.
The first one is the attributes tab.

00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:19.116
This shows the results of a number of
different tests and other things that SMART

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:28.441
keeps track of. If you notice here, two
of them are in red. Lets take a look at

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:35.706
this bottom one. This program offers us
some information about the kind of error

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:39.972
If you look below, it says "Notice, the
drive has a non-zero raw value." And

00:01:39.973 --> 00:01:44.436
then goes on to give some other information.
It has yet to flag the drive as

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:51.703
"FAILED," however, it does show that the
drive may be prone to failure in the

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:57.468
future. And it may be causing the errors
that you are seeing. After looking at

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:04.210
this, we can check out the error log
. This error log shows that this drive has

00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:10.976
193 errors, which is considerable amount.
I have also notice that every time I

00:02:10.977 --> 00:02:18.715
start this drive, it has another error.
So, down below, after selecting the

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:25.485
error, you can see quite a bit of
information about it. However, if you are

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:30.017
already at this point, where you have
errors, and attribute problems, most likely

00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:34.907
your hard drive is damaged and my advice
is that you create an image of your hard

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:41.603
drive. If you look on BM+'s basic menu,
you will see a task for creating hard

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:47.246
drive images. This will help you to cut your losses.
Hard drive problems only

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:52.254
get worse with use. Turning your computer
off and on will only push it one step

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.495
closer to the edge of failure. So the
best thing to do is cut your loses and

00:02:56.496 --> 00:03:04.426
create an image of your hard drive.
If the attributes and error log are

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:08.732
inconclusive, you can perform tests.
Tests do not always give accurate

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:15.768
information. This hard drive, I know
for sure, has crashed and is no longer

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:24.009
usable. I will perform an extended test, on it.
And here you can see that it is

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.532
performing the test. In a matter of a few
second it will take what should be a

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:36.822
many minute test. Yet it completed it
in about 5 seconds. So I can tell that

00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:40.526
something is not right. Even though it
passes the extended test, it still has

00:03:40.527 --> 00:03:49.468
problems. So do not depend too much on the tests.
Remember, if you any red

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:55.952
flags, make an image of your hard drive.
That way you will be sure to preserve

00:03:55.953 --> 00:04:02.945
whatever information is left.
