Greetings my fellow audience, this is CheesyErwin 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.339
This would be my first minecraft video

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.039
with my voice

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.179
Actually, this not a minecraft video but rather

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.459
Tekkit Lite

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:16.739
The latest

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.119
Tekkit version

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.029
with Minecraft 1.4.6

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.559
I been playing Tekkit for quite a while

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.689
Trying with a lot of crazy ideas

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.670
including the semi-automatic TNT cannon

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.670
But those were not very successful, and they end up blowing up themselves... Anyway, I am going to show you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.670
A delicate creation of mine, and quite nostalgic

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.130
Nuclear cannon!

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.030
Yes, a TNT cannon that shoots nukes.. Yep, I got a name for it:

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.480
"Trebuchet"

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.410
The "Trebuchet" 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.470
Nuclear Payload

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.620
 Delivery Device

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.370
Let's see how this thing works

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.660
It just works like... any kind of...

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.820
ordinary TNT cannons... but with

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.660
TECHNOLOGY! Yes, technology

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.660
Firstly, let me show you it's main components

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.680
The water chamber thing

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.610
That TNT charges drops into

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.679
And these are

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:43.679
The deployers that would auto-reload the gun.. And here, also a deployer and the slab, and this is where you place the nuke

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.289
But before you can fire the gun, you have to load it first

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:19.729
How to load it?

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.989
it's very simple

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.379
You just use the reload protocol remote thing

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.549
Right click it... you see?

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.909
It's loaded

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.469
With nuke, and the TNT charges

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:39.469
Well, once it's loaded, let's fire this beast

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.419
Because I previously fired the cannon once

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.290
It made

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.589
the big crater... bigger...

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.219
Yep, and this is your

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.789
Nuclear TNT cannon

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:32.150
Thanks for watching!
