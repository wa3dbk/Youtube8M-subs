Hi, I'm Eugenie.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.610
Today I'm making 5-ingredient lemon parmesan pasta. 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.960
For this recipe, you will need: 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.980
pasta, heavy cream, butter, lemon, and Parmesan.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.980
First, cook 4 oz of pasta according to the directions of the package. And drain the pasta.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.900
In the same pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over low heat. 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.940
And mix in 1/4 cup of heavy cream, lemon zest, and lemon juice of 1/2 lemon. 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.740
And mix in freshly grated parmesan cheese as much as you want. 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.740
Finally taste and season with salt and pepper. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.510
Voila, quick and healthy lemon parmesan pasta. 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.580
When I was a student, this is one of the first pastas I made along with blue cheese pasta.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.830
This will make quick lunch for lemon lovers. 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.630
And it will be a perfect side dish for turkey or chicken breast.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.160
Bon appetit.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.000
The flavor of lemon and parmesan is just perfect for me.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090
I love the simplicity of this pasta. 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.610
