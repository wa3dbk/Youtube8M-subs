00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.240
Today I'm going to repair a broken garage
door hinge, actually I have 2 broken hinges

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.210
I need to fix and I've never done this before.
But at the end of this video, you'll be able

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.560
to do this repair on your own and save a lot
of money.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.980
The hinges I'm repairing are ones that are
next to the track on the ends of the garage

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.400
door. As you can see, this hinge has completely
snapped.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.359
So the first thing you need to do is disengage
the door from the motor and then roll the

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.999
door all the way down.
Replacement hinges can be found at Lowe's

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.450
which is where I got mine but you can probably
find them at any big hardware store. The one's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.540
I bought were only $5.00 each. One thing you
will need to pay attention to is the number

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.600
on the package. I bought the number one hinges.
Each hinge position has a different number

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.430
as you can see from my door. It starts with
number one down at the bottom and then goes

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.550
up to number three. Taller doors may have higher
numbers than 3.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.580
That's because the track actually sits closer
to the door frame at the bottom than at the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.390
top of the frame. The hinges above number
one offset the rollers from the track so that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.320
the door will sit flush when completely closed.
And if you happen to buy the wrong number

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.159
hinge, don't worry about it. The cylinder
in the middle of all the hinges line up with

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.159
the number one hinge as you can see here.
And the top and bottom roller brackets are

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.700
totally different from the hinges.
So now that you know a little about garage

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:38.700
hinges, let's start replacing the broken ones.
I'll start by removing bolts from the bottom of the hinge and work my way up.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.639
--Drill Sounds--

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.930
Now just slide the roller out and keep it handy, we'll reuse that part again.
And here's our shiny new hinge ready to be

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.739
installed.
I'll do this all in reverse order starting

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.140
with the roller. Just slip it in the track
and slide the hinge over it like this.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.610
Now line up the holes with the openings in
the hinge and then place the bolts back in

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.610
starting from the top. And don't forget to
use the washer from the old hinge.

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:37.629
Once all the bolts are back in and the hinge
is nice and tight, I can start working on the other side now.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.600
--MUSIC and DRILL SOUNDS--

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.940
Ok so the second hinge is done and as youcan see, it isn't too hard to replace and I think anyone who's even slightly handy can

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.370
do it. And as I said in the beginning of the
video, I've never done this before and was

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.150
still able to make the repair easily.
So now the last thing to do is re-engage the

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.479
door to the motor and you're all set!
