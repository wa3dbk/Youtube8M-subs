Little Horde babies

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.440
You must be trollin'

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.880

when you were picking out your race

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.700

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.480
"au revior"

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.180
Like mucolytic agents

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.620
we're gonna make you choke

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.140
Our fist is an expectorant

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.660
we'll shove it down your throat

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.960
The Horde is like a virus

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.220

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.940

You try to step up like a champ

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.620
We’re gonna knock you to the floor

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.820
You’ll grovel like a chimp

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.840
“Don’t wanna’ do this anymore”

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.300

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.900

You think this battles over

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.880
but it's only just begun

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.180
You got a couple puny hammers

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.980
but our dwarves are makin' guns

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.300
You wanna put me in my place
