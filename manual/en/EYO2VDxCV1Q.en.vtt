00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.770
2014 was the hottest year since we started
tracking weather patterns in 1880; in fact,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.040
all the hottest years in the top ten have
been since 1998!

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.670
And 2015 is heating up too...

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.939
A heat wave is gripping southeastern India
and has, as of this taping, killed more than

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.710
2200 people, mostly in the states of Andhra
Pradesh and Telengana.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.679
Temperatures have topped 120 (49C) melting
roadways in the populous Asian nation.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.660
Like the Western United States, parts of India
are in a drought, and this being an El Nino

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.210
year, the country is likely to experience
a large number of typhoons -- same as a hurricane

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.780
or cyclone -- but less monsoon rain.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.010
If all this sounds bad, it's because it is
bad; but India's no stranger to heat waves.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.010
In 2003 and again in 2010, around 3000 people
died from heat waves in Andhra Pradesh.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.820
The Farmer's Almanac, that bastion of weather
knowledge, says heat waves are prolonged periods

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.600
of heat caused by high atmospheric pressure
impacting an area.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
When a high-pressure system pulls air from
the upper atmosphere toward the ground, that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.580
air compresses and heats up, holding other
weather systems at bay and settling over a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.680
wide area.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.170
These high-pressure systems can block cloud-cover
and inhibit winds; meaning the sun's heat

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.540
compounds the already warm, dense, stagnant
conditions.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.130
Under normal circumstances, we're INCREDIBLE
at cooling our bodies -- maybe some of the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.250
best animals on the planet at it.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.250
But in extreme temperatures, we simply can't
handle the heat.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.950
Part of the problem in Andhra Pradesh and
Telengana is the humidity is very high on

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.950
average.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.590
Sweat evaporates far more slowly in high humidity.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.450
No evaporation, no cooling; so the body sweats
MORE, causing dehydration!

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.420
When the body can't dissipate its heat, fainting,
cramps, heat exhaustion, or heatstroke can

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.420
result.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.250
These afflictions affect the elderly, sick,
young, and those in urban areas more prominently;

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.200
but essentially, the heat overwhelms the body's
ability to cool itself.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.100
Eventually, we stop sweating altogether -- that's
the red alert.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.380
Heat can cause muscle cramps or fainting,
due to electrolyte shortages lost during sweating.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.580
Obviously, you'll get thirsty as your body
tries to get you to replenish lost water,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.190
but as your brain becomes affected, symptoms
include dizziness, weakness, and becoming

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.670
uncoordinated, and nauseated -- that's when
you know it's hit the brain.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.260
As water loss peaks, the blood becomes thicker,
the heart can't pump it as well, the kidneys

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.980
can't clean it, and the oxygen levels drop.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.120
In response the heart tries to pump more blood
faster at an increasing rate.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.970
Which heats up the body, creating a feedback
loop causing cold, clammy skin, and eventually,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.970
death.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.930
Once thermoregulation fails, it's pretty much
a spiral into terribleness, which is why it's

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.210
so important for animals to stay cool.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.400
Anything over 104 is terrible, and that goes
for fevers too!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.970
These weather patterns occur naturally, though
they can be exacerbated by humans.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.290
For example, asphalt and concrete store heat
all day and then release it at night keeping

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.890
the environment from naturally cooling; this
is called the "urban heat island effect."

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.740
Additionally, global climate change or global
warming is also a culprit.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.790
In a 2014 Bulletin of the American Meteorological
Society, 20 teams looked at 16 events from

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.230
2013 and found human activity "greatly increased
the risk for the extreme heat waves."

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.190
And separately, five studies of Australia's
2013 heat waves found the "chances of observing

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.830
such extreme temperatures in a world without
[human-caused] climate change is almost impossible."

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.349
Seemingly singular problems like sea ice melt
causes more solar heat absorption by the darker

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.459
water, accelerating climate shifts tooâ€¦
causing more heat waves, and, possibly, more

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.459
deaths.

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.620
When the heat is on, make sure you stay in
the shade, cool off, and allow your sweat

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.019
to evaporate.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:25.000
Stay cool folks.
