00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.100
Now let us look at how to create
simple objects here in the Houdini interface

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.260
The most easiest way to create an object in the
Interface

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.650
is on the create tab here at the top

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.519
By clicking on any of the objects here in
the create tab

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.210
I get a bounding box here in the 3D video

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.360
Which lets me position the object
anywhere in the scene

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.880
By clicking with my mouse, I position it at
that location

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.250
Apart form that if I want to create the object
directly

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.540
at the origin of my construction plane

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.220
I can Ctrl + Click on the object
and it directly gets created at the center

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.160
Now using my manipulator tool
I can move the object and rotate to where ever I want to 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.920
Apart from this you'll also observe that every
time

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.550
I create an object, I'm creating specific
nodes here in my network view

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.329
These nodes represent the different objects
and as you can see

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.390
By clicking on them here in the Network view
I am also selecting them in the 3D view

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.070
Now also anytime I create an object
I get the parameters of the object here at the top

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.179
I can change the different elements of the
object

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.740
On how the object is actually being created

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.850
Right here at the top I can choose the
different settings I want to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.579
Now for creating objects, lets see
how to create them off the construction plane

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.069
When I'm clicking
on any of the objects here

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.789
You can see that I get a bounding box
which represents where the object will get created

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.869
If I hold the Shift key on the keyboard
and Move my mouse

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.600
you can see the object gets displaced
from the construction plane

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.670
And now I'm offsetting the object
and still get to place it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.209
Where ever I want in the scene but, this time
I get to place it exactly in 3 Dimensions.

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.939
Rather than only
on the construction plane.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.549
Now finally in the 3D view lets see how to
go ahead and edit the construction plane itself.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.999
Because most times you might want to
have a smaller or a larger construction plane.

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:59.079
To do this, open the camera menu
Here at the top right corner.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.560
Here enable the
Construction plane handle

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.200
When you enable this you get
additional gizmos here in the viewport

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.360
Make sure you're in the manipulator tool if
you're in

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.689
any other tool the construction handles are
grayed out

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.750
Now we can go ahead pull out the construction
plane

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.510
and edit the entire settings.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.409
you can also move it using
the movement handles in the center

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.159
and also go ahead and
rotate the entire construction plane.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.980
Once you've done all these edits
we can go ahead and create an object

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.450
And this time the object gets created on the
construction plane itself

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.260
which is no longer aligned to the world axis

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.640
Finally if you want to go ahead and reset
the construction plane you can go under the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.909
same menu

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.200
Down under set construction plane
as you can see we have several options here

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.459
I'll go ahead and select
Revert to defaults

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.530
Once I click this my construction plane
is back to defaults

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.000
Ill go back and tell turn off construction
plane handles

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.439
and I'm back to the way it was.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.069
There are a few other ways of
creating objects in Houdini

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.980
The other way of creating objects is
right here in the 3D view itself

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.010
You can go ahead and press tab and
this will open a small tab menu

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.340
where you can type in the object you want
to create.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.870
Lets say i want to create a box
so by typing in the word box

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.730
It Auto-completes and gives me
the option to create a box

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.250
By pressing enter, you can see I can create
it right here

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.719
without going into my create shelf.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.310
Apart from that similarly when I'm in the
network view

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.590
I can go ahead, press tab anywhere in the
empty region.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.540
And go ahead select any of the primitives
I want to create

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.890
or so many other elements which are available.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.510
Every single node that you create in Houdini
comes with additional flags on both ends of

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.140
the node

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.609
On this particular box node we have created
you can see the green and the blue flag

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.819
The blue flag signifies whether or not
an object is actually visible

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.819
So if i go ahead and zoom into the viewport
and disable this blue flag

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.180
you can see that the object is no longer visible
but it can still be manipulated

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.939
So I have just moved the box, while it was
invisible

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.590
and if I enable the View (flag) you can see
its displaced.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.810
Also, if I tell that the object should no
longer be selectable

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.880
I can no longer select the object here in
the 3D view

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.750
To observe this let me create another primitive
I'll go ahead and create a sphere

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.510
And now if i go ahead and try to select the
cube

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.030
you can see that I can no longer do so.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.660
But by clicking on the Box object here
I can easily select it

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.850
Whereas by clicking on the sphere
I can select that

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.060
So this is the selection handle which tells
if an object is templated.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.860
And this is the display flag which
tells if an object is hidden.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.880
So that brings us to the end of this particular
video

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.390
Here we saw the basics of creating and manipulating
objects

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.340
In the next video, I will walk you through
the basics of using expressions in Houdini.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.700
If you have any critiques, comments or doubts
about these videos

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.880
you can go ahead and put them in the comments
section

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.500
and I'll do whatever i can to help you
