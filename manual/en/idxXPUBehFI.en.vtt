00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:01.599
What’s up guys, hope you’re doing well.

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.750
So today I’m going to be talking about what
I hate about birthdays and today is actually

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.879
my birthday.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.750
I’m 24 years old.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.820
That’s…kind of old.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.540
That is ridiculous though.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.540
24?

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.540
Dang!

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.170
That’s almost 25, you see what I’m saying…and
that’s like almost 50.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.590
You know you’re getting old when you don’t
want to draft players your age in Madden…

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.180
…which brings me to my first point: age.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.520
After the age of 21, birthdays just serve
as a reminder that you’re getting old.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.940
But something that I really do hate about
birthdays is the Facebook notifications.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.721
I don’t know about you, but on my Facebook
I have a lot of friends who are actual friends,

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:35.230
I have some people who are acquaintances,
and then I have some people I don’t know

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.230
who they are.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.230
I don’t know how the heck we are friends.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.230
I don’t know!

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.579
And these random people always seem to be
the people that wish you a happy birthday…which

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.579
is fine.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.579
Thank you.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:44.579
Thank you for wishing me a happy birthday.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.239
However, I don’t want you to get upset when
I leave a four paragraph message to someone

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.030
I know and just like your comment.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.129
One day, I’m just going to remove my birthday
from Facebook.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.629
Then, I can see who my true friends really
are.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.800
Something else that always bothers me about
birthdays is when you go out…you go to a

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.920
restaurant…Red Lobster for example…

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
…Personal preference…

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.620
…of course your family and friends have
to say: It’s his birthday!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.620
And what do they do?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.350
They bring out a group of people and they
sing you happy birthday.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.860
But someone please tell me why you always
have to get the one tone-deaf guy.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.909
Now I’m sitting here embarrassed cause a
group of strangers are singing me happy birthday.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:13.990
I’m a grown man.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.990
I don’t need this.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.990
I didn’t ask for this.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.790
You’re embarrassed cause you can only sing
one note, apparently.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.820
You’ve got to do better.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.409
Let’s talk about gifts for a second, shall
we?

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.409
I believe we shall.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.680
Being a grown man, I don’t really need gifts.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.530
I can get myself what I want.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.530
I’m a grown man.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.060
I’m happy if you just get me a card.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.060
Just get me a card!

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.060
Or some black socks maybe.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.280
You can never have enough black socks.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.159
But please, please, please, don’t buy me
any sweaters, turtlenecks, spandex.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.740
These are things I don’t need in my life.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.740
Just give me a gift card.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.850
I’d rather take the gift card.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.009
Really, I’d rather take the cash.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.009
That’s what I would rather take.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.759
But, like I said: I don’t need anything.

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.499
I’m happy with everything that I have right
now.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.310
But if you do get me a sweater…

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.450
…I’m probably not going to wear it.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.829
But I guess the thing I hate the most about
birthdays is that people just use this day

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.759
as an excuse to be unnecessarily ratchet…to
the utmost.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.039
Dude I had four Jägerbombs right?

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.320
Like, I was just killing it…after I already
had the 12 Naty Lights.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.160
3 shots of vodka like it was nothing…like
I just blub, blub, blub.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.610
Blacked out four times.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.060
I don’t even remember what happened on my
birthday but it was still epic.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.360
So you don’t remember what happened, but
it was still a good birthday though?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.360
Yeah dude, yeah!

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.110
I guess what I’m trying to say is this:

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.050
We should celebrate life everyday, not just
on our birthdays…

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.800
…because who really knows how much time
we have left?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.630
Also, please don’t be ratchet.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.320
There’s no reason for you to be ratchet,
let alone on your birthday.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.490
But those are some of the things I hate about
birthdays.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.610
What do you hate about birthdays?

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.610

No videos every Sunday.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.590
No Jugamos Juegos.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.770
Throw me the alley.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.920
What’s up guys, hope you’re doing well.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.080
So today I’m going to be talking about things
I hate about Halloween.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.540
Let me just preface this by saying: my parents
never let me celebrate Halloween.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.760
Normally, when I say this I get one of two
reactions: Oh my goodness!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.340
I’m a grown man.
