Hi! My name is Scott Reil and on behalf of
Expert Village, I would like to talk to you

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:09.370
about container gardening. There are a lot
of different soils out there for container

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.260
mixes. I don’t like to use right off the
rack container mix because quite often its

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.840
got fertilizers already added, or its quite
simply just peat with pear light mixed in.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.530
I do organic culture. I like to mix a little
more readily available food in there, some

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.270
more humus and whatnot. So I am going to show
you how to make a good organic mix for containers.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.860
The first thing to start with is some good
old fashioned potting mix. Now for a lot of

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.210
people, this is the one step that will get
them the rest of the way. And would I be able

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.190
to grow in my container mix like this? Well,
yeah probably but again, heat does not break

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.950
down readily and when it does break down,
it tends to be kind of acidic and the pear

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.899
light doesn’t break down at all. There’s
not a lot of extra food here for my plants,

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:10.612
so what I like to do is to add in gardening
soil, in this case from my friends at the

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:17.790
Coast of Maine. And it’s made with a lot
of extra humus, with kelp, with other fertilizers

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.380
in it that are going to help add a lot of
organic component in humus, and you can tell

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.340
just to look at it how black and rich this
is. Now we are really adding some organic

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.549
content back to the soil. It is going to make
it a little bit heavier than the original

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.360
mix would but that’s okay with me. Again,
it worked building a good organic soil it

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.040
is going to have the fungal structures and
things that will help keep it a white open

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:56.960
area soil like woodland soil. One last secret
for me is cocoa mulch. Now with that same

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.689
idea in mind, cocoa mulch has a white springy
texture. I go back to compact and it just

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.629
bounces right back to shape. Cocoa mulch.
Although the name would suggest that it is

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.889
mulch, I don’t like it as a mulch, but I
love it for the soil amendment, because it

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:24.019
helps build so those fungal soil strains that
really work well. Now I am going to mix a

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.969
big batch of this because we have a lot of
containers to do but this is something that

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:35.489
you could certainly mix yourself in smaller
quantities. So I mixed about 3 parts of potting

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:44.139
mix to 1 part soil to 1 part cocoa mulch and
I am going to give that a good fluffing up

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.930
with a fork, give it a good mix and I’ll
be ready to pack containers in just a minute.
