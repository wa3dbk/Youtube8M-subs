00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.430
So I'm going to make this beautiful mushroom
risotto. Slightly different twist on the tale.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.960
So sofrito's the base. It's chopped white
onions and a little bit of celery. And then

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.310
I want to add the risotto rice. I'm using
arborio rice, you can use carnaroli. A handful

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.779
per person.
Now while that's doing that, here I've got

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.390
some dried porchini. So what I'm going to
do is get a bit of my stock. So I'm just going

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.140
to give them a couple of minutes.
So my rice is sounding a little hot, and what

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.530
I'm going to do and you could use white wine
at this stage, but I'm going to use vermouth

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.580
which is absolutely fantastic.
Now as soon as that's gone in we want to stop

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.559
the frying and we want to go into risotto
mode adding small ladles of stock every minute

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.399
or so and giving it a little stir up.
Literally after a minute, right, beautiful

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.650
porchini and look in there. I mean already
chicken stock and dried mushroom taste is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.250
incredible.
In with the mushroom stock. Now here, look.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.030
Here on the board just chop them up and straight
in every last bit.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.209
All I have to do now is keep adding stock
and stirring it. Massaging out all the starch

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.209
until it's ready.
Now while that's just finishing off, here

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:31.020
I've got some lovely wild mushrooms. I've
got the girolle, pied de mouton, chanterelle,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.920
with the mushrooms, what I want to do is I
want to put them dry in and around this screaming

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.200
hot griddle pan.
Risotto is done. What I need to do definitely

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.100
while it's hot is get a knob of butter. I
want a nice handful of Parmesan, going to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:57.420
mix this up. Beat that up. Lid, let it chill
out. Whilst that off the heat, let's have

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.520
a little look over here.
These mushrooms should be toasted. I'm going

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.259
to get these mushrooms, I'm going to pick
some nice herbs. I love chervill, very, very

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.500
nice. I've got some parsley, tarragon. Most
of that in there, leave a bit for garnish.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:24.120
Now, tiny bit of oil. Now let's get a lemon.
Squeeze half that lemon into there, while

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.040
these are nice and warm and while the risotto
is resting. Let's plate it up. Lovely.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:39.720
Just spoon this on beautiful risotto. Beautiful
look at that. And then we get a little handful

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.970
of our beautiful mushrooms and we just splay
them all over the top like that.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.640
Then I get get a little knob of butter and
put that in the middle there and it will start

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.880
to melt. Now just give it a tiny, tiny little
grate.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.110
Look at that.
