00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.420
well I've got a pile of old wood here from
some salvaged cabinets and I just got a new

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:40.699
bandsaw so I'm thinking I can make a bandsaw
box or two out of this.

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.899
with my slabs done I can glue on my pattern
the design that I'm going with is not my own

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.829
design it's somebody else's design that I
seen a lot on the internet. and I'm not trying

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.219
to re-invent the wheel here.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:01:18.009
I really like this design and im just mainly
trying to get some bandsaw experience.

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.941
by removing the legs on the center section,
once we put this back together and glue it

00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:29.510
all in place were going to have the appearance
of a four legged chest of drawers.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:50.909
Now I just need to glue the front piece on
to the main body and start cutting my drawers.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:08.420
couple things to mention real quick.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.569
I should have cut the crack before I cut the
back off.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.010
Luckily I'm making three so I'm learning as
I go.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.650
And, on the second one that's exactly what
I did.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.989
I cut the crack before I cut the back off.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.570
Also, in order to cut these other drawers
out you need to cut the actual support in

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.629
between each drawer to get into this cavity.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.569
Now I've got to go back and glue all of this
together and using these reference lines to

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.480
make sure that everything is lined up nice
and neat.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.450
Once all my drawers are cut out and the back
and front are removed I can cut out this center

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.860
section to make a cavity to form an actual
drawer.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:03:08.349
With all my drawer piece cut I can sand the
inside and then glue my front and back piece

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:16.439
back on.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:28.840
I've taken some of this really dark green
poplar and made some simple pulls out of it.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:51.020
It's just a little strip of wood with a round
over on both sides.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.020
So that's it.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.980
A couple jewelry boxes from trash wood that
would otherwise be rotting away in a landfill

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.980
right now.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.960
I want to give a big thanks and a shout out
to Steve Carmichael at the Carmichael workshop

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960
.com.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.650
Last year he made a really cool bandsaw box,
jewelry box, for his daughter.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.040
That was the inspiration for me to go ahead
and make one of my own.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.710
Like I said this isn't my design.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.980
I found it on the internet.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.780
If you click the link in the description below
to go to my website I will show you where

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.660
you can find the template for this and also
you can check out Steve's video.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.650
The third one, I've been saying the third
one, I'm making three of these the whole video.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.920
It's going to be painted and I'll show you
that in a couple weeks on my website when

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.120
I get around to it.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.610
But, anyway guys.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.610
Thanks for watching.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.320
And I hope you guys have a great day.
