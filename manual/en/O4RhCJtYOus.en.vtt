00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:16.427
She's one of the best investigators I had.

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:17.891
But? - She's different.

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:18.905
What way?

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:20.206
In every way.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:22.130
Something wrong with the report?

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.031
Anything you chose not to disclose?

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.791
He's clean in my opinion.

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:29.735
He's honest.

00:00:29.736 --> 00:00:31.736
Our credibility isn’t dead yet.

00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:32.737
Mine is.

00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:36.895
He’s had a long-standing sexual relationship
with his co-editor of the magazine.

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:39.097
Sometimes he pleasures her. 

00:00:39.098 --> 00:00:41.327
Not often enough, in my opinion.

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:43.965
No, you're right not to include that.

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.677
I need your help.

00:00:46.678 --> 00:00:49.170
You come stay on the island.

00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:53.531
A way of avoiding all those
people you might want to avoid right now.

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:58.234
You will be investigating thieves, misers, bullies,

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:02.674
- the most detestable collection
of people that you will ever meet...

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:04.202
My family.

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:06.804
This is Harriet.

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:09.234
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:13.654
And for the past forty years
has been trying to drive me insane.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.031
Those are from her.

00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:20.080
The rest... from her killer.

00:01:21.507 --> 00:01:23.824
You failed to adapt to four foster homes

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.530
arrested twice for intoxication,

00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:27.531
twice for assault.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.509
How many partners have you had in the last month?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.254
And how many of those were men?

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.005
I should have control of my money.

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:36.954
And you will.
Once you learn to be sociable.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:39.560
Why don't we start with me?

00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:42.032
You know what to do.

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:46.640
I can't find something you've been
unable to find in forty years.

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:50.129
You don’t know that.
You have a very keen investigative mind.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.358
You were here that day?

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.533
A terrible day. 
Searching and not finding.

00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:56.391
I never found a body.

00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:58.540
Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated?

00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:00.897
Did she know something someone
wished she didn’t?

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:05.698
The last time I reported on something
without being absolutely sure,

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:07.044
I lost me my life savings.

00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:08.546
I need a research assistant.

00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:11.939
I know a excellent one.  She did the
background check on you.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.218
The what?

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.971
You don't think we could hire just anyone
for something like this?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.292
It's Mikael Blomkvist.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.440
May I come in?

00:02:22.104 --> 00:02:23.185
We need to talk.

00:02:23.186 --> 00:02:25.455
Hey! Hey, who do you think you are?

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:27.516
Put some clothes on and 
get rid of your girlfriend.

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:29.570
Can I call you Lisbeth?

00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:32.753
I want you to help me
catch a killer of women.

00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:37.543
I have absolutely no idea how they’re 
connected to the death of a 16 year old girl

00:02:37.544 --> 00:02:39.694
Don't you need to look over these? - I got it.

00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:43.413
It’s better to look at
what I’m about to show you

00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:44.519
on an empty stomach.

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:47.503
What are you doing here?
Reading your notes.

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:49.820
They’re encrypted.
Please.

00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:53.351
Rape.  Torture.  Fire.  Animals.
Religion.

00:02:53.352 --> 00:02:54.672
Am I missing anything?
The names.

00:02:55.073 --> 00:02:56.240
I may have something.

00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:58.425
Nobody likes people poking around
in their lives.

00:02:58.528 --> 00:02:59.619
Everybody knows why you're here

00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:05.070
Someone killed her. Someone on the island that day. 

00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.673
"If a woman approaches any beast
and dies with it.

00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:12.087
He shall kill the woman and the beast."

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.730
Soon you'll know us all only too
well - with my apologies.
