Ron Colby here with Gary Yamamoto Custom Baits.
One technique that a lot of people have just

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.850
forgot about; they don’t use it very much
anymore, but we’ve been using a lot here

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.200
at Lake Pal and catching stripers with it.
I’ve been using it a lot across the country

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.550
catching large mouth, small mouth, and spotted
bass with it too, and that’s spooning. Talking

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.000
about spoons not the ones you eat your cereal
with in the morning, but heavy heavy spoons.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.309
You fish very vertically. You can fish them
anywhere from 20. I would say 20-25 feet is

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.250
the minimum for shallowness and go all the
way down to 100 feet of water in the late

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.219
winder time with stripers using great big
sardine looking…This is a 3 ounce spoon,

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.730
this is like a 1 ounce spoon. Okay, one of
the things you want to do if you’re doing

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.520
spoons, you wan to make sure you have good
split rings on your back. I change out my

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.080
hooks. Go to a good Gamamkatsu hook. I usually
change to an oversized. Now, this one is a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.440
little too big, but it’s big for the big
stripers we’re catching here at Pal. I always

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.380
put a split ring on the nose of the hook.
That’ll help the bait fall. A lot more action

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.470
on it during the fall. I don’t do this a
lot, but if you’re getting a lot of line

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.540
twist, especially if you’re using spinning
reels or something like that to do your spooning

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.880
with and you hate the line twist, you can
put a nice little barrel swivel up on that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.970
split ring and tie it to it. That’ll even
give it more action as it’s falling and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.100
it’ll help get that line twist out of your
line. What you want to be using for your spooning

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.810
rods is generally a very stiff rod. You want
something with a lot of backbone; you want

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.720
something with extremely fast tip all the
way up. Generally, you want something with

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.120
a very long, like 7 foot is the minimum. If
you’re fishing really deep, you’ve got

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.720
to really set the hook on the fish hard and
move a lot of line and the line stretch. If

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.430
you use a long rod, very heavy line, 16 pound
test the lightest and all the way up to…a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.450
lot of guys will use 80 pound braid and stuff.
You want heavy line, heavy rods and a nice

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.099
spoon, and this is what they end up looking
like after you get done catching a lot of

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.409
fish.
