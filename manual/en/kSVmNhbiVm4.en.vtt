00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:06.550
Hold on,

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.796
not so fast. You know my motto:

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:10.909
"I have nothing to say; I am just answering questions."

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:12.852
Of course that was what I was looking for: it was my goal

00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:14.352
to create a style; a style that no longer existed.

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:20.975
If I had to define Chanel, I would say that she was the first stylist

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.491
to give women a modern attitude that didn't exist before.

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:26.983
She wasn't just a shopkeeper.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:28.423
She had her own look, her own style

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.238
and she was probably more entertaining than the others.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.279
Coco was someone who understood nothing, yet everything;

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:36.988
that is to say that she understood herself.

00:00:37.128 --> 00:00:39.893
She saw herself as being perfect,

00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:41.990
in tune with her times.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.440
Chanel brought us...herself

00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:46.624
and that was already something.

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:48.725
Chanel left us her style,

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.165
instantly identifiable.

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.207
It is timeless, but it is also in style.

00:00:54.327 --> 00:00:56.878
Her style belongs to another period

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.010
but it has survived, and adapted itself

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.999
to the modern world and all the following decades.

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.145
Fashion is... Advancing!

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:07.477
It cannot go back. There is no going back.

00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:09.565
Chanel elegance

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:13.311
is an attitude, a spirit, a certain abnegation

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.987
of feminine frilliness.

00:01:16.107 --> 00:01:17.954
I am the first to admit

00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:20.659
that she invented something tremendous: the Chanel suit,

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.337
the feminine version of the two-button suit;

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.803
and this started a

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:30.041
"fashion avalanche" - there is no other word for it -

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:32.411
that everyone copied, and that people

00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:35.253
continue to copy in an incredible way.

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:36.839
The hallmarks of Chanel, it's funny,

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:37.972
because, in fact,

00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:41.740
if you look at the 50's collections, the end of the 50's,

00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:43.649
there are very few chains,

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:44.876
there is no "CC"

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:46.507
and there are no camellias,

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:49.323
but in the 80's we had to pull out all the stops

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:50.802
because otherwise

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:55.059
it would just have been a posh, unassuming tweed suit with a little bow.

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:57.490
These are things that I drew out,

00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:58.434
exaggerated,

00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:00.629
and which I made people believe

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.977
had always existed. But that's my job.

00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:05.459
I don't sit down and say, "we're going to do some Chanel."

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.000
Honestly, I now do it unconsciously.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.743
I cannot give you the formula, because there is no formula.

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:14.259
When you buy Chanel, you are buying an idea

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.876
that is more or less unconscious,

00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:18.698
depending on your knowledge of this history.

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:20.084
The Chanel style is an idea,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.456
but this idea is now in a kind of collective memory

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.549
and that is very rare indeed.

00:02:25.823 --> 00:02:28.181
It is a legend that can be viewed.

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:30.835
It is a cosmopolitan legend.

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:34.076
It is globalization before globalization ever existed.

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:35.850
And that is genius.
