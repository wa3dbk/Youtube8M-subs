00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.830
Hey, I'm Nate from Design Squad.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.460
My neighbors, who live on
the third floor, have a cat,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.600
and I get to feed the cat
when they're on vacation.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.960
Trouble is,
I don't want to have to walk

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.630
up two whole flights of stairs
every time I feed the cat.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.300
So I decided
to build a little system

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.600
that will help me feed the cat

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.200
that's all the way up there,
while I'm still down here.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
I decided the best way

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.400
to make the cat feeder system
work would be to use a pulley,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.100
because it's a great way to lift
things high into the air.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.660
Now, to make the pulley work,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.160
I needed a way
to mount it to the railing.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.000
To set up a way
to mount the pulley,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.900
I figured a C clamp
would be a great way to do it.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.800
Now, earlier,
I made a prototype version.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
I wanted to put
the C clamp like this,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.230
because it seemed like
a pretty good place to put it.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.830
The pivot point
would be over here,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.000
and the pulley could
lift the cat food up.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.230
But I figured out that
actually makes the cat food

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.560
spill all over the place.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.930
It's a good thing
I did that as a prototype

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.500
instead of the final version.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Otherwise I'd be up here,
trying to make it work

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.530
and not knowing what to do.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.260
First, we're going to
mount our pulley mount,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.460
which is the C clamp,
onto the railing.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.400
Next we're going
to put on the spool,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.330
and this is what we're
using as our pulley.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.600
It's really just
a spool of fishing line,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.730
and I put some tape around it
to keep the line on there.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.130
This is nice because there's
a hole through the middle.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.060
It's just about the right
size to fit onto the handle

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.760
for the C clamp.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.700
All right, let's just
see how this lines up.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.900
Check out how much easier
the pulley makes it

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.830
to move the rope over the axle.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.000
When I pull from below,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.260
Whoop!

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.400
If we were just draping
the rope over the axle,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.800
there's a lot
of resistance there.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.300
We'd be working against
a lot of friction

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.230
and it would be a lot more
difficult than it needed to be.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.200
Instead the pulley acts like a
wheel and makes it a lot easier.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.330
I cut the bottom out
of the milk jug,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
because it makes
such a good funnel,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.400
and then on the bottom,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.100
an easy place where
I can put the tube on,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.160
that will guide the
food right into the dish.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.660
Not too bad.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.730
Now I just need
the string to work.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.400
We'll be pulling
from the bottom.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.630
Ah, yeah.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.100
That could do it.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.430
Now that the pulley
seems to work,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.800
I think it's time to try it out.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.600
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.900
Yes! It worked!

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.500
Can you think of other ways
to make a cat feeder?

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.460

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.430
Kitty...

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.830
the food's up there!

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.530
(cat meows)
