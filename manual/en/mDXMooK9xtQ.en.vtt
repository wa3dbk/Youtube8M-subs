Hi I'm Josh from eSpares and in
this video

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.460
I'm going to show you how to fit a
multi-position switch

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.810
on your hob. Hob's can have two
different types have switches one is a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.770
simmerstat,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.230
and that's a variable position switch
which can be set to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.800
any position within its rotation.
Other hob's

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.330
use a multi position switch like this
one

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.570
and this has fixed positions that it can be

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.990
turned to. The process for fitting
either a multi-position switch

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.210
or simmerstat is very similar and
in this video I'm using a micro mark

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.670
hob,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.850
but the process should be fairly similar
for most types

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.680
hob. Now before we begin make sure
the your hob

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.770
is turned off at the mains.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.880
Most hobs are also hard wired it's so you
won't actually be able to unplug it

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.970
but if you want to be extra safe you can
turn it off the

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.670
fuse board as well. Hob's tend to be
set into a cavity

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.189
in the worktop and some are also clicked
in place

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.880
underneath for safety. Just have a
check before you try to get yours out

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.460
that it isn't clicked in place

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.140
underneath. Obviously if it is just and
do those clips so that

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.320
you can lifted out. And once you've got
it out the first thing you need to do

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.320
is removed the knob on the switch that
you're replacing now most cases these simply

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.840
pull

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.120
straight off like so.
Once you've got the knob off

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.970
the next thing to do is grab some 
pliers or a spanner

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.409
and undo the nut that's holding the
switch

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:47.400
onto the hob. 
Now I've got the nut off

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.000
I can just turn the whole hob onto its front

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.520
and very gently lay it down and I now need
to separate

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.830
this base plates from the restive the
hope now on this one it's held in

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.159
by four screws here so I'm just gonna go
ahead and

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.030
unscrewed those.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.939
So I got those four screws off I can
just lift that base plates

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.290
straight of and I'll just pop that  to one side.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.329
And here

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.650
we can see the switches underneath.
Now this is the switch on going to

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.439
be replacing. In normal circumstances

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.900
we tell you to take a photo of the
connections

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.709
as a reminder of how to fit the new part.
But in this case there is actually

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.810
a couple have wires that are same color so
there is potential for them to be

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.430
mixed up when you're swapping them
over. So for that reason

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.010
it's actually better to simply swap one
wire

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.189
onto the replacement switch at a time
and that means you're

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.209
less likely to get them muddled up 
and these are simple

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.319
spade connector wires so you can just pull
them straight of

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.959
and then fit them onto your replacements
switch.

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.150
Okay so now I've swapped 
the connections over

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.680
I can take the old switch out and pop
the new one

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.469
in its place. And I'm just going to

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.010
refit the nut to the shaft of the switch
on the other side

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.809
to make sure it's in the correct
position.

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:35.489
Now that's in place I need to reattach
the baseplate

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.900
and now all that remains
is to fit the knob

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.269
back onto shaft.
And that's it

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.790
now if you've had to disturb the seal that
was fitted

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.370
around the hob when you were lifting it
out of the worktop

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.980
you can either buy the actual
hob seal from eSpares.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.859
Or you can just use some draught
excluder set around the edge of the hob just

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.489
to make sure it's sitting properly

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.659
into the cavity.
