00:00:39.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But before started warm up,first exercise for flexibility its a progrssion for bridge it looks like this.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:20.000
this progression its very simple very easy begin with that if you can make the bridge,the second exercise its bridge

First progression for kick up its very simple put knee above head do this 5 times after you can pass to the next progression

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The same position and rise the leg and push with arms,this progression need to do 5 time each after you are ready do do kick up

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Try to do kick up soft surface mats,grass,sand because initially you will hurt,i try a lot initially and i hurt my legs,my back
