00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.490
It's such important thing to have a way that
you can bring value clients. And every way

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.429
that we've come up with to help them do that
has, innovation has been at the core of it.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:21.400
ILS was founded by myself and a couple partners
in 1996. So we got into the business doing

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.340
flexographic, conventional printing. You know
we were being successful but we really didn't

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.420
have a unique proposition to offer that other
companies had.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.739
We had no niche markets. We were dealing with
600, 800 printers in this local area. So when

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.840
we've grown since 2005, when we got involved
in digital, our company has grown exponentially.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.140
And since 2005, we've really focused almost
exclusively our investment on the digital

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.710
side.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.710
When you look from 2005 to 2014, the growth
and maturity of the digital market is phenomenal.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.030
Years ago when digital printing launched in the
marketplace it started to change how labels 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.750
were about speed and efficiency and cost to
something that was a key component of marketing.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.140
The HP Indigo 20000 is a game changer for
us. It gives us an entire different marketplace

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.370
that we can bring the values that we've been
bringing on label side can now be brought

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.210
to the flexible packaging market.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.640
With the introduction of the HP 20000 what
has happened is, it's taken that advancement

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.040
and taken it to flexible packaging and also
shrink sleeves in a way the market's been

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.720
longing to go.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.720
So the 30 inch press is a dramatic change.
Today we work with 13 inch wide rolls.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.920
30 inches -- two-and-a-half times the print width
-- it's really going to be a game changer

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.920
as far as the types of products and how we
can produce those products on the press.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.990
Whether you're a small company or a big company
you don't want to have a lot inventory, you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.210
don't want to have a lot of waste. The digital,
and the 20000 makes it so easy for that because

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.200
you can have it on demand. You don't have
any waste because you're going to get exact

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.950
amounts that you need.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.640
The print quality is a feature that's key
to digital. Digital is utilized to print actual

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.240
photographs that are very high quality. The
HP Indigo 20000 offers us and our customers

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.580
a unique opportunity. It can now deliver the
level of quality that only gravure printing

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.780
could do in the past.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.450
The workflow efficiencies that we get are
tremendous because now we can send a file

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.200
directly to press. We don't have to have plates
made. We don't have to wait for that part

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.980
of the process to happen. It's really, really
a huge advantage and something that has allowed

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.790
us to really expand our business because of
those efficiencies that we're able to bring

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.230
into our operation.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.790
What I think is so important is the merging
of talent. The innovation at ILS, the innovation

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.400
at HP, to be able to have a good outcome.
And any week of the year you'll see somebody

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.900
from HP in here and really helping us be successful.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.060
Clients are going to find ways to bring their
product to market, to differentiate themselves.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.720
And digital is going to be the solution that's
going to allow them to do it.
