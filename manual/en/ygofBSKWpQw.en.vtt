00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:15.280
Welcome to this video in which we are going
to show and make a short review of a Puma

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.800
fixed knife called Original Bowie.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:28.130
As you can see, this knife is made by famous
Company Puma, based in Solingen Germany.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:38.100
Solingen is a city in Germany, which is most
famous for knife making over centuries.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:48.469
And Puma is one of, how to say, really well-known
companies for this city and is mainly specialized

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.039
in hunting knives.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.609
Which are precisely made, mostly handmade
and have a really high quality.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.289
This original Bowie is also handmade.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:09.170
It comes with a certificate, which shows when
knife was made, this particular piece was

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:19.880
made in 2013, it also shows all the instructions
how to sharpen the knife, how to use knife,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.500
about warranty information, everything what
you have to know about your knife, when you

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.979
buy one.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.220
These instructions are in English and in German.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:44.240
The knife itself comes in really nice leather,
dark brown sheath, which has also a sling

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.159
for attaching it to the leg or you can also
attach it to your belt and then on your leg.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:01.600
It has interesting two safeties for the knife,
so even if you unleash this traditional safety

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:13.829
the knife still stays in the sheath, so you
have to remove this sling and here you go.

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.020
This is Original Bowie made by Puma.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.799
You can see here, each knife gets measured
for the hardness.

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:31.410
It was tested here, before it leaves the company.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.329
And as you can see, this knife is quite big,
it is long, not too heavy and has a traditional

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.640
Bowie design.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:57.350
It is almost, well it is 28 centimeters long,
the blade itself is 15.5 centimeters long,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:06.070
it has a thickness of 4 millimeters and is
a one piece, full tang design.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.410
The blade goes from here all the way to here,
to the end of the handle.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:27.229
It weight 200 grams and is made of 440 C stainless
steel, it has a satin finish and for handle

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:34.250
material a natural stag horn is used.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:43.060
It has really nice finish and is very durable
natural material.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:55.280
Smooth, as you can see in some parts this
material is polished, it is not satin anymore

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.890
like the blade.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.489
So it was really a lot of attention was invested
in the details in this knife, when it was

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.489
produced.

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:14.560
The knife is handmade, so you can that every
piece has some unique features.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:27.230
The knife also has a steel bolster, here,
between the handle and the blade.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:41.350
And it has a brass sling hole, and brass bolsters
for the handle.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:52.120
It is robust, reliable but still precisely
handmade knife made by Puma in Solingen Germany.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.970
