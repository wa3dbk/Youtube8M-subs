Hey guys, welcome back to the drum fill blog.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.290
We have a linear fill today.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.039
It's gonna be 3-4-3-4-2, right.

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:11.990
Um, so, you're going to start each grouping
on the bass drum.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.690
One, Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One,
Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, and then

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.779
you do your two; One, Two, right.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.300
One, Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One,
Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One, Two,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.300
right.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.300
Now in the grouping of three, each grouping
of three, you're gonna do note number three

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.990
on the high tom.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:51.649
One, Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One,
Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One, Two.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:06.410
One, Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One,
Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One, Two

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:32.990

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.650
One, Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One,
Two, Three, One, Two, Three, Four, One, Two

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.940
That's a fun combo!

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.370
All right guys, hey let me know how that one
is working out for you.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.060
Take it nice and slow
Play all of the notes on the snare drum nice

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.060
and soft.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.270
All right.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.380
It'll blend a lot better.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.690
