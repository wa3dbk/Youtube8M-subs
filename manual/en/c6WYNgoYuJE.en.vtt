00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:19.600
You may ask yourself
what the g-tron is.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.153
The "g" stands for gas,
green gas for the Netherlands.

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:30.393
We've made an elaborate video about
green gas, but I'll give you the summary.

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:38.695
Green gas is produced from river
sludge, manure, and garden waste.

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:41.353
It is injected into the gas network.

00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:47.357
It's very clean, low CO2 emissions
from both tank-to-wheel

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:53.781
(the moment you fill up) and well-
to-wheel (when the fuel is produced).

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.187
Green gas scores well on both.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.737
This is the A3 g-tron.
Let's start with the USP.

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:10.686
14% additional tax liability.
Some cars in this class have it,

00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:12.418
but not many.

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:15.406
If you want to drive
environmentally friendly:

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.310
CO2 emissions from a green gas car
are lower than a fuel efficient diesel.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.250
This sounds great,
but how does it work?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.140
Audi had the advantage that they
started anew with the MQB platform.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.343
We've heard that name before,
a modular build.

00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:41.558
They took plug-in hybrids and
green gas versions into account.

00:01:41.857 --> 00:01:50.782
CNG cars of old had disadvantages.
The tank had an inconvenient location,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.574
but this A3 has as much trunk
space as the A3 Quattro.

00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:06.283
The choice of engine
and gearbox is simple.

00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:11.226
There's only a 1.4 TSI with
double clutch S-tronic available.

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:13.756
No manual. Unfortunately you
don't get to shift gears yourself.

00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:18.065
The 1.4 TSI has 108 hp
and 148 ft lb torque.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.190
It's no rocket, but the S-tronic
keeps up with traffic.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.972
The gearbox thinks along
and shifts fast.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.289
The numbers, very important:
0-62 mph in 10.8 seconds.

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:37.664
The top speed is 122 mph.
I'd like it to be more.

00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:40.228
On the other hand, it has
14% additional tax liability.

00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:45.233
When looking at other
14% cars, this is it.

00:02:52.447 --> 00:02:55.232
You don't notice driving
on green gas.

00:02:55.232 --> 00:03:00.167
There's no transition like
with LPG tanks, a little jolt.

00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:04.510
The computer has more
options to show the range.

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:09.236
Driving on green gas only or
combined with gasoline.

00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:15.003
Thanks to the gasoline tank
you'll have a huge range.

00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:20.842
About 870 miles in total;
250 on green gas and 620 on gasoline.

00:03:20.842 --> 00:03:25.913
If you drive efficiently, which I
don't do, but you'll get very far.

00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:30.198
Now, where to fill up with green gas?

00:03:30.638 --> 00:03:34.480
It can't be done everywhere,
but in a lot of places.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.226
125 gas stations in the Netherlands.
They're right off the highway,

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:45.168
so you'll have to make a small detour,
but it shouldn't have to be a drama.

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:54.621
The base model is 28.900 euros,
but you can opt for some features.

00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:58.111
There's the S line and
Pro Line S packages,

00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:01.482
so you won't have to show off driving
a 14% additional tax liability car.

00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:03.329
You can configure a nice car.

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:10.075
What's more to realize: green gas
is clean and inexpensive.

00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:14.680
The price is about 1.06 euros at the
moment and is not linked to oil prices,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.226
so there won't be
a high increase there. 

00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:29.800
