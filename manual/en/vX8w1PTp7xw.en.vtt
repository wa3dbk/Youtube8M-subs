00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.070
 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.980
 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.049
The speaker, and I say speaker because

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.210
on the bottom it may appear that you have two speakers, a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.940
stereo speaker setup but you don't I'm afraid. It's a mono speaker

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.530
and then a mono microphone.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.620
Now the speaker on this is incredibly loud

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.670
I mean I am not kidding you here it's one of the loudest speakers I've ever

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.730
heard on a mobile device and the clarity is
actually quite remarkable.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.640
I would put it just under the HTC One
and well above the Galaxy S4.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.970
The Galaxy S4, because of the way the speaker is on the back

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.150
a little raised bump, it suffers from vibration and distortion something rotten.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.710
HTC One is still right now the king of all the mobiles

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.850
those front facing stereo speakers are just
glorious

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.530
but the Nexus 5? Wow! It's actually so loud

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.290
that yesterday when I was listening to some music on it I had  to actually turn it down because

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.120
my ears were starting to hurt so that gives you some idea

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.450
as to the kind of volume this thing can pump out.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.720
Now, when I've been listening to music on it
I have been making a point of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.720
not using  the equalizer which effectively can

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.340
recreate Beats audio so if you happen to be  using a Google Music app

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.610
you can tweak the equaliser to produce more bass, treble or mid, what have you

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.049
But I tried to leave everything just as it

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.460
was so we can just hear how most normal
users are going to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.070
interact, you know, hear the audio
quality from the Nexus 5.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.840
I was actually really impressed it does
it very very good job at

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.260
recreating my favourite tracks. Certainly it
didn't feel like it was blowing out the mids

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.909
too much

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.880
the basses were deep and overall the vocals
would nicely separated

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.470
which is quite remarkable for just a mono
 speaker, very very good

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.780
all round.  Let's talk about the audio quality overall

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.900
because it's not just about the speaker there that very few people are actually going to  listen to music

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.259
through,

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.509
it's all about your headphones so with the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.090
headphones I particularly have they are very very good for bass

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.929
these are a set of  JVC's and they've got basically a bass driver on the back of them.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.969
You look a little bit silly but they are
incredibly loud

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.930
and very very good quality for the price, about £25 I think.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.629
I literally looked my way through hundreds  of different sets from you know

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.249
the latest Beats  audios

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.209
and so on and all those funny ones that these
are RnB artists are putting out

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.939
and  frankly they're all trash compared to what the JVCs

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.150
produce  for £25. So there you go!

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.799
Don't don't spend  hundreds of pounds on earphones guys most of the time your ears can't

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.049
even pick out the frequency responses that they're attempting to generate. It's silly.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.659
But anyway what we have here with the
Nexus 5

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.489
is phenomenal  audio quality when
running through

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.499
headphones. There's no tinniness to it, there's no popping or clicking or any other

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.659
weird stuff. There's no distortion it's just

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.969
crisp and clear. Now a lot of it comes down to the headphones that you're using as well

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.219
the better the headphones the better the quality is going to be.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.309
Now I listen to my music through play music,  I do cache my music first in the highest quality

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.519
I possibly can and what I found was

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.059
no distortion, no massive problems, my music just sounded as good as it does

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:21.099
on the S4, on the HTC One or on any other device for

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.669
that matter. There is no problem here
is what I'm trying to say to you. If

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.790
you use the Nexus 5 for  listening to
music you're just going to find it great.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.359
A lot does come down to your headphones  but ultimately

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.809
if the device is putting out a nice
clean clear signal then

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.379
you're going to have absolutely no problems. There's certainly no distortion here and nothing

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.489
that made me think to myself hmm

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.059
Nexus 5, not great for music. In fact the Nexus 5,  absolutely perfect for music.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:52.120
Enjoy your music collection with pride on the Nexus 5.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.569
 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.689
