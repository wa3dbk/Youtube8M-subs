Tight - Wedding Guest Male Style Tips - Fashion

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.510
Advice

And today, we're going to be talking about
what to do when you have to attend a wedding

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.380
and your suit doesn’t fit.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.750

Finally, again, right there down below you're

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.990
It's a great e-book.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.329
We get comments on it every single day about
how great this is.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.069
And if you haven't grabbed it yet, make sure
to do that.

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:40.040
Okay, this is the question that came in.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.199
"Hello, Antonio!

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.719
I'm going to a friend of a friend's wedding.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.569
However, I gained a bit of weight and my good
suit is too tight.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.559
Should I wear my old suit or dress in business
casual?

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.589
Thank you."

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.339
All right, this is a good question.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.959
Oftentimes, if you don't wear a suit often,
you're going to put it on and you're going

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:05.400
to find that my goodness, that suit has gotten
smaller.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.570
Seriously, you've probably gained a little
bit of weight and all of a sudden, you find

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.900
it doesn’t fit you as well as what you used
to.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.600
It's one of those things that you don't think
about it because you don't wear a suit very

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.860
often, but when you put this on, what's going
to happen?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.210
You've probably got only a few days or hopefully
you've got a few weeks.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.810
That would be great, but if you've only got
a few days, you're going to have to make a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.910
very quick decision.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.470
It sounds like this gentleman has a suit to
fall back on or he's go the business casual,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.800
so I'm going to go with assuming that you've
only got a few days, but if you've got a few

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.640
weeks, I'll give you a tip at the end that
should make this a bit easier.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.000
The first thing I'm going to say though is
what is the wedding's dress code?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.500
Weddings have a dress code and they should
put that in the invite.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.520
I know a lot of modern ones don't do it nowadays,
but ask around.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.590
Find out what everyone else is going to wear
because you probably didn’t want to be wearing

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.450
a suit anyway if everyone else is going to
be -- if it's going to be super casual.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.190
I was at a wedding in San Diego and they wanted
it super casual.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.629
The bride and groom, they didn’t even have
shoes on.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.120
So if I showed up in a suit, I'm just going
to be out of place.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.799
And so, this wouldn't even have been a question.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:22.500
But if it's going to be a black tie affair
where all of the groomsmen are in black tie,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.510
you're going to want to wear a suit.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.130
And even though it's not your favorite suit
and you feel that you don't look as great,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.300
at the end of the day, the wedding is not
about you as the guest.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.730
It's about the bride and groom and showing
respect to them.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.599
So go ahead, and it sounds like you've got
a suit that fits you.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.629
That's what I would wear.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.360
Now, let me go ahead.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.139
Another thing I need to address, if it was
a casual wedding, you need to understand -- you

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.681
didn’t tell me what your definition of business
casual is because I say business casual, but

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.549
that term is used all over the place.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.370
I've seen men show up in a dress shirt and
a pair of jeans, and they think that's business

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.370
casual.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.970
Other men think it's a sports jacket, a pair
of dress slacks, and a tie, obviously a huge

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.010
difference.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.579
And so, you need to actually maybe -- if they
say business casual, ask specifically what's

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.419
the father of the bride going to be wearing
or what's the brother of the bride or the

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.290
brother of the groom, what are they going
to be wearing?

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.659
You just ask around and you can do a little
bit of detective work and figure this out.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.010
If you've got a bit of time, if you've got
a few weeks, you need to look at actually

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.840
possibly getting that suit altered because
it sounds like this is your favorite go-to

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.689
suit, the one that you really like.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.959
And as much as we would like to think we're
going to lose that weight, chances are that

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.999
weight is going to stick around a while, and
you need to have clothing that fits your body,

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:51.650
not trying to get your body into a suit or
into clothing that doesn’t fit.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.540
Alterations to open up a suit, and this is
assuming that you haven't had it opened up

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.809
already, I don't know, 50 or maybe 100 bucks
at most, but you're going to be in the suit

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:02.939
that you feel good in.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.609
And when you need that suit the next time,
oftentimes these weddings and these big events,

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.689
they happen and again and you just want to
be prepared.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.590
So if you've got the time, take it to a tailor,
get it adjusted, and be comfortable in your

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.590
own skin.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.080
Again, check and find out what the wedding
dress code is.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.070
This is something you should be able to call
and ask about.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.070
Don't call the bride directly.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.990
She's got enough things going on, but call
others.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.290
Maybe there's a wedding planner or someone
related to the bride.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.690
They probably heard her talk about this a
hundred times and they'll probably know the

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.690
answer.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.690
Okay.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.300
