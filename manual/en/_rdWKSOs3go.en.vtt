00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.880
Alice and the Magic Gardens!

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.130
Another game sent to us from the good people
at Alawar Games.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.939
This time it’s a match 3 game!

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.000
Not my usual but nice.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.670
It’s like bejeweled but with fruit and fairies
and gardens... and Alice, but no Wonderland...

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.730
Anyway...

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.620
So Alice is a servant to a king until one
day she’s visited by a fairy that tells

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.570
her an evil sorcerer has locked up their fruit
and if she helps she’ll be given her own

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.570
garden.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.790
Quid pro quo.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.910
At its core, this is a match 3 game, but with
a few other features to keep it interesting.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.830
You’ll have a few different maps, that progress
in difficulty and every level will have a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.410
different objectives, not just reach a certain
amount of points or make X matches, those

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.729
are a couple of them, but you’ll also have
match X target fruit, match on designated

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:30.270
squares, find the flowers, hunt the spiders
and even boss battles.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.709
So there’s a good bit of variety to the
gameplay.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.520
Also you’ve probably noticed by now that
there’s actually two layers of matches you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520
need to make.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.190
The tiles on top, and then the fruit.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.830
This adds a little more strategy since not
clearing tiles will make matching fruit that

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.360
much harder.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680
Plus you have fruit bombs, fruit blasters,
spiders, worms, brooms, keys, bug spray...

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.310
There’s quite a lot going on once you get
into it.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.340
Once you’ve finished a stage, you get your
points, a medal based on time and some cash.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.470
This is where your magic garden comes into
play.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.670
As you progress you can add to Alice’s garden
and make it more beautiful....

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.319
Awww, it’s that sweet.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.379
So it’s kind of sim garden builder.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.670
But this part is kind of lacking actually.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.270
You add to the garden and increase your rating,
but aside from some achievements and your

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.720
own personal satisfaction, there’s isn’t
really any other reason to advance your garden.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.130
I mean, it’s the only thing you can do with
your money, so I guess why not.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.630
But that’s my one other complaint.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.920
I always had extra money and nothing to do
with it.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.720
But aside from those couple of nitpicking
things, this is a solid match 3 game and fans

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.590
of that genre will enjoy it, with a nice style,
easy to pick up and play and the variety offered.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.290
Oh one other thing I wanted to share.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.210
There is a bonus stage every now and then
and it reminds a lot of the coffee break,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.270
or gnat attack game in Mario Paint...

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:04.130
They even kind of make the same sound.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.260
Nostalgic!
