00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.650
Hello everyone. Today we’re going to give our attention to solids. 

00:00:10.024 --> 00:00:13.024
As I’ve promised – a little break from drawing realistic things.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.250
Here are 5 Platonic solids. 

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:20.157
These are: icosahedron, dodecahedron, octahedron, tetrahedron and cube.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
We all know the cube well by now. 
 And these are some of their modifications.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.920
Today we’re going to talk a bit about the two coolest ones, 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.000
which look quite complicated but I’m going to show you 
 how to draw them easily from a cube. 

00:00:31.342 --> 00:00:34.342
And we’re also going to talk about this interesting star. Let’s get to work.

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:37.848
In the beginning we’re going to draw „the star” – 2 intersecting tetrahedra. 

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.265
At first I’m going to find 1 tetrahedron in a cube. 

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:43.658
Its edges are just diagonals of the cube’s walls. 

00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:47.523
The rest of the diagonals create a 2nd, twin tetrahedron. 

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:53.122
If I now connect the intersection points of their 
 edges I’ll get an octahedron inside. 

00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:03.783
Now by shading proper surfaces I extract the two intersecting tetrahedra

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:08.666
but by shading other surfaces in the same place 
 I could get one tetrahedron or an octahedron.

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:13.952
To create an icosahedron I first have to find 
 all of the cube’s walls centres. 

00:01:17.538 --> 00:01:20.538
Next through each centre I lead a segment on the cube’s wall.

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:25.245
The segments on adjoining walls should be turned 
 to one another by the right angle,

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.718
so they should be laid in pairs on each convergence and vertical.

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:37.035
I now divide each segment into 5 even 
 parts and strengthen the 3 middle ones.

00:01:38.374 --> 00:01:41.870
It’s easiest to divide the vertical segment as the foreshortening will not disturb us.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.370
Further you can move in perspective the divisions 
 to the segments of the remaining walls.

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:10.800
In the end you just have to connect the 
 proper ends of the segments to each other.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.660
This way 20 even tetrahedra should be created.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.630
To create a dodecahedron I need the same segments 
 on the walls as in the icosahedron. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Only here I also have to push them through the cube’s 
 walls to about a half the segment’s length. 

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:51.020
To be sure that the segments are extended to a proper length

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.330
I check if one segment’s end, the middle of the 2nd segment and 
 the middle of the cube’s edge lay in one straight line. 

00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:21.120
To finish we only have to connect the 
 extended segment’s ends with cube’s closest vertices.

00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:25.150
This way 12 even pentahedra are created.

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.560
As you can probably imagine there are many more cool solids to draw. 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.440
I can show you how to construct them. It all depends on you.

00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:09.300
Write in the comments if you liked this film, 

00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:13.760
because I could make another one dedicated to e.g. Archimedean solids.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.140
And in the meantime I invite you all to the next episode in 
 which we’re going to draw a space base on Mars. See you.
