Hi everyone I’m Ryoya.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.540
I’m making vegan pan cake today.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.520
and I’m making gluten free pan cake, not normal pan cakes.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.260
I’m going to use rice flour and sorghum flour today.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.540
These flour are easy to find in Japan.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.800
There are so much kinds of flour I can choose from in the United States.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.360
I could find lots of variety of flour in japan, but only in limited places.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.920
so that is why I’m using rice flour and sorghum flour which are easy to find in Japan.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:38.100
Gluten free is becoming popular even in Japan recently.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:50.440
It gets kind of hard to see through the essence of things once you follow the trend too much.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:05.280
I hope people who watch Veggie Dishes can choose their foods that fit your body.Not a food that don’t fit you.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.780
I made Gluten free pan cakes today,And there are always people saying ”I can eat this pan cakes everyday because it’s gluten free!”.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:22.180
Of course not.
I hope you guys wouldn’t be such people.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.400
See you next week!
