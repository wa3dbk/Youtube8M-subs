00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:25.650
What you need:  a bowl of water, a sewing needle, liquid soap and two small squares of bathroom tissue.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:41.710
After you've filled the bowl with water, place the needle on top of the bathroom tissue square and place 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.710
it gently on the water.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:56.070
Observe how the bathroom tissue becomes saturated with water and within a few minutes sinks to the bottom.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.390
Notice the needle is still floating?

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:12.610
Remove the soggy bathroom tissue and sewing needle from the water.  Add a few drops of liquid soap to 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.150
the water and stir with your finger.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:34.900
music playing

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.700
Carefully place the second square of bathroom tissue and needle on top of the water.  Observe that now 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.800
when the bathroom tissue sinks, the needle sinks, too.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.150
Why do you think this happens?  The soap reduces the water's surface tension so that the water can no 

00:01:56.150 --> 01:59:59.000
longer support the needle.  This is why soap works so effectively to clean.
