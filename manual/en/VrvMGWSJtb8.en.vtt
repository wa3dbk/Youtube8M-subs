00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.019
Alright!  Today we're going to be replacing
the pitman arm on a 98 each

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.289
Chevrolet Blazer four by four I understand have

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.889
to remove the steering box to do this
Im gonna remove the air filter

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.289
after we  we get the air filter out of the way gonna pull the

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.669
bolt and there's going to be two
grommets on the studs

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.679
on the other side and the box pops right
up out of there

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.989
allows you access to get to the

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.380
power steering lines which I'll

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.280
show you here right there they are the power steering lines go to the steering box

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.560
in the steering shaft comes down you
have to remove the plastic cover

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.700
and take bolt out

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.710
and that will come apart the book says that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.970
you have to remove the power steering
pump Uh I'm not going to do that

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.860
I don't think you have to I'm gonna remove the
lower

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.590
skid plate and get to it from down there
here's a view from underneath the vehicle

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.630
that's the center link with the pitman
arm bolted up to it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.420
remove the cotter key the nut. you have
to go outside by the driver's wheel

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.540
remove the wheel and  go in from the side
with your pickle fork to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.010
break it apart

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.770
after removing the wheel you can see there's a
wide open space there to get to the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.630
center link and the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.780
arm thats after the Pull the pin and nut and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.920
your pickle fork fits right in there

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.930
and knocks it out thats what you well a

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.150
joint remover pickle fork
lots of  different names i spose

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.750
I call it a pickle fork  my boss always used to
call it that a long time ago

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.060
anyway that's how you get into that okay

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.110
lets move on ok from the same side on
the driver side into the wheel well

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.830
there's three bolts on the frame

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.990
you remove those and that is what holds
the steering box in place

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.110
alright well I removed the skid plate

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.770
and there you can see hold on let me
get this focused

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.990
up here you can see the steering box is sittin

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.670
right there and once you remove those
power steering lines

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.150
that thing will move I think pretty
much slide out of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.750
there were gonna to give that a shot

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.320
you can see I'll all access once you get
the hose's

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.959
out move the wires out of the way i think it
gives you plenty room to get it out of there

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.690
so were gonna give them a shot okay I'm
gonna break the power steering lines

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.040
loose from the steering box

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.650
I got my uh I call it crows foot down
here holding on to it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.110
extension in a rathet makes it easy cause if not you need a super short

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.730
a wrench this is just like a tubing
wrench only its got

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.820
they're just crows feet that go in the  the end
of you

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.320
ratchet makes it real sweet to pull it off

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.320
see how easy turn once you break them loose you can get

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.459
down there with your fingers because
they're pretty much finger tight

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.519
but you got to break it loose first

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.600
and that's an excellent tool for that
right tools for

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.040
the right job yeah anyway coming outta there

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.510
and we'llgo to our next step

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.840
which will probably be remove the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.930
bolt that holds the steering shaft into
the steering box

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.970
yeah and I forgot to mention mention but place
 your drain pan underneath there

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.120
before you disconnect those lines I did
that just forgot to

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.750
mention it the put your drain pan down there so
that

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.560
you dont make a big ole mess remove the bolt
from the steering shaft

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.410
you see that comes out real easy and
the box

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.570
yup you can see it comes out
and

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.340
the steering shaft is disconnected you see the
box is missing now

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.549
thats because I got it out it out here on

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.190
the floor see theres there's a big ol

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.720
hole right up in there where it sits right up in there

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.170
I have the box over here it's time to
pull the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.269
pitman arm off and a hear im gonna to try and
use this puller here

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.139
and it might work it might not let me
give it a shot

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:23.139
because i don't have a pitman arm
puller handy and to get the pitman arm removed

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.230
in the new one put on

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.160
it's just a reverse procedure to
put it all back together

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.050
you gotta stick the box back into place
you see we got this bolted back up

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.220
and in place and stuff where it needs to be im
about ready to hook up

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.750
the lines given last minute ago way

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.320
dag gum dag gum  stupid lite

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.210
smacking a few times there we go

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.260
Ok my lite back working again yeah

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.950
you can see the pitman arm is going over
there

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.520
on the inside towards the shaft I'll
have to put that together

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.530
I get the box bolted up get the lines
hooked up to it

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.260
is basically a reverse procedure

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.900
what what we did take it apart now put
it back together

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.169
okay we'll just

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.949
hook our power steering pump lines back
up

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.870
we've got those two we've got that mean
feed line from the

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.860
reservoir that hose for

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.860
the reservoir or two cooler lines course
you'll have to look up the

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.390
steering shaft before he even bolt up the box
box

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.380
so it's pretty elementary just keep
your wheels

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.740
point forward straight the pitman arm

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.060
in straight position and it's got a flat
spot on it only go on way

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.800
so you the bolt up into that

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.490
get that hooked up tighten it up and
then you can

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.610
secure the steering box back to the
frame

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.730
and then install your cooler lines or
not cool lines bit

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.600
power steering lines

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.820
okay as you can see we've got the power
steering

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:23.520
lines connected right there and we have
the steering shaft connected in the bolt

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.790
in it

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.940
the now it's time for the final final
we'll just button everything up

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.640
but the air box back in there fill the

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.120
reservoir with power steering fluid put
the wheel back on

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.480
let it down on the ground and

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.500
but the air box back in the air filter
put it all back together

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.940
in there you have it that's how you do
it

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.240
not not so bad it's it seems a little
scarier sounds a little like a whole

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.240
bunch more work than it is but it's
really not that bad of a job

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.630
