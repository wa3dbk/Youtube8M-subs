etrailer.com Part number: SA851BToday we&amp;#39;re

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.380
going to be taking a look at the Saris Bones
RS Trunk Mounted 3-Bike Rack, part number

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.730
SA851B.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.040
Before we begin our installation, we&amp;#39;ll
first need to make sure that our fit settings

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.140
are correct.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.380
You can see these notches here on the rail
of the bike rack which is going to determine

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.589
where this ratcheting mechanism needs to be
placed.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.490
To determine what fit setting our bike rack
should be at, we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and refer

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.329
to the fit guide.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.060
The notches are not labelled, but notch #1
starts at the bottom, so we&amp;#39;ll count up

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.230
12 notches.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:58.810
You can see this black handle.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:54.039
We&amp;#39;ll pull it down, which 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:43.180
is going to free 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:59.120
it 
up 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:04:05.530
and allow us to maneuver it 
up 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:05:07.960
and 
down 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:06:53.180
this arm.
