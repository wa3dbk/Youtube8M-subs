How to make an envelope for CD

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:08.126
Let's do a cover for CD using a sheet of paper.

00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:13.318
The first step here is to put the CD in the half of sheet paper.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.047
Finding more or less the middle of the sheet and bend the corner.

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:30.648
Have to try to keep this part always the same size, without warping.

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:48.060
That done, fold the sheet in half.

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:11.105
Here fold in half.

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:25.813
Now with this crease, give a way to get here in the other corner.

00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:35.777
Then fold in again.

00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:42.096
It'll be here.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:57.450
The part where the CD is ready.

00:01:58.541 --> 00:01:59.695
The CD goes here.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:02.268
Now we fold here.

00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:15.216
Does the part that will fit to close the envelope.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.411
With the point made??, just snap here.

00:02:28.793 --> 00:02:30.918
[Ohhh!]
