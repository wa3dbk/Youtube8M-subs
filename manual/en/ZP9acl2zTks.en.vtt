hi Amanda van der Gulik here from fun
cake decorating ideas and I want

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.809
to give you some ideas on what you can
use for your icing when you want to do

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.559
some piping now there are these
containers that you can get this one is

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.930
from Betty Crocker where you can simply
put your icing in the container and pop

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.140
the lid on and it comes with the
removable tips but not everybody can

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
afford this I was lucky enough to get
this is a gift but what I used to always

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.010
use for muck bags not every country has
milk bags but if you're in North America

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.899
it's very common to have a milk bag if
by your milk in bags and when you're

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.030
finished drinking your milk you simply
slid open the bottom clean it out and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:59.629
then you take your icing tip so you have
the part that goes inside the icing bag

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:08.790
or you can fit your tips on and what I
do I simply put it into the bag in the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.450
corner figure out approximately how much
of the plastic I need to cut off cut off

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.729
the end I usually have more plastic left
over over the edge because I want to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.530
make sure it's not going to squish out
the other end of it then you pop your

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.820
icing tip on and screw on the lid to
hold it in place and there you have a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.290
very nice and easy icing bag if you're
not going to go out and buy the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.340
expensive ones
now if you don't have milk bags handy

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.770
you can use other bags oh I like to use
Ziploc bags because you can also then

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.930
zip it off pop it in the fridge and use
it again later now these are sandwich

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.509
bags they're relatively thin so you can
use them but I find that you can't reuse

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.829
them very very much because they tend to
want to break down and icing comes out

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.299
the side so what I use instead are the
freezer bags because they're a little

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.770
bit thicker and again

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:23.890
I've submitted my icing base open up a
bit black bag pop in the base find the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.299
corner snip off the end again with an
overhang so that the icing won't come

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.489
out the other side of it

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:44.319
grab my icing tip top it on and screw it
into place and there you have it a nice

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.970
easy not very expensive way to have your
icing bags the icing tips themselves you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.409
can get from different places but I like
the flexibility of having these tips

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.470
simply because I can use whatever bags I
want and when I'm finished I can roll it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.049
up put a little paper clip or another
paper clip sorry a clothespin there zip

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.209
up the end and pop it in the freezer and
I've got my icing for another day I hope

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.500
