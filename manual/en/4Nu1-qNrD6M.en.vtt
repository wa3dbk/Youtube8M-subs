00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:04.599
^ - Let's be honest here.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:06.339
^ Who doesn't love a good ninja game?

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.458
^ Seriously, there's been so many good ones

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:10.779
over the years I kinda lose track of them all.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.768
We're talkin Ninja Gaiden, Shinobi,

00:00:13.768 --> 00:00:16.179
Ninja Spirits, Tensue,

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.639
however one of my favorites doesn't

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:21.218
really fit in with the rest I just mentioned.

00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:23.038
In this episode I'm gonna be

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:24.936
talking about Strider.

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:30.893
Although I'd say that most

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:32.182
gamers these days are more familiar

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:33.733
with the character of Strider Hiryu

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.575
via the Marvel vs Capcom games

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:36.911
and the recently released

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.028
reboot on the current generation systems.

00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:40.448
The series actually started out

00:00:40.448 --> 00:00:42.669
as sort of collaborative endeavour

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:44.528
between Capcom and a manga collective

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:47.521
called Moto Kikaku in the late 80s.

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.149
The Strider series saw two

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.500
games released early on.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.180
One was injected directly

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.209
into the booming arcade scene...

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:55.621
and the other?

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:56.631
That's right,

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:57.908
it went home to the good ol

00:00:57.908 --> 00:00:59.810
Nintendo Entertainment System.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.870
A system that had really hit it's... uh,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.490
stride years earlier.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.830
(Strider music)

00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:20.151
Developed on Capcom's CPS1 hardware,

00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.290
the arcade version of Strider was released first

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.580
in March of 1989.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.689
Taking place in the year 2048,

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:27.839
Strider Hiryu,

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:29.830
an elite member of a mercenary force,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.958
is hired to fight across Eurasia,

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:32.940
and assassinate the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.809
self proclaimed leader of the world

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:36.620
Grandmaster Meio.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.870
Nice setup befitting of

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.679
a quarter muncher if you ask me.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.072
Cutting soldiers in half,

00:01:43.072 --> 00:01:44.161
left and right,

00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:46.351
Hiryu is a straight up killing machine

00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:47.511
to put it lightly.

00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:49.873
He's equipped with his sort of plasma sword

00:01:49.873 --> 00:01:51.158
called the Cypher,

00:01:51.158 --> 00:01:53.350
and a number of amazing acrobatic moves

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.079
like this awesome cartwheel jump

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.608
and a kicking slide move.

00:01:56.608 --> 00:01:59.389
Hiryu also acquires a number of robotic helpers,

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:01.662
or options as they're called here.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:04.170
The journey across Eurasia has

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.809
some pretty cool locales.

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:07.520
you'll travel to Siberia,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.399
to the airship Balrog,

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.932
all the way to the Amazon,

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:13.562
and finally to the Grandmaster's base...

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:16.360
on a space station called The Third Moon.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.469
While the whole game is not

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.841
particularly long it's made up of

00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:22.440
constant set pieces and in my opinion

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.209
some of the most iconic moments

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.449
from any game in the 1980s.

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:28.468
There's some really great stuff here.

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:29.687
The mechanical gorilla,

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:31.818
getting devoured by piranhas,

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.505
the flipping gravity.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.024
I'll never forget the first time

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:36.934
I did the hill run in Siberia

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:38.505
with everything blowing up behind me.

00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:40.735
Definitely my favorite part of the game.

00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:42.772
I think that most people who have a passing

00:02:42.772 --> 00:02:44.574
interest in the series are probably

00:02:44.574 --> 00:02:46.446
most familiar with this version.

00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:48.444
I guess it's probably because

00:02:48.444 --> 00:02:50.864
it's been ported about a million times.

00:02:50.864 --> 00:02:52.884
It also helps that the sequel

00:02:52.884 --> 00:02:54.836
and the reboot were both based

00:02:54.836 --> 00:02:56.665
on this versions story.

00:02:56.665 --> 00:03:00.036
(Action music)

00:03:06.031 --> 00:03:07.811
Following a couple months later,

00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.244
Strider was released on the NES

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:11.651
in North America in July of 1989.

00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.928
This time around,

00:03:12.928 --> 00:03:14.987
the Striders are a covert operation team.

00:03:14.987 --> 00:03:17.538
Not so different from mercenaries I guess.

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:19.024
The game begins with Hiryu,

00:03:19.024 --> 00:03:21.513
being assigned by the team leader, Matic,

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:23.743
to find and kill his best friend Kain,

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:25.522
another member of the Strider team

00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:27.975
that had been captured by an unknown enemy.

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.944
This leads Hiryu across the globe

00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:31.744
to uncover nonsensical plot

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.104
involving these tree like

00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:35.324
mind control devices called ZAIN.

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:36.516
That who would have guessed it,

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.055
goes all the way to the top.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:40.873
A lot less linear than coin version,

00:03:40.873 --> 00:03:44.093
Strider NES is more of an adventure.

00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:45.794
You see, Hiryu,

00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:47.823
will collect keys for security doors

00:03:47.823 --> 00:03:49.233
and find boots that will

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:50.630
allow him to do amazing things

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.634
like walking on water and up

00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:55.252
the side of buildings on magnetic surfaces.

00:03:55.252 --> 00:03:56.873
He'll also obtain floppy disks

00:03:56.873 --> 00:03:58.683
that contain encrypted material.

00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:01.013
Usually leading us plot devices

00:04:01.013 --> 00:04:03.355
that will take us to the next country.

00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:04.754
Hiryu has the same arsenal

00:04:04.754 --> 00:04:05.844
as the arcade game,

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:07.284
though his jumping animation

00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:09.053
is no longer the awesome cartwheel flip.

00:04:09.053 --> 00:04:10.522
And his Cypher swing is no longer

00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:12.263
the cool yellow laser arc.

00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:14.582
Instead it's just this.

00:04:16.483 --> 00:04:17.724
I always kind of felt

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.293
it looked like a metal wing..

00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:20.974
not like a sword swing.

00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:22.472
There's also a bit of a level up system

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:24.104
in place that occurs after completing

00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:25.513
certain story points

00:04:25.513 --> 00:04:26.885
that increase your life.

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:28.503
And in another new addition

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:30.213
to this version, magic.

00:04:30.213 --> 00:04:31.703
You get a number of spells

00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:32.963
that you can equip,

00:04:32.963 --> 00:04:34.163
but you won't find a lot

00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:35.583
of uses for most of them.

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:36.834
To be honest I only found

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:38.123
myself using the high jump

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:39.272
and recovery to any

00:04:39.272 --> 00:04:41.083
serious extent throughout the entire game.

00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:42.043
Beyond that,

00:04:42.043 --> 00:04:43.095
you get this ability to shoot

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:44.942
plasma waves out of your sword.

00:04:44.942 --> 00:04:47.063
A practically useless move that only

00:04:47.063 --> 00:04:49.696
serves to completely break the final boss battle.

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:51.181
Hiryu's sword attack is more than

00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:52.511
powerful enough to deal with

00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:54.093
just about every enemy.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:56.333
Maybe even too powerful in most cases.

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:57.972
Seriously, you can pretty much

00:04:57.972 --> 00:05:00.013
plow through everything as long

00:05:00.013 --> 00:05:01.593
as you keep an eye on your health.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:02.742
What I think is interesting about

00:05:02.742 --> 00:05:03.912
this version is how it features

00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:05.513
two different designs of the main character.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.002
In the opening cinema,

00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:09.333
Hiryu looks a lot like his eventual redesign

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:11.132
we've come to know and love

00:05:11.132 --> 00:05:12.984
from the late 90s with Strider II

00:05:12.984 --> 00:05:14.902
and Marvel vs Capcom.

00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:16.054
Once you start the game though,

00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:17.834
he looks more like his arcade counterpart.

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:18.985
I wonder if he looked like

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.374
the opening cinema version

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:22.094
of the character but once the team

00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:23.432
saw the arcade version they

00:05:23.432 --> 00:05:24.853
altered his sprite.

00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:26.344
Naturally as you'd expect,

00:05:26.344 --> 00:05:27.654
this port was a bit longer.

00:05:27.654 --> 00:05:29.525
It only took me a couple of hours to play through,

00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:31.582
but it has a nice password feature

00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:32.594
if you just don't have the

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:34.313
block of time to really dedicate.

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:36.494
Strider on the NES doesn't get a lot of love.

00:05:36.494 --> 00:05:38.754
It's got this strangely unfinished feel,

00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:42.743
like it's downright glitchy and broken at times.

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:44.644
The jumping mechanic of the game

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:47.805
can be totally unreliable and infuriating.

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:49.764
The translation occasionally

00:05:49.764 --> 00:05:51.353
makes very little sense,

00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:52.815
which to be fair was kind of

00:05:52.815 --> 00:05:54.284
a staple at the time.

00:05:54.284 --> 00:05:56.110
What I find most strange is this version

00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:58.239
was never released on the Famicom in Japan.

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:00.970
It was delayed repeatedly and eventually cancelled.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.061
I don't think this version was ported anywhere

00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:04.828
expect to a Gameboy Advance

00:06:04.828 --> 00:06:07.709
compilation cartridge called Capcom Mini Mix.

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:09.850
Picking a better game is simple here.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.120
It's the arcade version that's endured.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.499
Obviously.

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.078
But the NES version I have to say,

00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:17.439
despite all of it's jank,

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.459
I've actually kind of grown to love it.

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:21.931
Sure it's not a great game,

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:23.920
and it's kind of easily forgotten,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.129
but it sure is a lot better

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:27.820
than I remember it being.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.438
