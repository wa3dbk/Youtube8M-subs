00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:06.940
Hello this is a quick review of the Pentax Optio
P80 camera

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.719
basically, just a few

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.829
good and bad points about it

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:12.589
first the good

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.070
it's pretty thin

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.920
the lens when

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.559
inside

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:22.889
doesn't portrude

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.220
it slips easily into

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.609
anybody's pocket

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.119
so you don't necessarily need a camera case
for it

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.390
the materials especially at the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.370
places you touch

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.760
Are pretty nice, so here at the top

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.420
a lot of metallic parts, the case is

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.440
glossy, the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.640
buttons

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.820
have good tacticle response, they're not too difficult
to press

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.040
one of the imprints

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.830
is crooked

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.350
that's not

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.670
all that important

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.840
has a wide angle lens; this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.290
is quite an advantage

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.200
especially

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.080
after using a Canon A95 camera

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.100
this one is 28 millimeters

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.200
mine was about  37  millimeters
I think

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.940
so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.909
get more of your friends in the same
pictured frame

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.110
definitely an advantage

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.830
other than that

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.530
it's quick to deploy

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.150
I'll show you an example

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.590
by pressing the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.680
top button here

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.380
pressing the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.179
shutter and it took the picture already

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.560
and took the second picture now

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.170
so

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.480
it's fast

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.710
actually it's taking a video right now

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.839
because it remembers that's the video mode it had ...

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.949
that's mode I was in before

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.809
gonna talk about that later

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.609
one advantage also is

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.739
when you press on the playback button you're reviewing
your pictures...

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.579
you can press at any time on the

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.049
shutter

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.099
and allready; it immediatelly goes back into the
video mode

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.069
well picture taking mode, recording mode - whichever

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.419
and that's pretty good because

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.010
if you ever pass it to a friend or a stranger

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.759
they won't have to navigate through the menus

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:55.859
that's the good points
now the bad points

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.699
first off
the placement ofthe a flash

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.510
you know as the flash is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.249
right there

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.599
whenever somebody

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.959
doesn't know the camera takes a picture

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.999
they might obstruct it

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.189
so

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.939
they'll end up with

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.269
images with dark areas

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.589
the

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.519
automatic white balance

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.449
is very bad, especially if you don't turn
on

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.039
the flash

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:34.959
it tends to put everything in yellow

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.839
even in good lighting

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:41.900
indoor lighting

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.049
the

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.699
camera takes pictures

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.359
mostly in 400 ISO 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.319
modes
0:03:52.319,0:03:54.349
400 ISO sensitivity

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.419
which tends to be very grainy

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.689
I mean even

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.669
if you turn on the flash it 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.700
still does that

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.079
which is kind of disappointing

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.919
the only way to alleviate that is to

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.859
going to

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.430
program picture mode

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.519
change the ISO

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.019
change a lot of things

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.080
and then remember that you're in that mode next time the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.009
your surroundings change which  kind of
defeats the point of a 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.299
Point-and-shoot camera

00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:35.569
of this size

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:36.779
every time

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.990
I don't want to take pictures with the flash
I have to remember to

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.990
change the white balance and it's 
quite drastic

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.960
the manual white balance and automatic white
balance

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.059
it's totally off

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.550
other disadvantages

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.129
the viewing angle of the lens

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.509
is

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.830
very narrow

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.039
I can't get the camera above my head before

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.419
before the screen just disappears

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.449
I'm used to a

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.030
to a display I can rotate with the
A95

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.229
so the viewing angle was never an issue but I know
that other cameras do a better job at this

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.860
if you want to take a picture above a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.229
crowd

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.029
from the side

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.740
things like that

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.840
another small gripe is the fact that

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.569
when in playback

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.889
mode

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.090
you're zooming in 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.629
the picture

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.340
it's kind of laggy

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.000
but still usable

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.409
I just wish it was faster

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:01.879
with all that said

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.429
I'm going to be returning
this tomorrow

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:12.279
i'll be exchanged it instead for a

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.869
canon

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.899
950IS

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:17.990
which is

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.199
very similar to this one in 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.149
size

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.779
same wide-angle lens

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.599
although this time it has 
image stabilization

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.210
This one has digital image stablization 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.580
which is not effective at all

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.889
i'd rather just

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.759
not use the

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.279
shake reduction feature as it's called

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:53.009
when taking pictures even at higher sensitivities
higher ISO's

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.149
it will still

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:55.949
be able to...

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.289
the picture won't be all that grainy
I was very surprised to see

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.309
online reviews of the Canon

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:05.529
at its

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:07.449
very good

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:09.629
noise levels

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.319
so

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.669
you might as well

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.229
take pictures with your

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:21.610
cell phone

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.550
with the high levels of noise that this camera

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.819
puts out in 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:30.780
automatic modes

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.669
it's kind of

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:35.319
pointless

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:35.569
ah well - live and learn
