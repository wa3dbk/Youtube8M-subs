00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.050
I studied abroad in the fall of 2014

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.040
I studied in Madrid Spain. I loved
getting to know the Spanish culture and

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.180
studying a language

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.419
and being able to do that with a bunch
of students who

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.930
are used to a different cultural
background

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.620
I met a lot of great people not only
from other colleges here in the States

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.540
but also

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.250
Ireland and Germany of course Spain was
really fun

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.890
and exciting.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.960
theme

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.030
 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.260
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.850
 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.480
Jennifer waters was crossing the street
on her way to church and as she started to cross

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.609
the street a car

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.620
grazed her and she had fallen back and hit her head

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.120
initially when you hear that your heart just drops.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.269
I cried out loud enough that our
neighbors heard us. It was kind of

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.310
bring it to your knees
news.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.799
not knowing what to expect she's been hit
by car they didn't really have a lot of

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.119
details at that time but they knew it
wasn't good

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.090
the initial

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.380
prognosis of Jen's injuries were quite
serious so we wanted the parents

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.450
immediately to be flown over. At that point it wasn't sure if she was going to

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.380
be dead by the time we got there

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.880
and they just weren't or she already was maybe and we weren't gonna know until we

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.280
they just wanted us to be there. I landed in Madrid I went directly

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.940
to

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.860
the hospital Jen was in a deep coma

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.229
at a certain point it was just very uncertain
whether Jen would be able to pull through

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.970
Our new president Dr. Lovell liked
the idea of sending somebody like

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.520
myself in

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.180
senior administration but also a Jesuit
priest be able to offer that kind of outreach.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.090
I called and left them a message as well

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.050
trying to just let them know that you we will do
everything we can to help that situation

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.450
This is a portion of some of the notes that Jen

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.010
received from kids at Marquette. Some that she
knew something she didn't

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.010
I know you don't know me because I am a
freshman but despite that I

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.650
despite that I have been thinking about
and praying for you all week

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.320
I know it's been rough

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.100
a rough week for you and your family but
remember

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.860
that God is always by your side and he
will make things right in the end

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.400
I pray for strength and comfort for
you and your family

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.570
I know you can do this

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.070
trust in the Lord your brother in Christ
Bradley.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.530
and a you know that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:56.020
it just goes on and on.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.440
Very nice.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:12.959
Take your time, kid.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.670
The way that the community not just the
administration

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.390
but the community of students and staff

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.050
and teachers just that full community

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:32.330
of Marquette they were right there.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.560
I'm really looking forward to returning
to Marquette

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.209
and to be really plugged in again with Marquette

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:51.690
and the Milwaukee community is going to be

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.640
really really exciting

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.870
How are you? Good to see you welcome back to campus.  It was
really cool to see how much

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.530
we really did connects and care for

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.610
one another. To have someone like
yourself there to be with us and to

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.459
sheppard us and to pray with

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.750
us and over her and with her just

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.870
amazing how important that was for all
of us

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.350
and then you said almost I think the
very first night you said

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.970
So Marquette says be the difference and you said this is the difference so

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.330
Marquette wants that

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.740
people graduate from the University but

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.270
university itself tries to be that kind of difference.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.659
To see her talk,

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.909
laugh, joke, her sense of humor to be able
to speak in Spanish

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:50.729
is a miracle. Seeing this really reminded
me of why I chose

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.219
I'm here to come here to learn how to
serve other people learn how to serve God

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.710
learn how to really band together

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.499
The Marquette community stepped-up and supported
them and made their life

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:06.050
bearable in a time which they were having
just trouble living from day-to-day.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.139
If you get tired you let them know.

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.949
I knew all this time that I wanted to help
people help themselves but

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.289
now I think I have a better understanding

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.669
for what that will look like. There are a
lot of students here

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.319
at Marquette who are really focused on

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.099
helping people and I'm really looking forward to

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:52.250
getting to a place where I can practice that every day.
