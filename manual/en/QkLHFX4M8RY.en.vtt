00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And also by the Deadlywind Fibur-X carbon fiber barrels.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They’re ultra-lightweight, accurate and quiet.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They utilize the Freak replaceable inserts,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so one barrel and a few inserts will do the job of multiple barrels.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000

Hey, this is Holliday and you’re watching Social Paintball.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Welcome to Social Paintball News. Here’s your top stories.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Living Legends VI, Russian Legion Update,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Houston Heat Expands to Millennium, and Arena Moscow Girls Cup 2013.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[Intro Music]

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
CPX Sports, located in Joliet, Illinois, has been

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
pumping out the announcements these past few weeks

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
regarding their famous Living Legends scenario event.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The theme this year will be a sequel and is entitled,
0:00:54, 0:00:55
“The Dark Age: Descent Into Darkness.” The commanders

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
have also been announced for the event.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This year will feature the most recent addition to Dye’s Tactical team,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Andre “Wolf” Critchlow as general for the “New Empire” team,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and heading up the opposition called “The Horde”

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
will be SAS founder Steve “Necro” Kaltenbach.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The Horde will be trying for its second win following last year’s controversial outcome.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, full disclosure here, this reporter is biased for sure.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
General Necro is a member of Social Paintball

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and our small squad from Maine played on his Vandals squad

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
last year for the Horde side. I have played this event for the past two years

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and am always impressed on how each year it grows.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Besides the epic size of the event, the most special aspect of the event is still

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that it has a recball type of atmosphere.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Off the field, there is truly a special spirit of camaraderie

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and friendship that makes this event worth attending

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
no matter how you feel about the specifics of the rules for the event.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So, I am advising you right now to be sure and join me

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and Social Paintball’s SAS “Necro” on the side of the Horde.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I know the teams involved and, although we may not have all the most famous players,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
we have some of the most important hardcore teams.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
These guys are all coming to work.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000

We’ll be in touch with you via YouTube. Congratulations.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If you need a new jersey for one of these epic events, check this out.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Planet Eclipse has released their latest jerseys.
0:02:13,0:02:114
First, a couple of cool points.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
There is a microfiber sewn into the bottom, front, and inside

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of the jerseys to clean lenses. Major space has been left in the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
back area for team names and logos

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and four US Pro teams will be rocking custom versions this season:

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Impact, X Factor, Aftershock and 187 cRew as well as European Pro teams:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Disruption, Icon and Carnage. If these are anything like our Social Paintball

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
HDE jerseys, then they will be amazing.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Israel wears his all over the world to film, it’s light and breathable.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I wore one at Living Legends Five last year, too. I loved it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Russian Legion’s Kirill Prihidni provided Social Paintball’s Marjee Clark

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
with a training update this past week. Russian Legion has started its third week

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
of training for the 2013 season.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
They spent the first two weeks working on physical conditioning

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and the third week should include more paintball skills.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It’s been, yet another, bitter cold winter in Moscow

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
but this didn’t stop Russian Legion from practicing in their snow covered dome.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Thankfully, it’s much warmer inside the dome and the guys have been very happy

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to pick up their guns after enjoying a little vacation time.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
In addition to practice, Russian Legion also got the chance to try out new products

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
from their sponsors, including Virtue’s Spire loaders and Infinity paint from Valken.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Russian Legion has only four more full practice weeks before

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
they fly out to the first PSP event. The team is digging really deep

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to perform well in the new rules format.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Houston Heat announced that yes, the rumor is true.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
They will be playing in the Millennium Series this year.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
According to their website, Houston Heat, powered by G.I. Sportz Paintball,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is heading across the Atlantic Ocean to play in the Champions Paintball League

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of the Millennium European Paintball Series for the 2013 season.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Houston Heat’s owner, Randy “Sarge” Smith, had this to say,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
“We are honored to have the opportunity to play at an international level

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in the Millennium Series. We have great respect for the talent

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and level of competition involved in the league and are looking forward

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to the unique challenges it offers.”

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The team’s owner hopes that entering the Millennium Series to play with some

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
of the best paintballers around the world will help take the team’s skills to the next level.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Arena Moscow Girls Cup 2013 is the world’s biggest annual female paintball tournament.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The tournament will be held March 8th through 9th, 2013 in Moscow, Russia.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The tournament was held, for the first time, in March 2012

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and gathered 10 teams with girls from 8 countries: Norway, Iran, Sweden,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
France, Denmark, Malaysia, Ukraine, and Russia.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The Arena Moscow Girls Cup 2013 has already confirmed 14 teams for the event.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The event will host girls from: Germany, Iran, UK, Malaysia, Philippines,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Singapore, Japan, Belarus, Ukraine, Sweden, Russia, Holland, Norway and Australia.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The event will be held in the best European all-weather paintball complex:

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Arena Moscow Paintball Palace. Planet Eclipse and Celtic Paintball

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
are sponsoring the event with prizes. There are still plenty of slots left

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and many sponsor opportunities, so show the ladies in this sport some love and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
check this event out.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[Sub’em. Viewer submissions and recommended channels.]

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Well, word must have gotten out that we had room for shout outs

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because this week we’ve got four viewer submitted paintball channels

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
for you all to check out and maybe ad to your sub list.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
First up, we have a new full service channel that will be doing reviews,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
shooting videos, and gameplay in the near future. [D3VPB]

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Next we have just a personal channel, but one with many vids

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So you can all check out for some indoor speedball action. [cooldude112233445570]

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
This following submission is for you montage fans out there

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and seems to be a recball montage sort of experience. [XFactorGP]

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And finally, saving my favorite submission for last,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I had actually been following this channel here and there due to the “shens” vids.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Some are quite funny and as you can see the channel already has 700 subs,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
so give this one an extra look and consider subbing paintcheckpb for a channel that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
represents the fun side of paintball. [paintcheckpb]
