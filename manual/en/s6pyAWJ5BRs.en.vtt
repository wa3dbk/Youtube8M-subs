&gt;&gt; CUTTS: Here's a question from Rob in The
Netherlands. Rob asks, "Can the 'Change of

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.839
address' feature in Google Webmaster Tools
be used to merge two sites, site 'B' becomes

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.959
a part of site 'A', or is its use limited
to moving a site from one domain to another?

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.170
Do you have any advice for successfully merging
sites?" Well, the "Change of address" form

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.110
is intended to be moving from one site to
another site. So I wouldn't recommend that

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.240
you try to be merging a bunch of sites or
taking that sort of approach. If you do want

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.370
to successfully merge sites, here's what I
recommend. Suppose you have two sites, "A"

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.660
and "B". And you want to take "A" and merge
it with "B". If you log in to Webmaster Consoles

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.390
and prove that you're on site "A", you'll
be able to see essentially the full exhaustive

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.110
list of all the links that we know about,
so you can download as a tab or a comma separated

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.470
value a list of all the links that come to
site "A". Now look through that and you don't

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.090
want to necessarily write everyone who has
ever linked to site "A" unless there's only,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.530
like, five or six people. But you can say,
"Okay, who are the important people who linked

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.650
to site 'A'?" Maybe there is blogs, maybe
there are new sites. Anybody that's reputable

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.540
that you think has high PageRank. And then
I would say okay, write to those people and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.350
say "Hey, site 'A' and site 'B' are merging.
The new page with be not here on site 'A'

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.479
but here on site 'B'. Would you mind updating
your link?" And a lot of those high PageRank

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.630
people, you know they want to have good links,
they'll be happy to update their link and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.450
point to the new part on site "B". Then you
want to do a 301 redirect from every page

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.189
on site "A" to the appropriate part where
that page is on site "B". So don't just do

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.070
a 301 redirect from, you know, an individual
page on site "A" to the root level of site

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.250
"B". Do it from whatever the URL is on site
"A" to whatever the URL is on site "B". That

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.460
way, someone who's landing on the old page
will land on exactly what the new page is

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.310
going to be. So in essence, you're looking
around at all the back links to site "A",

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.670
you've downloaded the full list according
to Google and you can look at the ones according

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.780
to Yahoo or Microsoft as well. And you're
trying to identify the important ones that

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.620
you really care about and make sure that those
definitely get re-written. And then in the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.870
meantime, you can go ahead and put 301 redirects
in place to merge those sites. So that's roughly

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.950
how I would try to merge two different sites
that you've purchased or two sites that you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.790
have, maybe you've purchased one and you're
moving them to a new site.
