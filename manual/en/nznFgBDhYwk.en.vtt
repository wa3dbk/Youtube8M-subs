00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:03.244
Different types of backhand net drop

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:05.992
ok now

00:00:05.992 --> 00:00:10.041
the simple net play shuttle come

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:13.833
you do the net, go over the net

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:17.389
normally they use it for singles

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:18.682
have a look

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:19.254
net

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:29.147
ok now

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.660
the next one

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.948
is flat net play, which can be used in doubles

00:00:37.948 --> 00:00:40.294
because if shuttle goes up little bit

00:00:40.294 --> 00:00:43.928
in doubles one of opponent is already there

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:44.645
so

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:49.611
he or she can kill it to prevent opponent

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:52.623
to kill the net play

00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:56.924
you must hit it flat as possible have a look please

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:04.834
flat, so they can't kill it

00:01:07.544 --> 00:01:10.627
now Tom, put shuttles down

00:01:10.627 --> 00:01:12.294
take racket

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:13.744
now ready

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:14.409
take one shuttle

00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:18.649
I do normal net play and you kill it

00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:20.845
after net play ready

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:22.275
there

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:23.732
then he can kill it

00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:24.897
because shuttle goes up

00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:29.519
now, but if I do that way

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:30.435
yeah, its difficult

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:31.841
kill it, try to kill it

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:33.889
its difficult to kill it

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.546
so flat

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.582
can be used for doubles

00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:40.269
now

00:01:41.723 --> 00:01:47.386
the single specialized net play

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:50.436
because singles, opponent is little bit far

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:52.905
let's say after drop shot

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:55.452
even if you hit little bit high

00:01:55.452 --> 00:01:58.552
because he is away its difficult to kill it

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:00.906
its better in singles

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:04.371
go little bit high but shuttle goes steeper

00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:05.887
ok have a look

00:02:05.887 --> 00:02:10.654
this is I call it single net play

00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:11.336
by hand please

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:17.889
watch the shuttle fly

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.057
here - there

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:23.490
and the shuttle goes straight down

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.890
so instead of you hit that way

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.709
you hit up here

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.608
and then shuttle goes down

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:32.890
now have a look Tom I do take the racket

00:02:33.974 --> 00:02:38.217
shuttles give it to me, all of them

00:02:39.802 --> 00:02:42.894
do the net, I will do the single net

00:02:42.894 --> 00:02:45.221
try to lift it please

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:46.344
ok have a look

00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:47.821
I do that

00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:48.858
lift it

00:02:49.674 --> 00:02:50.692
again

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.949
there

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.524
yeah even they try to lift it

00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:58.372
it can't go further

00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:01.823
so you can kill it

00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:05.873
but don't use it when opponent is doing net

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.787
net

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.336
and if you do this shot

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:10.427
it can be killed

00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:11.388
like that

00:03:11.388 --> 00:03:12.807
so you do net

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:15.184
I do loose net, it can be killed

00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:20.183
you use this technique when opponent hits drop shot

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:22.217
and then you can do that one more

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.911
yeah drop

00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:31.494
you have to do that and then kill it

00:03:31.494 --> 00:03:36.111
so that is for singles net

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:37.495
so I showed you three

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:39.310
normal net

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.810
net shot for doubles flat

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.860
net shot for singles

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.495
which goes very tight

00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:53.201
now you can spin the net shot

00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.735
depending on where the shuttle is coming from

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.428
ok throw by hand

00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:00.339
from cross side

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:01.780
here net

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.280
let's say shuttle is coming from specially

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.011
the cross direction over there to here

00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.919
and you knew it

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.351
so you are able to take shuttle early at net

00:04:15.351 --> 00:04:17.716
and then you can spin it

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:18.450
have a look

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.765
further back please

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:20.733
over the net

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:21.401
watch this

00:04:24.354 --> 00:04:25.572
close to the net

00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:36.633
yeah spin it

00:04:38.448 --> 00:04:43.578
so it will be difficult to lift

00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:46.930
now next kind is deceptive net

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.763
straight please

00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:51.766
you hold

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:54.383
show your opponent like net

00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:57.612
and show your opponent lift, but still do net

00:04:57.612 --> 00:05:01.330
so this is more deceptive net play

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.130
have a look

00:05:04.142 --> 00:05:04.707
net

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.046
so you hold and add some false action

00:05:20.046 --> 00:05:23.078
so opponent, because your racket is going down

00:05:23.078 --> 00:05:28.511
he will be doing that and he delay the movement to the shuttle cock

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:31.061
now

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.208
have a look again

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.390
all again

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.023
normal net

00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:37.266
as you know

00:05:40.614 --> 00:05:42.864
now, doubles net

00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:47.364
flat to prevent the opponent to kill it

00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:49.598
it does not matter, if it goes little bit higher

00:05:49.598 --> 00:05:52.933
that is most important thing, not to hit too high

00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:54.814
so opponent can kill it

00:05:54.814 --> 00:05:59.710
now next one is spin, sorry

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.160
next one is single net play

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.065
go very tight, you can add little bit height

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.950
but you take chance shuttle goes like that

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.983
which can give you immediate point

00:06:11.983 --> 00:06:14.932
or opponent try to lift it

00:06:14.932 --> 00:06:17.632
shuttle goes only half court or shorter

00:06:17.632 --> 00:06:19.232
you can kill it ok

00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:20.648
single tight net

00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:21.480
have a look

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.130
how shuttle fly

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.044
now next one is spin

00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:39.573
shuttle comes cross direction

00:06:39.573 --> 00:06:40.257
you follow

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.686
and you spin it

00:06:45.498 --> 00:06:47.616
and this is I call it the winning shot

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.484
once you have opportunity 

00:06:50.484 --> 00:06:54.970
normally the rally ends

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.353
here or smash

00:06:57.353 --> 00:07:00.187
the last one I showed you is

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:03.218
deceptive net play

00:07:03.218 --> 00:07:07.427
show net play, show lift, but net play again

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.526
3 deceptions

00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:12.246
so hold and lift

00:07:12.246 --> 00:07:12.777
hold

00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:15.856
lift

00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:17.892
hold lift

00:07:23.482 --> 00:07:26.329
ok so there are how many

00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:35.703
1 2 3 4 5 different kind of net play can be made

00:07:35.703 --> 00:07:38.301
from your backhand side

00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:42.735
and I will show you how it should be done 

00:07:42.735 --> 00:07:45.703
in detail, moths after months
