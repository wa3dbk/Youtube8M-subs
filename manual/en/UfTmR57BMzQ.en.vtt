00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:10.370
Q: Now, Broadway, you know I love this game
of basketball, right?

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.370
Broadway: I love this game.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.610
Q: And, I want to make sure I'm playing the
game the right way.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.610
Broadway: Yeah.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.039
Q: So, can you explain to me the basic rules
of what we're trying to do when we're playing

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.039
the game of basketball?

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.580
Broadway: First of all, you have to dribble
the ball . . .

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.580
Q: Dribble the ball.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.580
Broadway: Up the court.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.580
Q: Up the court.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.580
Broadway: And, once you stop your dribble
. . .

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.580
Q: Yeah.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.580
Broadway: . . . you have to pass it to somebody.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.580
Q: OK.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.580
Broadway: You got 5 seconds . . .

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.580
Q: Five seconds?

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.580
Broadway: . . . or you will get a Five-Second
Violation.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.580
Q: OK.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.580
OK.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.580
Broadway: So, you can't take the ball and
run around . . .

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.580
Q: You can't run around with it.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.580
Broadway: No, no.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.580
Q: No, no, no.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.580
Broadway: You've got to maintain the dribble
. . .

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.580
Q: OK.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.580
Broadway: . . . until you're ready to make
a pass.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.580
Q: OK.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.580
And, we got five players on the court.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.580
Broadway: Five players on the court.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.620
Q: And, you all work together to score baskets
on either end?

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.620
Broadway: That's what's called "team basketball."

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.620
Q: Team basketball.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.140
Broadway: Two sides to the game.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.140
Offense . . .

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.140
Q: Offense.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.140
Broadway: . . . and Defense.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.140
Q: Defense.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.140
Offense, obviously trying to score baskets.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.830
Defense, trying to prevent the other team
from scoring baskets on you.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.830
Right?

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.830
Broadway: Yep.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.830
In most games . . .

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.830
Q: Yeah.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.830
Broadway: . . . standard high school games,
you get about five Timeouts.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.830
Q: Right.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.830
Right.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.830
Oh, Timeouts too?

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.830
Broadway: Yeah.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.830
Quarters are about eight minutes.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.830
Q: Eight minutes?

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.830
Broadway: Yeah.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.830
Usually two to three referees in a game.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.830
Q: OK.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.830
Yep, yep.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.830
Broadway: And, you have all kinds of different
rules.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.830
Three-Second Violation.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.830
Q: Right?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.859
Broadway: You can't stand in the painted area
more than three seconds.

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:18.859
Q: Three seconds.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.340
Now, we can't forget about the outside lines.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.979
Broadway: No, that's called out of bounds.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.189
Q: Out of bounds.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.799
Sidelines, baselines and we have the half-court
line.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.799
Broadway: Yeah.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.149
Once you come across one side of half court,
you can't retreat and go back across that

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.450
line or that's called a back court violation.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.729
Q: Back Court, right, right.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:34.729
Lots of rules, man.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.100
Broadway: Lots of rules but you got to know
the game in order to know how to play the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.100
game.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.100
Q: That's true.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.100
That's true.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.100
That's true.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100
Broadway: It's like your game.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.100
Q: Right.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100
What game is that?

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.100
Broadway: That other game.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.100
Q: Oh, you know I was doing that?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.100
When I get the (?).

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.100
Broadway: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.100
Q: You know what I'm saying?

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
But, that's a different game.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.100
We don't even want to talk about that.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.100
Broadway: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.100
Q: Right now, we're talking about the game
you love.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.100
Broadway: Yeah.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.100
Q: Basketball.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100
Broadway: I love another game.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.100
Q: What other game you like?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.100
Broadway: I used to play catch and kiss.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.100
Q: What?

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.100
Cut that out.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.100
You know what?

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.100
Check this out.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.100
If you guys want to know more about the rules,
check out these videos that we're going to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100
show you.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.114
But, that's the basic rules of how to play
basketball, with the Harlem Wizards.
