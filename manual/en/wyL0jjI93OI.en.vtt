00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.350
A 38-year-old woman that I

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.110
currently work with in psychotherapy
came in with command hallucinations

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.240
telling her to kill.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.349
I worked with her for a while

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.180
and at one point she was living with her
parents and she wanted me

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.310
to see her mother who was pushing her

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.340
to come in because she had various
things to tell me

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.730
so I told my patient I would
see her mother

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.250
for half a session and then I would see
her and we would talk about it.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.879
The mother came in and she was

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.229
one of the most obnoxious horrific women

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.940
I had ever met. I contained myself.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.850
I retained my composure. I had a discussion
with her.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.960
I was polite and nice to her.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.589
When her part of the session was
over I escorted her out.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.519
And I thanked her for coming.  And I sat down
my patient

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.720
and I said to her, "Look, I have to be
honest with you."

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.540
"There were several times while I was
talking to your mother that I felt like

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.130
wrapping my fingers around her
her throat

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.340
and squeezing until her eyeballs popped out.
At that point my patient looked at me startled

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.450
and she said, "Oh my god!

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.540
I know what the voice is!
It's my own voice

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.750
telling me to kill my mother!"
And I looked at her and said:

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.289
"I can understand that."

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.590
What happened after that is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.570
her command hallucinations went away.
I did not plan that.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.780
I did not understand before I said what
I said

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.229
what the nature of her command
hallucinations were.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.410
But once that happened it was obvious.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.229
What she was doing is she was experiencing

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.390
horrific murderous thoughts toward her mother

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.910
and she was unable to accept them.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.090
So what she did she projected them
outside of her

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.530
and those thoughts became a voice
telling her what to do.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.239
Therefore she wasn't responsible for them.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.540
She's been Voice free now for about a
year

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.420
and not on any medication. Prior to
that,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.070
before she came to me, she was on three
different kinds of medication.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.290
She had read about the medications and
she really didn't want to be on medication.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.690
But every time she tried to come off she
would wind up back in the hospital.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.280
After she saw me she came off the
medication

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.820
over a period of six months.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.060
Several times she started to feel symptoms
and the covering physician would

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.269
raise the medication slightly, leave it
at that for a while

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.709
and then we would start to decrease
again.

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.530
Again, she's medication free.
She's hallucination free.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.110
And she's functioning!

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.520
Did she start with the diagnosis of
schizophrenia? She started out with the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.460
diagnosis is schizophrenia from
childhood.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.320
Would she still qualify for the diagnosis?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.320
Not really.  Not really.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:37.550
How universal would you say this story
of this woman you work with is?

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.830
If you were to take everyone

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.070
diagnosed schizophrenic and put them in
a situation

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.750
where they could explore and look at at the issues

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.060
of where the whole symptoms were coming from

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.790
and get to the bottom of them, 
the issues would melt

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.070
the issues would slowly

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.070
go away. Now keep in mind I got very
lucky with this patient.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.080
I had no clue that that was going to happen. 
I just told her the truth about

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.350
the way I felt.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.829
But I could accept my feelings and she
never had permission to

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.510
And my telling her the way I felt gave
her permission to feel.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.580
And she did. And when she did.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.610
She didn't need that symptom anymore.
She didn't need to defend

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.850
herself in that way.
