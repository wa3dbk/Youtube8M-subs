Hi this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:08.870
On today's episode let's take a look at Geek
Tool.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.089
Geek Tool is an interesting way for you to
extend your Desktop by adding little widgets

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.089
to it.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.330
Things that you can see on your Desktop that
are kind of there in the background.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.550
You can get Geek Tool in the Mac App Store.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.039
Just do a quick search for it and it will
come right up.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.650
You can download it for free.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.360
So here is what Geek Tool looks like when
you run it.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.930
Now you drag and drop things out of here onto
your Desktop.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.580
For instance let's try dragging an image out.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.390
It is going to create this little space here
on the Desktop that I can move around anywhere

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.730
that I want.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.270
Then under Properties here, I can set Properties
of that image.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.710
Now that image can be something locally like
a local image that you've got but that doesn't

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.790
really give you any functionality.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.050
What is more interesting is to put a URL.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.150
I'm going to paste in an URL of a weather
satellite image that is updated from the US

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.150
government.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.510
What will happen is I can put that here and
I can drag it and enlarge it.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.860
That image is on the Desktop.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.330
If I click out of Geek Tool and I'm just in
the Finder now I can see that it is just there

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.330
on the background.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.540
Part of the background of the Desktop.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.540
It will remain there.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.540
I can cover it with stuff.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.690
I can't drag it again until I select Geek
Tool again and then I can drag it.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.310
But the cool thing is that it will update
as the image changes.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.390
So everyday I can look and see the new weather
information.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.850
Weather is an obvious one but you can think
of probably other images that are out there

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.200
where there is a static URL but the actual
image there changes like say maybe a webcam

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.700
or something.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.970
In addition you can drag file information.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.170
So this will put some text here on the Desktop.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.450
This text I can put anywhere I want and I
can resize the window.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.880
I can set what it is.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.890
So like I can for instance use a log file
here.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.729
Let me get my Apache firewall log if I want
to be really geeky and it will put that information

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.549
there on the Desktop and as that file changes
it will be updated.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.390
So this could be something here where you
can have logs or some other information that

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.859
appears and it changes.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.880
Again if I am not in Geek Tool you can see
it is just static information on the Desktop.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.950
It is not really static.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.091
It will be updated but I can't change it or
affect it.

00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:18.470
It is really there on the Desktop in the background.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.730
Probably the most ultra geeky thing that you
can do is to use a shell script.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.920
Let me put a shell script here.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.790
It is like a terminal command.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.840
I can do something like top which will display
information about things that are running

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.220
on my Mac and I can have it update every three
seconds.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.580
Let me make it an easier color to see.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.490
There we go.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.540
Now you can see this information here.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.620
You can see the results of top.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.819
Or I can use something like all sorts of different
things to display the current date.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.569
You can see it displays the date there as
it would return from a terminal command but

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:11.069
in addition I can now customize that by changing
the font and color.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:20.050
So I can put a clock on my Desktop that easily.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.050
Now if I click off you can see that it just
stays there in the background on the Desktop.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.150
Remember I said it should update every three
seconds so you can see it is doing that.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.130
Probably for this one I would want to set
it to update every second so it now acts like

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.210
a normal clock there on the background of
my Desktop.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.660
You can use any shell script.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.300
So the more you know about programming, the
more you know about terminal commands, you

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.989
can put different bits on here, Geeklets they
are called, on your Desktop to give you information.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:58.099
Then when you quit Geek Tool you can say No
I do not want to disable Geek Tool I just

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.819
want to quit running the app there.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.760
I am not running the app anymore but this
information remains on the screen.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.630
You can see this is updating.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.610
The Apache firewall would update and also
this weather image here would update all at

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.329
the same time while things change in the world.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.329
So that is the basics.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.340
Now if you search for a Geek Tool ideas or
Geek Tool Geeklets or whatever on the internet

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.629
you will find out all sorts of ideas that
other people have done with Geek Tool.

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.890
Stuff that they can use from shell scripts
and images and texts files or URLs that they

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.800
can display on their Desktop to give them
useful information and make them more productive.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800
Hope you found this useful.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:53.830
Until next time this is Gary with
