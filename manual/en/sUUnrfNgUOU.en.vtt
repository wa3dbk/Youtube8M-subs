One of the complaints that many Razer fans had in the past was the absence of illuminated Razer products. This is not a problem anymore thanks to the Razer Chroma Series.

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:25.600
You are watching the Unboxholics show with Sakis Karpas and this is the Razer Chroma Series. We'll be specifically unboxing the Razer Blackwidow Chroma, the Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma and the Razer Deathadder Chroma.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:35.150
The name "Chroma" derives from the ability that is given to users to choose among a spectrum of visual effects featuring 16.8 million colors.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:50.200
The inclusion of lighting effects is the only difference between the Chroma and non-Chroma products of Razer. So, if you'd like to see a more detailed review of the following products, please visit Unboxholics.com.

00:00:50.521 --> 00:01:04.200
Users can change the color, the intensity and the duration of the lighting effects through the Razer Synapse platform of the company. 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:17.100
My personal favorite is the "reactive" effect which is enabled when you press a button on the keyboard, thus creating a beautiful lighting effect.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:30.900
Things are simpler with the Razer Deathadder because there are only two parts that can be illuminated and those are the Razer logo and the mouse wheel. The available effects are static, breathing and spectrum cycle.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:44.000
Last but not least, the Razer Kraken 7.1 is another product of the Chroma series and the available effects are static, breathing and spectrum cycle.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.700
Check out the Razer Chroma products in action. 

00:02:21.062 --> 00:02:41.800
The Razer Chroma Series is available now and each product costs a little bit more than the original. Aside from the variety in LED lighting, you should know that this is the only difference that you'll see between the non-chroma Razer products and the Razer Chroma series.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.800
