00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.540
This friendly street is in the heart of Utrecht
in the Netherlands.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.149
It is actually a bridge over the old city moat.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.069
The water surrounding the historic city center

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:12.849
has been there since the twelfth century.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.429
The city wall was removed
but little else changed.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.529
If the city council had its way in the 1970s

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.849
it would have been very different.

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:31.170
This lovely place
would have looked like this:

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.980
On this 'before' picture from 1958

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.810
we can see the bridge in the circle.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.820
For the increasing motorized traffic

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.140
the city wanted to get rid of the water

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.880
and use the space
for a city ring road.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.430
By the 1960s
traffic had increased so much

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.510
that a raised ring road
with multi level crossings

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.830
was thought necessary.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.890
A lot of buildings would have to be removed
for that planned highway.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.610
The road was to be built in stages.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.190
The first part was indeed built.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.820
But the second part wasn't.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.610
In the end of the 1960s
the works started.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.740
The water was removed 
and roads were built in its place.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440
By the 1970s

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.180
the first cars used what was soon nicknamed:
"the shortest motorway in the Netherlands".

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.670
Because times were changing
and the protests against the ring road

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.930
became so strong

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.000
that second part
was never built.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.180
In 2010 the road is still there,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.780
but it won't be for very long.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.180
It will be removed completely.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.270
A bit further down it is already closed.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.399
Works are going on
to bring the water back,

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.760
40 years after it was taken from the city.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.600
All this concrete will be gone soon,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.460
a viaduct has already been demolished.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.180
Artist's impressions of the new city moat
look promising.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.099
This roundabout was also built 
in the place of water.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.620
Now it is a bridge

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.239
and the water flows again.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.339
This is the first part of the city moat 
that was brought back.

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:34.510
A 40 year old mistake
erased from history.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.459
There is a difference with the part
that wasn't touched in the first place.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.909
But it is good that Utrecht corrected

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.229
road design mistakes from the past

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.499
for a better future.

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.929
For it is clear that heavy motorized traffic

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.729
simply does not belong here.
