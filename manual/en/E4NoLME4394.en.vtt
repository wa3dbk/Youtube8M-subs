Hello ! Today we are together to do the Britney Spears I wanna go make up tutorial.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.480
So let's just get started !

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.540
Apply your Bobbi Brown skin foundation with a ELF brush, this is the flat brush for foundation.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.520
This brush is great

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.100
Next, matify your skin using the studio fix powder foundation from Mac and the Kabuki brush from Réserve Naturelle

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:52.630
For the cheeks I am using the Mineralize Skinfinish from mac with an angle brush. Britney Spears' cheeks are very defined on the check bone.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:02.980
Britney's eyebrows are much thicker than mine so I'm redrawing them all along with an angle brush.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.120
Once your eyebrows are nicely done, apply your base.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:15.420
I am using here Réserve Naturelle's base. This is a twisted eye puncil and I stump it with my finger

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.060
Use a mat color here I am using inglot eye shadow and this is the 213 brush from MAC

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.420
Then I use a dark mat shadow Inglot that I have just put it in the palm of the eyelid and I ascend in the inner corner of my eye

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.610
This color is the most important color for the make up it will really defined your eye make up with it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.060
So blend it a little bit 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.250
Once you have done this apply a black eye pencil and in the water line as well

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.490
Make sure that you blend under the lash line as well

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.030
So blend it with a 219 from MAC

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.270
Ok your eye make up is nice to blend it so take the same color as before and blend it on the lower lash line

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.720
by taking a black eye shadow this one mat from manly palette

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.940
you'll place on the outer part of your eyes just between the first color used and the eyeliner you have blended

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.950
With the same brush from the beginning apply your highlight

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.000
use all the parts where you see your skin to place the highlight

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.420
Make sure that you blend the black with the highlight. 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.040
I am using lumière cosmétique and this one is called butter cream

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:57.770
Place a cold Grey color on the lower lash line and link it with the top lash line

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.820
Make sure you've blended it well on the outer corner. You can you use your finger

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.640
The eyeliner we're going to do is thicker is the outer corner than in the inner.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:31.710
Do a very thin line on the inner corner and thickened it on the outer part of your eyes

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:39.180
I am using a lipstick from Bare Minerals and a touch of lip gloss and you look is done !
