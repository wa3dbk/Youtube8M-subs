00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.441
He loves to be punched in his face

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.248
Is that your third victory already?

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.924
It depends. When's the next fight Alex?

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.100
We're planning on having a big event this Saturday with our high rollers

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.404
The bids are high so the profit would be as well

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.399
So two days from now ?

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.992
You can earn 20,000Å¯ Euros

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.552
I'm his coach, I'll take care of him

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.588
Your kid will make his own decisions

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.960
Hi, I'm Amit

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.220
In the past couple of years I've been working on my final project for the university

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.733
I've been working on this short film called "UNDERGROUND"
in which I also play the lead role

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.300
It's a genre film, of an unrepresented genre

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.203
Here in Israel

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.712
It's an Action film mixed with drama

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.040
The film's plotline is around Omer

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.156
He is a guy, who has since birth a neural disorder in which he can't feel pain

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.588
And when he grows up he needs to provide for his family

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.160
And he decided to do so by fighting in illegal street fights

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.361
So we started working on it. As you can see we're in the middle of the shooting

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.757
We've recruited a special effects make-up artist, a fighting choreographer. Professional staff

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.159
They all got hooked on this project and volunteered willingly to help

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.048
And make this production to fulfill its potential

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.844
But we still need your help in order for this to happen

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
I've been waiting so long for this project to come to reality

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.400
Cause it's something that was missing here in Israel

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.260
That I would enjoy watching,
and that I know other people would enjoy as well

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.020
So if you believe that we can make unique films here

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.980
that we would enjoy watching over and over

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.124
I would love for you to back us up and support this project

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.080
And become partners to a new and unique creation

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.744
Thank you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.700
