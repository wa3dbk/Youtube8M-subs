00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:05.818
Your brain is a pretty amazing machine.

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:12.539
It's a network of about 86 billion neurons
that if compared to a computer, researchers

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.288
predict is capable of more than a trillion
processes every second.

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:20.268
But… it makes mistakes.

00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:24.338
As much as we hate to admit it, we’re only
human.

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:28.327
Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts we make
when we’re processing information.

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:30.807
They’re errors in our judgement.

00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:34.108
Let’s take a closer look...

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:41.968
For me, building anything is a labour of love...but
our labour may just lead to love.

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:46.538
The IKEA effect is the tendency to place a
disproportionately high value on things you

00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:54.008
assemble yourself–think sets of lego, origami
or, of course, IKEA furniture.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:58.758
In a series of studies where participants
assembled those three things, they saw their

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:05.488
creations as similar in value to the creations
of experts, and they mistakenly thought others

00:01:05.488 --> 00:01:08.698
would share their opinion.

00:01:08.698 --> 00:01:12.958
Researchers found the effect only occurred
when the creations were fully assembled, and

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:18.448
didn’t have an impact when things were partially
assembled or built and then destroyed.

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:23.838
Perhaps our love of DIY creations comes from
us investing our time in them…

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:26.668
But how much time?

00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:33.678
The planning fallacy is where we underestimate
the time it takes to complete a task.

00:01:33.678 --> 00:01:38.478
Researchers suggest we underestimate our own
task-completion times, but not the time it

00:01:38.478 --> 00:01:40.888
would take other people.

00:01:40.888 --> 00:01:46.229
One study asked participants to estimate how
long it would take to do certain tasks, like

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.617
shop for a gift, format document or prepare
a meal.

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:56.107
They found that participants who didn’t
unpack the tasks down into bite size pieces

00:01:56.107 --> 00:02:02.687
were more biased, and greatly underestimated
how long tasks would take.

00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:05.998
So when you break things down, they’re easier
to digest.

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:13.238
Unless, of course, you’re still trying to
digest how much you spent on that IKEA furniture.

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:20.208
Post purchase rationalisation is where you
persuade yourself, using a rational argument,

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:22.328
that a purchase was good value.

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:26.228
Like spending $480 on the ah-pp-lar-oh loveseat.

00:02:26.228 --> 00:02:27.228
With two footstools.

00:02:27.228 --> 00:02:32.898
Most of us refuse to accept that we could
have made a mistake, so we convince ourselves

00:02:32.898 --> 00:02:34.488
that we’ve made a right decision.

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:38.998
I mean, it even comes with two footstools.

00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:45.057
And the availability cascade is a self-reinforcing
process of collective belief formation.

00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:49.938
So if you repeat something for long enough,
something that most other people are saying,

00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:53.418
it will become true.

00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:58.868
If you hear that IKEA is a great cultural
institution and you read that IKEA is a great

00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:04.718
cultural institution, you will probably come
to believe that IKEA is a great cultural institution.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:09.488
It’s the idea that we follow the crowd based
on what’s socially acceptable.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:13.008
I mean, IKEA is a great cultural institution.

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:16.038
That loveseat even came with two footstools.

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:20.358
Sometimes we don’t realise that these cognitive
biases have affected our behaviour–errors

00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:24.228
in our judgement often happen subconsciously.

00:03:24.228 --> 00:03:28.478
I for one, have committed so many planning
fallacies I still haven’t finished most

00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:31.048
things I said I would do.

00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:33.408
Or replied to any of your emails.

00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:34.548
Sorry.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:39.138
Let me know down in the comments, or on Twitter,
if you’ve discovered any of these biases

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:41.798
creeping in your behaviour.

00:03:41.798 --> 00:03:43.978
