00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:02.685
BOBBY_RAHAL - Learning a new track can be a daunting

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:05.284
experience, especially since you don't
want to waste

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:08.593
valuable practice time
figuring out which way the turns go.

00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:11.973
Fortunately, there are some things you
can do to get yourself up to speed

00:00:11.973 --> 00:00:14.023
before you even head out to the track.

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:15.513
PATRICK_LONG - The first thing when I'm learning a new

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:19.394
racetrack or helping a new
student is to tell them you've

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.044
seen all these corners before, on

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:22.548
whatever tracks
you've been to in the past,

00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:24.465
so don't psych yourself out that you've

00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:27.269
never been to Spa or you've
never been to Daytona.

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.931
Just know that you have
to do the same thing

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:30.409
that everybody else
has to do, which is

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:31.989
process new corners.

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:36.380
JOEY_HAND - For me, it's a lot of preparedness

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.118
again, walking the track, knowing things

00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:40.888
like is there brake markers?

00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:42.674
If there is brake markers are they up high?

00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:44.472
Are we at a street course?
Are they high or

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:47.022
are they down on the ground?
Are they cones? Are they

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:48.922
signs? Can they move?

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:51.672
You know, and thinking
about all those things.

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:55.282
But the first thing I do as I like to
go out and find my brake zones.

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.852
You know, I like to get out there,
push the brake zones,

00:00:57.852 --> 00:00:58.932
over-slow or

00:00:58.932 --> 00:01:02.652
under-slow, whatever you want to
call it, and then get to them quickly.

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:04.942
Find a very, very close brake marker

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:06.822
very quickly, and then

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:08.751
just roll through the corners. You know,

00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:10.470
roll apex speeds as
much as you can.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.100
And the last thing, work on power-down.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.530
You know, so for me,
it's all...I work on the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.520
beginning of the corner to the end.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.646
For me learning a new track
is about going out and

00:01:20.672 --> 00:01:22.689
doing the old traditional
walk around the track.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.471
See the nuances, get
down low, look where

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:26.169
the cambers are, look
at curbs that you

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.494
can utilize and curbs that you can't,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.749
because often times you just go out

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.109
there at speed and

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:31.669
it looks a lot different than if you're out there and

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:34.270
you can really study it on foot or on a bicycle.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.366
Other than that,
video-game simulation

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:37.979
is great to learn tracks. I'm

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.658
not one that's a big supporter 
of sitting all week

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.210
on the video games and racing.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.610
You know, if I needed to learn a new

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.124
track I'll spend 20, 30, 40

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.762
minutes on a video-game simulation

00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:48.934
but I won't sit there all week.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.141
JUSTIN_WILSON - I mean, I like to 
start out, if at all

00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.184
possible, I go on iRacing and look it

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.380
up on there and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.760
and learn the track because

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.536
you know, that layout,
knowing when you going

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.350
to turn left and right
is critical and there's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.760
nothing more accurate
than the iRacing software,

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:05.170
so that's
the big one for me.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.209
If you don't know the track, if it's not on

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.458
any software anywhere, it's best just

00:02:11.484 --> 00:02:14.279
to walk it first, look at it, go

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.305
back to your hotel that
night, the next morning you

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:18.409
go out in the race car and
(on) the first lap take it

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.180
easy and then build it up.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.850
It's all about the sight picture and where

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.249
you've got to be looking, so you're

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.148
looking for your references

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:28.329
for braking, for your turn-in

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.540
and just know... you start off hitting those

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:33.150
marks and you can tweak
it as you run on.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.599
RYAN_DALZIEL - When I went to Le Mans for 
the first time, I spent

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.150
hours -- I actually flew out to
Texas -- and I spent hours on a simulator

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.309
just simulating around,
driving a GT car at

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.393
Le Mans and when I went there, I mean it's

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.689
unbelievable how realistic this stuff is.

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.869
SCOTT_PRUETT - And then you look 
at simulators nowadays,

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.639
because I use them effectively, 
I've used one out at

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.709
at Sears Point Raceway, and

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.269
it just magnifies that opportunity
for more miles in cars,

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.626
more miles at affordable situations.

00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:04.039
Even if you were to get off track -- if you get

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.259
off the track in a simulator,

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.150
no big deal. You get off-track in a 
real race car,

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:10.951
now there's potential for bodily
harm as well as,

00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:12.562
you know, tearing up
the race car which is the

00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:13.910
the last thing you want to do.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.829
I learned the Paul Ricard circuit with

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.249
a Moto GP game. You know, so

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.629
I played a Moto GP game that...

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.199
It drove the same track. It was a
motorcycle game but who

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.729
cares? I at least knew

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.919
at Paul Ricard that Turn One
was going to go to the right

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:31.109
and Turn Two's going to go
left or whatever it is, right?

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.249
And so even right now I'm trying to learn Le Mans for

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.780
the pre-qualifying. I'm

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.559
trying to learn Le Mans right now as we speak, so

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:44.549
I think it's a big thing. 
I just, I want to know

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.119
which way the corners go.

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.419
Simulators nowadays, video games nowadays

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.059
are so good that you can learn. 
You CAN learn stuff

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.784
but nothing beats the seat of the pants,
being in the car, you know?

00:03:55.784 --> 00:03:57.684
SAFEisFAST.com

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.429
DARREN_LAW - You know, safe is fast. Obviously,

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:04.951
you want to be safe and not make mistakes

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:06.759
and in this type of racing

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.727
especially when we were coming 
into a 24-hour race,

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:10.799
we have to be careful and

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.609
not have anything go
wrong or we won't finish, so

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.219
safe to a certain extent but you
do still have to push the limits.
