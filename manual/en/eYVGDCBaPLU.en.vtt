00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:16.810
Alright today we are going to review motorcycle
carrier part number MX600 from Rage PowerSport

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.810
Products.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.380
Alright, this motorcycle carrier is designed
for one motorcycle.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.900
It does come with a self storing ramp to help
load up the bike.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.630
It comes with two tie-down points, one for
the outboard and one for the inboard.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.759
It features all steel construction with a
powder coat finish on it.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.050
And the pins themselves, make it adjustable
for different bikes, are galvanized and so

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.050
are the tie-down points.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.670
The last feature about this rack is it does
come standard with an anti-rattle device.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.450
The carrying capacity of this motorcycle rack
is rated up to 600 pounds.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.220
00:45
We will go ahead and attach it with a 5/ 8

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.220
inch hitch pin.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.340
You can also use your favorite locking pin
too.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.540
Then next we will slide on our anti-rattle
device.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.490
Make sure the screws are undone completely
so we can slide it underneath the collar of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.490
the hitch.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.490
When you tighten up the bolts, probably not
all of these are going to catch because of

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.399
the different types of hitches that are out
there and different clearances.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.999
Get as many as you can to grab a hold of the
hitch.

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:22.170
It also has adjustable pins where the tires
go so you can adjust for different size tires

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.179
on your motorcycle.

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:42.439
I am planning on doing the same thing for
the other side too.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:51.810
Alright, next we will go ahead and remove
the ramp and get it ready.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.729
There are two wing nuts that hold it in place.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:14.569
Alright, and with this model we can actually
install the ramp on either side, whichever

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:27.349
is easier for you.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:03:03.069
OK, you can see that the peg on the ramp 
will 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:14.079
actually 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:27.790
fit in the 
hole right here.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.290
And we will just it in there.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.440
And we are ready to load up our bike.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.150
