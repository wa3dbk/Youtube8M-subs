00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.050
The year is 2004.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.100
The world has just been put back on its axis,
owing to the rise of Pokemon and the spate

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.100
of competitive-battle games what followed
in its wake.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.890
The maelstrom was thought to be over, until…

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.720
THE CARD-BATTLE GAMES ATTACKED.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.510
Everything you loved and held dear was turned
into a card-battling monstrosity.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.830
Funny thing was, though, a few of these games
were darn good.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.600
Not all the time, but sometimes, the grainier
mechanics of such a system just kinda… clicked.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.460
Back on the Game Boy Advance, this really
hit home with two particular titles that adapted

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.780
and indeed flourished in this strange format:
Mega Man Battle Network, and Kingdom Hearts

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.620
Chain of Memories.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.580
In this direct sequel to Kingdom Hearts…
everyone forgets everything and you end up

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.899
going through all the places you’d already
BEEN through, trying desperately to remember

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.500
just what the hell you’re doing there in
the first place.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.200
Part of it may or may not be related to searching
for King Mickey in the creepily-named Castle

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.060
Oblivion, where each floor has to be turned
into a locale like Pumpkin Town or Agrabah

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.980
and quested through because… wait, what
was I saying again?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.980
Oh, yeah.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.970
As you can probably tell, this isn’t the
Game Boy Advance version, rather, it’s the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.470
HD PS3 remake of the PS2 remake Re:Chain of
Memories.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.880
Where the original had an isometric viewpoint
and sprite-based graphics, this version uses

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.869
much the same assets and controls as its PS2
or PS3 counterparts.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.690
And while I’ve mentioned my issues with
the mechanics of said titles…

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.380
I’ve gotta say, by slowing down the pace
of the game just a smidge, and allowing for

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.380
greater strategic planning through the manipulation
of a deck, the combat seems to flow much more

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.899
smoothly.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.820
By combining sets of three cards, you can
utilize special attacks, upgrade spells, and

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.970
if you happen to get really, really lucky
when buying randomized packs of cards from

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.150
the friendly Moogles along your journey, just
open up every fight with a level 3 Simba summon

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.980
and wipe out a large chunk of the enemy force.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.700
This also increases the value of the attacks
you make, which becomes important as foes

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.800
can interrupt your actions by playing higher-value
attacks.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.790
If you run out of cards, you can reload your
“hand” by standing still and being vulnerable

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.209
for a while, which is obviously exactly what
you want to be doing in the middle of a fight.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.160
Survive, and you’re rewarded with a room
card, which determines the contents behind

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.280
the next door you open.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.290
It’s a strange, modular world-building system
that gives the player a lot of control, allowing

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.349
for a save point or enemy-free treasure room
or absolute maelstrom of fodder enemies for

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.980
grinding purposes.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.700
Level-up bonuses can teach new slight combos,
increase Sora’s max HP, or boost the total

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.379
card value allowed in each of three equippable
decks.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.370
As it’s derived from a GBA game, there isn’t
much vocal work to speak of, though the PS2

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.900
adaptation added some cutscenes which have
been PS3-ized for optimal duck-feather display

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.959
purposes.

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.879
The soundtrack feels free to turn on the intensity
during battle scenes, with tracks appropriate

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.739
to each locale, while the modular world-chunks
are well-detailed and reward any schmoe who

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.349
wanders through beating any and all pieces
of scenery with an oversized key.

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.930
Yes, it’ll feel weird to play such gritty,
math-centric action on a proper console - just

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.980
like Mega Man Network Transmission felt weird
- but there are those of us of a certain disposition

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.209
who relish the thought of deck optimization,
and making the most out of every available

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.330
point.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:59.040
The obvious “Heartless of the Cards” joke
is left as an exercise for the reader.
