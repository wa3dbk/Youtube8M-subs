00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:09.175
Ok, let’s go back to talk about the kua, the pelvis here

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:19.185
It is interesting to know that many people who practise 
Tai Chi suffer some kind of knee problem, knee injury

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:29.195
I think one of the major reasons is because 
they don’t know how to relax and open this area

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.533
Thus, putting too much stress on the knees

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.540
It is very important to open and strengthen this part 
from the 3 techniques that I’ve shown you

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.450
If you know how to open up and utilize this part

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.383
not only it will prevent many problems of your knees

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:56.560
and you will find you that you become 
much stronger than before

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.496
normally, in our form, like the shibashi

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:10.170
we have a lot of movements, 
going up and down, up and down

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.675
so most people when they think of going up and down

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.184
they only think about bending the knees, straighten 
the knees, bending the knees, straighten the knees

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:33.260
but actually at the same time, 
if you put your hands here, this area

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.310
when you go down

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.370
if you do the movement correctly, 
your body remains straight 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.373
you can feel this part is going in

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.379
so this part is going in

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:59.520
and when you stand up, you can feel that 
this part is pushing your hands out

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.156
this part pushing your hands out

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.995
So, actually whenever you go up and down

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.667
there is a force going in and out at the same time

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.837
so the force is like this, put your hands here

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.676
now, I go down, there is a force going in

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:29.182
and when I stand up, this part will push out from here

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:35.210
like there is a force going this way, going out from here

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.525
and then when you go down, the force is going in

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.528
out

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.197
in

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.340
out

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:10.657
ok, practise this and put your hands here

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.162
when you go down, try to feel this area really going in

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:24.400
when you stand up, try to push it from here but 
make sure your body remain straight

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:32.345
if you do it correctly, you will see that 
you can make a big difference

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.357
when you sit on a chair, 
naturally this part will open up and go in

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.330
so, when you sit on a chair, you see, this part will go in

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.400
unless you want to sit like this

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:07.480
ok, so when you go down it is so simple, 
just as if you are sitting on a chair

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:20.326
and you should be able to feel this part doing the work
going in, out, in, out

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:34.507
so, it is a like . . .
there is a force here going forward and backward

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.100
going forward and backward

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:54.327
and you will find that it become much easier and 
you also become much stronger if do this correctly

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.309
ok, for the next demonstration, 
I need 2 strong men to come out and help me

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.648
don’t be shy

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.652
anyone?

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:27.827
man or woman?

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.997
doesn’t matter as long as they are strong

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:42.342
ok, so what I do is I’ll squat down and you press 
on my shoulders and do not let me come up

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.350
ok, so just stand beside me

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.210
so, I squat down, press on my shoulders

00:05:56.523 --> 00:06:03.463
ok, later on, everyone will try this to experience

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:10.303
ok, first time you just try to stand up 
like a normal person

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.472
you keep on pressing me

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:18.311
it is very difficult for me

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.649
because I only weight 55kg

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:35.328
but the next time you do this, 
this time you think about something different

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:42.836
ok, now I still squat down like before,
but instead of thinking going up

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.338
I think of this part going out

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:54.514
press again

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.190
it becomes much easier

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:04.124
ok, everyone try this
