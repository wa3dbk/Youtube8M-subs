00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.420
In this video I'm going to show you how to do a

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.960
120-degree pleat intersection, which is one of the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.520
basic techniques used for tessellations in origami.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.900
We need to start with a triangle grid,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.420
and I advise to have at least eight divisions.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.440
If you don't know how to fold a triangle grid,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.640
just check one of my other videos.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.360
First choose an intersection

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.900
of creases on the grid

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.100
around which the pleat should be based.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.120
Then locate three creases

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.620
so that they enclose a 120-degree angle.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.920
Or, in other words, two full triangles are in between.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.740
For these three creases, make mountain folds.

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:56.972
Depending on how you folded the grid,

00:00:57.044 --> 00:00:59.284
these already are mountain folds.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.480
For me, they aren't yet, so I'm just

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.860
going along the creases,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120
changing the direction of the crease.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.300
Like so.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.060
Next we're going to go again, along the grid

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.780
to fold one of these mountain folds -

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.940
kind of putting two layers together -

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.780
and those two layers will be folded down

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.520
along this grid crease.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.220
Then these two layers will be folded up

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.540
along this grid crease,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.680
and these two layers will be folded

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.300
over to the right along this grid crease.

00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:53.006
So they're always parallel to the mountain folds.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.720
So if you've got these three,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.000
you can fold the first one over,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.900
maybe by bringing this layer up,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.640
making a valley fold on that grid crease,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.480
and here, again, bring the paper up

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.400
to make a valley fold along the grid crease.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.540
And fold over to the right,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.680
again, making a valley fold.

00:02:32.392 --> 00:02:35.752
And then when you have those valley folds in place,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.760
almost naturally all of this will collapse

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.160
and you'll see that right here

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.200
you fold down.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.460
This is the crease you're going along in a valley,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.960
and it extends all the way up there

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.680
and you push that down so that

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.339
it's a valley fold all the way through,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.540
thus making a small mountain fold right here.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.460
And then you can flatten everything down

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.540
and you've got a flat model again,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.000
and your 120-degree pleat intersection is done.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.020
You can change the pleat intersection

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.340
by just changing how you arrange these flaps.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.320
For example, like so -

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.840
or like so ...

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.360
or any way you like.

00:03:36.562 --> 00:03:39.122
If you turn around the model you'll see

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.020
that you have one 120-degree angle,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.900
another one,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.920
and a third one.
