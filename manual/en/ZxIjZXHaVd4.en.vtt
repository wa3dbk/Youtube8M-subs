00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.240
Lara Croft hit the Game Boy Advance like a
Gretchen Wilson song.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.320
Shootin’ pistols, humpin’ walls, jumpin’
through fires...hey, who knew Lara was a country

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.320
fan?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.960
It’s Tomb Raider: The Prophecy, ya’ll.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.820
So this 2002 release was a Game Boy Advance
exclusive.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.870
And actually, it would be the only Tomb Raider
game to go with an isometric perspective until

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.059
The Guardian Of Light eight years later.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.380
And if there’s one thing that defines The
Prophecy, it’s that isometric perspective.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.670
And bad grammar.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.059
And flipping switches.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.170
And dogs.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.220
So there is a story here, but it’s never
really all that clear.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.140
Something about magic stones that can summon
a monster, which in turn brings about the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.140
apocalypse.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.140
Eh, whatever.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.850
People are always so worried about the apocalypse.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.880
Who cares?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.240
We’re overdue for a good plague, anyway.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.840
A mild apocalypse would suffice.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.430
But no, there’s Lara Croft.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.549
Freaking...overachiever.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.220
Neither apocalypse nor C cup for Lara Croft.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.930
So the game has a kind of old-school flair
to it, which I really like.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.670
And it suits Tomb Raider well in this particular
application.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.040
So there’s plenty of platforming and puzzle
solving and shimmying across ledges, and at

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.240
least in theory, it works great on the GBA...but
the problem with this game is really two-fold.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.619
One, the perspective doesn’t always work.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.840
And two, the gameplay never evolves.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.190
To speak to the prior, there are more a few
times when the game’s graphics fail its

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.190
perspective.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.500
Which is to say discerning ledges from backgrounds
can be problematic.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.900
But the bigger problem is that...Lara’s
objectives never change.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.810
From beginning to end, it’s just...flip
switch, find door, disable trap, find door,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.810
shoot dogs.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.340
It all works perfectly fine and is actually
good fun at first.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.300
But it gets repetitive really fast.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:37.340
And some of those sound effects.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.900
Ugh.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.310
This is a classic example of a game that...you
know, it starts off with some fun ideas, everything

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.940
is going fine, you wait for it to take that
next step, and it never does.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.099
It never changes gear.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.500
And technically, you know, you can definitely
get to your destination that way.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.040
But you’re gonna be in the same lane the
whole time, and someone is probably gonna

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.150
give you the finger.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.120
That’s Tomb Raider: The Prophecy.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:21.269
The gaming equivalent of a good-looking mom
who sadly drives a minivan.
