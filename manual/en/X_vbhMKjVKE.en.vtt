00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.379
Meet the camera drone that follows you automatically;
takes your selfies

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:10.700
This Incredible Waterproof 'Selfie' Drone
Will Track You After You Throw It Into The Air

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.039
With his hand outstretched, a small drone
resting in his palm, Antoine Balaresque looks

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.030
like a falconer.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.230
When he tosses the drone in the air, its propellers
start spinning and a built-in camera begins

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.940
recording. As Balaresque turns and walks away,
the drone follows him.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.720
The self-flying Lily Camera is a new consumer
photography drone specifically for capturing

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.210
aerial selfies. It knows exactly where its
subject is at all times, automatically tracking

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.809
their location through a small remote with
GPS that users keep in their hand or pocket.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.290
A surfer might fling the waterproof drone
into the air for a shot that follows her along

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.510
a wave. Mountain bikers could get a bird’s-eye
view of their trip down a hill. Tennis players

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.239
might use the footage to improve their game.
On the less sporty side, a family could cram

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.019
everyone at a reunion into a group photo.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.900
“It’s all about getting the shot. Lily
takes care of all the flight,” said co-founder

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.310
Henry Bradlow.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.250
Co-founded in 2013 by Balaresque and Bradlow
while they were students at Berkeley, Lily

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.350
is entering a crowded field of consumer drones
like DJI’s Phantom and action cameras like

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.770
GoPro. They hope Lily will appeal to the selfie
stick and extreme sports crowds more than

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.040
drone hobbyists.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.830
Flying anywhere between two and 50 feet off
the ground, the drone doesn’t require any

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.009
real-time piloting or a hand-held controller.
You just throw it in the air, and when you’re

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.540
done, press a button on the remote and it
lands back in your hand.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.790
Before takeoff, choose from a list of pre-set
movements or program custom shots on the companion

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.960
mobile app. Lily can follow a subject around
for cinematic tracking shots, slowly zoom

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.430
in or out, make a lazy circle around them,
or just hover at a set spot in the air. The

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.740
app also shows a live feed of the drone’s
view.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.279
The disk-shaped black quadcopter is a little
over 10 inches wide and 3 inches tall. It

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:18.799
weighs 2.8 pounds, flies up to 25 miles per
hour and can stay in the air for 20 minutes

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.799
before needing a charge. Inside, a built in
camera shoots 1080p video and captures 12

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.450
megapixel still photos.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.090
Inside the remote are an accelerometer, barometer
and GPS sensor. Bradlow says the sensors can

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.359
be used to program smart shots, like detecting
when a snowboarder makes a jump and telling

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.340
the camera to switch to slow motion. In addition
to letting you zoom in and pan left or right,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.279
the remote has a microphone to record audio
on the ground.

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:55.340
At a recent demonstration of Lily, Bradlow
and Balaresque used prototypes they had built

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.909
in-house using 3D printers and a CNC machine.
However, they had an early production version

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.419
of the drone on hand and said they’re already
working with manufacturers in Asia.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:12.659
Though Lily won’t be commercially available
until February 2016, the company is starting

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:19.659
to take early orders this week. Pre-sale units
will cost $499 — half the final retail price

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.959
of $999. So far Lily has raised $1 million
in funding from SV Angel, High Line Venture

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.169
Partners and Upside Partnership.
