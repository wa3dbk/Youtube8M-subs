00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:22.829
You know what you do with Mahjong?

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.570
Turn it into a war game.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.570
That’s magical.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.769
That’s what this game does, and hey...you
know what else you do?

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.619
You make the tiles 3D.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.829
Obviously, I’m being a jerk.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.910
It’s Mahjong 3D: Warriors of the Emperor.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.989
Now, it’s not that those things in and of
themselves ruin Mahjong 3D.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.859
You couldn’t even call it that without the
3D, and listen...wars with samurais and parchment

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:53.859
paper?

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:54.859
Always a good thing.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.289
But it’s what this game neglects in favor
of the superfluous that leaves a bad taste

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.289
in my mouth.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.179
So you play as a young Chinese king.

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:04.979
I’m not even going to try with the names.

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:05.980
That’s the thing.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.670
It’s easy to write reviews—those cowards
can type whatever they want.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.930
Hey, try reading that crap into a microphone!

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.610
I gotta be like, “Oh, you’re this king,
and he’s trying to conquer these places.”

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.630
I’m like Michael Cera trying to translate
the Bible.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.009
So it’s cool that there’s a story...I
guess.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.930
I mean, I don’t really need them from puzzle
games, but games like Puzzle Quest show that

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.210
there’s definitely room for that.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.049
But the problem I have is with the game’s
decision to go 3D...specifically, the design

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.990
decision that move implies.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.560
Now, the 3DS has two screens, right?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.479
And each one does something different.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.450
The top screen does 3D graphics, but the bottom
would let you actually touch the tiles.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.790
It’s okay that Mahjong 3D went with 3D tiles
instead of tiles you can touch, but at least

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.539
find a way to take advantage of the touch
screen, as well.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.670
This game doesn’t.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.729
See, you play by dragging your stylus on the
bottom, which moves a cursor on top.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.850
So right off the bat, you have this disconnect
between the touch and the cursor, and it feels

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.850
a bit weird.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.629
The worst part, though, is how you make the
matches.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.980
You have to touch a tile, hold down the cursor,
drag it to a match and release...and you do

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.590
all this with the inherent disconnect.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.130
It just feels like...there had to be a better
way to do this.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.629
Fortunately, if you can get the hang of it,
there is a lot here in terms of content.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.599
The game has a ton of levels, let alone varieties.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.100
There are a few different types you deal with,
including “debate” levels where you have

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.090
to outmatch the computer.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.900
And if you somehow want more, there’s even
a level editor in this freaking thing.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.220
This game has everything.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.819
Well, except a natural and smooth control
scheme.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.190
And that’s why I was so lukewarm about Mahjong
3D: Warriors of the Emperor.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.650
It contends that 3D graphics and feature lists
and level editors are important enough to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280
make simple control an afterthought.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.459
Meh, I’d argue the opposite.
