00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.340
So I think I always kind of had an inkling 
that I was attracted to the same sex 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.070
I guess for me I knew I was gay at a very young age 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.970
I realised I was attracted to men and women 
during my teenage years 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.570
I first realised I was bisexual about 4 years ago

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.750
As soon as I went to school I knew that I was, as they say, "different"

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.650
I had a lot of girlfriends but not many guy friends, 
and I was having [pause]

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.720
feelings towards men that I never really experienced before.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.340
I didn't really know quite what was in my mind for a while 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.940
What I knew about being gay I found out through reading books.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.050
So my school years I just conformed and got along.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.090
I really hated going to school for a period of time 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.090
I think I tried to please a lot of people, 
and tried to just float between groups

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.290
and I just wanted to be like everyone else was 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.080
When I came out in high school 
I was the only out person at my school 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.000
I did notice that there was a fair bit of 
negativity and silence around being gay

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.720
Rumours spread like wildfire and that happened 
really quickly at my school 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.380
and just everything changed

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.000
Across the whole school a whole bunch of kids 
had decided that they would group up 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.028
and they would write a whole bunch of 
offensive things about me all over the school   

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.405
There was regular kind of taunts from starting at 
saying, you know, "You stupid girl"

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:38.620
or "you stupid fairy."

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.700
"fag", "homo"

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.721
Then developing into really, really aggressive kind of 
bullying, you know, being pushed into the lockers, 

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.380
I think I was spat at once.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.410
My class decided it would be a good idea 
to take a vote on who hated me

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.409
I went to the toilet and I got bundled up in the cubicle 
and got absolutely beaten the hell out of. 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.422
They left me bloody and unconscious on the floor. 
But not until it happens, do you realise 

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:12.453
that there is that much hatred 
or misunderstanding or you know  

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:14.060
evilness in people.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.067
When you're a little kid you think oh luckily I've been born 
with all my arms and legs and fingers and toes, but oh yeah

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:21.290
I've got that other thing I have to hide. 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.902
I thought being a "closet queen" was really 
repressive, and I think 

00:02:27.922 --> 00:02:29.780
people pay a high price for it

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.098
I suffered from depression through a lot of high school 
and coming out of high school because 

00:02:35.108 --> 00:02:37.840
I couldn't fully come to terms with who I was. 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.820
It was quite destructive for me personally

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.500
If I was accused of being gay I would deny it

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.060
When you are different people enjoy, 
for whatever reason, being aggressive.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.072
Things could have gotten to a place where maybe 
they couldn't have returned

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.030
I could've done something really bad.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.063
I would be lying if I say I hadn't considered suicide. 
I've come very very very close to suicide 

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:06.490
as far as buying the stuff to kill myself with. 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.930
And even though you wont tell your family because you're embarrassed 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.000
I thought that coming out was scary and
I didn't know how my mum and dad would react.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.340
I really wanted to come out to my parents for a long long time, 
but I guess the longer you leave it the harder it gets in a way. 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.740
I thought it was about time to actually be 
really truthfully honest with myself

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.754
In some ways coming out was really easy because I did it by letter 
back in the old days when people used to send letters.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.940
They didn't take it the best

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.860
There's only been a few hiccups 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.360
That definitely wasn't in their plan for my life 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.480
My dad isn't too comfortable with it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.470
He had these grand plans of me finding 
a nice Italian woman, and

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.920
settling down, and having kids and was 
looking forward to that traditional sort of marriage

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.469
They were wanting me to have kids, do the Catholic boy thing 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.870
and find a girl

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:09.110
My mum particularly said, I wish it wasn't true. 
And that was really hard to hear because that was 
something that I had indeed thought myself. 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.890
My father didn't talk about it. 
Took my father about 6-7 years before we talked. 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.889
I found a lot of struggle with my mother because I thought 
she was going to be more supportive than she actually was.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.956
Slowly they realise that I'm still the same person, I'm just a much happier version 

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.250
of who I used to be.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.255
After I did come out to my family and 
a lot of my friends, I found that 

00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:39.120
life felt a little bit easier. 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.840
Things have really turned around 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.840
Once the doors opened, once I made that first step, 
things just started to get better. Much better. 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.610
I'm happy the way I am. I like my life the way it is. 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.600
When you're a teenager being different is 
something that people feel they can victimise you for

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.170
It's not your fault. You're not doing anything wrong. 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.400
As an adult being different is a little bit of a badge 
of honour and I think people kind of like it. 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.400
I am what I am because I am gay. 
I am what I am because I'm not straight.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.660
If I was straight I would be a very different person. 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:29.590
For every person out there that doesn't understand and can be mean, 
there's a whole army of people who are really supportive and 
loving and nice. Very nice. 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.598
Since that point I have made some really really great gay friends and really really great 

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:37.810
straight friends that are supportive of me. 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.813
It's a lot easier to pretend to be straight but it's not the way I 
would live my life. I like to lie straight in bed. 

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.280
That's the only straight thing I probably do! 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.286
There are people that you can talk to; there's plenty 
of support out there. Please don't be isolated and

00:05:52.306 --> 00:05:58.293
ensure that you love and respect and care for yourself, 
because you're very important. 

00:05:58.313 --> 00:06:00.660
I think that being gay is fantastic. 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.420
This is who I am and I'm very proud of who I am

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.580
And so I just want to say 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.010
I'm gay

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.550
I'm gay

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.780
I am a queer man

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.300
I'm an out and proud queer woman 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.540
I am a bisexual woman

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.960
I'm gay

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.850
I am gay

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.230
I'm a gay man

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.890
I am bisexual.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.190
I'm gay

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.470
I have definitely seen signs along the way 
that have proved to me that it was worth it. 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.810
It does get better

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.050
It does get better

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.770
Things do get better

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.630
It gradually gets better

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.700
It doesn't matter if you are gay, straight, bi, transgender

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.730
Life has gotten better

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.750
It does get better; it's getting better all the time

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.170
And things will always get better

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.069
I promise it gets better.

00:06:47.089 --> 00:07:02.069
