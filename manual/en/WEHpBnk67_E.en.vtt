00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.610
Hey guys so today I’m here with my review
of the HP Veer

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.790
4G for AT&amp;T. I’ve been using this phone
for the past few

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.980
days now so let me give you my full review.
The first thing

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.550
that will jump out at you is the size of the
phone. With a

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.070
2.6 inch display and a slide out physical
keyboard the Veer

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.750
is absolutely tiny even compared to phones
like the iPhone.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.390
I’ll get into how this effects usability
a bit later on but

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.040
suffice it to say that the 2.6 inch screen
is nice and bright

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.170
and has a very reasonable resolution of 320x400
pixels. Phone

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.690
calls on the Veer are surprisingly good thanks
to it’s dual

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.920
microphones. The speaker is also surprisingly
decent with

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.570
good volume without any distortion when laid
down on a flat

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.670
surface. The 4G part of the phone comes courtesy
of the AT&amp;T

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.649
HSPA+ network. Just like the Inspire 4G I
recently reviewed

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.300
the Veer gets decent, if not amazing speeds.
I typically found

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.300
somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 Mbps
down and usually a

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.199
bit less than 1Mbps up assuming you have a
good connection.

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.249
Certainly not bad but this is nowhere near
the speeds you’ll

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.969
find on Verizon’s 4G LTE network. I’ll
say it right now: I love

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.180
webOS. The multitasking is second to none
and the gesture area

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.410
on the Veer allows you to control the phone
effortlessly.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.830
Currently on it’s 2.1.2 release as of this
review webOS screams

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.160
on the Veer. Don’t let the small size fool
you: this is a very

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.990
fast little phone. With an 800Mhz Snapdragon
processor and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.630
512MB of RAM it chews up and spits out multitasking
as many

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.620
apps as you like. When you get into the apps
however the Veer

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.830
becomes a bit of a mixed bag. It comes preinstalled
with quite

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.980
a few apps such as a mail client, contacts
app, a YouTube player,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.130
Google Maps and Amazon MP3. Most all of these
are just fine

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.890
however where the real issues lie is in the
App Catalog. The interface

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.950
is decent but there are some fairly major
holes in the selection

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.770
including an official Twitter app, Netflix,
Skype and many many

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.610
other major apps that are unavailable. To
make matters worse, not all

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.950
apps are available for the Veer if they were
made for the larger

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.710
display on the Pre. Things get much better
in the browser. While

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.960
you are of course constrained by the small
display you’ll find

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.690
that the browser is quite fast and has some
of the smoothest

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.610
zooming and scrolling I’ve ever seen. You’ll
also find support

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.200
for Adobe Flash 10.1 for viewing Flash content
which runs decently

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.700
like it does on most mobile devices but is
less than perfect.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.080
The camera is a sore spot. While it has a
5 megapixel sensor it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.319
lacks both autofocus and a flash resulting
in mediocre images in

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.910
most situations. On top of that I ran into
a bug that crashed the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.750
camera app and restarted the phone after taking
a few pictures.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.379
The story doesn’t get much better as the
VGA video is fairly awful

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.799
as well. The size of the phone limits how
big the keyboard can be

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.060
but overall I was impressed. The sliding mechanism
seems to be

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.409
very robust and the keys had a nice tactile
feel that had me up

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.889
to a decent typing speed in just a few days
of using the Veer.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.999
It also lights up subtly making it great for
typing even when you

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.340
can’t easily make out the tiny keys. The
Veer has a proprietary

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.829
magnetic charging and syncing port that’s
very similar to the

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.060
MagSafe adapter on Apple laptops. It works
well, connecting

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.151
strongly. What isn’t so great is the included
3.5mm headphone

00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:03.810
adapter that snaps onto the phone. While this
too snaps on easily

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.569
it’s tiny and almost certain to get lost
in the first few days of

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.959
owning the phone. It’s a bit of a shame
really as the sound chip

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.909
in the Veer actually sounds quite good once
you hook headphones up.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.420
Battery life on the Veer is decent. In my
testing I found that I was

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.499
able to get through a day of moderate usage
before the phone died.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.340
Your mileage will certainly vary but you will
almost certainly need to

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.159
plug the Veer in every night. The Veer is
a bit of a hard phone to

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.159
sum up. On one hand you have a poor camera,
a lackluster app store

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.269
and no way to expand the roughly 6GB of usable
onboard storage.

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.629
But on the other hand you have a stellar OS,
an absolutely

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.620
speedy experience and excellent build quality.
What it boils down

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.189
to is are you interested in a small phone?
If so the Veer is a great

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.790
choice and will serve you well. If size isn’t
as big of a deal to you

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.569
though I would have to recommend taking a
look the Pre 3 which should

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.980
be available in the coming months and has
all of the same features

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.280
of the Veer but in a larger package. If you
