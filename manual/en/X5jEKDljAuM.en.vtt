00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.930
In today's Slanted Lens Lesson we're out
on location shooting a rain shot with the

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.560
new Canon 1DC that Lens Pro to Go was nice
enough to deliver to us. Our goal today is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.090
to shoot video on this new 4K camera and to
pull still images from that footage. We're

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.230
going to test the different shutter speeds
and see how they affect the video and the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.810
stills. Let's go ahead and get started,
see what we can do.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.390
You know, rain is a perfect subject to test
this concept of pulling still frames from

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.510
video. Before we get started we need some
technical background. Video is a series of

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.309
single images, each frame blurring into the
next frame is what creates that look of motion.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.110
Stills, on the other hand, are single images
that have very little motion blur. The shutter

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.920
speed in video is just like the shutter speed
in stills. It's the amount of time the shutters

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.759
open during each exposure. We'll be shooting
at 24 frames a second, which means that there

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.390
will be 24 exposures, images, or frames, each
second. The normal shutter speed is 1/50th

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.810
of a second, or twice the frame rate.
Let's look at two different pieces of video

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.970
with different shutter speeds. The first is
at 24 frames per second and a shutter speed

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.770
of a 50th of a second. Each image, or frame,
is blurred. Now, at 400th of a second, each

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.470
image, or frame, is sharp. Let's see them
rolling side by side and how they differ.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.780
The video with the fast shutter speed is pretty
choppy and not really good for general purposes.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.810
1/100th or 1/200th of a second will give us
sharp images of the rain and the people, but

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.619
may not make the best video. If the shutter
rate is too fast the video starts to look

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.750
choppy, but the stills are more likely to
be in focus. If it's too slow, the video

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.950
and stills are going to be just too blurry.
Unlike stills, video needs motion blur to

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.840
look good. So that's our challenge here,
a balance between those two thoughts.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.209
Before we do our shutter test let's take
a look at how we set up our rain shot. We're

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.840
shooting outside, so the rain can run down
the driveway and not cause a problem. First,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.919
we're going to put up two 12 by 12 duvetyne
side by side to create a black background.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:21.040
Duvetyne is a black fabric that doesn't
really reflect much light so it's a perfect

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.319
background if you wanted to just go black.
Using Sun Seeker, I know the sun is going

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.730
to be in a back light position between 2 and
4 p.m., so I position the duvetyne's in

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.309
a manner that will allow me to use the sun
as a back rim light for those two hours.

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:39.779
For our rain we went with our tried and true
fanned spray nozzles. You can see all about

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:44.049
making rain in an earlier video we did called
"Creating Rain: a Special Effect". These

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.489
will both be placed on the camera right side
shooting up and allowing the rain to fall

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.809
on our umbrellas. It's nice because our
frame is pretty tight, so these two will cover

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.799
the area pretty well.
This is supposed to be at night, so I'll

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.719
set color balance on the Canon 1DC to tungsten,
or 3200 degrees. This makes the sunlight very

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:07.529
blue. Here's our first shot with the rain
and sunlight only. For the camera left side

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.739
we added a 1K Fresnel to be on her face. This
is a tungsten light, so it will be neutral

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.120
on her face. We're trying to compete with
the sun as our backlight so we need a lot

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.959
of light on her face. We'll add another
2K, and that looks much better. Our last light

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.799
is going to be a fill light on the camera
right side. We used a Photoflex P22, and pushed

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.680
that right up to the edge of the frame. We
used a large golf umbrella covered with plastic

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.879
on a C stand, to keep the water off the lights.
Now that our lights are in place let's take

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.620
a look at the different shutter speeds. These
first tests were all shot at 24 frames a second,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.839
at an F13. We first shot at 1/50th of a second,
this gave us really nice blurry rain but our

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:51.069
talent was a little soft, sometimes, when
they moved. Our next test was at 1/100th of

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.260
a second. The rain drops are shorter lines
in each frame and don't blur together as

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.010
well as video. They also don't look very
good as still images because the rain just

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.959
comes out as small dashes. We're now going
to go to 1/200th of a second. The rain drops

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.029
in each frame are very short lines of dashes
and don't blur together well in the video.

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.269
When we go to stills the rain is just small
dashes and doesn't look very good, but his

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.540
face is sharp in just about every frame.
Here's a split frame of the 1/50th of a

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.180
second next to the 1/200th of a second. Again,
if you shoot with too high of a shutter speed

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.710
there is no motion blur on individual frames,
and when viewed at normal speed the video

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.889
looks choppy and stuttery. The was used very
effectively in beach landing scenes of "Saving

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.689
Private Ryan". It creates an action look
because things are kind of jumpy and stuttery.

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.360
For us, we're going to use 1/50th of a second
with our rain. It just looks better. It looks

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.240
better in the video, it looks better in the
stills, we are just going to lose a lot of

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.520
images to motion blur on the face as she moves
around.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.639
We added smoke from our Rosco 1700 in a lot
of the images just to add another layer; I

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.289
thought that was very effective. Here is some
of the footage we shot at 60 frames a second

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.090
and 1/125th of a second shutter speed. This
is one of the stills we pulled from that slow

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.819
motion footage. This is a fast shutter speed
so the stills are a little sharper, the downside

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.220
is you're shooting slow motion. It's very
beautiful, but you can't shoot in slow motion

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.710
all the time.
My conclusion about this process of pulling

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.409
stills from video with the intent of using
both the stills and the video is that it's

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.560
pretty difficult, and only good for certain
things. If you're shooting wildlife and

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.909
outdoor things I think this could be a great
option, it has tremendous possibilities. The

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.830
problem is that you're going to lose a lot
of frames to motion blur, especially if you're

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.590
shooting something moving like an animal.
As for advertising, when you're shooting

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.960
something you have complete control over it
just doesn't make very much sense to me.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.219
I found the process of pulling frames was
kind of like a shotgun approach. I kind of

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.129
felt like we were just letting the camera
roll, having her move, and did we get something?

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.840
Was it right? It just felt very distant and
not comfortable to me.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.560
The shutter speed is really an issue that
can't be solved right now. 1/50th of a second

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.430
is what looks best at 24 frames a second,
it gives too much motion blur. Now, I shoot

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.110
stills at 1/50th of a second all the time,
but they're not moving through the frame.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.719
They're in position; it's much more controlled.
That said, I love the Canon 1DC want to buy

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:13.199
one. I see times when it would be a great
value to be able to shoot video and pull the

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.360
stills. I've personally learned that this
process has limitations, but there are times

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.839
when it will be extremely valuable. So keep
those cameras rolling and keep on clicking.
