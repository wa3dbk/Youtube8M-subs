hey Leo

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:13.169
what is this noise?

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.060
how many pieces, look

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.880
do you think there are pieces enough to make the huge truck in the picture?

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.479
do you?

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.160

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.640
the frame, the axes of wheels

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.320
the four wheels

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.810
three seats

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.260
the steering wheel

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.660
and then

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.470
the yellow cabin

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.420
where do exhaust pipes go?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.520
thank you Leo, we have to put them in this way

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.720
and the bumper

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.560
now we make the back part

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.260
we need of wheels, of course

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.200
it's laking a wheel on this axis

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.639
leo, can you find it?

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.039
very good

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.840
look for it in the sand

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.669
which wheel we need?

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.549

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.179
let's go Leo

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.600
