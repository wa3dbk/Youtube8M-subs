00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Hello everybody!

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.580
I get a lot of questions on my main channel about Japan

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.320
and Japanese and lots of different things

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.740
and on Tumblr and stuff like that.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.120
But the thing is that only one person

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.360
gets to see that response. Or maybe like 10.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.240
So I thought I would just do a short series of videos

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.180
on this channel answering your questions about Japan.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.260
So that means leave your question below

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.020
and the most popular questions I'll make a video about.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.380
So today's video is one of my most frequently asked questions,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.480
which is, how did you learn Japanese.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.620
And it's going to get a little bit long, so hang in there!

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.800
First of all, my Japanese is not perfect.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.680
It is functional, but it isn't perfect.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.140
It isn't super amazing, and I'm still learning, so ... yeah!

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.360
Secondly, I self-studied Japanese.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.540
... so I studied by myself

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.820
and I don't think that's the most efficient way to study a language, necessarily,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.220
it depends on how you learn

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.120
but I definitely think that being in a classroom situation

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.200
with that kind of pressure cooker thing

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.460
where you have to memorise things for tests

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.520
and you have to speak in class and stuff

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.420
really helps when you're learning a language.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.220
So look up your local language classes

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.560
and if there aren't any, stick with me

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.420
because I'll tell you how I self-studied Japanese.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.140
First thing you've got to do is learn kana, hiragana and katakana.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.560
Just get down and dirty and learn those beasts quickly

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.760
because you need to!

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.480
I once knew someone who had lived in Japan for a year

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.920
and still hadn't finished learning katakana

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.460
and that's just - no! You only need a week to learn them, trust me!

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.520
You could learn them in a day actually. It's rote memorisation.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.740
Memorise it, learn how to write it - you're done!

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.040
OK. I know that sounded a little bit crazy but I'm serious.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
Learn hiragana and katakana.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.680
Now we're going to go on to my favourite Japanese textbook.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.800
The best textbook for learning Japanese IMHO

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.980
It is slightly academically slanted

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.200
It's very very structured, which I really like

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.760
but if you learn a different way from me,  you might not like it so much ... and it is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.500
Genki.  So this is the second one, the first one is red.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.220
You can find it on Amazon and I'll put a link below.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.500
You can buy it with a workbook and a CD.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.620
I've never really used the CD but I think that would be really beneficial

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620
if you're learning by yourself.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.960
Now this book I entirely self-studied.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.560
and it has amazing structure, like I just said.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.800
You get a list of vocabulary and you have to memorise it.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.900
because all the chapters integrate the vocabulary as you go on

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.240
so it's a great way to motivate you to actually memorise

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm dropping things left, right and centre here!

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.260
But anyway, it has a vocabulary section

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.820
it has grammar, pages of grammar, explains it really well in English

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.020
and then  - more stuff I used to practise -

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.300
and then it has tons of practice,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.240
speaking challenges

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.140
and for each lesson, at the back there is a list of kanji.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.120
Even if you don't have a teacher in a class

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.120
or a friend to study with or a language exchange partner

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.940
I think you can learn so much from this textbook alone.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.960
Obviously, start with the red one if you're a beginner.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.040
and then move on to Genki II if you enjoy the red one.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.620
It can get a little bit pricey overseas

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.640
but if you have a friend who's going to Japan

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.200
or a friend in Japan, it's only 3000 Yen,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.720
which is actually quite cheap, I think, for this kind of book.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.860
I think I paid 90 dollars for it in New Zealand.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.400
So, yay! Not yay for that price, but yeah.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.840
The only downside is - you don't have a teacher to check your answers

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.080
You really have to self-check, and you can accidentally learn things wrong.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.260
There's also "Minna no Nihongo", which is another series of beginner textbooks

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.720
and advanced and intermediate textbooks, I think.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.080
I've never really used it but tons of universities use it, I think.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.940
So there's that, if you don't like style of the Genki textbook.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.660
OK, my recommendations if you've finished Genki II

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.760
It's so much harder to find solid study books

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.120
so what I did when I finished Genki II

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.420
was I went on to these books.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.800
I did sankyu (N3) first and then I got the nikyu (N2) ones

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.460
after I'd memorised everything in the sankyu ones

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.440
but there's a bit of overlap

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.900
so just choose which one looks good for your level

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.980
And these are really good for reinforcing stuff like kanji

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.600
It helped me with my kanji and reinforcing grammar.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.080
It has grammar, reading, kanji and also vocabulary.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.880
These are pretty good. I'll put a link down below.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.280
The drill is really noisy, sorry about that.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.220
But I have to keep going.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.860
So Japanese books, manga, magazines,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.660
English books in Japanese, Japanese movies

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.720
- stuff like that are all great.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.160
Supplement your learning ... that's so fricking loud!

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.780
OK, I'm back. It was noisy. I came back.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.940
So the last step is immersion, which you can achieve by coming to Japan

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.360
or you can do it by surrounding yourself with Japanese things

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.080
Japanese music, Japanese cartoons, Japanese dramas,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.940
Japanese movies, Japanese people and Japanese stuff.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.700
And you can change your computer to Japanese

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.220
and you can speak to yourself in Japanese

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.240
and you can record a vlog in Japanese.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.740
In fact if you want to try that, do your "jikoshoukai" (self-introduction)

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.600
and post it as a video response to this video

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.660
and we can all be Japanese-y. No ...

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.840
And the last thing is using the Internet as a learning tool

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.200
I put this last for a reason

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.720
because even though you can learn some pretty cool Japanese from the Internet

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.640
and you can definitely immerse yourself in Japanese

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.660
and practise your Japanese on the Internet

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.860
it is definitely not the only thing you should be doing.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.800
It's an additional thing you can do to supplement your learning.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.540
I've heard of people Skyping with Japanese people,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.540
meeting on Twitter,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.180
and there are loads of Japanese people who want to learn English

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.960
so you can do a language exchange.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.180
There's a website called Lang-8 where people can correct your journal entries.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.860
YouTube has tons of Japanese-y videos. Tons!

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.160
You could probably spend hours and hours and days.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.640
It would take you years to watch them all.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.760
Just be careful, because I know, and you know

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.840
how addictive the Internet is.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.300
It will trick you into thinking you're studying

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.480
when really you're not.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:13.100
Because you might be able to pick up a few things from a YouTube video or a website

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.160
but it's probably not as much as you would pick up

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.040
if you just sat down for 10 minutes a day and studied.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.660
And that's the last point. I made three last points, sorry!

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.720
The last point is just a little bit a day, and don't feel discouraged.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.920
What I used to do was study in my lunchbreaks

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.300
so I would carry around my textbooks

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.000
and any chance I had to study, I would use it.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.060
It really helped me, so maybe that will help you.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.040
Unless you don't work.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.700
So leave your  [sound of metal being dropped] Yeah.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.340
So you guys, in the comments section, please leave your suggestions

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.260
and your language learning tips.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.180
And also leave your requests

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.680
and thumb up the ones you like the sound of

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.200
and I will probably do them for you.  Yay!

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:12.200
Byeeeee! Wow, it went really blurry. Goodbye.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.100
And yeah! I just look like Boxxy.
