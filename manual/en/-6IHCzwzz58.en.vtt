00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:07.050
Okay, in this segment we're going to cover
installing the computer and the computer cover.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.300
First, what we want to do is this carpet here
where the vent comes out underneath the seat

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.339
on the passenger's side, we don't have a wiring
harness to fold it under. So, what I've done

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.960
is taken the lip and folded it back, so it's
smashes down and holds itself down. That way

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.770
that won't be in the way of that vent. First
we want to take the computer, make sure we

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.010
got it lined up right--the three mounting
points. And check our electric connectors.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.940
And just start--we'll go from left to right.
This large one first, push in till it clicks.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.770
Do not force these, make sure that they go
in correctly. They should slide in normally

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.360
and click when they lock. If they're real
hard, check, make sure you've got it in line

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.020
correctly, and you don't have anything that
might be blocking the port of entry or causing

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.840
you a problem. Lock them all in place. Then
we just want to slide it over to where it

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.650
bolts down. It's going to use three of these
six millimeter bolts with ten millimeter head

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:29.090
that are about an inch long. And we just want
to go around and get the three bolts started.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.280
Now I've got a ten millimeter deep socket--I
don't need it for this application, it's just

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.659
handy, it gets it up a little higher and easier
for me to reach. I'll put a ratchet on to

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.049
try to get it to speed down. Then I'm just
going to go around and snug all three of them.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:02:02.159
Then I'll tighten them down. The next step
is a cover, and it's going to come and cover

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:11.620
this wiring harness assembly, and it's going
to go into that machined portion of the computer

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.560
itself, so it's going to be a small four--three
or four millimeter machined screw head that

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.590
goes into those two slots. Go ahead and put
those two screws in place and that'll conclude

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.010
installing the computer and the computer cover.
Please watch our next segment, we're going

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.300
to cover installing the center console.
