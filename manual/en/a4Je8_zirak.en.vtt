00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.330
Welcome to the National Weather Service briefing
for a significant rain and windstorm that

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.160
will impact southern Oregon and northern California
through Monday.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.210
Our concerns are for heavy rain west of the
Cascades leading to flooding, landslides,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.399
and debris flows in recent burn scar areas
of western Siskiyou County. Strong winds are

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:31.909
expected over the ocean and near the coast
and at higher elevations inland. The strong

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:38.909
winds will create dangerous seas and high
surf up to around 25 feet. This is a large

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.239
storm that will impact the region from Seattle
to San Francisco.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.839
Major impacts could be river flooding, especially
for small streams. Strong winds may down trees

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:58.670
and cause power outages. There will be dangerous
ocean fishing conditions, and this storm will

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.409
have a negative impact on winter outdoor recreation
as the already meager snow pack will likely

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.409
diminish. The rain will be good for the drought
in the short term, especially near the coast.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.140
This satellite view Wednesday morning shows
moisture in mainly the middle part of the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.890
atmosphere. When we talk about an Atmospheric
River otherwise known as a Pineapple Express,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.649
this satellite view doesn�t always include
the abundant moisture at the warmer low levels.

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.310
If you look closely you can see this abundant
moisture originating near Hawaii and another

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.520
area north of Hawaii. Much of the moisture
in the atmosphere is found in the warmer lower

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.520
layers of the atmosphere and you�ll see
this more clearly in the next slide.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.329
This loop shows where the deep moisture is
forecast to be transported in the atmosphere.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.789
This loop is the result of many computer forecasts
averaged together which we believe to be a

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:07.719
more accurate forecast rather than just looking
at one computer forecast. Northern California

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.719
and far southwest Oregon may receive the most
moisture through Sunday night.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.250
These were the weather watches, warnings,
and advisories that were in effect as of Wednesday

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.250
morning. They include flood watches, high
surf advisories, storm warnings for the ocean,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.580
high wind watches, and wind advisories.
Here are the rainfall amounts expected through

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.110
Friday night. The heaviest rain will occur
across Curry, western Josephine, and western

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.560
and southern Siskiyou counties This will be
a warm storm with snow levels mainly above

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.250
7000 feet.
Here is the total rainfall expected through

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.000
Monday. Amounts decrease to the east and north.
The greatest threat of flooding will be across

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
areas that receive 6 or more inches of rain.
Some areas will see strong winds both Thursday

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.590
and Friday. The strongest winds over the ocean
and at the coast are expected Thursday morning.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.870
A Storm Warning has been issued for the ocean.
Farther inland, the strongest winds may occur

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.290
Friday afternoon. Areas of concern are the
Shasta Valley, the southern end of the Rogue

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.290
Valley near Ashland, the Summer Lake area
in Lake County, and any exposed high elevation

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.420
sites such as the Crater Lake rim.
Despite the heavy rain, the Chetco River near

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.300
Brookings is not expected to reach flood stage.
It is forecast to crest Friday night.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.250
The South Fork of the Coquille River at Myrtle
Point is forecast to crest just below moderate

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.250
flood Friday night into early Saturday.
The Coquille River at Coquille is forecast

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.190
to crest at minor flooding on Saturday and
Saturday night.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.829
Other rivers across the region will see rises
but are not expected to flood. The Sprague

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.829
River near Beatty is forecast to get close
to minor flooding Saturday night into Sunday.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.509
The Scott River near Fort Jones will see a
decent rise but is still forecast to remain

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:42.509
below flood stage this weekend.
The main concern from this storm is for very

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.099
heavy rain which may lead to urban and small
stream flooding, as well as flooding on the

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:54.719
larger rivers near the coast. Landslides and
debris flows are also possible especially

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.860
at the coast and the highways which lead to
the coast. Ocean conditions will be dangerous

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.460
for fishing through Friday and high surf will
pound the beaches especially the south facing

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.560
areas. Winds are expected to be gusty on Thursday
and Friday and damaging winds are possible

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.560
at the coast and across exposed higher elevations
inland, as well as the Shasta Valley and Summer

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.509
Lake area. This rain will help the drought
but there is still a long way to go to fill

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:32.069
the reservoirs and the meager snow pack will
likely diminish due to the very high snow

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:37.499
levels.
From all of us at the National Weather Service�we

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:39.739
thank you for watching our weather briefing.
