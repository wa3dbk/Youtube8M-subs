00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.370
Today on our 2008 Ford F150 well be installing
the Magnaflow turndown cap back exhaust system,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.210
part number MF17106.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.740
Before we can begin installing our new exhaust
system well need to remove the old or manufacturers

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.840
exhaust system first.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.830
For this application well be removing the
muffler and tailpipe.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.570
To make it easier to remove the muffler and
tailpipe it will first be easier to go ahead

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.570
and remove the rubber isolators.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.180
There are total of three for this system,
one just behind the rear axle, one just forward

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.120
of the rear axle and one just forward of the
muffler.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.579
Before we remove our hangers well go ahead
and loosen up the clamp, securing the muffler

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.019
exhaust pipe through the forward exhaust pipe.

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:58.920
To remove our hangers well remove the fastener
from the frame and rotate the rubber isolator

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.230
down and out of the frame.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.510
Note, it may be easier to remove the hangers
and hardware if you spray them down with some

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.580
spray lubricant first.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.010
Now well go ahead and start working the muffler
out of the exhaust.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.280
Note, in extreme cases it may be necessary
to heat up the exhaust pipe to remove the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.860
muffler inlet.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:03:07.950
Well go ahead and get out our torch now.
