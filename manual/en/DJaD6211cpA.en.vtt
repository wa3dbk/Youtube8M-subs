00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.090
Before loading your U-Box, make sure to drain
all water connections from appliances, as

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.090
well as gas and fluids from lawnmowers, weed
eaters and/or motorcycles.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.119
Also be sure to label all boxes with room
names, as this will make your unloading and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.560
unpacking easier.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.720
Begin at the back of the U-Box, and work your
way forward.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.960
Stand large items, such as coaches, on end
to maximize space and place a furniture pad

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.790
between the floor of a U-Box and the item
you are loading.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.230
Tie these items down with U-Haul rope or tie
downs to prevent shifting.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.530
Glass or fragile items should be wrapped in
U-Haul furniture pads or bubble wrap to prevent

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.530
damage.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.450
TV's must be wrapped in furniture pads and
then placed in a U-Haul TV box, or covered

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.850
with a large piece of cardboard.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.000
Use the U-Haul utility dolly whenever possible,
as this will save energy and make your move

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.210
easier.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.420
The screen side should placed against a flat,
cushioned service.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.979
Cover all furniture with U-Haul furniture
pads and secure larger items with U-Haul tie

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.670
downs, and place smaller ones in voids between
existing items.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.979
Removing legs from tables and chairs not only
prevents breakage, but maximizes space within

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.630
your U-Box.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.789
Wrapping these, and all other sensitive items
in U-Haul furniture pads or bubble wrap will

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.600
prevent scratching.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.090
Stand these items on end to maximize space.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.249
Fill all gaps, voids, and spaces with U-Haul
furniture pads and couch cushions to prevent

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.560
shifting.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.460
Light and fragile items should be loaded at
the top of each tier.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.310
Place heavy items, such as dressers, heavy
boxes, chests, and appliances, on the bottom

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.170
of the U-Box and distribute evenly across.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.829
Make sure to stabilize any moving parts of
furniture, equipment or appliances that you

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.029
are loading.

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:12.550
Utilize all open spaces within cabinets, bookshelves,
and entertainment centers.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.080
Professional loaders build tiers from the
floor to the ceiling, spanning side to side,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.390
creating wall-like layers.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.629
This will evenly distribute the weight in
the U-Box from the front to the back.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.599
Keep your tiers as tight as possible, filling
any empty spaces with additional items or

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.870
U-Haul furniture pads to prevent load shift.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.329
Make sure you are evenly distributing your
heaviest items, and not loading them all on

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.019
one end or one side of your U-Box.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.909
Always be flexible and position your items,
so that they are tiered and that there are

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.080
no gaps between them.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.900
Fill any gaps with U-Haul furniture pads,
pillows, or couch cushions.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.000
Do not load all heavy items on one side, or
one end of the U-Box.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.550
Extremely heavy items, such as toolboxes,
safes, and refrigerators, should be loaded

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.609
in the center of the U-Box.

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.400
Lock the wheels if possible, and secure with
tie downs.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.579
Do not load the following articles inside
of the U-Box.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:23.150
Any hazardous materials, explosives or other
dangerous articles such as tanks or bottles

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.079
designed to contain butane or propane.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.459
This also includes tanks and containers for
gas barbecue grills, torches, heater, tools

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.409
and appliances, as well as tanks and bottles
certified as empty, but still under pressure.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.170
Articles which are liable to contaminate the
U-Box or otherwise damage equipment or other

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.620
property, as well as articles that cannot
be taken from the premises without damage

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.499
to the article of the premises.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:59.499
Perishable articles such as refrigerated and
frozen foods, liquid items of any kind, living

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:05.359
plants and animals, legal documents and articles
that may be needed during time of transit

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.830
such as passports, visas, birth certificates,
and medications.
