00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
silence shared in words

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
presents

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.430
Nobody Teaches You About Hate

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
These are the ways

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
they have spoiled

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
your

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
authenticity about love.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.980
Your question is, that I say love and hate

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are the same energy;

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.301
then why is there so much hate in the world

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.750
and not so much love?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.497
It is because nobody has been teaching you about hate;

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.021
hence, hate has remained pure,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.150
unadulterated.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.982
Nobody has bothered about you, nobody has told you how to hate,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.822
whom to hate.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.750
Because hate has been left untouched by your parents,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.508
teachers, and priests,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.899
it has a purity,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.390
a sincerity.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.800
When a man hates you,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.245
you can trust that he hates you. But when he loves you,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.300
you cannot trust him.

00:02:15.883 --> 00:02:22.580
You know perfectly well that when you hate someone

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.425
it has a tremendous force,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.623
and when you love someone

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.450
there is not that force.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.690
You remember your enemies more than your friends.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.383
You can forget your friends

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.680
but you cannot forget your enemies.

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:06.387
What is happening?

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.374
It is because your love has been distorted,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.665
and something unreal,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.900
which is not love,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.780
has been handed to you.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.750
And you have been playing with that toy

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.322
called love,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.900
unaware that you have

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.050
a potential of love within you.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.450
So when you love

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.244
it is just so-so,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.972
skin-deep.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.850
Scratch it a little bit and it is gone.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.988
But when you hate,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.796
you hate from your guts.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.430
It is not skin-deep

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
it is gut-deep.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.740
I have been surprised

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.950
how much purity your hate has,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.700
how much authenticity, naturalness, spontaneity.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.502
And just because of its spontaneity, naturalness,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:03.090
authenticity, purity, I see in it a certain beauty which is not there in your love.
