00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.130
Hi all. So Sony's managed to cause its first

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.600
major stink actually with its fanbase. So we've all heard about Share Play

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.349
at Gamescom 2014 but now a few more
details are actuallly starting to come out from the 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:23.009
executives at Sony. So it would seem that Share Play is limited to a maximum of 60

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.890
minutes in any one

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.779
session. What we don't know is whether
this means you will then have to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.789
ask to share again and your friend will have
to accept

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.910
and the connection will have to be
re-established. That seems to be the case.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.290
So unfortunately it's kind of bad on us for having assumed

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.360
that Sony was going to do something
really awesome here

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.700
and not put a limit on there. So why do I think Sony have done this? What are the reasons why?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.880
Well I think the main one is that they
don't want to upset developers too much

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.480
by essentially giving away

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.450
free games, which is kind of what would
happen if there wasn't any limit on there,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.860
if there wasn't a

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.510
session limit. You could sit there for eight hours, play the game completely and 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.079
never have to pay for it. Now my flip side on that is that if

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.700
my friend brings the disk round for me I
can sit there and I can play the game

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.109
until I've completed it and the developers would never get a penny out of me anyway.

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:15.140
The other option here is that Sony doesn't want to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.219
effectively remove the need for PlayStation now or in the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.579
future. Obviously part of PlayStation now is
eventually it will

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.710
start streaming all manner of  Sony's games, PlayStation 4 included

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.880
in the future. But if they have a system
where

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.159
any game that's currently installed onto a
PlayStation 4

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.450
can be shared for free unlimitedly with
your friends it removes the need for the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.979
PlayStation Now service. What you would

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.469
have is one or two friends grabbing all of the games and then them

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.889
just being shared out effectively through the streaming service. And of course the final

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:50.950
reason Sony are doing this is because there's no competition. It's as smple as that. They can put

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.479
whatever

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.590
arbitrary limit on there they want. It's
not like Microsoft has an answer

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.359
that would say, I mean Microsoft could come back and say, we're going to do an hour and a half,

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.259
so Sony goes, well, we'll do two hours then, or one hour and 45 minutes.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.159
Essentially with no competition Sony can
say well it can be 30 minutes,

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.229
it can be 60 minutes, it can be 35 seconds if we feel like it. It's not like there's any competition

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.009
there

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.569
to kind of drive us to make this service
better and

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.650
to compete around this time limit. So what do you think? Did Sony pull the wool over

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.930
our eyes a little bit or

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.280
were they simply keeping the negatives away from the event

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.390
and the main tranche of mass journalism
that was going on at the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.659
time? It certainly now seems that Sony has attempted

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.720
to pull a bit of a Microsoft in a little
bit of a bait and switching of

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.730
sorts. Get everybody pumped up for this
thinking it's a fantastic thing

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.319
and then a couple of days later hit everybody with limits and a dose of reality.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.560
It's a little bit like the way Microsoft
tends to do things which is a shame really.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.180
Sony on this occasion you've let us all
down because you didn't communicate this

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.030
one properly.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.629
You allowed expectation to become inflated and then you burst the bubble.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.799
Unfortunately the backlash is all yours,

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.569
all yours alone. Thanks for watching, do
