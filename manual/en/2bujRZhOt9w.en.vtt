00:00:00.614 --> 00:00:02.748
I'm going to destroy you.

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:06.019
After tonight,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.021
No one will ever again

00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:10.523
Question my powers.

00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:13.259
After tonight,
if they speak of you,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.262
They'll speak only
of how you...

00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:17.263
Begged

00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:18.831
For death.

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:19.932
And I,

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.002
Being a merciful lord...

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.103
Obliged.

00:00:24.804 --> 00:00:26.272
Get up!

00:00:26.273 --> 00:00:27.606
[groaning]

00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:33.679
Don't you turn your back on me,
harry potter!

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.049
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.616
I want to see the light

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:39.419
Leave your eyes!

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.633
Have it your way.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.903
&lt;i&gt;Expelliarmus!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Avada kedavra!&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:16.889
Do nothing!

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.691
He's mine to finish!

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:20.025
[grunts]

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.630
He's mine!

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:27.066
[grunts]

00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:30.836
[â™Ş]

00:01:32.473 --> 00:01:33.473
[groans]

00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:59.499
Harry, when
the connection

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.566
Is broken,

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:02.067
You must get
to the portkey.

00:02:02.068 --> 00:02:04.303
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time,

00:02:04.304 --> 00:02:06.205
But only a moment.
Do you understand?
