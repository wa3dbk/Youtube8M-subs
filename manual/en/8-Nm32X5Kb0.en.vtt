Hi, I’m Scott from Total Eclipse Design
downtown Mt. Pleasant, Michigan and we’re

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.340
here on behalf of Expert Village we’ll be
discussing male grooming today. In this clip

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.039
we’re going to discuss male shaving. What
we’re going to do is we’re going to wet

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.869
a washcloth with hot water. We’re actually
going to lay the warm washcloth on the face,

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:41.089
the heat from that is going to open the pores.
Take your razor by hot water, you’re going

00:00:41.089 --> 00:01:08.689
to follow straight down with the grain of
the face.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.700
With underneath you never want to shave upwards,
you always shave down with the grain, if you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:02:03.369
shave upwards you can get ingrown hairs. So
as you shave you’re going to shave downwards

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:14.610
and once again you want to go in a downward
motion.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.090
That is how we shave properly.
