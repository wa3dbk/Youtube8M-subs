00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.500
Mathematics is a highly desirable subject
to study at degree level

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.400
and many graduate employers actively seek
out mathematics students for their

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
various graduate qualities.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
At Exeter our students go on to further research,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.800
teaching, many will go into the
financial sector

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.269
but there are a whole range of possibilities out
there and we understand

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.609
that we're not preparing you for the job market
that exists now but the one that will

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279
exist when you emerge as a graduate.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.120
I chose to study Mathematics at the University of Exeter,
it was because I was interested in

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.540
the subject when I was young

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.660
and I think the subject itself... it is really helpful

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.780
to all sorts of aspects of career in the future

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.570
and then it helps you to develop your own logical reasoning skills

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.590
and that's very handy, like when you're
trying to work into business sectors

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.480
because that's what the people are looking for.
In the first term of our Mathematics

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.800
degree we have a module called
Mathematic Investigations

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.870
where students work together to explore
mathematical problems

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.670
of interest to them and also understand
their role in the research community.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.799
It can be absolutely infuriating when
you start off with a problem

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.939
and you look at it and go
"I've got no idea how this works"

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.340
but to be able to work through that and bring in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.560
all of these new bits of knowledge and
come out to this really satisfying

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.780
answer at the end of it. We have a range of
Mathematics programmes ranging from single

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.420
honours three and four year Mathematics degrees

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.400
to degree programmes in which you can
take Mathematics with various different subjects;

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.689
our maths with business options are very
popular for international students.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.390
I'm an international student from
Shanghai, China which is one of the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.189
biggest cities of the world.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.030
The reason why I choose Mathematical
department of Exeter is that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.509
it has a very great, very nice
reputation all over the UK.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.360
The course I'm doing at the moment is
Mathematics with Accounting

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.840
which allows me to study both
of the subjects at one time;

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.800
this is exactly what I wanted.
Mathematics at Exeter is defined not only by

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.509
the academic rigour of its programme and
the opportunities to

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.149
be taught by research-intensive staff,
experts in their field,

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.690
but also the community that we have
between staff and student

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.180
where we have students engaging actively
with staff to design their curriculum.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.900
Well I applied for a four-year course which
would allow me

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.230
in my third year to take a semester
abroad. I went to America,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.810
I went to New Mexico. Americans are
fantastic.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.980
I also had the opportunity to study some
different modules over there

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.819
which I couldn't do over here, I
studied some music as well as

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.390
doing Maths at the same time which was
really great for me. There are many

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.870
opportunities for students to engage
with the current research that's going

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.780
on in Mathematics at Exeter.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.640
We have partnerships with the Met Office,
joint professorships

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.690
and students can follow specialised
degree programmes.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.069
I would absolutely adore the opportunity to
be able to work at Met Office

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.640
which is in Exeter and we've got
really strong links with that at Exeter uni,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.310
especially in the Maths department

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.920
and I would love to be able to do some
climate modeling,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.379
and some sort of grass roots research and be able to

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.440
basically save the world with maths
would be great.
