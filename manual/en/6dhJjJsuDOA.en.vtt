Hi I am Rachel from Successful Garden Design,
and in this short video I am going to tell you

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.469
about new how to design small garden formula.
With small gardens there is a lot you can

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.199
do to make them feel larger and more interesting.
Now most people think that it's the plants

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.900
that make a real difference, but it's not.
Plants are of course important, but they're

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.620
the finishing touch, and not the starting
point. What really makes the difference is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.870
how you shape the space and how you use the
landscaping materials. Different shaped-gardens

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.860
need you to do different things with the shape.
Long, narrow gardens need totally different

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.210
shapes to square or wide gardens. And if you
use the wrong shapes in your garden, you can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.620
actually end up making it look even smaller
than it already is. And the way you use the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.260
landscaping materials also has a dramatic
impact on how large or small a garden looks.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.559
Now the gardens shown in the picture here
are actually similar width, but look how much larger

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.989
the garden on the bottom looks just because
we've used the materials in the right way.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.670
In the small garden design formula, I'll
take you through the entire design process step by

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.200
step, showing you all the tricks and techniques
that professional designers use. I'll also

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.209
show you the design formula you can use to
make designing really simple. I'll show

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:22.209
you which shapes to use in long gardens, wide
gardens, square and awkward shaped gardens.

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:27.090
We'll cover how to tackle changes in level
and how to create them if your garden is flat.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.869
The small garden design formula is packed with plans showing different size and shape gardens

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.139
to give you plenty of ideas, but there is
also a deconstructed version of each plan

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:41.079
so you can see the underlying design shapes
more easily. And this will help you understand

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.729
what makes the design work. The small garden
design formula is completely online you have

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.569
instant access and no waiting for the postman.
And you can download it and view it on your

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:57.569
iPad, your mac or pc. And the formula includes
full colour, 97 page pdf e-book, which you can download

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.749
and that will walk you through the entire process
step by step. And there is also picture galleries

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:08.910
of gardens, full video tutorials cause it
makes a big difference seeing someone demonstrate

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.550
and walk you through the process than just
reading about something. And also included

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.710
in the small garden formula, you get how to
survey your garden, which shows you exactly how to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.050
measure and survey your garden correctly and
draw a scale plan which is vital to do, otherwise

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.860
the garden just won't fit when you come
to build it. And finally the small garden

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.820
design formula comes with a 60-day money back
guarantee, so if you're not entirely satisfied,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.200
you can have a full refund. So you've got nothing
to lose and I really hope you give small garden

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.340
design formula a go as I know it will totally
help you transform your garden into something

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.490
you'll really love. And by learning the
really simple design formula you'll save

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.610
yourself hundreds on either hiring a designer
or buying the wrong things for your garden.
