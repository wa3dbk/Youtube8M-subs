00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.170
Food allergies happen when your body mistakenly
thinks that the food you just ate is dangerous.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.910
Just a small amount of a particular food can
trigger the body's immune system to develop

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.660
an allergic reaction.
These reactions can range from simple hives

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.679
on the skin to more serious complications
including anaphylaxis, which is a whole body

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.529
reaction that can be fatal. So, they can be
serious.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.660
A food allergy can develop immediately after
a food is eaten or even a few hours later.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
The symptoms you should be watching out for
are hives, which are small, itchy red bumps

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.050
that look like wheels, or blotches on the
skin. You may also have symptoms you'd see

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.380
with asthma like wheezing, and coughing. Other
symptoms could include diarrhea, vomiting,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.570
itching of the mouth and throat, swelling
in the mouth and throat and abdominal pain.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.000
These symptoms can mean that you're allergic
to certain foods, but some of them can also

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.590
be caused by food intolerance. People who
are lactose intolerant may feel sick after

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.890
drinking milk, but they aren't allergic
to milk. That's because the discomfort from

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.600
food intolerance isn't caused by the immune
system, so those aren't called allergies.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.710
People most often have food allergies to nuts,
dairy products, wheat, and certain fish. These

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.420
are the most common because they contain certain
proteins that in some people set off an allergic

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.780
reaction.
Those reactions start when a natural immune

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.229
system antibody called immunoglobin E --or
I-G-E triggers the release of histamine and

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.329
other chemicals. The chemical histamine causes
allergy symptoms like hives and sneezing.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.700
You can visit an allergist to find out if
you have food allergy. The physician will

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.319
ask questions about your family history and
the symptoms that you've been experiencing

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.770
with certain foods.
The doctor will test your skin with liquid

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.079
extracts of different foods. They will be
looking for any hives or rashes. You may also

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.030
have a blood test to see if you carry any
I-G-E antibodies to specific foods.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.829
To pin down problem foods, it's a good idea
to keep a food diary detailing what you eat,

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.609
when you eat it, and any symptoms that appear
around that time.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.720
Elimination diets can also help diagnose a
food allergy. These work by removing a suspected

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.290
food from the diet to see if allergy symptoms
clear up. If the symptoms do go away, the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.290
next step would be to do a food challenge.
This is done in a doctor's office. You will

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.760
be given a sample of the food you may be allergic
to. If there is a reaction with the suspected

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.560
food, then the allergy is confirmed.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.670
Unfortunately, there is no cure for food allergies
right now. And, while some kids may outgrow

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.159
a food allergy, others who don't must carefully
navigate menus and grocery aisles their whole

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:33.569
lives. The good news is there are many ways
for those with food allergies to eat well

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.819
and incorporate all the nutrition they need
in their diets.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.930
SHARON:
If you or someone in your family has a food

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.040
allergy, it's something you need to think
about at every meal. But, it doesn't mean

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.290
the party's over. So, let's forget what
mom says and start with dessert.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.000
I love ice cream, which is a dairy product.
And, dairy products are some of the most common

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.290
allergens. But, there are many milk options
that don't come from animals, and they come

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.709
in ice cream products, too! This soy ice cream
is just one example. Another thing to keep

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.959
in mind with dessert, sorbet is dairy free,
but some sherbets are made with milk. And,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.349
if you really have a sweet tooth, try dark
chocolate which is made without milk.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.659
For alternatives to animal milk, try soy,
almond, and rice milks. It's also important

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:37.980
to think about what nutrients you're losing
when cutting out a certain food product. Fortunately,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.310
all of these milk alternatives have nearly
the same amount of calcium as dairy milk.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.659
Almond milk is a great source of calcium,
and soy &amp; rice milks are almost always fortified

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:38.959
with calcium. Soy milk also comes with an
additional punch of protein. So, you'll

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.470
have a healthy start to your day by using
any of these milks with your favorite low-sugar

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.720
cereal.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.220
If someone in your family has a peanut allergy,
it's important to pay close attention to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.610
the labels of what's in your pantry. Some
people can have a peanut allergy so sensitive

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.860
that even foods processed in a plant that
handles peanuts can trigger a reaction. For

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.980
more obvious problem foods, like peanut butter,
it's easier than ever today to find alternatives

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.110
like almond, cashew, and even sunflower butter
if you're allergic to all tree nuts.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.489
People with seafood allergies may need to
stay away from just shell fish, or in some

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:42.739
cases all varieties of fish. If you're extra
sensitive to fish, be careful when eating

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:42.739
out because the kitchen will often prepare
dishes on the same surfaces that were used

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:42.739
for fish dishes. Also, vitamins sometimes
contain fish oils and other fish products,

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:42.739
so make sure to read those labels. When cooking
at home, substitute a lean meat like chicken

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.200
in a fish dish. You'll be losing heart-healthy
fats called omega-3's and vitamin-B by cutting

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.269
fish out of your diet, so grab these vitamin
supplements so you're not missing out.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.140
A wheat, or gluten, allergy means that grains
like barley, wheat, and oats are off-limits.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.920
So, for a recipe that calls for these, substitute
with rice or corn. You'll need to be careful

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.650
with Gluten. It can be hidden in many foods
like soy sauce and salad dressings. I checked

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.760
the labels at the supermarket and picked out
this salad dressing which is gluten-free.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.709
More products are beginning to advertise with
a gluten-free label to make it easier for

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.959
you to make safe choices, so keep your eye
out.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.890
Living with a food allergy can be a good thing.
It'll make you pay attention to what's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.970
going onto the dinner plate, and where nutrients
are coming from. With some experimentation,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.670
you'll discover a whole new world of safe,
delicious ingredient alternatives and recipes.
