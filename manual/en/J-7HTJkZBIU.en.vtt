00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.749
If you've been paying any attention to the
news this week, you'll have seen a landslide

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:08.240
of stories focussing on Valve's first foray
into the world of mass-market hardware manufacture

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.870
- we're talking about the Steam Box.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.650
Trouble is, it's not that clear what the machine
is, what it'll do, or who's making what.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.250
With that in mind, this week's Rumour Mill
sees us serving up a no-frills, meat-and-potatoes

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.890
breakdown of exactly what the Steam Box is.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.470
First things first: there is more than one
Steam Box.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.330
Consider it a collective name for Valve-approved
hardware.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.300
The thing that you've probably seen this week
is Piston, a potential Steam Box developed

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.530
by Xi3 Corporation, with investment from Valve.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.660
The compact machine is built to support Steam
and the associated Big Picture mode for large,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.950
hi-def TV screens.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.020
It was also the subject of this failed Kickstarter,
suggesting that the Valve investment saved

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.030
the project, or that the pictures we've been
seeing on every Steam Box story are completely

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.030
wrong.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.360
Basically, Piston is one of many possible
Steam Box iterations.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.670
Getting back to the bigger picture.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.140
Gabe Newell has admitted that Valve's own
version of the hardware is on the way, but

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.949
they're unlikely to make any announcements
this year.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.680
Newell promises their machine - currently
codenamed Bigfoot - will be low-cost and high

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680
performance.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.070
The intention is for all the Steam Boxes to
fall into one of three categories - good,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.350
better and best - and Valve's effort will
live in the middle slot.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.700
That leads us onto cost.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.469
At present we only know the price of Piston,
which will sell for between 499 and 999 dollars

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.170
- above the price range of budget consoles,
and comparable with the cost of a modestly

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810
powerful PC.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.229
For your money you're essentially getting
a means of playing Steam titles on your TV

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.780
without the faff of a PC: a compact, user-friendly
entry point into a world of gaming that is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.939
often perceived as being expensive and elitist.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.560
But does this make it a console?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
Sort of.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.719
The crucial difference here is that Steam
Box's focus is on openness and flexibility.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.810
Both Valve's machine and Piston come packaged
with Linux, a free, open source operating

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.700
system that's the anathema of Windows 8's
rainbow lockbox, or the ad-splattered homepage

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.759
of Xbox Live.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.630
If you've ever wanted to fire up a machine
and only see what YOU want, this could be

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.630
for you.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.630
It gets better, though.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.159
That flexibility extends to the hardware,
so unlike the current generation of consoles

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.140
your machine will be upgradeable.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.000
This means that manufacturers like Valve and
Xi3 won't lose money on every sale and the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.891
machine won't be obsolete in six year's time,
providing you're willing to dish out for a

00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:19.440
shiny new graphics card.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.390
This isn't console-baiting scaremongering
- it's just plain good news for anyone that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.840
loves games.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840
So there you have it.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.120
Forget about the 'is it, isn't it?' confusion
and instead focus on this; any iteration of

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.570
the Steam Box is likely to give you open,
upgradeable, high-end access to a world of

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.050
PC gaming from the comfort of your sofa.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.360
The question is, are you ready for that level
of choice?
