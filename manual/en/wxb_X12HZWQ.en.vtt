00:00:00.793 --> 00:00:01.976
I'm kind of
grumpy today, dude.

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:03.395
I didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:05.896
I was having
those dreams again.

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:07.865
You know how it's
just me in a castle.

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.734
I gotta fight, like,
a thousand wizards.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.169
The only way to beat them
is to punch them

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:12.987
As hard as I can
in their faces.

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:15.806
And then, when I'm done,
all their little
wizard wives came out

00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:17.808
And wanted me
just to have sex with them.

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:19.110
Which is kind of weird.

00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:20.895
Hey, look at this, huh?

00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:22.263
Hey, everybody.

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:23.748
I've got some awesome news.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.150
We have a new
crew member today.

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:26.567
Denise.

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:28.102
Hi, everyone.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.654
So, I thought it'd be fun
if we all went around

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.023
And said our name
and a little something
about ourselves.

00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:35.159
I'll start.
My name is rod,

00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:37.161
And I like to party.

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:39.848
All right, dave.
You're up.

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:42.750
Uh... Hi. Uh...
My name is dave,

00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:45.519
And, uh, I like to party.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.755
Uh... No, dave.
I just said that I party,

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:50.224
So maybe do something
different from me.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:53.861
My name is dave,
and I am the stunt man.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.330
You know what?
Let's move on.

00:00:55.397 --> 00:00:56.814
Rico, you're up.

00:00:56.882 --> 00:01:00.535
Uh... Hello. I'm rico,
and I like to party.

00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:01.953
Yeah. Uh, rico?

00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:03.521
What did I just say to dave?

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:04.555
Who?
Dave.

00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:07.142
I like to party. I'm rod.
No. You're kevin.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:09.477
Right. Kevin. I party.

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.012
No. No, you don't.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.363
Okay, nobody parties but me.

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.532
Yes. And we party.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.750
No.
Yeah, just rod.

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:16.934
Yes.
And me.

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.054
No! I'm the only one
who parties.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.005
I'm pretty sure
I've partied before.

00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:23.725
No, kevin, I know for a fact
you don't party, okay?
You do not party.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.378
You're right.
Dave's the party guy.
Sweet.

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:28.296
Oh, my god.
Shut up, okay?

00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:29.997
I'm just gonna do it for you.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:32.500
Denise. This is the crew.

00:01:32.568 --> 00:01:33.834
Dave's the mechanic.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.186
Rico makes the ramps.

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:37.438
And kevin is
team manager/videographer.

00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:39.474
None of them party. Right?

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:41.659
Got it?

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:42.827
Okay.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.914
Let's party.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:50.418
Pools are perfect
for holding water, man.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:54.689
Man, I don't
really know about having
a girl on the team, man.

00:01:54.757 --> 00:01:56.490
All right, rico, listen.
Um...

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:01.262
There's an ancient
italian maxim, uh, that
roughly translates to

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.634
"he who is resistant
to change is destined
to perish."

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:09.270
So, why don't you
try to open up that mind
of yours? You know?

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.706
It's like, look at kevin.
I mean, he...
