00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:01.919
Hello.

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:05.460
My name is Patty Roller and today I’m going
to be making an Easter arrangement that you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.340
can use on your table, something pretty simple
so that you can make it at home.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.790
What I do first, I have the glue pan.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.460
We use that at work but you can use the glue
gun or some tape and you take a piece of the

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.630
Sahara or Styrofoam.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.100
Press it into the container and then I take
a little bit of the Spanish moss or some moss.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.290
You can use whatever you have at home and
cover the Sahara up so that you don’t see

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.210
what’s in the container.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.969
Then I would take a few of these twigs that
I found outside New York.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.359
So you can use things that you have.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.460
So we stick those in there.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.800
I like to put a little bit of glue on the
bottom of every stick so I know it’s really

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.749
secure in the arrangement.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.999
So what we want is something with a little
bit of height and I have this.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:04.159
I try to shape each little part up so that
it has some motion or fluidity to it.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.610
So we will put that there in the center and
then we want to put in some foliage so that

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.679
we cover up the mechanics of the arrangement
like the Sahara and any space that might be

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.429
there, and you can use several different kinds
of foliage on this so that you can keep it

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:22.429
interesting-looking.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.350
You keep it kind of small at the base.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.850
Each one of these that you put in, you want
to give it a little bit of shape too so that

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.229
your arrangement doesn’t look real rigid
or unnatural.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.909
So that was a little bit of petunia and now
we can use a little bit of this variegated

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.520
ivy in here which all has a spring look to
it.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.909
I usually cut apart each stem because some
of those stems are real long and we don’t

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.990
need that kind of length in the arrangement.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.380
So we will keep it kind of short and compact.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.539
That way if you use it on your table during
the Easter dinner, you won’t have to move

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:08.539
the arrangement.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.539
You can leave it right there.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:18.230
People can see over it or through it and right
now what is really popular too is the grass.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.340
Very natural-looking arrangements.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.730
So we use a little bit of grass in here.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.739
I’m thinking in this arrangement I might
use a little nest with a bird in it.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.340
Put a little bit of glue on that.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.599
I try and stick it to the foliage in the arrangement.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.400
We will put a little bit of moss in it, a
little bit of glue on it so it all sticks

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.379
together and then we will put our bird in,
a little bit of glue again.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.610
Just set it there at the side and then I also
have some little Easter eggs that we can put

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.460
in here.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.970
Since my nest is kind of small, we use the
smaller of the Easter eggs here.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.110
Place them.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.659
Now we will finish up with our flowers.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:27.319
Some yellow daisies nice and bright and colourful
and we can use those in different heights.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.260
Put some in the back of the arrangements,
some in the front.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.299
We will have some tall.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:44.739
Some will be shorter 
and maybe a couple of the daffodils to keep

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.430
this real springy-looking.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.010
So you could have this on your table now and
you can use it through Mother’s Day into

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.129
June even.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.890
So we use some of the daffodils.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.159
You can use daffodils if you like.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.180
You could use some iris, some tulips.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.769
You can use whatever flowers you want and
you can use this basic design for any time

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:12.829
of the year too.

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.680
So you can make yourself a Christmas arrangement
or a fall arrangement using the same design.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.850
Here’s something that’s interesting, like
a curly willow type foliage.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:36.500
Put a little bit of that in there and this
is a pick that I put on the bottom of it.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.260
When I know it’s going to be a little difficult
to put into the arrangement, the pick helps

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:55.670
hold it in place along with the glue that
we use.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.170
Sometimes if I have foliage that doesn’t
have a flower on anymore so that I use every

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:07.730
part of the soft bush, I will go ahead and
just add that per foliage to try to make it

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.130
a little more interesting.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:24.190
Fill in some spaces 
and now we will add a couple of white daisies

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.340
for a little bit of contrast and color.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.220
We want to keep it interesting.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.190
This daisy I’m able to cut apart and get
two pieces out of.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:55.210
That way you get more for your money.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.520
And I think if we put a couple of iris in
there, it will finish it off.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:08.930
It just adds to the spring look.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.270
Now this is an arrangement that we would probably
sell for about $45 in our shop, very springy.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.990
You can use around the table or wherever you
need an arrangement.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.220
Nice and bright and colourful.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.520
Thank you and have a great day.
