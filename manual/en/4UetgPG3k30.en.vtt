00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.980
hi so today I'm going to talk about my
experiences with ultrasound fat

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.509
cavitation um a little while ago it was in
the news and it was on some program

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.920
saying you know it's it's the
non-invasive new alternative to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.970
liposuction um and then after that,n a lot of the coupon websites like

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.490
in Australia we have like jump on it dot com and cudo and all these coupon websites

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.170
they were selling say six hundred
dollars worth of fat cavitation

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.540
treatments for a hundred dollars so a
while back when I was in better

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:49.020
financial place I bought two of them
so I had a total of six fat cavitation

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.899
sessions um for like a hundred and
ninety dollars or something ordinarily

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.609
that is supposed to cost something like
closer to a thousand dollars which I

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.250
would never ever pay and  like my
experiences with IPL or laser hair

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.760
removal I'm glad that I did it the
coupon way and found out that it didn't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.439
work doing it cheaper than if I pay you
know crazy mount of money which wouldn't

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.159
happen because I couldn't afford it
anyway but yeah that may be another

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.549
video
IPL did not work for me. so basically I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.439
had six forty five to fifty minute fat
cavitation sessions over six weeks so

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.479
one a week and basically they get the
machine there's a big ultrasound thing

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.560
they Lube you up and they put it on and
it's it buzzes and vibrates and rings

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.210
it's actually quite bizarre um I
did feel a very slight I don't know if

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.280
you could call it stinging it really
wasn't that much it's just a slight

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.700
something going on on my skin where it
touched sometimes um but it was pretty

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.159
much painless it really is painless

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.319
after a few of them I did start to
notice

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.939
the skin because I had them all on my
abdomen because that's my problem area

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.420
I'm apple-shaped
genetics so I really wanted to do

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.829
anything I could to reduce it, I
noticed that the skin got kind of floppy

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.870
like it did seem like something was
happening like they say that the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.739
cells are meant to shrink, your fat cells
are meant to shrink and definitely it

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.939
was much more wobbly and floppy after
each session but ultimately the results

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:50.189
my first measurement versus my last
measurement, I lost three centimeters

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.430
which apparently is good but for me it
has made absolutely no difference in the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.340
appearance of my abdomen at all and um
you know to be completely

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.859
honest I could have whatever
measurement stomach

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.260
and I can tell in the morning and by the way my clothes fit

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.909
because I have such bloating problems so

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.440
I can like go to bed and my stomach's a
certain measurement and then when I wake

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.139
up in the morning it can be you know
seven eight centimeters smaller because

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.269
of just if I get say a solid you know
amount of sleep it just shrinks while

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.260
I'm sleeping so to be honest I feel like
I had pretty much no results from it um

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.930
I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you're someone like me who

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.239
has a lot of fat in the area, I've heard
that if you have just a very small

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.169
pocket of fat in the area that you can't
get rid of that it really makes a

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:02.060
more noticeable difference if you have
less fat to lose or shrink

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.150
but yeah for me um it basically did
nothing so I'm glad that I wasted like

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.329
190 dollars versus thousands of dollars
because some places do

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:22.529
charge like two and three hundred
dollars per session so for me it

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.880
didn't really do anything
I noticed it doing

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.300
a very very slight like the way it made
my skin floppy and I noticed that, but

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.040
ultimately after six sessions which
you're supposed to see quite a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.560
noticeable result after six sessions
there was just no real

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.460
noticeable difference. So that's my
experience with fat cavitation, if you

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.190
have a lot of fat in the area don't
bother really it'll just be a waste of

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.440
your money. if you've got a little little
bit of fat in an area that you want to

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.620
try and get rid of and you've got money
to spend then I may recommend it

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.060
in that instance but otherwise, no I'm
not really happy with it um even the

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.850
money I did spend I feel that was a
waste of money

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.450
anyway apart from that I have got into
Zumba again, me and my friend have

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.080
started going together um so that's a
real motivation and it's fun and

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.470
we've also been doing tons of other
exercises together like after zumba

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.450
we'll go somewhere and go for a jog or
something like that so she's really

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:48.440
motivating me um eating wise I'm doing
pretty well I'm eating pretty healthy my

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:56.450
portions are okay which is really really
good for me um yeah I've got stress in

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:04.670
my life financial stress um I'm starting
working a lot more in a couple of weeks

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.470
and they really really awful shifts like
sleepovers on the weekends I'll

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.530
basically have no weekend which
is really going to suck and I'm a bit

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.940
stressed about that but apart from that
everything's okay um oh my blog I've

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.980
really started using my blog again (blog no longer active/changed names)
