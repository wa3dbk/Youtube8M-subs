00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:00.650
Hello guys.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.340
Today I want to talk

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.700
to all of you about one of

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.750
my favorite products from Healthy Hair Plus.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.890
And the product I'm talking about is this emu oil.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.330
And first I want

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.150
to start by mentioning that

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.690
this emu oil is an amazing product.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.120
It can be beneficial for many things.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.830
And some of the things it

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.890
can be used for, is

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.590
for your hair and your skin.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.110
But first of all I want to start of by mentioning that this is a all natural product.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.900
It's 100% Emu oil so it

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.210
doesn't come contain any preservatives,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.870
which is one of the reasons

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.740
why I completely love this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.500
product, because I love using

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.670
natural products on my skin and my hair.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.040
So Iike I mentioned earlier Emu

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.430
oil is a great product

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.070
and very beneficial for your skin

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.370
and for your hair, but I

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.090
want to start by mentioning the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.770
many benefits of using emu oil for your hair.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880
Now, you got probably wondering

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.600
who exactly is a good

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.990
candidate for using emu oil on their hair.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.220
Now emu oil can be

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.350
used by anyone, it doesn't

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.340
matter what type of hair

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.070
you have, it doesn't matter whether you have dry

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.330
hair oily hair, long

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.660
hair, short hair, curly hair, straight

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.280
hair, it doesn't matter.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.370
It's very beneficial for all hair types.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.100
But, this product is extremely

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.240
beneficial for those of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.750
you who suffer from very dry

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.480
hair, if you have a lot of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.050
split ends, if you have dry and

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.140
itchy scalp or if

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.360
trying to grow out your hair

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.440
but your hair grows very slowly, if

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.180
you have thin hair or

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.470
bald spots, this is amazing for you.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.350
So if you have any of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.600
these hair types or hair

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.610
conditions, Emu Oil would

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.990
be very, very beneficial for your hair type.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.350
Now you guys are probably wondering

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.680
and why is it that Emu

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.240
Oil is so beneficial for people

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.520
with dry hair and split ends?

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.930
The reason, why Emu Oil is beneficial

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.920
for dry hair, is because it is considered a natural moisturizer.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.850
So if you still have some

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.910
dry hair or dry scalp

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.720
and itchy scalp, which you

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.790
know the itch might be due

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.330
to the dryness on your

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.570
scalp, then you needed natural

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.200
moisturizer like Emu Oil,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.540
in order to help

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.200
moisturizer and fully provide your hair

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.800
with all the nutrients and moisture that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.260
it in order to

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.760
recuperate and change from

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.260
oily dry to being nice and moisturized.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.040
Now also if you have a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.240
lot of split ends or if

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.120
your hair tends to break a lot.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.970
It's usually because your hair

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.970
is very dry and it's very fragile, very sensitive.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.910
It might flake when you brush

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.150
it, when you putting up in

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.840
a ponytail any little thing might cause your hair to split.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.240
And usually that's when your hair is very dry.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.810
And so what Emu Oil is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.890
going to do, it's going to add

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.040
kinds of moisture to your

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.210
hair and it's going to make

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.890
your hair flexible so that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.220
it won't break or split

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.820
as easily.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.070
Emu oil is also very good for those of you who are trying to grow out your hair.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.310
Like myself, not so

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.850
long ago I was on a journey to grow my hair.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.400
I was having a difficult time growing out my hair.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.650
My hair was growing very slowly, it was very growing.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.620
And after using Emu Oil

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.420
my hair has grown a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.730
lot, I show you in a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.510
little bit what my hair

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.290
looks like from the back, so that you can see the length of my my hair.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.120
And the reason why Emu Oil

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.640
is so beneficial for people who

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.520
are trying to grow out their

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.940
hair, or people who have

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.050
bald spots, or just have very slow growing hair.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.550
It's because Emu Oil

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.740
is know for [xx]  wakening your hair follicles.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.660
So what it's going to do, it's

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.010
going to remove any obstacles

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.210
that might be impeding hair growth.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.920
Sometimes people recommend use a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.500
clarifying shampoo which will

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.090
remove any excess oil

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.760
or hair products in order to allow hair to grow.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.910
And that's what you will

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.300
what's going to do without having to use a clarifying product.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.440
It's going to clarify and remove

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.930
any products that might be impeding hair growth.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.100
And not only is it going

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.670
to awaken your hair follicles

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.240
and allow your hair to grow.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.760
But it's going to provide

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.300
your hair with tons of

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.080
nutrients that you need, in order

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.840
to not only grow your hair but grow healthy  [be] here.Let

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.520
me show you guys how long my

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.010
hair is.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.080
Just to let you guys have an idea.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.860
I achieved more of

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.460
my hair growth and the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.960
length or my hair, due to

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.520
the Emu Oil because I am a true believer in Emu Oil.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.930
Now you guys are

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.830
probably wondering, what exactly  [xx]

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.140
is contained inside of this Emu Oil

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.250
that helps promote faster hair growth.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.870
Now the reason why Emu Oil

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.360
helps promote faster hair growth

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.600
is because it contains omega 3

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.900
Omega 6 and Omega 9.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.720
And all of those

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.300
Omegas are known for helping to

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.320
promote faster hair growth about

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.800
the hair growth but

healthy, faster hair growth.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.910
So, it's very important that

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.470
if you want hair growth with

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.160

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.200
that you apply it on fingertips and

massage it all over your scalp.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.360
It's actually part of the directions of this product.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.430
If what you want is to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.120
elevate any itchiness or dryness

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.480

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.530
And you need to make sure make

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.780
sure that you use this product and you focus on your skull.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.590
And you massage it on

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.150
a weekly or daily basis depending

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.660
on how you decided to use

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.380
with this Emu Oil, now

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.890
if what you want is more

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.790
shine on your hair,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.340
then of course you would apply

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.410
it on your hands and apply

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.780
all over your hair, just

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.700
like you would with any other hair serum.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.220
So what other benefits can

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.790
you expect on your hair after using Emu Oil?

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.600
so you can expect faster hair growth.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.870
New hair growth if you have bald spots.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.270
You can also expect lots of

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.240
shine smoothness because it

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.520
is a natural moisterizer and shine.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.240
Now very quickly I do want to

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.400
show all of you some

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.680
different ways in which you

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.350
can use this Emu Oil on your hair.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.510
favorite way of using this

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.400
emu oil is by

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.090
using it when I wash my hair.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.830
So I use shampoo to clean

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.320
my hair and then when

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.560
I apply conditioner I mix about

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.080
3 or 4 drops, sometimes

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.890
even more depending on the thickness or the length of your hair.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.570
On my hand along with the conditioner.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.960
I mix the conditioner along with this Emu Oil and I put it all through my hair.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.130
And I leave it on my hair

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.100
while I continue to do

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.170
the other things that I

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.150
do when I shower and then I wash it off.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.000
And your hair going to feel

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.270
immediately so soft and

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.000
smooth, even after it dries naturally or

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.240
you blow dry your hair or

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.990
you use any hot tools on your hair.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.570
Now way of using this is by applying it on your hands like a regular serum.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.420
If you want the hair book

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.860
benefits then you do want

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.200
to focus on the scott mixture

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.680
that you massage it so that

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.280
it will absorb all of the

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.150
nutrients and all of

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.560
those omegas contained in this Emu Oil.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.660
And what you want is to moisturize

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.710
and seal your ends and just

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.140
add shine, then go ahead

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.500
and focus on the bottom like

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.030
you do with a regular hair serum.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.160
Okay, so now I want to

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.970
talk a little bit about the benefits of

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.270
using emu oil for your skin.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.040
So you can use this not

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.770
only on your face but you

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.820
can use it on your arms,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.500
on your legs, all through your

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.650
body in order to moisturize your skin.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.940
I think the most important thing

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.430
that I need to mention about Emu

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.770
Oil when using it on your

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.460
face, is the fact that it will not make you breakout.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.060
I've been using this on

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.210
my skin for a long time now and

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.560
it doesn't make me break out

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.730
which is why I think it's

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.730
so amazing and why I think I love this product.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.390
Now the next thing that

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.730
I think is just amazing about

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.010
this product is that it's know

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.810
as an anti-wrinkle product.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.960
So if you are trying

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.810
to be proactive, and you're trying

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.930
to make sure that you don't

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.410
get any wrinkles on your

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.720
skin, under your eyes or anywhere

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.600
on your face, then this

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.220
is the product that

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.840
you need to be using in order to be proactive.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.970
Now if you already have wrinkles

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.440
and you want to mediate any

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.640
problems you might have with wrinkles

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.980
on your face, I recommend that you start using Emu Oil.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.640
Because it's going to help your

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.890
skin by providing it with lots

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.140
of moisture and the nutrients

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.850
need in order to help

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.100
deal with the wrinkles that you might have right now.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.110
And it will help prevent any further wrinkles.
