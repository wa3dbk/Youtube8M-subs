00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.100
Truly this is an historic day. There greatest
majesty confidence in humble

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:08.880
Columbus

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.620
is vindicated there is a western
route to the Indies

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.999
and therefore I hereby name these islands

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.000
the West Indies

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Er East Indies

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
East Indies, surely

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What are you talking about ? We sailed west to find them didn't we ?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
there to the West of us, therefore there the West Indies

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.200
Yer but I thought the whole point was we're proving that the world is
a globe, so if these truly are the Indies

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.000
which is incidentally something else I quite like to talk to you about
some point, but assuming they are the Indies then

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
they must be the East Indies the most
easterly point of the Indies.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Do you see?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Do you see this ?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.500
