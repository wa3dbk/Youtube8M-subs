00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.666
Wow!

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.966
Pretty snow!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.133
What’s that for?
Oh, cool! What is it?

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:42.600
- I’m making a snow castle!
- You are?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.766
There! All done!

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.300
Ooh, wow! It’s awesome!

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.000
It looks just like a castle
made for a princess!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.433
- Now...
- Now what? That looks fun!

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.900
My next job… is making
a BIG snowman!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.300
Wow! I’ll help! Wait for me!

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.800
Hi everyone!

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.500
Hey, look at what I brought!

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.366
Are you okay, Helly?

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:21.700
It’s slippery!
You’ve got to be extra careful.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.633
I wanted you all to see this.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.900
It’s a new invention of Jin’s.
It’s a snow cleaner!

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.466
- A snow cleaner?
- Yeah! Isn’t it the coolest?

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.033
It sucks up the snow
and it works great!

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:35.366
Yup! Uh…yup!

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.433
Wait…  Something’s wrong.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:40.566
Why isn’t this thing working?

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.200
Helly? Wait a minute.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.866
I think you should let
Jin do that.

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:50.200
And…DONE!
Yahoo! We did it!

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:03.566
Great!

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:08.333
Woww! All done! Hi, Snowman!
You’re so cute!

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.200
I love you…

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.666
Suji, I think we should
go home now.

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:19.900
Already? Why?

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.800
I’m really hungry!

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400
But… What about
our snowman?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.900
- We’ll leave it!
- No way!

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.333
He’ll be all alone.
All night! He’ll get scared!

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.933
We can’t just let him stay
in the park all by himself!

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.600
I know what.
I’ll take him home!

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.666
What? How are you going to
carry a snowman?

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:42.433
Then you just
go home by yourself

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.366
and I’ll stay here
with my friend!

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:47.800
Fine! Do what you want!
Bye!

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.466
My snowman!

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.400
I think this
should be just fine!

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.766
Right! So now let’s go and
take care of the park.

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:03.133
Good. Next stop? The park!

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:05.533
Right!

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:13.200
I can’t wait! Now, our snowman
will be safe in our house!

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.866
Suji! He’s going to melt
if we bring him indoors!

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:18.666
Really?

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.533
It’s so cold!

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:30.166
- Time to cross!
- ‘Kay, here I come!

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:36.133
No! Suji! Are you okay?

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:39.200
It hurts!

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.600
A red light!

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.700
Uh oh, Whoa! I’m starting
to skid! I can’t stop!

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:53.866
LOOK OUT!

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:09.900
Poli! Thank goodness!

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.866
Well, I’m so glad
everyone’s okay.

00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:16.366
But that certainly was
a close call!

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:20.600
Kevin. Suji. When it snows,
roads are very slippery!

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.966
Cars and people can
easily get into accidents!

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:26.766
Cars can’t stop
quickly on snowy roads,

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.100
so you have to make sure
to be extra careful

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.566
when crossing on foot.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:33.100
You should either wait
first for any cars to pass,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.666
or make sure they’ve
made a complete stop,

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:38.033
before attempting
to cross the street.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.466
And if you walk with
your hands in your pockets,

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:42.433
that can be dangerous, too!

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:44.866
It’s always a good idea
to wear gloves.

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:47.900
You should also avoid wearing
white clothes on a snowy day.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.800
You’ll be seen more easily
wearing colorful clothes!

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.766
We’ll do that, Poli!

00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:55.400
Hey guys!

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.733
Now…Watch this!

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:03.833
Whoa! More snowmen!

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:07.866
Now, our snowman’s going to
have lots and lots of friends!

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:14.100
Your snowman won’t have any
time to be lonely ever again!
