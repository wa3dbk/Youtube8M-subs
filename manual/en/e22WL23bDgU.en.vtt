00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.700
The President:
Roll Tide!

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.300
(applause)

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.233
Everybody, have a seat.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.300
Have a seat here.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.066
It is a great pleasure to
welcome the Alabama Crimson Tide

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.000
to the White House -- again.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.467
(applause)

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:17.700
I want to congratulate them
on winning their 15th National

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.233
Championship -- and their
third in four years.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.734
They are starting to learn their
way around the White House.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:24.700
(laughter)

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.300
I was thinking about just
having some cots for them here,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.467
they're here so often -- except
we couldn't find any that were

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:31.600
big enough.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.667
(laughter)

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:38.066
Now, before I begin, I want to
extend sympathies to the family

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.533
of Mal Moore, who
passed away last month,

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.934
after a career that spanned
six decades as a player,

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:48.166
a coach and athletic
director at Alabama.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.500
Mal did more than just about
anybody to make this program

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.667
what it is today.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.967
Our prayers go out to all the
members of the Alabama community

00:00:56.967 --> 00:01:00.333
who knew him and loved him.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:04.100
Now, last year obviously also
had a lot of bright spots for

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.000
the Crimson Tide.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.834
From the beginning
of spring practice,

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.867
the best teams in the country
had one goal and that was to try

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:13.967
to at least be as good, if
not better, than Alabama.

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.934
But the Tide kept on rising
to the occasion and they

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:18.900
never let up.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.533
Back in January, with the
whole country watching,

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.166
this team lined up against
the number-one ranked,

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.800
undefeated Fighting
Irish of Notre Dame,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.133
and dominated from
the first possession.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.867
At halftime it was 28 to zero.

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:32.133
That's when I stopped watching.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.266
(laughter)

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:37.066
When the clock ran
out it was 42 to 14.

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:40.533
And they left no doubt who was
the best team in the country.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:44.266
And after the game, the Notre
Dame athletic director said,

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.333
"They're not just
better than us.

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.333
"They're better than everyone."

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:49.400
And that was no accident.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.834
A few days after winning
the title last year,

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:54.367
Coach Saban was
already back to work.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:57.133
And even after losing some
pretty big names in the draft

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:02.533
last year, he and his terrific
coaching team made sure that

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.734
they did not lose a step.

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:08.400
AJ McCarron showed the kind of
poise that very few 22-year-olds

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.066
possess -- passing for more than
2,900 yards and 30 touchdowns on

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.100
the season.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.066
I hear he's coming
back for one more year,

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.133
because apparently the rest
of the SEC defenses haven't

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.200
suffered enough.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.433
(laughter)

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:25.834
So he's going to subject
them to a little more pain.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:27.934
Then there were the seniors, who
finished their four years with a

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:33.300
combined record of 49 and 5,
which I think is pretty good.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.800
Barrett Jones ended his career
as one of the most decorated

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.467
football players in
Alabama history --

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:40.834
even playing in the National
Championship game with torn

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:43.066
ligaments in his foot.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.934
After the game he said, "It was
painful, but you couldn't have

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:49.700
"pulled me off the
field with a tractor."

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.200
And I don't think he was joking.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.033
I think that's true.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.000
(laughter)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.500
This title also belongs to
everyone who helped these young

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.300
men get to where
they are today --

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.200
family and friends, high
school coaches and loved ones,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.400
trainers, staff, grocers.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.767
(laughter)

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:13.066
These guys eat a lot.

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:16.400
It belongs to every student
who came to every game,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.133
all the fans who yelled "Roll
Tide" at kickoff and cheered on

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.834
the Million Dollar Band.

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:25.633
In Miami on the night the
Tide won the championship,

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:28.934
one Notre Dame fan apparently
asked if "Roll Tide" is a noun

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:32.867
or a verb -- to which another
fan dressed head-to-toe in

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:35.100
crimson replied,
"It's a way of life."

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.100
(laughter)

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.133
And that way of life has created
legends like Bear Bryant and

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:43.166
Joe Namath -- it's also a legacy
carried on by this team and

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:47.433
generations of fans who will
fill Bryant-Denny Stadium to the

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.200
rafters on Saturday afternoons.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.633
So obviously everybody here
has a lot to be proud of.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:56.667
I want to congratulate Alabama
one more time on a great season.

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:59.967
I want to wish the players luck
who will be taking part in the

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:02.433
NFL draft next year.

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:07.000
And since I'll be around for
four more football seasons,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.500
I expect I just might see these
guys again before I leave.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.500
So, Roll Tide!

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.400
Thank you.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.433
(applause)

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:18.600
Coach.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.433
Coach Saban:
Mr. President, we certainly
appreciate what you do for

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:23.667
our country.

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:26.433
It's certainly special for you
to take the time to honor out

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:30.567
team, which we're very proud of
their accomplishments relative

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:32.934
to all of our fans,
all of our supporters,

00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:35.100
all of our coaches and players.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.567
And this is really a special
occasion and something you never

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:38.567
really get used to.

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:40.000
So we really appreciate it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.700
And we do have something that we
want to present you with today.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.033
And I might say, we're kind of
keeping inventory of what we've

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:49.867
been giving you, and now
you have a full uniform.

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:51.300
You're an official
member of the team.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.467
(laughter)

00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:55.734
And I will have a meeting later
with you to decide how much

00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:56.934
playing time you're
going to get.

00:04:56.934 --> 00:05:00.533
(laughter and applause)

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:01.967
The President:
I think we should
keep me on the bench.

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:03.667
(laughter)

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:04.900
How you doing?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.433
Good to see you.

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:07.934
That's a good
looking helmet, there.

00:05:07.934 --> 00:05:10.133
I like that.

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:11.166
Fantastic.

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:12.333
How you doing?

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:14.233
Good to see you.

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:18.133
All right, I got all my gear
-- you guys wanna strike this?

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:45.700
(camera shutters clicking)

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.000
(cheers and applause)
