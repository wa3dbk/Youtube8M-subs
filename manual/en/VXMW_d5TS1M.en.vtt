00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One day the Indian mystic Nisargadatta said to a visitor

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
expressing doubts as to the methods of searching,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
"What are you on about...

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
â€¦you do not even know why you were born."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Hence the first question: why we are?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In the Buddhist tradition the main concept

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is that everything in the world arises due to "dependent origination".

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This world appears dependent on causes connected to circumstances.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Inside every human being everything stems from that first cause:

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
ignorance and lack of knowledge

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of the "nature of the mind".

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There are various methods and various ways to bring the mind

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to a state of calm and non-attachment.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The true teacher is the unconditioned nature of our mind

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and here "nature" means "not made in any way",

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it is there, present as our nature state right from the very beginning.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It is not a new invention,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
nor an idea or a philosophical theory,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it is unconditioned reality, cognizant emptiness.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's identity is no thing ...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It is not an object that can be seen,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
heard, smelt, tasted or grasped

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but at the same time it is able to know.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
These two things are indivisible, not two separate things,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
just as the flame of a candle is both fire and it shines,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
it is both hot and it shines, you cannot separate the two.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Moreover the nature of the mind is amorphous

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
like light and space.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
One last stupid question:

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it is obvious that we are getting used to horrible events,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
nothing outrages us

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
as if the obscure side of beings were coming to the surface,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
just like the iceberg parable.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We need to talk to future generations.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
If people do this, the world will be a wonderful place.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What should we do?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We need to pay attention, we must apply this method to our everyday life

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
then we will really be happy.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, the bottom line

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is we must be helpful to others

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
as much as we can,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
at least we should not harm anyone.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Thank you very much.
