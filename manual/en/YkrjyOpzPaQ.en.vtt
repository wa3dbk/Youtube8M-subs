00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:16.210
&gt;&gt; As one of the oldest universities Packaging Programs in the
country, UW Stout offers broad industry
experience for virtually every interest.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:23.756
Packaging students enjoy the highest paid internships on
campus with an average internships wage of $17 per hour.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.036
Stout Packaging Engineers are highly recruited by the industry with
job placement rates for our program graduates of 98% or higher.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.036
Our reputation for producing outstanding Packaging Professionals has
resulted in more industry sponsored
scholarships than any other program at UW Stout.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:51.276
&gt;&gt; Of the 25 top employers in 2009, 2010 at that Hire University
of Wisconsin Stout students, 12 of them were hiring for Packaging.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.836
So we have a long record of companies coming
back for more of what we're producing.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:18.096
&gt;&gt; The main purpose of college is to get a job and be able to be
successful in your future and the stats really showed the -- how good
the program was and how Stout was with their job, job
replacement percentage and the salary statistics and everything.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.743
&gt;&gt; The list of employers that employ our students is, is
pretty big and broad because our industry is so large.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:42.356
&gt;&gt; Packaging was really interesting to me, seeing the vibration table
and being able to cut out, you know, any sort of design on the, the
data tech table was just really hands-on
and seemed really fun and interesting.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.030
&gt;&gt; With the co-op program, we're really lucky in that there are more
co-op opportunities coming every semester than we have students that
are willing or maybe ready to go out
on a call at any given period of time.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.890
&gt;&gt; I've actually had two co-ops, one at a pharmaceutical company and
that was really interesting being able to see the regulations that
they have to deal with and then my second one was at a metal
fabrication plant where they had never
had a packaging engineer before.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.020
&gt;&gt; The UW Stout Packaging Program is blessed again with a lot of
support from industry and another way that that's highlighted is
through the scholarships that we have available to our students.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.173
Even in the last couple of years and we've had this economic
downturn, we still have placement rates, 98 and 100%.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.896
Very, just consistently, semester after semester.
