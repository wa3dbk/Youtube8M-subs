00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.600
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Steve Matthis.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.780
You might remember me from being the winning
mechanic at the 1999 Summercross.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.020
Well, this week on the Transworld Bike Bandit
how to, I'm gonna show you how to change an

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.090
air filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The air filter, one of the cheapest things

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.410
on your bike, is also one of the most important.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.570
What you wanna do is make sure that it's kept
clean at all times.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.550
This affects the reliability and the performance
to your machine.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.870
Basically, the Transworld Motocross guys here
have left me with a pretty dirty one.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.900
So get some gloves from your local doctor's
office or you can buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.680
&lt;p&gt;And you wanna be careful when you reach
into the air box to take out a dirty air filter.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.829
Lots of times they'll be dirt and debris on
it and you can drop back down into the boot

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.270
and affect your motor.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.440
So unscrew the bolt, there's not a lot of
room on these new four-strokes either for

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440
the airbox.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.440
So extra special attention.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.680
Turning, turning, turning still turning.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.869
Take out the bolt, turn the filter sideways
and voila, there you have it.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.920
Like I said, the Transworld Motocross guys,
they don't do their maintenance.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:36.759
A dirty filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I clean the air box, I like to use

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.490
Maxima contact cleaner.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.479
Basically get a rag, get your contact cleaner.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.400
Spray some on there and just reach down and
clean that lip, get all the dirt and debris

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.240
out.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.130
Clean the backside of the airbox.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.680
As a factory mechanic, you'll see a lot of
times at the races, the mechanics will have

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.409
the whole subframe pulled off.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.130
They don't wanna risk dropping even the tiniest
little bit of dirt down in there.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.110
But for this purpose, and for most guys, you
can just use contact cleaner and a rag.&lt;/p&gt;

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:18.340
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that don't have fresh
clean filter oils at home, what you wanna

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.310
do is you take your dirty filter, get a bucket,
maybe some solvent, little bit of gasoline,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.820
Maxima air filter cleaner.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:34.569
Basically, spray that in there 
and work it around the filter.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.200
But it's not how we roll here at Transworld.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:50.410
We have a new pro-filter oiled and ready to
go into the bike.&lt;br /&gt;

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.600
So the new filter, ready to go and oiled,
you wanna install into the bike.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.730
For sandy tracks or some mud, water, that
sort of stuff, you can put the Maxima grease

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.090
along the lip.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.740
Always like to do that at Southwick seemed
to help my riders performance.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.940
But we're going to go without that today.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.489
So as I took it out, I twisted the air filter.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.659
When I'm putting it back in, wanna twist it
again.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.350
Drop it in there and again, visually check
and make sure that you have all the tabs lined

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.569
up.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.569
Pull it back a little bit.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.340
I like to do that to get the threads started.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.760
And simply start installing the air filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, I can't stress how important

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.150
it is to keep a fresh filter on your bike.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.420
It improves the reliability, improves the
performance of it.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.690
And it's an easy thing to do to your bike
and that and oil changes, keep up on it.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.840
With that, that's the Bike Bandit how to of
the week.&lt;/p&gt;
