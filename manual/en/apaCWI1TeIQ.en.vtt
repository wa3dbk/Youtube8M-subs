00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.800
Alright, okay.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.070
So if you guys have
a big sized notebook

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.840
and you use it
as a desktop replacement,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.970
you’re going to love this.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.980
Check this out,
this is really cool.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.250
This is the Vantek.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.320
It’s actually called the NBA-100U 
5.1 USB audio adapter.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.730
This is, pretty much,
a sound card in a little tiny box.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.930
It’s extremely affordable and
what you do is you plug it in USB,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.790
you install their drivers and 
there’s a little software packet,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.300
and what it does is,
it gives you 6 channels of volume.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.040
It gives you 5.1 surround sound

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.870
and it’s great for people
that have notebooks,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.770
it’s great for people that,
let’s say you have a computer

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.470
and let’s say you have
a bunch of video cards in there,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.740
you have no space
for a sound card

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.510
and your motherboard,
for whatever reason,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.610
does not offer
surround sound audio.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.910
You plug this baby in,
it’s very very affordable,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.820
I can’t tell you the price
because it might even be cheaper

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.550
if you see this video
a year from now.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.490
But, extremely affordable
and it does give you 5.1.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.790
It is usable for desktops,
like I just mentioned,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.930
but I think, more than anybody, 
it’s for people that are using

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.930
little notebooks,
netbooks, stuff like that

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.160
or if you have a big one. 
Let’s say that you have a 17” notebook

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.740
and you use it
as a desktop replacement.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.030
It kind of sticks around in
your house, you know, it’s great.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.170
You can get one of those
laptop coaters

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.440
that has a USB hub on the back,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.170
you plug this in and then you plug 
your 5-channel speakers into this

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.510
and then, as soon as you come home,
 you plug in that USB

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.770
and you automatically
have surround sound.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.090
You can watch TV’s on it,
you can watch movies…

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.620
Did I say TV’s?
That’s pretty funny, huh?

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.020
Funny, you like that Alfred? 
That’s funny, huh?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.050
By the way everybody,
Alfred is filming today.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.820
Very weird. So if you get sick, 
write him an e-mail.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.030
Alfred AS at Alfred dot com,
I don’t know. Whatever.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.870
So, let’s move on. 
Let me talk about this thing.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.330
Actually, you know what?
Let me pull it out here.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.460
Let me show you what it’s like.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.160
Because it is very small,
very compact and, like I said,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.070
it’s going to be very useful
to a lot of people,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.940
because it is quite affordable.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.970
My first gripe with it is that 
it’s packaging is dangerous, man.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.850
I’m surprised that my fingers
are still attached.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.270
Alright, so here it is.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.980
You can see, it is very small.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.680
See when I pull out little things 
like this Alfred?

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.420
This is when you zoom in
a little bit.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.890
You don’t have to go crazy, but…

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.320
as you can see,
you got a power button.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.020
Actually, this is an indicator light 
to show you that it’s on.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.530
You got a plus and minus
for your volume

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.820
and then you’re going to notice that, 
right through here,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.660
you have all your inputs for your 
5 surround sound, so this is…

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.600
this is your rear, this is
your center and your subwoofer

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.830
and this is your front.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.300
Now, over here is something else 
that’s very interesting.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.870
You’re going to notice that
it says line-in.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.040
That line-in right there
is actually for mono line in

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.980
and this is mic-in,
this is stereo in.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.310
So you’re going to actually input 
more audio through here

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.580
and have multiple channels.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.620
So, another thing that’s actually
 kind of impressive

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.120
about this thing is, if you’re using this 
for your microphone

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.750
and you’re using this for something else,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.550
you can actually input more
than one audio into your computer

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.090
because this
is completely separate.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.630
If you already have a video card, 
or you already have a mic in,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.460
the USB is completely separate 
from the rest of the audio.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.910
So this can actually add
a lot of utility to your computer.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.340
Now, another thing
that’s very important

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.040
that this little device does is
it has this little chip inside

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.070
that can automatically,
pretty much,

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.710
change the format of your audio.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.880
It’ll upsample it from 2 channels
 to 5.1 channels,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.650
it’ll do like a virtual surround, 
which is actually great.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.220
And again, it does add that second card, 
or it acts as a second card,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.650
so that gives you
a lot of versatility.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.020
You can have
a stereo playing outside,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.920
some music for your guests,
and then you can be in your room

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.190
playing music at the same time, 
different things,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.660
which is actually really cool.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.860
So again, it’s great for people

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.830
with laptops and desktop replacements

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.130
that are using laptops.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.700
It’s easy, it’s got simple software,
 it’s very affordable.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.070
It’s the Vantek NBA-100U
5.1 audio USB adapter.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.900

 e-mail me.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.450

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.810
Good job Alfred.
