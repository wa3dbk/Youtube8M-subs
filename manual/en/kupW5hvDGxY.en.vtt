00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.140
How can we provide food

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.360
for a growing population without
converting a large part

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.500
of the world's remaining forests to
make way for new farmland?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.550
How can we stem the tide of climate change 
and deal with the consequences?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.370
How can we achieve these things and at the same time

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.330
ensure economic growth for the poor and leave no one behind?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
These are some of the most pressing
questions for humanity and for our planet.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.030
And these are some of the questions

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.449
we're going to discuss at the 
Global Landscapes Forum

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.780
a major international conference 
on the sidelines

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.000
of the upcoming UN climate change summit
in Warsaw, in November.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.000
When we talk about landscapes, 
what does that mean?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
As a first step, we recognize that we can't look 
at forestry and agriculture in isolation.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.000
A "landscapes" approach to research and to policy

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.400
takes a wider view and finds combined solutions.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If we want to make meaningful progress and contribute

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to overall sustainable development,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.500
then researchers, policy maker and all of us
must think

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.200
about forests and agriculture as inextricably linked

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.970
parts of a greater "landscape", parts of combined solutions.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.410
We need to tear down

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.500
the institutional barriers between these areas.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.500
This is what the landscapes forum is about.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.210
Global Landscape Forum 
has a very concrete objectives

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.810
to inform the UN climate agreements the future ones

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.229
and the achievement of the UN sustainable development

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.670
Consider the following facts

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.619
it's three billion people living in rural areas

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.900
depending on agriculture and forestry
for livelihoods.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.400
Globally, there's 1 billion people who are food insecure.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.200
In 15 years time there'll be another 1 billion person to feed.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.870
From a food perspectives, the obvious solution is 
to expand food production

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.000
this often means increasing the mount of area given to agriculture.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.190
But this comes at the expense of forests
and natural ecosystems.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.300
Agriculture is the most important driver of deforestation,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.900
it accounts for about three-quarters of all 
deforestation around the globe.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.500
On has to tackle agriculture and forestry issues at the same time,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.320
the landscape approaches one tool that we can use to do.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.390
We have to think and act differently,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.780
forum intends to bring the different
sectors together

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.300
in order to start this conversations.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:08.200
We'd like to welcome you to Warsaw, on 16th-17th of November,
to the Global Landscape Forum.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.500
On behalf of the group of international organizations 
that putting together the forum.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600
See you there.
