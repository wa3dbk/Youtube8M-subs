00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:12.790
bjbj Happy Halloween. I'm Catharine, a makeup
artist with BHCosmetics. This is just a quick,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.080
easy tutorial of how to do Kathy Perry's purple
look from the "California Gurls" video. I'm

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.119
using BHCosmetics' eye and lip primer. Taking
my ring finger and sweeping just a little

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:37.780
bit over the entire lid, stopping just under
the crease line. Next, take a stiff, flat,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.260
smudge brush and dip it into a deep purple
color. I'm using it as a base over the entire

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.820
eyelid, again, stopping just under the crease
line, using small, swirling motions to evenly

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:00.719
blend color to a soft edge. Using BHCosmetics's
small eye shadow brush, I'll be creating a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.960
neutral contour line just at the crease line.
I'll dip into a neutral beige tanish color

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.140
just to give the slight illusion of depth,
and slightly recreate the eye shape that we

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.270
see on Kathy Perry's purple eye look. Going
back to my first smudge brush, I'll be dipping

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:31.890
it into some shimmery powders to give the
sparkle that we see in the purple look. Using

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.369
an angled liner brush, we're going to create
a nice clean simple cat eye. Go ahead and

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.880
dip this brush into a black cream eyeliner,
and start with a line extending from the outer

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.090
corner of your eye, going towards the end
of your eyebrow. And from that tip of that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.500
line, draw a line back towards the center
of your eyelid, ending right at the lash line.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.759
And then fill in the gap. Using BHCosmetics's
flat smudge brush, we're going to be creating

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.480
a brow highlight by mixing 2 colors; a baby
pink and a matte white eye shadow, and sweeping

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.190
this over the entire brow bone, going all
the way to blending into the neutral contoured

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:31.030
crease line. Now it's time for lashes. First,
without glue, measure the strip lashes to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.350
your lash line. If the corners are poking
you, they're too long and you'll need to trim

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:46.970
off the excess from the outer edge. Next,
apply glue to the entire strip. Now, using

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.170
a tweezer or your finger tips, place the strip
lash at the center of your lash line. Once

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.010
the center is attached, work on attaching
the outer corner first, and the inner corner

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.640
last. Press the strip into your lash line
using the end of the tweezers or your fingertip

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.300
to secure it. And last, to complete the eyes,
sweep your favorite black mascara over the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.591
strip lashes and your own lashes, combining
the two, sweeping upwards from your lash line

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:28.590
to the end of the lashes. Using the BHCosmetics
blush brush and the 6 color contour palette,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.970
we're going to sweep a rosy pink over the
apples of the cheeks, blending into our hairline

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:43.180
just under the temple area. 
Now, with the BHCosmetics lip brush and the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:04:01.850
66 color lip gloss palette, we're going to
sweep a vibrant pop out pink over the lips.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:11.860
Finish it off with a shear pinky gloss to
give the look some shine. And that was our

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.473
quick and easy Katy Perry "California Gurls"
tutorial. Have a happy and safe Halloween,
