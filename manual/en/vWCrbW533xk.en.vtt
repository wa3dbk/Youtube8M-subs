00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:02.501
Whatever you do, don't microwave anything at home.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.669
Jory: What about Hot Pockets?

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.110
Jon: I suppose that would be okay.

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:07.085
Riley: What about popcorn?

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.706
Jory and Jon: Shut up, Riley!

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:15.943
Hello, and welcome to the season 8 finale of "Is it a 
 Good Idea to Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:17.163
Riley: The finale?!

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.949
Jory: Yeah!

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:18.556
Riley: I mean, I just feel like this season just flew by!

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:20.367
Jory: Yeah, it's like we did it all in one day or somethin'!

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.830
Riley: I know!

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:22.434
Jory: Or two... Or three...

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.755
Riley: A weekend...

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.189
Jory: I don't know how long it's gonna 
 take... I mean, how long it TOOK!

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.290
Anyways... But I'm your bronze medal sidekick, Riley McIlwain.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.960
Jory: Uh, you're just bronze? I've got GOLD in here, somewhere!

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.695
Riley: Dude, don't touch those! Aw, dude, that's gross! You're touching gold teeth?!

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.331
Jory: Yeah, it's my grill!

00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:35.903
Riley: Dude, dude... That's gross, dude!

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:38.935
Jory: Yeah, but either way, I think it's gonna make a 
 brilliant light show in our microwave. Let's go do it!

00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:39.523
*Riley makes angelic falsetto*

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:40.545
*theme song plays*

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.106
Jory: It smells like victory!

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.774
Jory: All hands to the deck!

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.109
Jory: Nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.844
Jory: Let's get outta here!

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.945
Jory: Ventilation is key!

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.280
Jon: What're you doing?! Put that out!

00:00:47.694 --> 00:00:49.694
Jory: The masks- they do nothing!

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.180
Riley: (muffled) Be careful!

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.202
Riley: The tin foil shield- it actually worked!

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.752
Jon: Does it still work?

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.386
Jory: You're dumb!

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.120
Jory: Stopping, stopping!

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.149
Jory and Riley: 2.8!

00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:58.935
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:05.594
Let's find out! Here at the Jory Caron Laboratory 2.8, safety? No!

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:07.712
Riley: It IS our season 8 finale, though!

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.234
Jory: It IS our season 8 finale!

00:01:08.313 --> 00:01:10.313
Riley: It's gonna be great!

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:17.069
Jory: I mean, we've pulled out all the stops. We've got this giant fan, we've got a 
 microwave that actually has talked to God before! And we're gonna be microwaving some gold.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.740
Jory: That's not fool's gold, either. That's REAL gold!

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880
Riley: We have our Olympic bronze medal... I mean, "bronze filings."

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.516
Jory: These are copper ball bearings, I think.

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.952
Jon: Those are so [beep]in' small!

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:32.725
Jory: And we also have this barium thing, which, 
 apparently, is, like, this really inert metal.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:33.788
*Riley spills ball bearings*

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.993
Jory: Oh, great...

00:01:34.203 --> 00:01:38.203
Riley: I'm gonna pour this here. Look how 
 many there are right there! That's like...

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:40.898
Jory: If we had an intern, we would make them count those!

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:43.740
Jon: Alright, let's put it in there for... I don't know- what...?

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.470
Riley: 49-er!

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:46.070
Jory and Riley: 49!

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.300
Jory: Gold Rush, baby!

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:48.880
Jon: Everybody loves the Gold Rush!

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.940
Riley: Love gold!

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.510
*futuristic whooshing sound*

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.940
Jon: Ooh, yeah!

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.910
Jory: Okay, not sure what any of that was...

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.800
Riley: Whoa!

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.320
Jory: I think that's actually the bronze.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.280
Jory: I'm sure that looked brilliant, but I can't tell.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.690
Riley: Those are all the little bronze balls. Ooh-ooh!

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.390
Jon: Either that or that might be the bronze filings.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.890
Jory: I think that's the bronze filings. They're on fire now.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:11.000
Jon: Awesome!

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.800
Riley: Look at the bag!

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:16.870
Jory: Oh, wait, no- the copper, the copper ball bearings. I love 
 how there's still the glow stick stuff all over the window!

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:24.400
Jon: I'm amazed at what St. Margaret II has been through this season, 
 and now, she has the ultimate treat of being, of microwaving gold!

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:29.080
Jory: (to metal mixture) I'm gonna ask 
 that you do some more stuff... Okay!

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.720
Riley: Ooh! And ask, and you shall receive!

00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:32.300
Jory: What was over there?

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:33.180
Riley: I have no idea!

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:33.750
Jory: Oh, those were those little metal plates.

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:35.390
Jon: Is it a good idea to BRONZE this?

00:02:35.295 --> 00:02:37.300
Riley: OH! The microwave died!

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:38.360
Jon: The microwave died?

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:39.570
Riley: Yeah!

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:47.920
Jon: The microwave really died on the FINAL experiment in the FINAL minutes? That's perfect timing! 
 It's like Margaret KNEW her time was coming, and she wanted to go out gracefully.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.400
Riley: (muffled through mask) Fire in there!

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.400
Jory: There's no flames, though.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.470
Riley: (muffled) Let's go!

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:52.840
Jon: Come on, Margaret! Stay with us, Margaret! Ha bisky!

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:50.840
Riley: (muffled) Okay...

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.670
Jon: Come on, Margaret! Stay with us, Margaret! Ha bisky!

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.770
Jory: (muffled) Where did those teeth go?

00:02:54.208 --> 00:03:00.210
Jory: Oh, THERE they are! The plastic container with 
 the ball bearings just melted over there.

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:03.160
Jory: Wait, wait, wait, wait- where's the gold?

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:05.000
Jon: Yeah, keep that gold. It's still worth somethin'!

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:07.360
Riley: Uh, I think she's finally, um...

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:08.950
Jory: Did you turn her back on?

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.020
Riley: Oh, yeah, I turned her back on...

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.590
*Riley pounds on Margaret II*

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.090
Jory: Come on, girl!

00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:11.640
Riley: (mimicking defibrillator) Clear!

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.020
Jory: (urgently) Come on, girl, come on!

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.260
*Riley pounds on Margaret II some more*

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.360
Jory: (to Riley) Talk to her!

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.360
Jon: I think she really died on the final 
 experiment. That couldn't have worked out better.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.900
*St. Margaret II beeps and comes to life YET AGAIN!*

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:22.330
*Jory and Riley laugh in amazement at Margaret II's holy powers*

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:25.370
Jon: YES! YES! [Beep]in' satanic microwave!

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:29.200
Jory: What the [beep]?! Okay, so...

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.040
Riley: Wow...

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.810
Jory: You might be wondering, "What's the brand of microwave I should get 
 if I plan on microwaving all sorts of [beep]?" It's, uh...

00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:38.270
Riley: Emerson! Ironic, 'cause that's where Jon and Jory went.

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:39.970
Jory: Well, I TRIED...

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.050
Riley: I said "went", I never said "finished"!

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.450
*Jory laughs*

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.660
Jon: Impressive, very impressive!

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:56.460
Jory: So, you may be wondering, is it a good idea to microwave all of this random metal [beep]? I would 
 say "yes" on the bronze, "no" on the gold, "no" on the barium, and "no" on the mystery metal.

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:58.000
Riley: Just go Cash4Gold, if anything.

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.640
Jory: So, that's about it for season 8 of...

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:01.110
Jory and Riley: ..."Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?"

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:03.010
I'm Jory Caron.

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.680
I'm Riley McIlwain.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.810
Jory: And, uh...

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.680
Riley: Wait for the clip show.

00:04:04.947 --> 00:04:06.950
Jory: Yeah!

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:07.510
Riley: Just wait for it.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:09.350
Jory: We had a good time. If you missed any of 
 the episodes, they're around here somewhere. Just find them!

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:12.520
Riley: Yeah, click the series, I don't know! Thumbs up!

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:15.580
Jory: And the clip show WILL be out probably in a 
 couple of days. Find it, watch it, LOVE it!

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:22.460
*end credits play*

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.600
*marching band-like retirement montage music plays*

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.000
Jory: Let's call this one "Margaret II"!

00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:27.870
Jory: She's beautiful, and I love her so much!

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.270
Riley: Look at that!

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:30.170
Jon: Salute!

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:30.900
Jon: (muffled) Release the Kraken!

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.070
Jory: Stop! Stop it!

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.100
Jon: You'll be sayin' "wow" every time!

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.440
Riley: WOW!

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:35.310
Jory: That sounds like a good idea!

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040
Jon: (muffled) That was easy!

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.410
Jory: She rose again. I rose again right now!

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.640
*whooshing of fire extinguisher*

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:42.180
Jory: That's TWO resurrections! How many did Jesus do?

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:43.880
Riley: (in possessed voice) Get this out of me!

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.250
Jory: The saint herself!

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.650
Riley: (in exaggerated Boston accent) Margaret!

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.280
Jory: (in Boston accent) Margaret!

00:04:46.534 --> 00:04:48.530
Riley: (still in exaggerated Boston accent) Margaret!

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:48.840
Jory: Mother Margaret!

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.120
*retirement montage music ends*

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.090
Jory: She's risen THREE times!

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.260
Riley: I was gonna say! THREE!

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:57.590
Jory: The Bible only ever said that Jesus will rise TWICE, 
 okay? We have shown that this can rise THREE times!

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:04.760
Jon: So, beyond a shadow of a doubt, Margaret 
 II is MORE powerful than Jesus H. Christ!

00:05:03.276 --> 00:05:05.280
Jory: She is bigger than Jesus Christ!

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:12.070
Riley: So, if you wanna write, in the web space below, a little 
 Bible passage for St. Margaret II, then, uh, please, feel free!

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.910
Jon: We'll give you a free pizza roll!

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.780
Riley: (in deep voice) Below!

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:16.380
Jory: (laughs) We'll give you a pizza roll!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
