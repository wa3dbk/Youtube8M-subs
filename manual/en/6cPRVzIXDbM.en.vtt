Hi, welcome aboard. My name is Mark Corke from BoatUS Magazine. Today we're going

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
to be bleeding a diesel engine. We
previously changed the fuel filter on

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
this engine, but when you change a fuel
filter, it introduces air into the system,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.170
and the whole idea of bleeding it is
that we have to get that air out. Now, a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.939
fuel system on a diesel engine is a
closed system, so in other words if

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.930
there's any air in there, the engine
will either not start, or if it does

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.309
start, it will die. So what we have to do to
bleed that out is we use what's called

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.170
the fuel lift pump on the engine and we
manually pump that to pump air out. And

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.899
I'm going to take you through the steps
to do that. It's not particularly

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.620
difficult but to many people
believing a diesel engine is seeing

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
something of a black art. So let's get
started. Right, so here's the fuel filter

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.199
right here below my knee and this is the
fuel line, going along here, goes around

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.550
here and it comes to here. This is the
lift pump. And then from there it goes up

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.200
this braided hose to the secondary fuel
filter. Now, what's going to happen is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.299
because we changed the fuel filter here
we've got air in this filter. We have to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.939
pump that out. So the first thing to do
is to get an oil absorbent pad under the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.030
filter because we will spill some fuel.
I'm then going to use a wrench and undo

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.860
this banjo nut. You don't need to take it
all the way out, but this is on the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.820
pressure side of the pump. So we pump the pump and then the fuel will come out. So we

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.030
have a rag handy and you'll notice I'm
wearing gloves because I don't want to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.979
get diesel fuel on my hands. So I've
cracked this open just half a turn and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.479
now I'm going to start pumping.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.440
And I can see some bubbles coming out of here mixed with a bit of fuel. So I'm

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.619
just going to keep pumping until they
get a steady stream of fuel coming out.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.009
Right, I've got a nice steady stream of
fuel there now. So what I'm going to do

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.470
now is as I'm pumping we're getting a
nice steady stream of fuel out there so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.570
I'm going to get the wrench on there and
as I pump down I'm just going to tighten

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.760
that up so that there's no chance of
getting air back in there. Now, sometimes

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.110
if the fuel system was completely empty
we'd have to crack the injectors at the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.239
injector pump here, and the injectors on
the engine here, too. But we don't have to

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.739
do that because we only changed the
primary fuel filter so I know that this

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.350
filter bowl here will be full of fuel. So
there's absolutely no need to do that. As

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.930
I said, if if we were replacing this
filter too then we'd have to loosen these

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.860
off here and we do exactly what we've
just done there until we saw a fuel

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.480
bubble out of here, then we shut that off.
But we should be good to go now so I'm

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.920
just going to wipe up the fuel and we'll
give it a go and see if the engine will

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.670
start and run properly. Right, so we're
now back at the helm, we've put the deck

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.019
back down, we cleaned everything up.
Should be good to go so we're just going

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.240
to run the engine now just to make sure
everything is good.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.500
(Buzzing of boat turning on)

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.140
(Engine starting)

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.980
(Sound of engine and water bubbling)

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.500
I've just started the engine. It sounds
great.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.340
There's no cough. There's no splutters, so
I think the next time we go out we

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.480
should not have an issue. So it didn't
take me very long, it was very

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.439
straightforward, and as I said at the
beginning of the video, everybody

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.620
thinks of it as some sort of black art,
which it really isn't, but it's a good

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.900
skill to learn. For more on this and for

Thank you very much for
watching and we'll see you next time.
