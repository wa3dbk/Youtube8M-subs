00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.500
[ Music ]

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.216
&gt;&gt; The classic definition
of epidemiology is

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.496
that it is the study
of the distribution,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.830
as well as the determinants
of health

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.266
and health outcomes
in populations.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.990
Some of the key elements
that are really critical

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.696
to epidemiology are that
it focuses on populations

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.606
so we're not only interested

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.453
in why certain individuals
have an extremely high risk

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.820
of disease but also why certain
populations have more disease

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.420
or poorer health than
other populations.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.610
A second component that is
important to epidemiology is

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.563
that it's very tied to public
health practice and action.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.000
So we use the results from
epidemiology to translate

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.206
that into interventions and
these could be interventions

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.506
at an individual level or
more broadly to policies

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.070
that are really aimed at
improving the public's health.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.823
Well, I think of
epidemiologists as people

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.266
who are seeking answers,
who really like to try

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.966
to understand the details
behind what is happening

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.110
and it takes sort
of a keen observer.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.440
One of the reasons
why our department

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.546
of epidemiology is unique is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.866
that we have a very
diverse faculty

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.286
and the faculty are working
on a large variety of topics

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.310
and areas that are
important to public health.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.346
For example, we have faculty
who work on the application

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.020
of laboratory methods
to population health.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.640
We have faculty who work
on the genetics of disease.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.103
We also have faculty who
focus on international health

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.670
or health in global settings and
finally we have faculty working

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.743
on a number of chronic diseases.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.650
Because we have so many active
research projects going on,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.006
there are many opportunities
for students to get engaged

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.573
and to work directly in a one
on one kind of relationship

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.530
with faculty members to
really immerse themselves

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.100
in the research process.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.670
The University and the
school both have a very long,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.210
rich history of focusing on very
important public health topics.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.713
For example, the polio vaccine
was developed and tested here

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.076
within our own department
of epidemiology

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.006
at the School of Public Health.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.786
We strive to train our students
and to give them what we

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.556
like to call their
epidemiology toolbox so that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.946
when they leave our program,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.190
they have a very
strong foundation

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.223
in their both epidemiological
and bio statistical methods

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.846
and then they can apply
that really to any area

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.760
that they may be
interested in pursuing.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.120
