00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.480
Retro: Nokia 6310i
Launched Q2 2002.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.080
In terms of mobile phone history, 2002 was
a very long time ago.. and you would expect

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.039
a handset from that era to be obsolete and
completely unloved, right?

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.869
Well.. almost.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.030
There's an exception to every rule.. and that
exception is the Nokia 6310i.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:33.440
The 6310i itself was just a slightly upgraded
version of the 6310 (from 2001) which in itself

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.250
was an upgrade of the 6210 (from 2000).

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.770
So, the 6310i is a six year old phone based
on even older technology, which makes it remarkable

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.500
that you still see the 6310i in use today.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.980
By modern standards, the feature set seems
pretty laughable.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.530
The display is a 96 x 60 pixel monochrome
panel, and the 6310i doesn't have a camera,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.219
music player or even polyphonic ringtones.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.600
But it was one of the first Nokia handsets
to support Bluetooth, and it came with GPRS

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.680
data and Java support for downloadable applications.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.540
But there are several features in the 6310i
that Nokia have never really been able to

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.540
match.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.630
Firstly, it is a very easy handset to use.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.900
The number keys are well spaced and very comfortable
to use, and the menu and selection keys are

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.610
exceptionally simple and intuitive.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.770
Add to that the large call and hang up keys,
and many people would argue that the ergonomics

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.360
on the 6310i have never been bettered.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.119
It's quite a tall phone, coming in at 129
x 47 x 17mm, but combined with an ergonomic

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.260
design, it means that the microphone is somewhere
in the vicinity of the mouth when in use,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.260
which is handy.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.900
The large size also means that the 6310i is
quite robust - most surviving ones will have

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.939
suffered a few bad drops in their time.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.479
The battery life was excellent too, with a
maximum talktime of over 7 hours and up to

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.840
17 days standby time, the 6310i easily outlasts
many of its modern competitors.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.430
The Nokia 6310i is still popular today, and
refurbished handsets can cost up to £100

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.439
/ €140 or so.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.459
New ones are very rare as the phone has been
out of production for some years, and prices

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.540
range from around £150 to £220 (€200 to
€300).

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.849
Why so expensive?

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.120
Simply because many people see the 6310i as
the best handset that Nokia have ever made

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.249
in terms of usability.. and they'd like to
stick with it.

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:53.329
Whether you think that the 6310i is an old
clunker or a design classic is up to you.

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.849
But we certainly think that Nokia could still
learn a thing or two from this ancient mobile

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.870
phone.
