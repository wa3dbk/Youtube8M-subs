00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.900
So once we get in there you guys are going
to climb off your horses here in a few moments

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.279
when I tell you to, we're going to ride through
all of these guests, we're going to ride down

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.450
the road, and I'm going to stop at each campsite
and give you guys, I'll call out your name

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.309
and you guys will be able to camp in those
campsites down there. Well, the program is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.820
with the Boy Scouts. It's a Boy Scout program,
and it's, one of the neatest things about

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.350
this program is that we're not just out here
on a horseback ride going around in a little

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.440
circle and then back to the same place. We're
moving the herd. We have of about 70 to 80

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.000
head of horses, which, there are about 50
out here with us right now. We're moving them

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.700
between our two camps. We have a winter camp
ranch. The ranch itself is outside Scott's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.750
Mills and we have a mountain camp that's on
the backside of Mt. Hood not too far outside

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.130
of Dufur. And we run these horses up there
all summer as a scout program. We're with

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.970
us 9 days. We start with many kids who have
never been on a horse before. This trip here

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.190
we have 36 folk on. And there's a number of
them who have never rode before. We start

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.190
with an orientation day on the first Saturday.
It starts at 11:00 and it goes until dark.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.720
And then the next morning we wake them up
at, before light, feed them before light,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.010
and we're down at the corals as the sun's
rising. And my 8:30 or 9:00 we're on our horse

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.170
heading toward our first campsite. The Boy
Scouts of America have a long tradition of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.290
stewardship across the landscape and here
on the Mt. Hood. My big hope with the Boy

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.720
Scouts of America is that they will form the
new stewards of our country and will work

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.229
within Public Service towards trying to promote
land management across the landscape and all

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.200
of our public lands. You know it's something
that has changed over the years. Years ago

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.970
this was a trip to get our horses moved. But,
I don't know if it was just because I wanted

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.950
these kids to experience more or if I was
just bored with just riding or whatever, but

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.900
we've really transformed this thing into,
a 9 day horsemanship clinic that we talk continually

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.769
about humanship skills. We have a whole session
on leadership, a whole session on goal setting,

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.459
a whole session on having a positive attitude
and how that attitude can transform your life.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.400
I'm learning about horsemanship, and how to
be successful, and how to just be a better

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.910
person in life and to see what acting like
a Western cowboy can teach you. I have also

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:02.200
grown in, kind of just faith in myself and
also relying on others and an animal that

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:09.889
I'm riding on trusting my life with and it's
a great partnership between you and the horse

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.859
and I think I'm having a great partnership
with Oreo. She's a great horse. She is an

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:25.919
Appaloosa I think. She 16 years old. She's
slow, but she get's the job done. It's a trust

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.489
thing, she trusts me, I trust her. It works.
I've only fallen off once. It wasn't that

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.560
bad, so I think we're doing pretty well. The
very first day, we start talking to these,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.889
to everybody because there are adults on this
trip too, about the difference between human

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.930
time--the time we all run out in the city
and when we've got a job and responsibilities

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.900
and all that. But then the other thing is
horse time. And that horse time that we teach

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.510
these kids about is the time that slows down
to the pace of the horse. And whatever happens

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.470
happens and however much time it take it takes.
There are a lot of different sayings these

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.180
kinds of kids, these kids start picking up
on. Like if you take the time it takes, it

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.799
takes less time. Make the right thing easy
and the wrong thing difficult. Recognize the

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.799
smallest change. Reward the slightest try.
And they start looking at those little things

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.479
with their horse and then they start realizing
how important that is with their lives. The

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.070
youth that are involved in this program, are
very interested in protecting the resources

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.430
of the Mt. Hood National Forest and use them
in a way where they can be sustained over

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.330
a long period of time. Boy Scouts in general
are people who have a high ethic related to

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.539
land use and land protection and I view them
as the future stewards of our public lands

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.889
across the United States. It's an amazing
program. I wish every kid in the country could

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.300
go on it because it's one of the things that
people don't realize their kids need. They

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.409
need responsibility, they need boundaries,
they need to know what they can do and what

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.659
they can't do. They need to have people tell
them they are great and they need to be successful.

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.620
And that's all something that happens to every
kid who comes out here. They just long for

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.289
this. It's just what their hearts' desire
is but they just don't know it because we

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.470
don't do this in the world anymore. And so
it's great. I tell these kids when they get

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.319
here, it's a trip of a lifetime. It's going
to transform your like just get ready to have

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:22.650
your life changed. And I don't let them down.
They know that and they come back and tell

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.200
me that and they come time after time to get
more of that.
