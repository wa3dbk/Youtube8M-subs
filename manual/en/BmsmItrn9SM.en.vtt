00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.230
george Zimmerman's sold a painting

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.230
Annabeth this story is so insane I'm
using the term painting very loosely

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.950
for a hundred grand okay it's sold on
eBay for 100,000 ninety nine dollars and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.969
ninety nine cents

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.520
what person would pay that for something
george Zimmerman painted

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.890
I don't know but as media i'd is
reporting

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.279
it's not clear that it's really an
original painting

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.990
Twitter user Raven underscore rainfall
pointed out to media i'd

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.800
that Zimmerman's America beamed artwork
above the American flag et cetera

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.220
it seems to be a copied or traced

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.070
over image from the stock photo company
Shutterstock

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.820
here for people who are watching here is
in Romans painting this is this is the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.300
images in Romans painting

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.220
and then here is a corresponding crop

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.940
love this shove the Shutterstock flag
every ripple in the flag

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.970
is identical Louis the best guess here I
i assume is a merman wanted the pain

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.350
American flag

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.060
so we search for an image on
Shutterstock and then

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.670
traced over it or something or I don't
know what he did

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.330
I in any case here's good old George
holding the painting

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.930
and this could actually bring up some
kind over copyright issues Shutterstock

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.430
images are copyrighted

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.789
and Zimmerman made a hundred grand
apparently copying the work

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.159
yeah I'm he could have just been a
simple Photoshop thing to you i mean

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.119
is a good chance that there was no
painting or drying or anything done by

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.479
hand by simmering here

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.149
Bahama but I think it's possible that if
he actually bought the picture of a star

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.600
Shutterstock that this would be okay
white that who knows

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.909
that's the case there's another guy who
po

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.200
posted a picture that are a drying that
he did online

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.289
artist Michael do want Oh No posted on
e-bay a drawing he did

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.759
which has kinda like a KKK looking
person which could be Zimmerman

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.189
pointing a gun at a kid holding skittles
who

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.250
probably is Trayvon Martin and e-bay
pulled it down like the same day that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250
Zimmerman sold for a hundred grand

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.400
saying that it depicted I it depicted

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.670
the KKK and they don't allow okkk
related stuff that the bay just doesn't

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.390
allow that

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.110
it's fascinating because that painting
is much more of a social commentary than

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.060
george Zimmerman's

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.340
also that guy painted the the commentary

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.410
image presumably hasn't killed anyone in
his life but Zimmerman is allowed to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.870
make a hundred grand of a copied
Shutterstock stock image

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.940
but this other guy can even get the 25
grand that his painting had been up to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.130
the donate to charity it so it's a
strange world out there Lewis

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.420
it is and George them which is

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.220
at using Zimmerman can thank his his
celebrity for that because that's the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.970
only reason this is happening
