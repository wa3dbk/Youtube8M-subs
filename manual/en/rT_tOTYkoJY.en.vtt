-[rapping]: Yo, my name is
Orange and I'm here to say

00:00:02.118 --> 00:00:04.037
The Juice fields questions
most every day

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:06.245
We got Pear, Grapefruit,
and Marshmallow

00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:08.660
We even got a puny red dude
that's half of a fellow

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.007

-Hey!

00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.869
-[laughs]
Time for The Juice, Pear.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.843
-Today we have my
favorite question yet.

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:18.456
David Howell writes, "Orange,
if you could be any supper hero,

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:19.843
who would you be?"

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:21.278
-Great question, David.

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:22.554
Most people don't
realize we foods

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:24.617
have our own superheroes
called "supper heroes,"

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:26.370
but we do,
so how 'bout it, everybody?

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.450
I wanna know What's the Juice?!

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.480
Grapefruit, superheroes, go!

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.804
-All right, Orange.

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:34.396
I'm gonna have to go with
my all-time favorite superhero

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:36.401
Spider-Flan!
[chuckles]

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.145
Yeah,
it's the best of both worlds.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:41.822
He get the powers of a spider,
plus the texture of flan.

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:43.656
-Spider-Flan?
[retches]

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:45.784
I can't think of
two grosser things.

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:47.953
Combining them together
should be illegal.

00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:50.749
-They're gross, this is true,
but riddle me this:

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.783
would any criminal mess
with a superhero that gross?

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:55.875
-I guess not. Good point.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:57.679
-More like great point!

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.261
-I know a supper villain
who would mess Spider-Flan:

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:04.077
Magmeato! That's who I'd be.

00:01:04.077 --> 00:01:05.509
-Uh, just to be clear,

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.890
we're all fully aware that
there are some supper heroes

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.875
capable of flying,
yet here we are

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.314
selecting spider breeds
and magnetic meats?

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:14.541
-Magmeato can fly if
he has access to metals.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.146
He'll just make a
hover board with his mind.

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:18.569
Plus, since he's made of meat,
he's pretty much like, you know,

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:21.403
100% muscle, so I bet
the ladies really dig that.

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:23.868
-I'd choose to be the
biggest hero in the world:

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:26.333
my mom! Yay!!!

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.665
-That's sweet but...

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.660
can you mom take on Souperman?

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.294
'Cause that's who I'd be:
Souperman.

00:01:33.294 --> 00:01:35.788
-Actually, my mom is
from the planet Krypton,

00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:37.452
so she can take on Souperman!

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:38.752
YAY! KILL! KILL!

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:40.508
-Okay, Orange, who would you be?

00:01:40.508 --> 00:01:42.681

the best theme song.

Batpan, you got to help me!

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:16.583

you sing a song repeatedly,
