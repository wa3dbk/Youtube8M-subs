00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:32.198
Akamonkai Language School has 
many different strengths.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.467
One of the biggest points 
that makes Akamonkai unique is

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.704
our general Japanese course
to get students to learn the language.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:41.741
We also have a college
preparation course.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.945
There is also a business preparation course
for students who want to work in Japan.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.214
Does Mongolia have intercoms?

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.283
Yes they do!

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:52.452
If that's so, then Japan is not the
only country with it!

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:56.089
We help students by using pictures

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.059
with the hope that this can
help them start speaking

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.295
and also learn Japanese 
through their actions and gestures.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.365
This allows students to become
used to the language,

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:09.269
and this allows them to eventually
be able to speak Japanese properly without guidance.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:16.576
The normal course every day you do a bit
of kanji, grammar, listening, reading, writing.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:25.251
With the business course, we still do all
of that but it's more focused on technical things.

00:01:25.474 --> 00:01:29.622
We read business newspaper articles for 
business settings in Japan, so

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:33.327
I think it's really useful if you
want to work here in Japan.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.265
In general after six months of study, you are
able to see the full contribution of the beginning levels.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.501
After one year of study,

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:48.007
After one year all the grammar and communication you learned during the beginner phase becomes smoother.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:52.812
Two years of study will more or less allow you to pass the JLPT N1 level.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:56.816
You will also be able to write short
essays, etc.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.121
When you are working or applying for a job,
your appearance is very important.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:06.459
At the moment I am in the Intermediate 2 level, 
which is quite a high level.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:14.100
We are studying a lot of grammar and kanji.

00:02:14.193 --> 00:02:17.443
The school helped me a lot because the teachers
always talk in Japanese

00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:20.840
so I have a lot of chance to practice!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.787
The school has a 24 hour study room in 
the basement of the building.

00:02:23.787 --> 00:02:28.047
There are also around 2000-3000 manga books 
as well as a computer room.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:33.622
These three aspects of the facility are available to access via the main Akamonkai campus 24 hours a day.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:37.687
After we receive an application form for 
part-time work from the students,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.190
we match them with jobs that fit their criteria and sit down with them to propose the best course of action.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:46.699
We assist them with things such as writing their 
resumes and practicing job interviews.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:50.466
The school helped me after I gave them my
information, explaining to them

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.773
what kind of part-time job I wanted to do.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:03:01.281
The teachers introduced me to my current part-time job.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:09.275
I work in a famous restaurant, whose company 
owns many restaurants all over Asia.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.291
Akamoknai helped me find a job.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:17.163
They let the student write down their resume and they will find a job for the student.

00:03:17.338 --> 00:03:21.267
Akamonkai also has a dormitory option
that is one of its strong points.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:28.141
There are many dormitories within the area
where you can reach the school via bike or walking.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:33.112
There are also students who live in
apartments who can also come to the school at night

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.282
to use the facilities, so you can be safe
and come to the school even at night.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.617
That's another highlight of the school.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.186
What I like about Akamonkai is that the teachers

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:51.030
help everyone in the same way, and many students in the past went to University afterwards.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:59.038
So teachers know how to advise students according to their goals, like finding a job or going to University.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:04.146
Akamonkai is one of the schools which helps 
the most to achieve your goals.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:09.315
I would recommend this school, one being that itâ€™s definitely affordable compared to other schools

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.117
I think it's an affordable school.

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:18.424
Whatever language you may speak, the staff
can help you with whatever questions you might have.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:22.580
I just think that the overall teaching here is pretty good.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:28.534
Always believe in your own goals and abilities and come to Akamonkai to achieve success.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:33.439
Together we can spread our wings and move 
forward not just in Japan but to the world.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:38.378
We look forward to seeing you here at 
Akamonkai Language School.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:03.002
Akamonkai Japanese Language School

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:06.439
Live and study in Japan

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:10.109
