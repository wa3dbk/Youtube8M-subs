Hi everyone I am Meral Ertunc I am the owner
of Body Lines Personal Training in Maitland

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.039
Florida.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.009
Today I’m going to go over Busso Ball training.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:31.550
Busso ball training is a great core exercise,
strength exercise, flexibility exercise.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.100
There’s a lot of balance involved here this
could be very advanced movement or it could

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.760
be very beginner movement.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.500
A lot of people get a little nervous when
they start getting on top of the Busso ball

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.519
because it is very wobbly but it’s going
to help you build strength, flexibility and

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.280
get your core really nice and strong.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.940
I don’t recommend people that are over 70
years of age being on top of a Busso ball.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.339
I just feel that that could let up to a little
bit of an injury.

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.049
Buss ball is done with your own body weight.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.670
Some people have never done Busso ball and
they may have a lot strength already built

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.810
up that they can go ahead and do this right
when I teach them.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.380
And a lot of people they don’t have any
strength.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.880
But you can build your strength on the Busso
ball to get more advanced.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.780
I’m going to go ahead and demonstrate some
exercises on the Busso ball.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.640
I’ll start with a beginner exercise and
then show you a intermediate exercise and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.120
an advanced exercise.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.740
OK first this is a beginner exercise.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.170
Busso ball is a little wobbly like this.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.610
This is a hard surface.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.640
What I want you to do is to get right on top
of it.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.149
You’re going to go ahead and do a push-up.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.880
Your knees are going to be bent you want your
back nice and straight and you’re going

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.630
to come all the way down and you’re going
to push up.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.049
OK this is a beginner Busso ball push-up here
OK?

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.060
Now, if you want to do a little bit of an
intermediate you’re going to be up on your

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.880
toes and you’re going to go down deep and
push up.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.570
Down deep and then push up.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.979
Now if you want to be a little bit more advanced
have one leg out lot of balance here if you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.979
notice.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.840
Here and push.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.310
Here and push.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.160
Back is nice and straight engage that core
and you’re pushing up.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.630
This is more of an advanced Busso exercise.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.300
