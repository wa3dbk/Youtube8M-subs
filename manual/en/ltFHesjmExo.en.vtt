00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.750
What is Sony 3d glasses?

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.970
It's a freaking breakthrough!

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.540
No, seriously, through lifelong friendship
with computer graphics I could

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.620
remember only three milestones.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.241
The first one was back in 1995, when I
switched from monochrome CGA display which

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:21.020
was able to show only 4 shades of grey,
to a full-coloured VGA with a whole lot of

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.610
256 colours!

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.060
I still remember
how deliberately cartoonishly colourful the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.081
game picture was back in the day.

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.000
The next revelation dates back to 1998 when
I got a 3dfx.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.800
And the last is
this 3D HMD.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.370
The idea of a headmounted display is anything
but new.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.230
In 1994, when I was
dreaming about a VGA, VFX-1 helmet hit the

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.230
market.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.730
Aside wonderful AKG
headphones, it had two displays built-in.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.650
Those were TFT, a cutting edge
technology back then and sported 180 thousand

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.330
pixels resolution, which was
somewhat standard.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.090
Just for comparison, modern 720p HD-Ready
(not FullHD)

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.760
displays have a resolution of 921 thousand
pixels.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.039
The funny thing is VFX
was closer to virtual reality then the Sony

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:08.900
product, and head tracking is
the reason.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.040
It registered head movements on the wearer
and, with a noticeable

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.610
but tolerable lag, adjusted the image accordingly.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.490
Sony's helmet doesn't have a gyro, but as
it glows, maybe they could utilize

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.819
the same camera technology used in Move controller
to track the glasses

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:24.819
position.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:27.759
Anyway, you could imagine that a couple dozen
years back even the

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.130
mere fantasy of getting a VFX caused massive
wet emissions in shooter and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.389
simulator lovers.

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:37.170
However, the helmet was ahead of it's time,
and after 3rd revision the company

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.359
ceased production.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.409
This is quite common in the IT world.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.099
For instance, in
the early 1980 the home videogame giant Atari

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.289
released CX-42 - the worlds
first commercially available wireless joystick,

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.289
and failed.

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.999
As well as Nintendo
which released the notorious PowerGlove in

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.999
1989.

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.319
Or the early tablet GridPAD
released in the same year, from which Apple,

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.799
which is treated as an inventor
of the tablet PC for reason unknown, took

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.299
many ideas for their Newton, released
4 years later, and also failed.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.119
The market was just not ready for such innovations.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.060
In that sense Sony is in a far better position,
as there is plenty of 3d content now

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.200
as well as customers desire to view it.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.069
But there's a definite lack of
technology to deliver it.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.720
Apart from shaky attempts to create a 3d screen
which doesn't need special glasses to view

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.350
it, two main technologies are
readily available for the consumers.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.810
The first one works best in cinema and home
projectors and requires specially polarized

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.290
glasses that separate images for
left and right eye from a joint on-screen.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.129
Another one is for displays and
requires special shutter-glasses to operate.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.079
The TV screen alternates between
images for left and right eye, showing only

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.110
one at a time, and the glasses
shut the right or left eye accordingly, so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.280
that only the correct one will
get the required picture.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.250
This technology is also a couple dozen years
old.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.099
In the late nineties some NVidia videocards
came bundled with very similar

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.450
shutter-glasses, and the biggest concern was
to find a CRT-monitor capable of

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.219
producing 120Hz output at a decent resolution.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.420
The thing is the glasses cut
the refresh rate in half, meaning each eye

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.590
receives only 60Hz of the 120,
and if this value is below 60 the screen starts

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.709
to flicker noticeably causing severe
headaches after minutes of use.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.890
It's fair to say that the headaches
are also a problem with todays top-of-the-line

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.800
3D TV and most impressive 3d
cinemas, because the technology is rotten.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.609
Sony's 3d-glasses has none of these issues
for the very simple reason: each

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.230
eye has a separate display and receives a
very own, uninterrupted feed.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.909
In this
sense it doesn't differ from prescription

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.430
glasses, binoculars or those devices
you used to view stereo photographs when you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.569
were a kid.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.590
Nevertheless, Sony's 3d glasses are a product
for enthusiasts.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.409
Unlike a 3d
cinema, where you just snap on the glasses

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.569
and enjoy your popcorn, these
glasses require rigorous calibration exactly

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.299
for the user, or the 3d won't
be so immersive.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.829
Rigorous doesn't mean hard, you just stick
to certain rules.

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.370
The lower belt must be on hindhead, not on
top of the head, and the front pad

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.530
must be on you forehead.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.239
All the weight is supposed to be on this pad,
not on

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.540
your nose, this is extremely important!

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.570
By playing with pads of different size
and their position, adjust the distance between

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.290
the displays and your eyes,
and by moving the lenses adjust the distance

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.160
between left and right eye.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.210
When you're done, you're free to go!

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.030
Of cause this is more like jerking-off,
since others won't be able to share the pleasure

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.030
with you.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.520
And in general this
is more of a personal, single-owner device,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.570
as it must be readjusted for a new
user which is not exactly convenient.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.750
As for the headaches there are none, but at
first you may feel a little

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.140
sea sick as your vestibular needs some time
to adjust.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.460
You'll be good after a
couple days of usage.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.540
So, if you have a strong desire to get one,
you'll have to pick a model.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.830
Of course, many other products are available,
but most of them and ill-designed

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.130
and poorly made.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.470
There's really no alternative to a Sony as
for now.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.110
Sony offers two products - HMZ-T1 and the
new HMZ-T2.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.200
Which one should you get?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.560
The choice is not that easy.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.890
There's a price point.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.970
The first model is pricey,
but the second costs twice as much.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.860
So, what benefits are in store for you
if you pay double?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.820
Well, the official site markets the new model
to provide "full high definition

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.820
images".

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.600
For any sane person, full high definition
is FullHD, 1080p or

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.670
1920x1080.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.670
It's not!

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.931
The actual resolution is 720p exactly the
same as in

00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:34.931
the first model.

00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:38.830
You don't have to read the rest, but we'll
finish anyway.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.730
The main difference from the first model is
that the second weights 20 percent

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.730
less.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.050
How exactly did it lose weight?

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.250
By sacrificing quite decent open headphones.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.400
The second model has earphones!

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.720
Apart from the obvious hygiene issue when
used by

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.080
whole family, the sound will be very unimpressive,
since while the first model

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.530
offers 1000 mWt of power, the second is 10
times weaker with only 100 mWt of

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.660
power.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.110
That reads "say good by to massive explosions
and realistic gunfire".

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.190
So for twice the money, you basically get
the same product with downgraded

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.640
features.
