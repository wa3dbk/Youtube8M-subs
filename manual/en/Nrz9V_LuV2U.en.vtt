Hi I’m Courtney Gray over here at Hard Core
Studios on the east side of Austin, Texas.

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.920
Courtneygrayarts.com I’m going to show you
what I teach most of my students over here,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.980
one on one. Basically I teach creative wax
carving. What I’ve done here, I’m going

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.420
to demonstrate for you, is the process of
lost wax casting. This is the final step of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:33.539
your wax carving lesson. You will take your
wax that your carved, exactly to size and

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.899
proportion to what you want to make in silver,
gold or platinum. We don’t actually cast

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.129
platinum here it’s a different process,
but basically, this is what you would do.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.839
You would take your wax and with a wax pin,
which is basically like a soldering iron,

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:58.839
a heated pin, you would connect your wax to
a feed line which we call a sprue and connect

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:06.320
that to a rubber base. This is just a rubber
base that I have in different sizes and diameters

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.530
of. Depending on the size of your piece, you
would use the appropriate base and flask.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.420
The flask is basically a metal pipe that’s
pretty thin in gage and you want to match

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.409
that up with your rubber base. So basically
this is how we’re going to make our mold

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.750
before we cast. Once you have your wax screwed
onto your base you would put your flask over

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.030
that and insert a plaster type material we
call investment, it works a lot like plaster.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.810
Get that liquid, it’s a white powdery substance,
you would get the liquid and pour it around

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.030
your wax into the flask with your base on.
It surrounds your wax and captures all the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.812
detail. Then basically you would let that
sit overnight preferably or at least for an

00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:06.200
hour. You would then, once it’s hard and
ready to go, you would take that base off

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.810
and put it aside and you would basically have
an open cavity here where your metal is going

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.440
to be inserted once you take the wax out.
You then take that flask and put it into a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.290
kiln, small jewelry kiln, is fine. People
used to use their home ovens I don’t suggest

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.921
that there are a lot of fumes involved. You
take that, you put it into your kiln, you

00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:35.870
heat it up to in steps up to 1200 degrees
Fahrenheit and this will heat your wax out

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.640
of your mold. We call that the burn out process
or the lost wax process. Once that is completely

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.400
dissipated, the wax just dissipates with that
intense heat you have your mold that’s ready

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.760
to cast. What I’m going to show you to do
today is how to take that, heat your metal

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.141
and insert it into your mold using centripetal
force. This here is a centripetal casting

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:08.260
machine that we’re going to use to do that
today. There are other types of machines that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.790
you can use, there’s vacuum casting the
main one I work with is centripetal casting.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.340
So that’s what we’re going to do.
