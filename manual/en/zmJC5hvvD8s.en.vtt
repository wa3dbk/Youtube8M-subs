Hi! We are Nick and Valerie Wisniewski on
behalf of expertvillage.com. We are here to

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:25.599
talk about animal tracking and for more information,
please visit our website at walnuthilltracking.com.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.180
When you are out tracking animals and looking
at animal tracks you spend a lot of time on

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.430
the ground. One of the most useful things
that you can bring along with you is a pad

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.660
or some kind of thing to kneel on. It will
make your life a lot easier out in the wild.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.390
We each carry a belly bag which we turn around
so it is in front and inside of this are all

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.429
the things that we use for tracking. Some
of those things are tape measures. I usually

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:04.680
carry at least two sometimes three. Another
thing that we carry is hand disinfectant because

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.210
we actually when we are out tracking will
handle things like animal scat and we need

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.229
to sterilize our hands. We need to sterilize
our hands afterwards. We also have inside

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:24.390
of our tracking bags other things such as
measuring devices and other things that will

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.210
help you identify animal tracks. Inside of
our bag we have things like popsicle sticks

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.631
that we will use to stake out animal tracks
and try to determine the pattern that is on

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:43.270
the ground to help us identify the animal.
We have a flashlight which we use to shade

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.710
a track and put some light on it, create some
shadows which will help you identify the track.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.899
We have a couple of different kinds of magnifying
glasses. One which is a low magnification

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.799
and then jewelryâ€™s loop. This one happens
to be 20x. It could be 10x too. That will

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:13.060
help you look at things in greater detail.
We have some tools that we use when we are

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.860
picking apart animal scat which strangely
enough we do on a regular basis. These are

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.300
dental picks which I have appropriated solely
for the purpose of picking apart scat. We

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.360
have also something that is very important.
When we are looking at animal tracks, we are

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.430
looking at not just tracks but we are looking
at animal sign and one of the things to be

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.570
most commonly looked at is animal scat. These
calipers are used to determine the diameter

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.800
of different kinds of scat which will help
us identify what animal left that sign. There

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.830
are other things in here too like a metal
ruler that I use when I am measuring various

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.650
small tracks and a type of caliper here that
expands for measuring inside diameter of animal

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.640
holes or burrows. Another item that is very
useful is a pair of tweezers which you will

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:18.630
be using to pick apart different things, pulling
bear hair off of trees, etc. Another thing

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.370
that is quite useful is some string which
you can use to stake out animal tracks.
