How to Start Seeds, by Mike, the Garden Coach

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.200
I've used this method for starting seeds quite successfully for the last few years.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:26.900
I use a commercial seed tray, though you can use the egg carton. I like these, they produce 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.666
nice size plugs that are very convenient to work with

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:39.532
the material is a sterile, soil-less mix from SunGro 

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:44.866
It is organic seed starting mix number three

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:54.566
there is a number 4 mixed with a slightly higher mineral charge for planting out in 4 inch pots

00:00:54.566 --> 00:01:03.566
We dampen the media til it is like a damp sponge and fill the potting cells.

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:10.732
We tamp the material down to give a little dent we put the seeds in

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:18.166
Now, you have to leave enough room to put the seed in and cover them. The rule of thumb is 

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:23.266
2 to 3 times the diameter of the seed is the depth of the cover

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:33.999
Each seed packet will tell you the exactly how deep they like to be covered up. Too deep, and 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.400
the seats may not have the energy to put their leaves above the ground.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:52.100
so, we've cover with a light dusting of this media, and then the idea is to smooth this all off without knocking the seeds loose

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:02.000
Then, once the media has been smoothed off a little bit: we can pull out the other tray again 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.833
in tamp this material down so it doesn't  blow the seeds off while we take it to be watered. 

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:17.199
now, one of the things about watering here is that if you water from the top, it will often 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.466
look completely saturated at the top while it is still bone dry at the bottom

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.966
We label the plants here so that we can tell what they are.

00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:31.499
As soon as this is done we're going to go water them

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.233
Now, what we do here - these pots all have a hole in the bottom.

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:40.366
I use a child's sand &amp; water play table

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:48.432
that happens to be conveniently located near where I'm growing

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:58.599
Fill this with the water and then put the trays in and let them soak from the bottom up. This guarantees that the bottom of each cell 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.100
is saturated and that the media and the seeds settle down and come into firm contact with each other

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.500
as soon as they get glossy like this we can pull them out and put them up, ready to grow.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:24.333
Pretty soon you'll have your seeds starting like this. Have a good day... Mike, the Gardener
