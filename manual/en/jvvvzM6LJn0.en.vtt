Your church has a mission, and The City can
help you accomplish it by transforming the

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.370
way your whole church communicates and interacts!

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.090
You see, The City was built specifically for
the church. So, it gives you a single, integrated

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.581
platform for all the communication that drives
the mission of your church.

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:26.390
With The City, it's simple to communicate
to everyone in your church. Just write your

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.570
message and it will be posted in The City
and sent by email. And since The City knows

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.670
the people in your church, it's easy to focus
your message to just the right people, so

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.370
you can target something to members only,
or just women, or some other demographic.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.489
Your message goes to the right people, and
no one's inbox gets flooded with unnecessary

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.960
emails!

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.920
Of course, you don't just need to broadcast;
your church also communicates in smaller groups,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.980
formal and informal networks, and individual
relationships. So, if you want to start a

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.870
discussion with people in your community group,
you can choose to keep it within just that

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.080
group, or you can choose to share it with
other groups or individuals in your church.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.830
The City even lets you share communication
to people outside your church through a public

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.390
website, called the Plaza.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.440
After your message has gone out, it's not
really gone. That's because communication

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.970
in The City doesn't just go in one direction,
it's interactive! So, when someone posts an

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.440
urgent prayer request in The City, not only
do you see it right away, you can reply right

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.700
then and there -- even directly from email
 -- to let them know you're praying. And so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.700
can everyone else. As the situation develops,
everyone can be updated immediately, to further

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.820
direct their prayers and organize ministry
in response to specific needs.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.510
Or, maybe you're planning an event aimed at
building relationships with people who don't

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.720
know Jesus. You can share your event invitation
to the Plaza, and from there, people can invite

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.060
their friends and neighbors by sharing the
link through social networks like Facebook

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.500
or Twitter. People who aren't a part of your
church can use their Facebook account to RSVP

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.879
for the event and interact with anything on
your Plaza, so they can get to know people

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.540
from your church, even before meeting in real
life.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.219
Wondering how you'll know if all this communication
is effective? Well, The City has that covered,

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.989
too, with automatic metrics and engagement
reports to help you measure the reach and

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.099
ministry impact of all your communications.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.720
After all, communication isn't the goal. But
The City makes it easy for your whole church

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.180
to communicate effectively, so you can accomplish
your mission.
