share with you that when you are making

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.840
a chicken curry

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.200
you don't want only your chicken tasty

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.250

with you already taken out the skin grab

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.860
a chicken drumstick make two cuts two or

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:14.410
three cuts but 2 cut is a preferable

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.970
one cut on big side you don't have to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.850
cut all the way through just a deep

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.820
enough so when we are cooking the curry

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.430
goes inside and then it blends in with

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.239
