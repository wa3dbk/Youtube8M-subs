Howdy folks how is it going welcome to my
virgin kitchen this is Chloe and she has just

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.360
turned up, can you say hello?

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.360
Hello!

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.110
So Chloe has turned up and I am about to go
and pick Chloe up from school with you right,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.720
but just before she got home from school I
made ginger nuts.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.630
Do you know what they are?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.630
Yeah?

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.000
She is a bit shy because she has never been
here before and like are there people here?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500
It is just me and you ok?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.530
Alright!

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.190
So basically ginger nuts, they are like a
nostalgic biscuit Chloe ok, when I was younger

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.280
growing up, obviously you are younger when
growing up, ginger nuts were a really nostalgic

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.390
biscuit and if you had ginger hair, do you
have ginger hair?

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.410
Yeah, no you do not!

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.770
If you had ginger hair ginger nuts became
your nickname but anyhow they are super easy

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.640
to make if you want to have a go at making
them hit pause on the video when Chloe claps

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.100
her hands!

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.620
Yes so the ingredients are now on the screen
this is how you make ginger nuts (aka ginger

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.869
snaps).

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:20.060
So start to make these cookies, pre-heat your
oven to 190c or equivalent ok yes thanks Chloe

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.260
so whilst that is warming up get yourself
a big bowl where everything is going to come

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.040
together, start off by adding in your self
raising flour and then your ginger which of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.170
course you can tweak to your liking to add
as much or little gingerness as you like.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.290
What is the matter?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.340
I am not a bit shy now!

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:56.250
Anyhow bicarbonate of soda goes in next and
then give it an initial stir together and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.560
for some reason that made me flare my nostrils
and get quite excited whilst I was doing it,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.570
sorry about that!

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.259
Is that alright with you?

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.259
Good.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.480
So the next ingredient I added can you guess
what that was Chloe?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.209
Sugar, it was give me five!

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.752
She was not even here and knew I added sugar
in there I did it confidently and did not

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:24.309
look at the bowl but do not do that as I very
nearly did miss the bowl.

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:33.060
Get that stirred through, catalogue pose is
optional.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.069
Right I forgot to tell you a step, plonk your
butter into a bowl and rub together with fingers

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.010
and thumbs to create crumbs.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.389
Next up grab 2 tablespoons of what is this
Chloe?

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.489
What is that?

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.999
Yeah I just asked you that!

00:02:53.999 --> 00:03:02.480
2 tablespoons of golden syrup aka corn syrup.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.980
Mix it with a spoon and it will start to come
together.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.730
Form it into a ball with your hands it will
be kind of tacky but all good.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.739
With my big ginger ball of dough made it was
a case of dividing it up into smaller balls

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.620
so from that whole amount I managed to make
18 whole ginger nuts but roll them up into

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.279
small balls, put 9 on a baking tray until
well spread apart, but as you will see they

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:28.110
do actually enlarge!

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.659
Bake that in your oven for around 12-15 mins
until nice and golden brown and then allow

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.139
to cool and they will firm up a treat.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:42.959
That is it then guys there is your biscuit,
and I will have one too.

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.409
Ginger nut cookies or biscuits or snaps depending
on where you live.

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.879
They taste absolutely phenomenal just like
the real thing, did you like it?

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:05.119
Yes it tastes delicious so I hope you agree
they look fantastic they smell fantastic,

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:07.959
the studio now smells of ginger!

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:15.260
Rather than paint which is good!

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:26.689
So check out my other 2 videos, say I love
you, love you!

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:31.650
