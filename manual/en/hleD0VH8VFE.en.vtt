00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.290
Hi I'm chef Rainer Wickel and I'm here today
with Expert Village.com well we've fried the

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.450
chorizos and remember we've only been frying
these for about 2 to 3 minutes, we've made

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.170
them nice and brown around the side and now
what we need to do is we need to drain the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.250
fat out of the dish and add the hard apple
cider to it and start cooking it. So go ahead

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.140
and grab your skillet, remember it's a skillet
so it's pretty hot, the first thing we need

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:37.800
to do is go ahead and take the chorizo's out
of the frying pan and now what you want to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.340
do is you want to take all that access fat,
just drain it out of the pan. Now just leave

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.370
that little bit in there but just go ahead
and drain the access out of there and then

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:02.579
put it back onto the stove and now you want
to turn it down to low and put the chorizo's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:14.240
back into the pan.
And now we're going to take our hard apple

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.310
cider and you just want to put enough in there
so it'll come about half way up on the actual

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:29.049
chorizo themselves. And you want to get this
boiling so go ahead and make sure that the

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.270
mixture is boiling, now we need to take our
bay leaf and what we're going to do is we're

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.960
going to put one bay leaf in there. And this
is basically for flavoring, just throw it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.989
in there and now you can see it's already
starting to boil a little bit and then what

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:55.929
we need to do is just go ahead and cover it
and now we just need to let this simmer for

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.270
about 20 to 25 minutes. And that's going to
cook into the chorizos along with the bay

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.599
leaf and it's going to give it that nice flavor.
And this is how we cook our chorizo's in hard

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.420
apple cider.
