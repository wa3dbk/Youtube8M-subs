Hi!

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.190
Otto here for Bavarian Autosport.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.120
In this series of videos we are going to show
you how to access and remove the spare tire

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.110
on various BMW and MINI models that require
more than simply lifting the trunk floor and

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.730
pulling the spare out.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.440
Now if you have one of these models, we do
recommend that you practice these steps before

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.029
you actually have to use them.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.470
If your BMW or MINI does not have a spare
tire check, out our space saver spare kits

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:44.100
in our online store at BAVauto.com and as
always please subscribe to our Youtube channel

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.070

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.399

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.440
Now lets go ahead and check out the steps.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.059
Remove or fold back the trunk floor trim panel.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.870
Unscrew and remove the storage tray securing
nut.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.390
We suggest that you pre-loosen the nut before
you actually have to use it.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.040
We used a combination wrench and a wheel alignment
tool to loosen the nut so that we can then

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.980
remove it by hand.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.980
Pull the storage tray up and out.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.460
Use the spark plug socket and the wheel installation alignment
tool to loosen and remove the spare tire carrier

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.580
securing nut.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.180
This is the spare tire carrier lowering handle
cable and lock clip.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.900
Remove the jack for easier access to the lock
clip.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.860
Loosen the securing nut using the carrier
handle to turn the nut.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.240
To lower the spare tire carrier, pinch the
securing clip ends while pulling up on the

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:45.329
handle and cable.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.150
Carefully lower the spare tire carrier.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.390
Pull the complete spare tire tray and spare
tire out of the carrier frame.
