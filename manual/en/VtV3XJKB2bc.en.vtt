00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:09.370
All right, today on this 2009 Dodge Ram pickup,
we&amp;#39;ll be installing part number CG1000-7548,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.130
from CargoGlide.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.170
First thing we&amp;#39;re going to do is go ahead
and take the assembly and go ahead and place

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.170
it into the body of the pickup.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.720
We&amp;#39;ll go ahead and put it into place and
make sure we have it centered from left to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.029
right, and front to rear.

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.130
You want to keep it at least a half inch away
from everything around the bed of the truck.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.240
Once we have it centered the way we want it,
we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and slide it back.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:01:31.810
We&amp;#39;ll pull back on the lash, then pull
back on the cargo bed itself, leaving 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:02:17.500
the frame in 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:54.010
the 
bed of the pickup.
