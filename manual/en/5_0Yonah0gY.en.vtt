00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
We're gonna cook a little something.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.060
It's gonna be fast. It's gonna be easy.
It's gonna be delicious.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.540
So here's what you need: some bread, okay? 
You need a knife.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.440
You need a knife to cut your bread.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.840
I freeze my bread because I like it to stay fresh.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.980
If you're not an idiot, you also freeze your bread.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.340
If you don't freeze your bread, you're a fucking asshole, turn this video off.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.380
Sorry about that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.280
I didn't mean that.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.820
Gorgeous, eh!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.760
Here comes the magic.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.200
You guys are not gonna ever believe what's about to happen next.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.880
Cooking egg sandwich.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.360
You hear the crack of an egg shell, guess what?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.660
Oh, fuck.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.880
That wasn't supposed to happen.
[Hila giggles]

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.820
Okay guys, this is when you improvise.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.960
This is called creative problem solving.
Come over here.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.440
Now, you gotta make sure that the egg…

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.400
stays on the bread, so obviously we made a mistake.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.940
[Hila giggles]

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.160
So use— use a flat surface.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.040
But basically…
Here we go, this looks good.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.680
Okay we gotta keep it on.
We gotta make sure that the egg stays on the bread.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.540
Great.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.280
That— That worked out pretty good.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.020
We lost a little of the egg but we have the yolk still and, uh…

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.960
Well, we lost about half of the egg.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.880
But, uh, that's collateral damage.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.700
Here it is.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.340
So, bon appetit!

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.320
Nah, just kidding.
Just kidding you, guys.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.980
Okay. Boom. Oh, oh. Who thought of this?

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.700
What's happening?
What's he gonna do next?

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.100
What's he gonna do next?

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.720
How's he gonna cook that?
We gonna put it in the microwave.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.700
[glass vs. ceramic noise]

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.940
I don't know how long.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.220
So, you're waiting to see, uh.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.400
You wanna see how long is the cooking, so…

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.260
Uh, usually you got this kind of…

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.300
Iron plate to make sure you don't get cancer, so…

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.540
Which you wanna do is.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.560
You do like this.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.500
You do like this.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.180
Then you can see…

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.020
You can see what's going on, so…

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.300
You gotta stand there just to make sure it doesn't over cook, so…

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.380
Keep rocking.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.040
Just gotta keep moving

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.980
If you get the right, like, frequency you can really see like it's not even there. It's amazing!

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.660
Okay.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.380
[microwave ding sound]
[burp]

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.860
Here, give 'em a look at how it looks here.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.720
So, as you can see it doesn't look appetizing yet.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.260
I wouldn't eat that.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.620
But, uh, well, here's…

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.540
Here's the next little secret, here.
What's thi— OH!

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.760
Oh, cheese! Where this come from?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.720
Who put this out?
Cheeeese.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.540
Well, I like cheese, so…

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.140
[whispering] I think it's a lot.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.820
Imma put all of it
Imma put all the cheese.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.000
I don't really like egg, so I like to put a lot of cheese.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.880
So that I can't taste the egg.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.780
It's a little weird.
Most people think that's weird, but…

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.780
That's how I like to eat my eggs.
I cover it in so much cheese that I can't taste the egg anymore.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.860
Little strange

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.760
Some people say that's strange.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.380
I don't know.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.900
Let's go!

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.800
[microwave ding sound]
[Ethan imitates microwave]

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.120
Little salt.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.560
Little dab will do ya.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.980
There's a lot of stages in this.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.020
I thought it was easier. Fuck!
Here we go! Ready?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.360
It's very— It's really hot guys.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.800
Woooooo!

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.940
You wanna put it on its 'cause the bottom is real steamy and it's gonna get—

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.640
It's gonna get, uh, soggy if you don't flip.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.380
You want to melt.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.020
Melt the ingredients.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.240
Now clean up, like a good boy.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.320
You don't want to leave a mess for mommy.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.040
You wanna make sure the kitchen is nice when mommy gets home.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.180
Flip it over.
Keep it dry.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.200
Dear me to cut into it?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.660
You think it's gonna look good?
[Hila] Hmh.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.120
Oh you too.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.980
Let's cut into this dirty dude.
This dirty deed.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.580
It's a little chewy here, but take a look guys.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.560
HOOO!

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.220
Wow we!
[Hila] Wow.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.780
Guys!

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.600
Hold up, on sec here.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.140
Hashtag, uh, Emeril Lagasse

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.900
BAAAM!
Right?

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.380
Look at that!
That's a nice looking sandwich!

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.040
[female voice] Ooh boi!

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.040
Oh!

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.000
Lets's go ahead— Thanks for watching at home everybody.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.780
Let's go ahead and have a bite.
See how it turned out.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.140
Looks good.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.660
Alright. See you guys later.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.400
Bye bye now.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.520
See you later.
