00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.980
Lava Iris 501.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.420
Available now.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.780
Fancy a phablet but don't have the cash?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.820
Well, if you live in India or certain other
south Asian, Middle Eastern or African countries

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.650
then the Lava Iris 501 might be what you are
looking for.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.270
Let's start with the price: in India, the
Lava Iris 501 costs just under 10,000 Rupees,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.710
the equivalent to around â‚¬140 or $185.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.550
By western standards that isn't a lot of money,
but in India (for example) this is about two

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.650
month's average earnings, so it's a pretty
aspirational device.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.720
The headline feature with the Lava Iris 501
is the large 5" display.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.729
Despite being a big panel, the resolution
is only a modest 480 x 800 pixels, but that

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.900
should be good enough for most applications..
and it's a 16 million colour capacitive TFT

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.400
display, so it should be pretty decent when
it comes to quality.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.530
On the back is a 5 megapixel camera with a
0.3 megapixel one on the front for video calls.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.420
Inside is a dual-core 1GHz processor with
512MB of RAM and 4GB of onboard flash memory

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.670
plus a microSD slot.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.510
The Lava Iris 501 is a dual-SIM device, but
it only supports GSM 900 / 1800 and UMTS 2100

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.170
bands.. but that's good enough for most target
customers.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.731
It also supports 3.5G (HSPA) and 3G (UMTS)
data, plus WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS, and it

00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:50.780
also comes with a proximity sensor, G-sensor,
light sensor and gyroscope plus an FM radio

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.200
all the usual features that you would expect
to find in an Android 4.0 smartphone like

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.100
this.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.200
Inside is a 2100 mAh battery which Lava say
can give up to 7.8 hours talktime and 26 days

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.979
standby time.. on 2G, and that is probably
being highly optimistic.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.980
The Iris 501 measures 149 x 79 x 10.5mm.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.950
Some additional features include preloaded
games such as Asphalt HD and Cricket Fever,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.260
plus a multi-platform messaging application
called "hike".

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.180
And of course there are a mass of applications
available to download as well.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.120
OK, so it may not be the world's most powerful
smartphone, but bear in mind that the Samsung

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.410
Galaxy Note II costs around four times as
much.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.280
In India the Iris 501 is available to order
right now, but we don't know about other regions

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.079
at present.
