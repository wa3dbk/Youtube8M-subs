00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.121
Hey everybody.

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:05.611
Today's video is something a little different, 
so stay tuned!

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:20.271
So like I said, 
today's video is a little different than my other ones
好像方才說過，今天的錄像分享和以往的錄像內容有點不同

00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:23.790
I received a question last week during my faq videos
我上星期在"常問問題”的錄像分享專欄收到一個提問，

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.579
and I decided to hold it because I thought this question
我上星期在"常問問題”的錄像分享專欄收到一個提問，

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.978
was something that would be so great to talk about in a Monday video.
我覺得非常適合留待於"星期一錄像”節目中作出討論

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:34.077
So without further ado, here's the question:
事不宜遲，我讀出問題:

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:35.427
It says: Hey Kati,
嗨, 姬蒂,

00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:38.246
How much should you excuse someone with depression?

My little sister has been diagnosed

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:42.162
with severe depression and panic disorder.
我妹妹被診斷患上抑鬱症及驚恐症。

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.509
Understandably, she's not herself,
可以理解, 她不再是本來的自己，

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.809
she's short tempered and irritable,
她變得易怒和暴燥，同時報復心重和計較。

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.230
but also can be quite vindictive and mean.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.428
She used to be really sweet,
她原本很可親，

00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:52.411
and I understand this is part of her illness
我明白這是她的病癥，

00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:53.772
and I just let it go,
而且也嘗試放手，

00:00:53.772 --> 00:00:56.162
but she does it to our baby sister too
但連我們仍是嬰孩的幼妹也遭殃

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.650
(and she can't understand that it's not her fault)
(幼妹並沒有能力知道這並不是她的錯)。

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.577
As a family,
作為家人，

00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:03.334
we've been letting her take her frustrations out on everybody,
我們一直容忍她向我們發洩她的挫敗感，

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.659
and I wondered if that's the right thing to do?
我很困惑我們做得對嗎?

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.527
I have a very good relationship with her,
我一直和她有很好的關係，

00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:09.629
and often will gently tell her afterwards

if I think she's been particularly harsh to someone else.
事後我常會客氣地問她會否覺得自己有時對人粗暴無禮。

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:13.826
Sometimes it upsets her,

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:16.870
and I worry that I'm just adding to her negative voices.
我擔心我這樣做會增加她對自己的負面聲音

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.478
Is it best to let her know when she's being hurtful?
當她傷害人時讓她知道，是否最好的做法?

00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:22.346
Or to give her a break from any criticism
還是讓她免受批評，

00:01:22.346 --> 00:01:25.433
in order to build herself up against her negative voices?
從而幫助她從負面的聲音中重新振作?

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:26.466
I love her so much,

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.443
and I want to do what's best to help her,
我希望能盡力幫到她，

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:31.684
but I don't want our baby sister to feel hurt either. Help!
但我又不想幼妹受傷害。

00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:34.178
Now I thought this was a great question
這是個大難題，

00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:36.282
because of the fact that I often
因為我經常要和正在面對情緒困擾的人說話。

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:38.135
speak mainly to the people themselves
因為我經常要和正在面對情緒困擾的人說話。

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:40.135
who are struggling with the mental illness.
因為我經常要和正在面對情緒困擾的人說話。

00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:42.954
And I don't always talk to how the family can feel.

00:01:42.954 --> 00:01:45.844
And I know many of us have family members or loved ones

00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:47.334
who struggle with mental illness.

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:51.436
And how much is too much to let them get away with?

00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:53.005
That's a great question, right?
這是一個大問題，對嗎?

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:54.524
And in my practice,
在我的實務裡，

00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:56.776
I would take a three-step approach.
我會採用一個三步的取向

00:01:56.776 --> 00:01:59.243
The first being family therapy.
首先是家庭治療

00:01:59.243 --> 00:02:02.054
The second being externalising the problem.
第二是將問題外化

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:05.666
And the third would be seeking your own personal therapy.
第三是尋找合適你的個人輔導

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.524
Now the first. Going back to the first
首先回到家庭治療，

00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:08.849
Seeking family therapy.
首先回到家庭治療，

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.856
Why would I recommend that?
我為什麼這樣建議?

00:02:10.856 --> 00:02:13.703
I would recommend family therapy to people because it gives you
這是因家庭治療能讓你們

00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:16.804
a safe place to talk about the things you struggle to talk about
有一個安全的地方去講

00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:18.153
in your everyday life.
你們每天日常生活中的掙扎

00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:20.073
We don't often have times in our lives
我們通常沒有時間大家坐在一起，

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.926
where we're sitting around together,
我們通常沒有時間大家坐在一起，

00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:24.594
where everybody feels safe to talk about things,
每個人都可安心傾談，

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:26.023
where there is a mediator,
有調解員，

00:02:26.023 --> 00:02:27.508
someone like your therapist,
例如是你的治療師，

00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:29.166
is there to help make sure

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.079
everyone gets heard and no one gets stepped on.

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.347
We don't have that setup in our regular lives.
我們的日常生活並沒有這些安排，

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:35.905
And that's why it's important
因此要去尋找和創造這種機會，

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.967
to seek it out and create it.
因此要去尋找和創造這種機會，

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:41.158
Find a therapist that none of you've seen before,
找一個你們都沒有見過

00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:43.901
that sees families and deals with depression
而在處理家庭和抑鬱症有經驗的治療師

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:45.624
It would be a great experience for all of you
能有地方安心地抒發

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:49.146
and a safe place to vent about what's going on in your family.
家庭正經歷的事情會是一種很好的經驗。

00:02:49.146 --> 00:02:52.335
Now the second thing. Externalising the problem
現在到第二步，把問題外化

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:55.379
I know this sounds silly, but it can really really help the person
我想聽起來有點怪，但這做法

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.088
who's struggling with the mental illness, if we do this.
對正在和精神病搏鬥的人是很有用的

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:02.195
Externalising the problem means that instead of saying to them,
把問題外化是指，不要說

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:03.727
"You made me feel this way" or
”你令我感到這樣” 或是

00:03:03.727 --> 00:03:04.997
"When you did that,
”當你這樣做，

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:07.446
I felt terrible and that was really hurtful".
我的感覺很差、覺真的很受傷害”

00:03:07.446 --> 00:03:10.756
Instead of having those kinds of arguments/conversations,
不要作出爭辯，

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.939
it can really help to say, "You know,
可以說”你知道嗎，

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.433
when the depression came into our family, I really struggled.
自從抑鬱闖入我們的家庭之後，我真的很掙扎，

00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:18.844
And now the depression is everywhere.
現在抑鬱的影響好像無處不在，

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:20.665
It's ruining our relationship."
正在摧毀我們的關係。”

00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:23.511
It can help the person not feel so at fault
這有助當事人不會覺得全都是自己的錯，

00:03:23.511 --> 00:03:26.994
And it can also help them see relief from their problem
也能幫助他/她從問題中解脫出來

00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:30.467
and realise it's not them, it's their depression.
和看見他/她不是問題，抑鬱才是問題。

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:31.726
Now the third thing,
現在到尋找個人輔導

00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:34.032
is seeking your own personal therapy.
現在到尋找個人輔導

00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:36.913
And the reason why I recommend this to my clients,
我會作此建議,

00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:38.701
if I'm seeing them in a family setting,
如果當我以家庭的方式見他們時，

00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:41.166
is if the family setting isn't enough.
看見單靠家庭介入並不足夠。

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:42.905
It's very very normal
感得心力交瘁、

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:45.230
to feel exhausted, to be frustrated,
感到挫敗、感到不知所措、

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.124
to not know what to do,
to almost feel trapped because

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:50.376

and really tiring.

struggle with mental illness
家中有人要和精神病搏鬥，是非常耗心力的，

not only for the person with the mental illness.
