00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.340
Hi, I'm Chef Rainer Wickel, and I'm here today
with ExpertVillage.com. Well, we've taken

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.720
the bananas out the mixture, and now we need
to get ready to make our final sauce. Now,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.010
what we're going to do here is we're actually
going to be adding a (1/4) quarter cup of

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.311
dark rum. Now you need to make sure that you
have a rum that's at least forty percent (40%)

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.619
alcohol, because we are going to be setting
this on fire. And just because of the fact

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.539
that we are setting this on fire, you need
to be very careful. Now if the sauce is hot

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.649
enough, a lot of times, when you put the alcohol
in there, it actually will ignite by itself.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.140
But most of the time, you're going to have
to ignite it yourself. And just because of

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.449
the fact that we are going to be lighting
this, you need to be very careful that you

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:49.460
don't burn yourself. &lt;p&gt; So, we have our sauce
in here, and it's nice and warm. Everything's

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.961
mixed in there really well. So, what we need
to do now is just go ahead and take your (1/4)

00:00:54.961 --> 00:01:04.110
quarter cup of dark rum and pour it in there.
As you can see, it didn't ignite. Now remember,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.230
when you come along and do this, light the
match away from the pan, because this is going

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:19.220
to ignite. Now be very careful, put it in
there, and there you can see it ignited. Now

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.590
what we need to do is we just need to let
the alcohol cook off on here. You just want

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.900
to go ahead and let that cook down until the
flames subside. And once the flames subside,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.490
then we know that the sauce is ready. Now
if you see that the sauce is still a little

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.240
bit too thin, go ahead and just cook it up
a little bit longer, because you want to make

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.840
sure that it has a nice syrupy consistency
to it. Now remember, you're dealing with open

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.020
flames right here, so you want to make sure
that you don't burn yourself. So, as you can

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.640
see, it's still burning a little bit. But
once it stops flaming, then go ahead and take

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.760
a spoon, and just go ahead and mix it through.
Now we want to make sure that it's a nice,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.800
thick syrup. And this usually takes about
1 to 2 minutes until the flames actually subside.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.780
So be careful also when you're doing it near
an oven, because remember these flames are

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.920
actually going to go up pretty high. So you
want to make sure you don't burn anything

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.670
around it. A lot of times you might also want
to just take it away from the stove and then

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.230
go ahead and light it. And as you can see
right now, the flames have subsided. So what

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.750
we want to do now is we just want to let this
go ahead and mix. And it's still a little

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.819
bit watery, so what we want to do is we just
want to let this cook down until it's got

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.910
a nice, syrupy texture. And this is how we
make the final step in preparing our sauce

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.580
for making bananas foster.
