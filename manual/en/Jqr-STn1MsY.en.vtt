00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.720
Stitch number 75 is a stitch that is not listed
as what it's named in your manual, but I like

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.599
to use it for when I am machine quilting with
my walking foot using straight-line stitches.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.610
That little extra dot that shows on the picture
at the top and bottom are locking stitches,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.900
but not all in the same hole.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.380
They actually stitch forward a little bit
and then it automatically starts going in

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.190
the direction you are going and so first,
I'm going to switch over to a walking foot

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.480
since this machine is suited with a walking
foot.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.830
To put it on, I do like to put my thumb between
the foot and the arm that needs to go around

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.130
the screw and then attach it.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.230
Now, since this foot is usually has a place
that you can't put your thread down, a little

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.870
trick is to actually hold your bobbin thread,
take one stitch and don't hold on to your

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.870
top thread.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.239
See how it kind of dragged itself down?

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.579
Then take your bobbin thread you're still
holding onto, make a little bar across it

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.100
and drag underneath the presser foot.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.069
That will drag the top thread down below any
foot that doesn't have the little groove on

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.069
the side.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:09.350
Here is what I want to do with this stitch.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.380
It is set up.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.350
Go ahead and reset with stitch number 75.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.649
It's going to start off with teeny tiny stitches.

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.069
Very short two, three, four, five and then
it takes off.

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:27.240
The setting is about 2 1/2 mm long, so if
you are machine quilting somewhere between

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.670
2 1/2 and 3 is a nice stitch length to do.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399
Then, it's going to carry you down.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.070
Let's say you're stitching in the ditch or
you're row stitching, but you're stopping

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.139
at a certain place.

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.609
Instead of you trying to make little tiny
stitches yourself by lowering that stitch

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.270
length down, all you have to do is touch the
reverse button one time.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.049
That's going to tell the machine you're ready
to end and it will take that one, two, three,

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.329
four, five, seven stitches at the end.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.279
I've just kept my foot on the foot control
until it stopped completely but the distance

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.659
of stitching is very, very short.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.459
Those little tiny stitches, what allows me
to do is come in here clip this thread right

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.870
at the very tip and not have to worry about
those stitches coming loose ever.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.150
Have you ever tried taking little tiny stitches
out?

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.150
Well, yeah.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.400
It's just not easy.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.069
This stitch has built in tiny stitches that
you don't ever have to worry about coming

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.209
loose.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.930
Once you've done it once and completed the
stitch by using the reverse button at the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.879
end and finish through all the locking stitches,
it is ready to stitch again at your new place

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.879
you start.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.590
Just go ahead, stitch on down.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.700
Starts little tiny locking stitches [inaudible
00:02:36] to the regular stitch length and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.269
once again, press the reverse button when
you need to have it stopped.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.890
Let it finish and lift out and clip right
at your stitch.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.010
That is stitch number 75.
