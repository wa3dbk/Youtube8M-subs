instantaneously and you can enjoy it for
almost a week but if you want to keep it

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.060
a little longer

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.600
you can cut this carrot into sticks rather than grateD because I want to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.779
make it very simple here I've got grated
carrot

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.890
ok so once you grate the carrot just
take it in a bowl in this add cumin

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.809
seeds if you want you can roast the cumin seeds and add in this we're going to add

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.440
julliennes of ginger, chilli powder you
know just crushed or chopped garlic

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.260
mustard powder and vinegar, lots of
vinegar in this put it in and now you

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.379
know just mix all of this once you mix
this then we're going to add salt ok

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.040
that should be good enough and just
mix this and this carrot instant

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.560
accompaniment with your rice even when you make you know any rolls of a wraps or

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.759

this in the western side they use

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.310
pickled cucumber or things like that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.470

the carrot into sticks and make it add

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.909

about this achar is you get a mild

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.860
sweetness from the carrot and the nice
sourness and all the flavors the garlic
