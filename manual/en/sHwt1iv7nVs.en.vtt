IAN LOVEALL: Hi. I'm Ian Loveall with Expert
Village and today we're looking at wall painting,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
more specifically murals. So we've already
gone over some of the strokes, and now we're

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.190
going to go to the wall and look at how some
of those strokes are applied. So for this,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:24.820
we started with a basic stone finish over
the whole wall using the rag. Again, really

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.650
easy, you just dip it in the paint, scrunch
it up, drag it, pull it, smear it until you

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.510
get a nice random finish that roughly resemble
stone and then from here on out, everything

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.010
you see was done with these two brushes right
here. This one is a flat, synthetic sable

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.960
watercolor brush, it has a very, very soft,
soft bristle, and this can be used to produce

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.070
everything you see here. You can run that
side, and it can do all these nice, little

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:13.830
delicate wispy vines, stroke it at an angle
to create all these different leaves, and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.170
then you can actually load the brush with
different colors as we saw earlier, say half

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:26.150
the brush in white, half the brush in yellow,
and then just go through and create this little

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:36.270
fiddle-neck bloom here, and then white and
lavender to create the flowers in the vase,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:46.810
different shades of green you can create the
leaves you see here. And then, for the real

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.579
small stuff, just grab a smaller brush, dab
in the tiny little buds, some of the filaments

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:03.430
in the flower, highlights in the dove's eyes,
and some of the smaller vines we see here.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:12.850
So, as you can see, there's a whole lot you
can do with just a rag and two brushes, nothing

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.530
to it. And there you have it, the basics of
mural painting. We've covered the materials

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.470
you're going to need, some of the inspiration
to help get the wheels turning, and some of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.950
the techniques to apply them. So, grab a brush
and run amuck.
