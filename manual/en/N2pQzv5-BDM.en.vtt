Well you're watching Fox 17 this morning.  I lost my weather clicker

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.159
Just few moments ago. Rhett Walker was playing in it, and I misplaced the thing and I don't even

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:16.289
Okay, so I found it said you've got experience in weather. Yeah, I've been known to do whether a couple times is right

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.659
Well, it's my first but. Yeah, the bands agreeing with you

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.350
Yeah, okay, so I'm gonna step out the way and Rhett's gonna do the weather for you, okay, yeah

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.789
What we're looking at what is uh. We got

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.989
67 degrees, humidity about 76%. I click this thing

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.680
I look right here. See this is what's confusing about this isn't it?

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.450
Well we got the 67 degrees

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.120
What we're looking at is a there's green clouds coming up through Little Rock and St Louis

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
We're gonna have some light rain and maybe mixed with an almost heavy rain, that's gotta be yellow

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.189
You don't really have a yellow square. Oh, yeah, I don't know why y'all don't have that.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.600
I would if I was doing this

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.680
You watch out that rain going up into

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.119
8;51 and probably past that it looks like we got a flugel valve coming down

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.210
Maybe it might go into the inner center

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.500
coming into Nashville

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.420
I don't really know. I'm just hitting this button

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.110
I would say I would say if I were you I would just watch out for the green stuff

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.600
It's it's headed away

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.909
North Carolina. It's gonna come down there my grandparents live in Charlotte so watch out for the green green clouds out in Charlotte grandma

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.820
Anyways, here's your day planner. I mean. Yeah, nobody needs to know about 6:00 a.m.. It's already past

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.349
I don't know. I'm still up there but 9:00 a.m.. sixty six going into 72 right here and after 72

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.779
