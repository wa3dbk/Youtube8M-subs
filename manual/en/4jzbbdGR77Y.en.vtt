00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.440
(upbeat music)

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.470
- Hey everyone, I'm Mindy

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.600
from Cute Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.460
And Rylan's here today to help me

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.240
teach you guys the CGH Split Headband.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.740
Now, before we begin the headband,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.010
if you guys love our channel,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.780

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.510
and subscribe to our channel right here,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.920
so we know that you're
watching and love it.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.320
Now, on to the headband.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.150
Okay, you can see that I've just begun

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.210
by parting her hair from ear to ear,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.560
and pulling the rest of her
hair back into a ponytail.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.660
She has some whispies on
the front of her face,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.723
so I wet the hair down just slightly

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:40.960
right here in the front.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.430
I'm gonna by the ear and just

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.240
part off a small section of hair,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.540
and once I have that section in place,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.390
I'm gonna secure it with an elastic.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.040
And I like the elastics
that match her hair,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.290
just so they hide a little
bit better as we progress.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.420
Now I'm gonna create a second section,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.190
just slightly higher
than that first section.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.950
And again, secure it with an elastic.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.170
And this is where we begin splitting.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.530
So we're going to take
that second section,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.250
and split it in half.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800
Take the first section and pull it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.770
straight through the middle, like this.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.870
And then you can just
throw these back over

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.240
and secure em with a clip,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.430
so that they're kinda held out of the way.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.660
And we're going to create a third section.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.350
Now, our third section is going to include

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.300
the ends of the first section.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220
And now we're just going to repeat

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.830
pretty much the same process,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.560
so we're going to split this one open,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.260
we're gonna take those ends
from the second section,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.330
straight through, flip this back over,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.800
clip it out of the way,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.431
and create a fourth section
that includes those ends.

00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:58.390
(upbeat music)

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.550
When I get to this last one,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.680
I'm gonna go ahead and split it again,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.290
and run that last section through it,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.160
just like we have before,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.980
but on this one, I'm just gonna take

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.930
all of em at the very end and kind of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.960
put an elastic right here

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.730
and secure them together.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.970
Now, you'll notice that
I placed the elastics

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.100
towards to back of that part line,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.740
cause I want em sitting back
on her forehead a little bit.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.440
The rest of the hair you can just release

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.240
and using a couple bobby pins,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.100
you can just secure
that against the scalp,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.780
and you should be able to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.110
pretty much hide that last elastic

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.590
underneath the hair.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.720
Now, this is cool and it looks great,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.720
but we're gonna really
take it to another level

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.360
by going back and pulling
on that back strand,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.030
so on that back piece of hair,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.200
we're just gonna give it a little pop

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.040
by tugging it and pancaking it.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.353
(upbeat music)

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.840
And what that does is give it a really fun

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.950
almost kind of like a
little bit of a crown effect

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.520
that pops off the top
of her head right there.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.270
Let's do the final spin...
