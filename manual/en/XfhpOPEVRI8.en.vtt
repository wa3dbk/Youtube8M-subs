For making kachalu pickle boil them first.

00:01:14.862 --> 00:01:30.978
Place the kachalu in pressure cooker and add 2-2.5 cup water.

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:42.572
Turn on the gas and when it simmers once reduce the flame and boil on low flame for some more time.

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:54.255
Boil for 6-7 minutes more.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.846
Take out the kachalu from pressure cooker so that they get cooled quickly.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:32.557
Don’t over boil then keep them little hard.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:53.302
Make the kachalu cool properly. Meanwhile make masala for them.

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:59.085
Take oil in a pan and let it become hot completely.

00:03:02.738 --> 00:03:12.808
Mustard oil is bit spicy and by heating its spiciness gets dissolved.

00:03:12.994 --> 00:03:21.104
Oil is hot now; turn off the flame and let the oil get bit cooled.

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:27.601
 Meanwhile peel the kachalu’s.

00:03:29.695 --> 00:03:41.566
 Peel it nicely.

00:03:51.884 --> 00:03:54.813
Now cut the peeled kachalu in to pieces.

00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:59.135
Cut into medium size pieces.

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:07.724
Now we will make pickle from these pieces.

00:04:07.837 --> 00:04:12.894
Add carom seeds in oil and roast for few seconds.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:23.719
Add kalonji, fenugreek seeds as well and roast slightly.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:33.003
Now add kachalu pieces in the pan.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:50.346
Add asafoetida, turmeric powder, red chilly powder, mustard powder and salt.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:56.338
Mix all ingredients nicely.

00:04:56.627 --> 00:05:03.487
Keep stirring and cook for 1-2 minutes on low flame.

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:19.996
After 2 minutes turn off the gas and place it on shelf so that it gets cooled quickly.

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:34.451
When pickle gets cooled; add vinegar and mix nicely.

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:40.751
Pickle is ready; take it out in a bowl.

00:05:46.474 --> 00:05:48.617
Kachalu pickle is ready.

00:05:48.953 --> 00:06:00.873
This pickle can be eaten now itself but the real taste will come after 3 days when all the spices will be absorbed by kachalu.

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:09.223
 It has a shorter shelf life so eat it within 10-15 days only.

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:15.733
Store in any container made with
glass or plastic and use a clean

00:06:15.734 --> 00:06:21.270
spoon for taking out the pickle
whenever you feel like eating it.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:34.599
Shake the container before eating the pickle because all spices settles at the bottom.

00:06:38.926 --> 00:06:46.405
