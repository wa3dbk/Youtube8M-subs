00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.580
and H-4565 Two Line Monarch 1136

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.710
are great for quick and accurate price
marking on inventory and merchandise.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.940
The H-992 allows users to print up to
8 characters per line

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.230
with numbers and symbols on the first
line and numbers,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.430
symbols, and units of measure on the second line. The H-992 is perfect for printing pricing,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.110
SKUs or dates on the top line and prices
on the bottom line.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.130
The H-4565 also lets you print

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.329
up to 8 characters on
both lines but the H-4565

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.700
can print both letters and numbers on
the top line and numbers,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.680
symbols and units of measure on the
bottom line, making it ideal for printing

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.000
messages and words

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.469
or SKUs on the top and price on the
bottom. Before ordering,

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.020
please check the character band diagram
on uline.com

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.110
to determine if the H-992 or H-4565

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.820
is right for you. 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.899
With durable molded plastic bodies that withstand rough, repeated use

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.899
and an ergonomic pistol-grip design, the H-992

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.009
and H-4565 make labeling quick

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.949
and comfortable while increasing
operator efficiency. 

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:32.700
To use, push the release button and open the cover completely.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.380
You'll hear a click when it's fully open.
A free ink roller is included with your gun.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.390
Hold the roller by the stem and snap it
into place.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.700
To load a new roll of Monarch 1136
labels,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.220
tear off the first 10 inches of labels
and liner.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.440
Then, peel off and discard 12 labels from the liner to prevent jamming

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.460
and place the roll between the hubs and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.200
snap it into place.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.179
Drape the liner across the labeler, 
centered so it hangs about six to seven

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.769
inches past the peel bar and close the
cover. Squeeze and hold the trigger

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.120
and feed the label strip under the roller.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.040
Holding the strip in place, squeeze the
trigger repeatedly

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.810
until the label strip feeds through the
rear of the gun.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.730
Remove any loose labels. 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.180
Now, you're ready to set the character bands. Pull out the knob until the indicator

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.799
frames the correct band

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.310
and twist until you see the character
you want to print appear

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.250
as a black character with a white
background. For the top line of H-4565,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.599
use the character key on the side of the
gun to determine the character

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.269
conversion.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.459
For example, to print an "N," you would
select a "6."
