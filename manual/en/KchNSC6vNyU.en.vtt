-Hey, everyone.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.760
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.240
and today I'm going
to show you how

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.300
to do a double laced
braid into a side braid.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.770
So I first saw this one
on a picture of Rihanna,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.860
and I thought it was
really, really cool.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.860
And I've since had
people send it to me,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.020
so I'm going to go ahead
and do a tutorial on it,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.600
and I think you'll enjoy.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.650
So I've parted her hair where
her natural part line falls,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.233
which is slightly
to the left, and I'm

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.110
going to take a
little section of hair

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.780
right here near the front top.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.330
And I have just a lightly,
lightly misted her hair

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
with water just because
she has a tendency

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.050
to have a lot of
fly aways, and I'm

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.220
going to start my lace braid.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.980
Now, lace braid means I'm
only picking up from one side,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.560
and if you'll watch
my hands you'll

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.380
notice that I'm not picking up
hair from-- I'm only picking up

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.030
hair from this side of the
braid, not the right side.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.590
And I'm just going to
try to keep the braid as

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.700
close to her forehead
as humanly possible--

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.080
her hairline along her forehead.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.120
And you'll see when I
get a little farther what

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.750
I mean by that.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.740
Angle kind of straight
down initially,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.960
because if you start
angling back at this point

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.720
it won't land where you want
to ultimately finish the braid.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.580
So if you look at the
picture of Rihanna,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.100
she is wearing this braid
with her bright, red hair,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.840
and it kind of goes
over her ears, which

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.575
is why angling the braid
down like so because I want

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:38.862
it to hang right over
the top of her ears.

00:01:38.862 --> 00:01:42.610
And we're just going to
continue to braid it.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.340
And now when I hit
that top of her ear

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.210
where I want that
placement to be,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.190
now I'm just going to
go and run the braid

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.010
along the nape of her
neck-- her hairline--

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.270
along the back of her neck.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.050
We'll just keep going.

00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:17.230
And-- oops, sorry.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.680
So much pressure to
braid while I'm videoing.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.130
You can see that I've
gone down over her ear.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.660
Now I'm kind of evening
the braid out a little bit.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.980
Just taking it along more
of the nape of her neck.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.972
Keep turning her.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.205
Keep just adding in pieces.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.980
We're almost done.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.760
And when we get around
to the other side

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.770
you'll see that I've
already-- I'll show you.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.330
So I'm on my last piece here.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.940
Now you can see that I've
brought the braid all the way

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.430
around, almost to
her opposite ear.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.290
Now, I've already done the
braid on this side, which

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.820
just went straight down
over the top of her ear,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.920
and then we're going
to connect the two.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.947
Now to connect them, what
I do is grab two pieces

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:30.905
and hook them together.

00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:37.450
I'm going to unbraid
this a little bit,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.680
and just grab a
piece of that hair.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.640
So I have two strands in this
hand, two stands now hooked

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.530
together, and two
strands over here.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.530
And basically, you're just
going to start a regular braid,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.060
and this is how you just kind
of form them into one braid.

00:03:59.628 --> 00:04:04.572
And we'll go all the way down
until we run out of here,

00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:06.530
and then, of course,
secure it with an elastic.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.430
Do you have that clear one?

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.540
I'm going to use a clear
elastic on the end that

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.140
will blend into her hair better.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.300
Then you can come up here
and loosen it a little bit so

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.931
it's not--

00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:21.430
And then if you
have little wispies,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.860
like she has baby
hair right here,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.500
you can just bobby pins them
in, or just reach them up

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.220
and took them in.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.450
And there you go.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.530
So we have this
really fun braid.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.330
You can see the lace braid
goes all the way around.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.570
Another way to do it too
is to just-- once you

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.420
get to this point, you can just
gently pull down on the hair

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.166
right here and here,
and that will just

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.790
loosen it up from
the head a little bit

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.760
too and help it sit
over the ears better.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.830
But there you go.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.490
I think it looks really good.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.520
She actually wears
this one quite often,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.110
and we always get comments
on it when she's wearing it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.630
because it's really
a fun, unique look.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.070
We hope you guys enjoy,
and we'll see you later.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.620
-Bye.
