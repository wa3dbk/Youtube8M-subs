♪♫♪♫..........[Music playing]

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.720
AKG's DMS70 comes in both a quattro version

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.760
which is four channels

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.770
with XLR audio balanced out,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.170
and a dual version that's 2 channels,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.060
with TRS balanced out.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.960
The real big story here is uncompressed,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.740
high-quality, 24-bit, digital audio.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.140
Pretty incredible.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.270
When you're working down in the 500 600

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.270
MHz audio bands, in order to squeeze

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270
the audio into those small frequency sections

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.550
you have to compress the sound, and that's the

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.730
way all wireless microphones have been done

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.950
for many many years.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.360
But up in the 2.4 GHz band, we can

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.560
go uncompressed.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.530
That means 24-bit, 48K audio,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.400
uncompressed, super high quality

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.080
and that's what AKG represents is quality.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.260
These are also available at an incredible price.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.820
So let's take a quick look at 'em.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.600
First of all, we have a D5 capsule on the handheld.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.080
Handheld, very convenient, very easy to hold.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.450
And what's also easy is matching this transmitter up with the receiver.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.530
I simply press a button and the transmitter and the receiver talk to each other.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.810
Set a channel, agree on a channel and it's locked in.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.170
If I shut the transmitter off,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.820
the receiver remembers that so that the next

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.600
time I turn the transmitter on,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.930
that same transmitting channel is used.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.480
We can run up to 8 systems.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.040
That would be 4 of the duals,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.440
or 8 of the quattro systems.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.790
They also have...

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.690
a beltpack.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.230
Beltpack, again, fairly standard,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.390
will remember the channels

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.020
so they'll communicate together. Just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.890
press the button and lock 'em in.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.840
One of the really cool features

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.280
of the D70 system

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.150
is that if you shut off the receiver,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.160
the transmitter will automatically shut off.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
So there's bi-directional communication going on here.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.980
So that's really cool. You just shut

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.950
off the receivers and, boom, the transmitters also get shut off,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.000
so you don't have a battery problem on that.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.740
So you've got high-quality audio with the D70,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.610
incredible price point,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.850
the ability to go with a 4 channel version here

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.759
you can rack up a couple of these for a total of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.669
your 8 channels.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.660
The systems come, typically, with 1 tansmitter

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.360
on a dual, and 2 transmitters on a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.990
uh, quattro system. So it's easy to add

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.770
transmitters. They're very reasonably priced.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.200
So it's expandable,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.040
high-quality and affordable, from AKG

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.000
