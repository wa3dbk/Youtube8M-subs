Hi, I'm Gary for Expert Village. I'd like
to show you how to edit your signatures, not

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.590
only create new ones, but, possibly to add
in text or to just change the look of the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.060
signatures. So, we go back into Tools, and
Options, Mail Format and then in our signature.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.630
And, here we have our list of signatures for
new messages. I'm going to go ahead, and we

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.180
see that the Clown Animation has been chosen.
I'm going to click on Signatures. And, here's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.442
my list and, we see that we have the option
to Edit. So, I click on Edit, and again we

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:48.320
are only viewing the picture. And, we are
really being prompted to add in text. So,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.510
if we want to change and edit the picture,
we are going to have to go into our Advanced

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.210
Edit again and open up the Microsoft Word
Editor and create the HTM file. But, if we

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.320
just want to add in text, we can just go ahead
and put in text by clicking on top and hitting

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.150
the enter key. And, then, while we are on
top of the image, we can put something in

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:19.510
like Clown Productions.com. And, of course,
we can go ahead and make it nicer. We can

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:28.150
make it look more like a logo. We can change
our font around and maybe make a little bit

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.229
of a Bold Font, Crazy Harold. We'll put it
like that. So, here we have our image and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.729
it has some text on top. And, now we can go
ahead and use our signature more, instead

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.229
of just a kind of cute funny image, but actually
as a kind of logo or something that we can

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.270
really use as a calling card. And, we can
obviously add in more text, phone numbers,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.910
addresses. But, that's how you would go ahead
and edit your signature and put in text. And,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.610
of course, once this is saved, it will appear
in your emails just the same way as the plain

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.160
image did.
