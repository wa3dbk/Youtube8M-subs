00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.100
So how to keep your dreads clean?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.860
Well, definitely the main way is to shampoo
your dreads and your scalp regularly.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.770
For some that's once every week and for others
that's once every two weeks, and for some

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.649
others that's about once a month, but either
way you go you definitely want to be sure

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.260
to keep the actual dreads clean and your scalp
clean.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.309
One way is to use a non-residue shampoo.

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.829
A lot of times to maintain dreads you're using
gel, you're using wax, so when it's time to

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.170
shampoo your hair, you definitely want to
use something that's not going to add to that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.020
whole buildup, so you want to use something
that's going to get all of that buildup and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.579
all of that residue off.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:01:00.520
A great homemade way of coming up with a non-residue
shampoo is to use simple baking soda.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.230
If you take four tablespoons of baking soda
and put them in two cups of water, you can

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.100
make your own non-residue cleanser and you
just simply put it in a pitcher or a measuring

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.470
cup and just pour it right over your head,
just before you shampoo.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.530
Some people like to put it in and put a cap
on it and leave it for about 20 minutes.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.280
That will cause all the dirt and everything
from the scalp to come to the surface and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.280
then from there you can actually do your real
shampoo.You can also use vinegar, whether

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.070
you use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.250
They both work well and they both work great.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.020
You could definitely use a vinegar rinse,
just before you shampoo also, and that will

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.729
kind of help eliminate some of the odor and
some of the itchiness off the scalp.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.500
You also within your baking soda and water
combination, you can use distilled water with

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.590
your baking soda.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.960
You can also use a tablespoon of tea tree
or a tablespoon of rosemary, and those natural

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.600
oils will kind of help fight whatever element
is going on in your dreads at the time.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.140
Tea tree is great for your scalp.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.990
It'll keep the scalp from being itchy and
it also is a great cleanser, and the rosemary

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.440
will fight mold and dandruff.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.880
So there are some great things that you have
right there at your house that can keep your

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.490
dreads nice and clean, and your scalp nice
and healthy, but it's definitely recommended

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.560
that you shampoo your dreads and keep them
clean.
