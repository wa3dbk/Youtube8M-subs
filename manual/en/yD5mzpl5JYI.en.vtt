00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.020
Ricky Siglar: Let's just kind of hypothetically
say here we've got this guy head on on the

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.219
center or maybe he's in the shade inside and
you two, left guard and center, are responsible

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.139
maybe for this down guy and maybe the mic
linebacker.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.500
Somebody right here and the best way to block
him is instead of saying maybe you try to

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.700
shoot through and get him, because that mic
is going to weave.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.900
There's no way you're going to get through
to block him is that you two say, "Hey, we're

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.790
responsible for this guy and that guy."

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.260
And then you got to ask yourself the question,
"What's the best way for us to block these

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.260
two guys."

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.059
So that's what we call zone blocking.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.399
In this particular case, if this guy is lined
up here and he's stacked right there or maybe

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.079
he's changed a little bit over just to tap.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.269
Then you guys, whatever your call may be,
but you want to come off.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:56.010
You want to step with your inside foot, step
toward this crotch, okay and then be out a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.355
little bit more because you want to get a
piece of him.

00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:00.355
Guards you got to step with him.

00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:04.739
You got to be quick - you guys hit this guy
and you got to keep your head up and read

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.910
because you know what, you got read you're
looking for a guy and you got to see this

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.910
one.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.870
You push back until you get to him.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.330
Now the key to this - what makes it successful
is being able to see.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.280
You have to have your heads up on this and
see what this guy is doing, because guess

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
what?

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.730
If you don't look and you think he's going
to be scrapping, he might come back side and

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.790
these guys aren't paying attention.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.630
You two are blocking this guy blowing him
off and he runs back there and makes the play.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.770
So both of you have to have your heads up
and you might have to come off if he shoots

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.640
this gap or if he plays over the top, the
center is going to have come off and eventually

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.950
take him.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.000
The biggest mistake guys do in zone blocking
is that they're in such a hurry to get this

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.060
guy, they forget to take care of the most
important which is the down guy and this guy

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.373
at fly off is blocking and he'll fly off and
he'll go free and make the play.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:52.330
So you guys have to remember to blow him back
first, just depending on what the backer is

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.420
doing and where he's at and how he's reacting
is how long you stay on this block to come

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.420
up.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.420
He shoots now you got to come up.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.940
If he blows over and you could blow him back
and then come off and get him.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.560
That's what you want to do.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:13.109
So let's do a couple of quick drill to simulate
this zone combo type of blocking.

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.109
Going back to your linebacker.

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:19.239
You guys want to back out a little bit if
you don't mind.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.420
I'll hold the bag.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.733
I'm going to tell him - I'm going to give
difference.

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:26.733
You guys ready.

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:27.733
I guess this would be a DR.

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:28.733
Okay, so we're going to DR and we're going
up to the backer, right?

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:33.400
So it means you got to keep your heads up
to see what's happening.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.189
Down, set, hut.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.840
All right, it's game on.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.700
It's good.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.299
You really want to get movement on this guy.

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.030
The ideal thing is we can blow this guy back
and take this lap.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.030
That's beautiful.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.290
We got to knock this guy back.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.609
We don't want to just get two bodies on him
and no movement.

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.189
If he's still right here we got two guys on
him and this guy comes up here and you got

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.189
to block him here.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:12.389
We want to blow this guy back here into this
guy's lap and then you knock out two guys.

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.959
Okay so let's try it again.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.219
Now you got to keep your head up center, make
a good hit on him.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.940
I know you're concerned about him.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.920
Keep your eyes on him both of you guys, okay.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.409
All right, ready?

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.900
Down, set, hut.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.760
Move him back move him back.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760
What happened man?

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.400
You found a four leafed clover down there
man.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.459
You got to have your head up.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.930
You were looking at the ground.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.829
All right guys, pay attention.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.569
Down, set, hut.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.409
All right, all right, good job.

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:51.409
Good read.

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.939
Now the only problem so you want to just remember
take care of this - I would rather this guy

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:02.959
make the play two to three yards back here
for a game than to block him and let this

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.400
guy go for a loss.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.859
So remember the down lineman is the most important
guy.

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.349
Now another scenario on this and we'll just
walk through it; get down the set, I'll show

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.349
you.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.090
We got our DR should've said, "Down, set,
hut."

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.739
Now this guy goes over here like this.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.739
Go ahead step.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.930
If these shoes were over here are you going
to keep going?

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.950
You're going to turn up and get him and for
some reason he just takes off running or flows

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.780
or whatever it is and you take your step...

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.870
Let's come back here I'm going to play your
part.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.960
Somebody hold the bag.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.569
Hold this for me please.

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.280
All right, take your step.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.940
You take your step and all of a sudden he
plays over and you see him, now you turn and

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.940
adjust.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.539
That's why you have to - you step and you
look and go.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.800
This particular time - come back up here.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.509
He's right here come back; down, set, hut.

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:02.400
He might shoot here and this guy might come
off here.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.409
You want to stay on path.

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.830
So you still take your step - center excuse
me.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.150
You still take your step, he goes down here
and now you just look

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.560
Now you get yourself squared.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.870
If he's coming you're ready to go.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.520
You go and hit him.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.840
You guys understand that.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.009
It takes time, it takes repetitions - these
are just some of the basic techniques that

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.710
will coincide with your offensive system or
any system.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.710
??

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.710
??

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.710
??

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.710
??
