00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.060
You know the feeling, when you walk out in the woods at night

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.010
And you feel something's watching you and you just want to get the heck out of there?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.640
There IS something out there, and it WILL get you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.970
I recently broke my computer,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.800
and I had to use my old laptop to play Minecraft on

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.000
As one would expect, I could only play on lower video settings

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.559
That means I could only play with the thick fog, so I could barely see what's in front of me.

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.989
I started a new world and did what any other players would do:

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.629
Chop some wood.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.620
I took down a few trees when I felt like someone is watching me

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.530
I looked around and saw no one

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Thinking that I must be paranoid, I shook it off and continued to chop some wood

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.690
When I started making my house, I felt someone near me again.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.159
I turned around and saw a shadow behind a tree

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.830
Thinking it must be a cow I went after it to get some food and leather

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.880
As I went over to the tree. I couldn't see anything

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.600
I turned around towards my unfinished house and saw a player in it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.839
Confused, I chick that I chose singleplayer and didn't choose lan world

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
Sure enough, it was singleplayer

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.440
When I went out of the menu, the player was gone

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.440
A sign was where it stood

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.479
It said

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.479
Hello, neighbor

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.320
Freaking out, I broke the sign and finished the house

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.360
The next day outside my house was another sign

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080
this time it said

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
That was not nice

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.080
I broke it again, scared.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.000
I went out with my sword trying to find the player who is placing these signs

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200
I searched for hours with no luck

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.000
But suddenly. I saw a figure at the end of the fog, it ran, and I chased it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.759
It jumped down a hole. I followed like the idiot I am

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.430
the hole was deep

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.050
very deep

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.439
it ran all the way down to bedrock

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.210
I died from the fall

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.889
But in my deathscreen, the player was still alive

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.879
I respawned, but in an area, I wasn't in before. It was a huge forest with no end

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.119
I walked around for hours still not finding an exit to the forest suddenly I found a sign

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.109
Thinking it must be from the player again, I read it

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.020
You like my forest?

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.660
Now I was scared

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.570
I reached for the escape button, but when I pressed it the usual menu didn't pop up

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.740
instead

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.129
another menu popped up, asking me

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.690
Join me?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.290
with the answers yes, and no

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.820
Scared I pressed the no button, the sign now said you can't escape from my forest

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.240
Now I was frightened. I ran as much as I could

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.940
Finding more signs all saying you can't run from me

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.668
suddenly the signs stopped appearing, but now could hear a voice

00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:21.668
(faint) you're mine

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.280
I turned to speaker off, but I could still hear

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.280
Then I ran into a dead end

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.880
I turned around and there I saw him

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.500
inching closer, but not walking

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.760
It was like he warped closer to me

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.880
As he got closer, I began to hear his voice inside my head

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.480
(faint)be by my side

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.200
but when he got to me the voice stopped

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.549
But all I could see was his face, the lifeless face, the empty eyes

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.120
He was like he didn't exist

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.490
Then I suddenly hear him saying

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:29.120
"Join me, and be free from your fear. Silent be by my side, and never... feel... again."

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.920
the menu popped up again

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.749
Join me. It says yes, or no

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.169
I clicked yes...

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.019
You know the feeling when you walk out in the woods at night, and you feel something is watching you

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.880
And you just want to get the heck out of there

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.200
There IS something out there

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200
And I WILL get you
