00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:08.419
The final gala concert of the 20th Annual 
International Music Festival Cesky Krumlov 2011!

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:14.222
The finale belonged to the greatest opera 
artist of our times, Placido Domingo.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:20.076
The phenomenal Domingo was joined by 
Puerto Rican soprano Ana Maria Martinez.

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:27.174
The singers were accompanied by the Cesky Rozhlas 
Symphonic Orchestra conducted by American Eugene Kohn.

00:00:55.098 --> 00:00:59.036
I just arrived to Cesky Krumlov yesterday.

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:03.170
I knew it from books only and I thought it must be a beautiful place.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.082
Yesterday, I finally saw it with my own eyes.

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:09.077
Yes, it is really a wonderful city.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:11.871
Today, I’ve been singing all day.

00:01:12.052 --> 00:01:17.092
I was a bit afraid to take a stroll because I have 
a little cold, or maybe an allergy.

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:20.051
So, I haven’t been to the downtown yet.

00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:23.438
Hopefully, I will do so tomorrow before leaving.

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.870
Otherwise, I am sure I would come back.

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:31.762
Sing :-)

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.439
Singing and conducting, I hope I will be able 
to pursue it in the future. It is my life.

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:56.749
I would also desire that we have a little bit more peace 
and that we can make an end to all economic crises.

00:02:56.953 --> 00:03:03.694
I wish you all the best and congratulate you 
for this place which is really marvellous.

00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:40.526
Beautiful, isn’t it?

00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:42.077
What else to say?

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:44.831
That’s all from Cesky Krumlov for this year.

00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:47.062
See you next year!
