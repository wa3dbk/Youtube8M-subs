00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.870
today I'm going to show you what's in my

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.420
forever 21 bag that I'm totally in love

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.460
with its twenty four dollars I can't

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.290
wait to share it this is the contents of

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.870
my purse I just poured it out of my bag

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.170
onto here so I'm going to explain each

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.910
thing so here's the bag it is actually a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.369
backpack and a bag so if by forever 21

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.199
but the Olsen twins also have a line

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.570
called the row and they have a backpack

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.399
that looks exactly like this and it's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.559
like something like five thousand

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.899
dollars or something crazy anyways this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.510
one looks just like it and it's got

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.420
backpack you can also wear it as a purse

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.850
I wear it everywhere I love it and it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.030
big and oversized and super chic and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.270
durable so what's in my bag okay well

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.760
obviously I have my wallet and I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.829
actually have a men's wallet the reason

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.020
I have a men's wallet is because I feel

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.629
like a woman's wallet is super lumbering

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.420
and it just holds too much and I just

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.860
like to keep it really simple so I have

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.240
my credit card my Starbucks card and

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.400
sometimes a couple business cards but

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.130
normally where I keep my business cards

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.439
is my keychain so I carry this little

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.119
keychain around and to keep it simple

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.189
i'll just put business cards in here

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.530
this is like a little pouch and i can

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.530
also put keys or maybe a lip gloss so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.530
it's perfect so typically i have always

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.560
my keychain and my wallet on me and then

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.100
of course i have my sunglasses my

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.060
sunglasses are kind of men's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.979
the heavy the durable um and they're an

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.759
australian brand which i will leave the

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.500
link oil and i'm just so in love with

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.220

moisturizer this also has sunscreen in

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.959
it so you kind of get double coverage

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.970

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.900
gloves with a baseball cap on and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:05.239
sunglasses I'm petrified of the Sun so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.819
we'll definitely always find SPF then I

lovebirds fees it's the best it's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.930

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.219
that Rosie feel it's kind of flushed and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.709

overwhelming pixie always tries to lick

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.920
