00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:19.960
Hey guys!

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:35.450
Today I'm coming at you guys with a product
review.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.420
I'm finally getting back into the swing of
things since my protective styling.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.480
The first thing that I'm going to be reviewing
from the things that I owe you guys from the

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.690
haul I did back in July.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.229
That was a while ago but I told you guys I
was going to review the Aussie products, the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.820
cantu curling custard and some other stuff,
I can't remember.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.420
But, I decided to give the cantu curling custard
a try and review it for you guys today.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.630
So let's get into it.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.829
You guys know, I was pretty much searching
everywhere as to where I could find this curling

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:14.829
custard.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.320
I found it on NaturallyCurly.com.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.090
I saw some people talking about it and I saw
Melshary post it on her Instagram and I was

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.299
like, I gotta have that stuff because I love
cantu products.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.780
I searched everywhere and this was the last
one there at my local Walmart.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.450
I'll have a link to the curling custard below
because I know it's really hard to find.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.619
So check the description bar for a link to
where you can buy it.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.060
So I finally found it and this was the last
one there.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.810
Truth be told, recently I was looking for
the Cantu curling cream and they don't sell

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.850
that anymore in any of my Walmart's near my
house.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.902
I don't know what's going on with that.

00:01:55.902 --> 00:01:58.200
I don't know if they discontinued it.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.710
If you know where I could purchase it, let
me know in the comments below.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.259
This is the Cantu Shea Butter for Natural
Hair Curling Custard.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.440
It reminds me of some type of jelly just like
any other custard.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.080
It's like a jelly.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.370
It smells just like all of their products.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.940
I could really smell the Shea Butter and like
a hint of Coconut.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.210
It really smells like shea butter to me.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.830
The style I have in today is a wash and go.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.500
I just applied the same product to my hair
so that's what you're seeing right now.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.760
So far, I really love it.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.980
This is my 3rd time using it actually.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.150
I used it on my edges multiple times.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.420
I used it for a wash and go when I first bought
it.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.480
Then I just filmed me doing the wash and go
today for you guys.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.760
Overall, I like it.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.090
I would definitely purchase it again.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.590
On the bottle it says that it is sulfate free,
no mineral oil, parabens, silicone, gluten

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.720
all that good stuff.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.390
It's free of all those good things!

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.720
So if you're into that type of stuff, I don't
really look into like the sulfate free things.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.780
If it is sulfate free that's a plus.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.580
You get a 12oz jar.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.700
I got this for $5.97 at Walmart.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.102
Basically $6 for 12oz which is not bad at
all.

00:03:35.102 --> 00:03:36.470
I got a lot of product.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.380
When I first purchased it, it was filled to
the top so it's not that full but it was filled

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.380
to the top.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.340
A lot of product for $6.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.830
I got a question in one of my other reviews
before about what leave-ins I use.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.040
Whenever I'm doing a review, I usually don't
use a leave-in simply because usually when

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.940
I'm buying a product like Taliah Wajiid's
curl cream I usually don't buy their leave-in.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.830
On their directions it'll usually tell you
to use a certain product within a series of

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.370
other products and I usually don't have all
of them.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.621
So I try to just use strictly their product
and I usually don't use a leave-in.

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:19.710
But today I used a leave-in simply because
it was a wash and go.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:25.360
I used Original Moxie's Everyday Leave-In.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.939
So that's what I used today to do the wash
and go.

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.539
I used the leave-in, then I used the Cantu
Curling Custard.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.650
The only complaint I have about this product
is the flaking.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.610
When I used it the first time, I had flaking
on my edges and a little bit of flaking on

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.840
my hair.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.810
I don't know if I've been using too much of
it or maybe my hair wasn't wet enough.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.650
It does say to apply to soaking wet hair.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.650
It was definitely flaking.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.729
I didn't use a leave-in the first time.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.259
This is my third time using it and I decided
to use a leave-in.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.490
I feel like it's flaking but not as bad.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.900
As you can see, some of the spots are either
wet or you can see it's starting to flake.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.900
So I don't know.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.900
I've been reading a lot of reviews.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.319
A lot of people have been saying they've experienced
a lot of flaking with this product so I don't

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.380
know what it is but I am experiencing flaking
with it.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:24.210
On the bottle it says for additional moisture
or curl definition, apply the hair lotion

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.529
or the curl activator as a leave-in.

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:33.639
I'm guessing that maybe that might be contributing
to why we're experiencing flaking.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.880
I'm assuming that you have to use all of their
products in conjunction with this.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.560
But I didn't do that.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.120
Overall, I really liked the product.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.449
I think it's well worth the money.

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.639
I like how it keeps my hair defined without
a strong crunchy hold.

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.591
It has a really light hold with some nice
definition.

00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:58.889
The only thing that I don't like about it
is the flaking.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.880
To me, it's not as bad as using too much Eco
Styler or any other gel.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.840
So, overall I really like it.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.550
If you've tried this product, leave me a comment

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.300
