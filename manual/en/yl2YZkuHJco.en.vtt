00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.240
When we're climbing seated, we're able to
really conserve a lot of energy. I'm going

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.180
to show you some of the ways that I save energy
when I'm climbing now. First thing, I'm in

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.160
an easier gear than if I would be if I was
standing, second thing, is I'm just really

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.130
lightly grasping the handlebars. It's almost
like I'm just on the handlebars just touching

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.780
them, sometimes you don't even need to fully
wrap your hands around -- you can save a lot

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.809
of energy that way. I'm not using any upper
body strength if I don't have to. Basically

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.620
I'm letting the bike steer itself up the hill,
which is a nice way to do it. But now I'm

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.969
getting to a section that's a little bit more
trying, and it's a little bit more necessary

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.640
for me to pay attention to what I'm doing.
So, as I head up this section, what you'll

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.050
see is that I'll go from having this light,
almost just resting my hands on the handlebars

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.000
grip, to one that's creating more downward
force so I can really get up and around this

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.760
corner. So, getting lower, my hands grasp
on the bars I'm really now, as you see me

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.230
go past you, I'm really getting lower and
driving, but as soon as I get up here, I can

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.360
go back to just having my hands floating all
around because I don't need the interaction

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.570
of my hands when I'm not doing technical climbing,
they can just be meat hooks -- they don't

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.180
need to have any grasping force. The way the
bikes are designed they track just fine going

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.820
up the hill, so it's all about using as little
energy as you have to. So, I'm seated, peddling

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.050
nice smooth circles to maintain traction and
when I get to the harder, steeper parts I'm

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.580
still just keeping it smooth -- just applying
more power, especially using a lot more upper

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.650
body.
