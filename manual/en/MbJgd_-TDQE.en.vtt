00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:05.050
haiti lied to you that this is erica
rocks is again from catholic university

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.820
of america

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.679
and i wanted to bring up another issue
that i have an on-campus events

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.109
this is the pro-life march that is
taking place here in d_c_

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.880
here on campus we hahaha housing over
twelve hundred pro-life protesters and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.970
that we are not only doing that we are
actually supporting the pro-life

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.259
movement here

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.009
uh... n_b_c_

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.519
uh... as an official

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.200
university policy

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.120
we have yet we have it has a policy

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.220
that says capital university is pro-life
and that is actually one of the slogans

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.970
we have online of a couple our students
is marching

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.550
uh... along with these protesters

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.710
so one of the things that i wanted to
party does that and is the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.239
not only want my campus is doing

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.269
so far has a uh...

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.260
you know tech and stands on a very
controversial issue here

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.490
in america

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.180
but also are what they're doing to
promote it farther

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.910
uh... some up

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.590
some of the things that survey kat
university is doing is to sensor

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.080
some of these uh... uh... some of the
pro-choicers or anybody that is opposed

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.520
to the uh... catholic and gender

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.570
which includes pro-life same sex
marriage homosexuality

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.140
and things of that sort

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.520
and that is very troubling to me for
uh... a tapas that calls itself a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.060
university

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.689
uh... at universities across the hotbed

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.210
for ideas

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.600
thoughts issues where students and
professors can debate amongst themselves

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.850
in this sort of a free marketplace of
uh... of debate

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.709
however uh... it's not only happening
here at temple university

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.950
but also other universities were
censorship

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.610
of those of free speech is uh... being a
play among them students around the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.910
country

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.209
so one of the things are one of the or
to things i want to ask you guys

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.170
is uh...

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.439
number one

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.280
is it ok for university to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.379
take a stance on a political issue and
shape its

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.750
below it universal or educational
philosophy

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.619
are out such a stance

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.239
anzio

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.469
is the philosophy

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:30.649
is the philosophy of censorship
appropriate for a university to have

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:35.819
if it offends or a ideas should could be
controversial things like that

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.370
even though universities should really
be a free market place uh... the epitome

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.809
of free marketplace of ideas for
students and professors sore

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.299
so only the campuses cell

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.419
are really into it so article network
eyes and uh... hope to talk to destin

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:52.869
thanks very much
