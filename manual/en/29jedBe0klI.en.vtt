00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.930
hi I'm Joe wiesenfelder from cars.com this
is a 2008 toyota camry it's the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.220
long-standing best-selling car in the
United States toyota's reputation comes

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.309
from a number of things one is
reliability and another is interior

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.260
quality they gave very early attention
to things like materials quality the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.130
motion of things like the grab handles
in the sunglass holder and also even

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.580
things like sound just listen to how it
sounds as it moves and opens it doesn't

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.870
have that plastic you sound now on the
flip side in the past year so there have

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.489
been a lot of complaints about interior
rattles &amp; noise combined with trouble

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.780
with the six-speed transmission that
comes with the v6 model v6 model is now

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.210
considered below average and reliability

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.739
overall though we like the quality on
the inside its well-appointed in our xle

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.209
test vehicle some great features that
still are in every car tilt and

00:00:54.209 --> 00:01:00.389
telescoping the center console is pretty
big and there are 12 volt outlets and

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:03.479
the input for an mp3 player here in
front

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.620
they're both under a door so you can
leave your phone or mp3 player in there

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.810
no one can see it from the outside

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.260
also our car has seat warmers it's
pretty disappointing they're just on and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.850
off most cars have lower high

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.180
volkswagen has six different on position
the locking glove compartment is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.020
actually exceptionally large and they're
putting latches on the side now so if

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.990
you have something the middle there it
survives one of the things has been

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.790
controversial is this bezel around the
navigation system or AC controls it kind

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.960
of has a fifties diner look it's backlit
blue at night if you don't like it you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.130
can now get a wood panel bezel to go
around it to match the other would the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.700
ventilation system has what's called
plasmacluster it adopts plasmacluster

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.870
technology which helps to keep good air
quality by emitting positive and

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.190
negative ions through the driver's side
vent static electricity might be

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.320
discharged due to the high voltage used
to operate the system whatever dude I'm

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.520
comfortable in the backseat

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.630
I'm six feet tall my knees have a little
clearance the front seats in the drivers

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.750
position also this being an XL e the
backseats adjust for backrest angle

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.980
which is pretty nice a drawback to the
reclining back seat is that they don't

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.930
let you fold the backgrounds forward to
extend the trunk into the cabin all you

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.820
get is this pass-through in the center

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.710
unfortunately the SE model also has no
folding seat also you know the hinges of

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.520
the old style that go down into the
trunk other cars for example the hyundai

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.080
sonata have hinges out here so they
don't get inside and interfere

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.900
for what it's worth these are close to
the side so they probably aren't that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.700
bad market doesn't lie the camry is the
bestseller because it's a very good car

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.270
even if it's having some trouble right
now the biggest complaint people have

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.870
about it is that it looks boring or
plane now I think it looks pretty good

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:59.050
but i just turned 40 so for additional
information on this car or any other go

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.510
