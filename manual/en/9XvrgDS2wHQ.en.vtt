00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.640
We are going to make a small generator which
is going light the LED on our Lighthouse.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.119
For this you require strong Neodymium Magnets,
Insulated Copper Wire and some other material.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:18.119
Take a film can and make two holes on two
ends and fix two straws as bush or bearings.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.420
This is the inside view. Now take a yellow
piece of sponge rubber and affix two strong

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.219
Neodymium Magnets. Poke a bicycle spoke in
the rubber for the axle or the shaft. And

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.219
now weave this bicycle spoke in the two bearings.
You will see that the bottle has a little

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.960
slit on one side and the spoke must rotate
very freely inside the bearing. Now wind 800

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.289
turns of thin insulated copper wire 36-gauge.
Scrape the ends and attach to a LED. If you

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:06.289
know rotate the spoke the LED will light up.
Take a thick card sheet and make a 5 petaled

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.350
turbine with it like the petals of a flower.
Fix this turbine to the end of the bicycle

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.060
spoke. Also attach a bottle lid with a hole
in it using two sticks. Take a bottle and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.100
fix it to the lid. The bottom of bottle is
cut. Now if you move this white bottle up-down

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.140
in the green bottle full of water air will
be expelled from the hole in the lid and will

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.460
move the turbine. The turbine will move the
magnets and there be electricity generated

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.460
which will light the LED. This is a very beautiful
model of a Lighthouse where you actually light

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.689
up a LED.
