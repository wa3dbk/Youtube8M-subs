00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.500
Ok lets get little more advanced with the
rhythm right.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.799
So what we done is we talked about big rhythms
the thing lasting for 4 and 2 and 1 beat or

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.799
3 beats.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.560
Now let's talk about a breaking down 1 beats,
so we are subdividing the beat.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.550
So the 1st way to subdivide it is something
called 8th notes rights.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.499
So what 8th note is what I like to thing of
it is 2 notes in a beat right so 1 and 2 and

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:40.770
3 and 4 and 1 and 2 and right something 2
strums per beat.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.640
The next one we can talk about are called
16th notes, so now I'm subdividing the beat

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.730
one more time and so now there is 4 notes
per beat, now so you could say 1 E and a 2

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.570
E and a 3 E and a 4 E and a right and that
might sound like this 1 E and a 2 E and a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.860
right, 1 E and a 2 E and a 3 E and a.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.119
Now I have been doing that with chords but
you could use the notes as well all just happens

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.659
to be I'm playing with chords.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.560
Another subdivision of the beat is called
triplets right.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.400
Its lot tricky this is 3 in one beat and it
actually the way the triplets sounds is just

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:45.509
like the word triplets right so tri-pl-et
tri-pl-et.. right 1-2-3 1-2-3 1-2-3‚ right

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.100
so you can here the 3 in one beat right.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.700
And the last one that we can talk about is
6 in 1 beat.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.060
Some people call it 6 doublet.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.990
Its sounds like this 1-2-3-4-5-6 1-2-3-4-5-6.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.990
So you can imagine you can keep subdividing
the beat I'm just trying to include all those

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:18.180
notes in 1 beat right so 1-2-3-4-5-6 1-2-3-4-5-6
‚ So there you go some advanced rhythms

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.010
for you.
