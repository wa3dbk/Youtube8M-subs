00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.379
[CAR ENGINE]

00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:11.146
[MUSIC]

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:15.366
The 435i is lower, stiffer, and
generally sportier than

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.406
the 3 Series.

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:19.916
But the biggest news is probably
the name, which to me

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:21.826
is plain wrong.

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:26.006
It's like renaming Coca Cola,
Vegetable Bum Water.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:27.748
Actually, it's not quite
that bad, as you know.

00:00:27.748 --> 00:00:29.276
But you get the gist.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:32.756
The 3 Series coupe was
a motoring staple.

00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:35.212
It didn't need renaming.

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:37.956
After several aborted attempts
to record a [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:40.246
camera on the roads around
Lisbon, I'm resorting to

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:40.736
voice-over.

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:42.676
It just wasn't happening.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.202
It's a man thing.

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:45.556
--434--

00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:47.716
Please turn left
in 100 metres.

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:49.496
I need to be rid of you.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:52.386
This is a curious car, because
at first it seems ridiculous

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:56.886
that a 306-horsepower BMW coupe
that will smash up to 62

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:00.436
miles an hour in 5.1 seconds,
could come across as a bit

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.616
uninteresting.

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:05.016
This one is at least fitted with
the optional 8-speed auto

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:09.416
which is, as I have to keep
saying, is plain brilliant.

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:11.976
Optional electric dampers ride
well in comfort, a little bit

00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:13.716
spiky in spots.

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:17.276
The 435i is so fast and
discreet, you wonder if BMW

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.766
could have made it any more
ordinary looking--

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.656
except for those weird arrow
bits on the front wings, which

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:25.086
look like seals' ears.

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:26.736
The problem here is
a familiar one--

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:29.926
the 435i is so accomplished,
you wonder if it borders on

00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:31.146
the boring.

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:33.546
So I wandered into the faded
glory of Estoril.

00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:35.756
And couldn't really hide my
disappointment at the

00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:38.326
normalness of it all.

00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:39.526
I know the M4--

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:41.826
now that sounds completely
wrong to my ears--

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:45.426
will be the hot shoe, but a
300-horsepower, rear-drive BMW

00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:47.366
should make you tingle
just a bit.

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.856
Shouldn't it?

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:52.176
The steering is quick, the car
changes direction beautifully,

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:55.346
the motor does that
BMW growly thing.

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:57.826
But it's just not
that enlivening.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:00.046
Nor was the message from BMW.

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:03.506
The pre-track briefing
stipulated, no drifting.

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:06.446
Talk about red rag to a bull.

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:09.176
So here we are at Estoril.

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:11.436
Four laps.

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:13.836
And, curiously, in the briefing

00:02:13.836 --> 00:02:17.642
at the end, no drifting.

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:22.456
I'm a bit like a 14-year-old
being told not to smoke, when

00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:23.736
someone says, no drifting.

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:26.536
It's a bit, red rag to a bull.

00:02:26.536 --> 00:02:29.426
So I'm going to try and resist
drifting, cause it's not big,

00:02:29.426 --> 00:02:31.146
and it's not clever.

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:32.606
But this is a rear-wheel
drive BMW.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:36.066
And what are rear-wheel drive
BMWs for, if not to kind of

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:37.286
play with the back of the car?

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:37.896
Isn't that the whole point?

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:39.596
Otherwise you just buy
an Audi, don't you?

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:40.696
I don't know.

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:42.231
We'll discuss that later on.

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:43.516
What have we got here then?

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:47.426
We have a strange car, because
this is 10,000 pounds more

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:53.506
than an M135i, and yet,
it has less torque.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.656
So I'm not quite sure what
they're trying to do in

00:02:56.656 --> 00:02:58.476
performance terms.

00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:00.496
The chassis immediately
feels better balanced.

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:04.296
Longer wheelbase, everything
about it just feels a little

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:06.847
bit more grown up.

00:03:06.847 --> 00:03:08.916
And I really like the
rear axle location.

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:11.296
The rear axle is far better
located in this car than it is

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:12.366
in the 1 Series.

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:14.806
It deals with this torque
without thinking about it.

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:15.716
Steering--

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:17.606
really nice and quick,
actually.

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:18.806
Very impressed by that.

00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:21.661
Brake pedal-- firm.

00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:23.006
Why am I doing this
on the track?

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:25.916
Who's going to come and do
a track in their 435i?

00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:27.171
Not many people.

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:29.186
We're just on a normal
street tire.

00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:33.056
But even so, the performance
of the car.

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:36.256
A few years ago, this would have
been just about bordering

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:38.336
on supercar performance.

00:03:38.336 --> 00:03:40.066
It's incredible.

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:40.666
Transmission--

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:43.786
love this 8-speed ZF.

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:46.926
I know I crap on about it,
but it's just so good.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.691
Matched with this turbo-charged
straight-six, it

00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.226
works brilliantly, really
brilliantly.

00:03:54.254 --> 00:03:57.288
Remember, no drifting
please, no drifting.

00:03:57.288 --> 00:03:58.526
and I mean, no drifting.

00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:02.006
[CAR ENGINE]

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:03.256
Okay, no drifting.

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:10.933
BMW, I mean, it's a bit like
leaving plates of cake out at

00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:12.636
tea-time, and saying,
don't eat it.

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:15.285
Your cars are brilliant
at going sideways, so

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:17.096
I'm going to do it.

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:18.376
Morally wrong not to.

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:23.438
Really nice chassis.

00:04:23.438 --> 00:04:26.176
I get the hint of what
an M3 might be like

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:27.086
now, it's pretty exciting.

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:29.396
Because this structure
is stiff.

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:31.161
Everything about it
is high quality.

00:04:34.643 --> 00:04:38.336
Can a BMW be called
a 4 Series?

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:39.726
That's a philosophical
question.

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:42.506
That's a deeply philosophical
question, isn't it?

00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:44.556
I'm not sure it can, actually.

00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:47.026
I struggle with the
group four.

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:48.826
It doesn't sound quite
right to me.

00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:54.496
[CAR ENGINE]

00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:56.866
This guy has more performance
than most of the people that

00:04:56.866 --> 00:04:58.706
buy it will ever need, OK?

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:02.136
It really does.

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:03.318
But--

00:05:03.318 --> 00:05:06.126
and there is a "but" here, as
I cruise into the pit lane.

00:05:06.126 --> 00:05:09.961
The "but," for me, is that
despite driving so well, and

00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:13.406
being so fast, this is quite
an ordinary-feeling car.

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:13.746
You know?

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:16.226
It doesn't feel that special
to me at all.

00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:18.496
Well over 40 grand in the UK.

00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:21.206
Cabin is quite ordinary
3 Series.

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:23.546
The whole thing is
quite ordinary.

00:05:23.546 --> 00:05:24.736
Leaves a lot of space
for the M3.

00:05:24.736 --> 00:05:28.446
A lot of space for the M3.

00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:31.226
And so, underneath all that
gloss and perfection, there

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:33.706
really is a very good
performance car.

00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:36.466
One that keeps BMW well ahead
of its German rivals in this

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:38.056
particular sector.

00:05:38.056 --> 00:05:40.826
And, as if to acknowledge the
fact that it might need some

00:05:40.826 --> 00:05:44.496
added spice, BMW will be
offering a load M Performance

00:05:44.496 --> 00:05:47.216
modifications as aftermarket
parts--

00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:50.091
suspension, brakes, a locking
differential, and a power kit

00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:53.696
that adds 34 horsepower, and
37 foot pounds of torque,

00:05:53.696 --> 00:05:57.636
taking it back up to kind
of M135i levels of poke.

00:05:57.636 --> 00:06:01.266
The only problem is, they
didn't let us drive one.

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:02.506
Just remember--

00:06:02.506 --> 00:06:03.126
no drifting.

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:08.126
[CAR ENGINE]

00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:12.616
you.

00:06:12.616 --> 00:06:14.396
Of course we're going to do
some drifting, you know?

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:15.646
I mean, it's a BMW, isn't it?
