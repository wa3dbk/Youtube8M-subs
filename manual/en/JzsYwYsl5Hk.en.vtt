We look forward to play with you soon,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.070
 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.900
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
over the course of the month

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.869
we blend a broad spectrum of
partner acrobatics and flying therapeutics

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.829
alongside deepening into teachings skills

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.419
we also spent a lot of time training and
playing with their own personal practice

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.650
we work from basics and simple tricks

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.089
into slows, washing machines, in
transition to a standing positions

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.989
we offered to students an option to
choose into deepening a focus either into

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.570
therapeutics or acrobatics

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.280
by choosing a program and than spending more hours deepening into

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.269
their area  of interest

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.210
Flying Therapeutics is a bodywork practice

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.680
where clients benefits from a weightless inverted treatment

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.049
it's a journey

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.570
a journey where the client yes gets through a process of trust

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.890
surrender, let go and finally feel like

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.619
a baby in the arms of their own parents

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.799
 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:16.810
 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.420
the therapeutic program is dedicated to
those practitioners that want

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.729
litterally to extent their practice to a new
dimension. Most of the bodywork happens on the floor

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.070
 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.200
or on a table, here we start to explore  the
third dimension

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.759
and that makes this practice unique

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.549
we decided to join the therapeutic program with the acro one

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.770
to make sure the practitioner could have the right amount of hours

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.850
to practice the skills, the coordination and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.140
and the strength that we need to offer a good

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.880
