Hi, I'm Ruth Medjber and welcome to Out of the Darkroom on AdoramaTV.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.400
I'm here in the Grand Palais for Paris Photo 2014, and on today's show

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.400
we are going to be looking at photobooks. The photobook industry is massive these

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.439
days. It was the one thing that is not hit by e-readers in the digital era.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.900
People still love to look at photobooks. Especially here in Paris Photo,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.919
where photobooks are a really key draw. There is even an award

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.989
specifically designed for first photobooks, and as
well phot book of the year.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.120
Today I'm going to take you around, we are going to have a look at the key books

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.350
that feature in this. We are also going to interview some photographers who are

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.190
signing their photobooks for us all.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.530
Join me now!

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.729
AdoramaTV presents

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.509
Out of the Darkroom with Ruth Medjber. 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.160
I'm here with Ángel Luis González Fernandez. Ángel runs the Library Project,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.440
can you maybe tell us a little bit about what that is?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.260
Sure,the Library Project is a collection of photobooks,

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.529
that we started in 2011.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.860
It was on the back of the PhotoIreland Festival,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.950
that we did a book at a magazine fare with 
all the books that we collected,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.240
We build and re-united this collection

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.710
And over the last 3-4 years we have been
adding to the collection.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.890
And finally we managed to make it available to the public 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.170
in our space that we also call the
library project.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.130
In Temple Bar right at the heart of Dublin City Centre. Wow, so you are surrounded

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.740
by photobooks daily, so what kinda stuff do you have on show? Is it a lot of self published

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.320
or big publishing houses, 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.770
what you have there?  Well there is a
mix, there is everything really there

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.790
are also published books and most of the fun scenes seem to be self published

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.710
course but there's also loads of books and many of them have received awards

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.160
as well.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.030
How do you how do you feel about awards I mean do you think it's justified

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.050
do you like seeing

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.070
them come up through the ranks?
Well this is the third year and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.360
and they added the catalog as an extra award, you know

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.640
the best catalogue of the year
for a photographic exhibition

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.650
we have also the best book of the year

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.220
and the best first book of the year.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.920
So that's very much for young photographers or newer photographers

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.090
that are coming out. 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.099
It's great because you can imagine
for a person who's starting

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.650
somebody that publishing the first book

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.750
coming here getting the books listed - it's a
big push for their

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.850
careers, they get

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.730
exposure and right now hear there are
thousands of people coming

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.030
every day - they get to see your work, they  
get to see 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.050
your practice - I mean what better way
to promote your work?

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.460
Photobooks are a big draw still
it's probably one of the industries that

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.580
wasn't hit too much by the digital
kind of era

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.710
and do you see it growing how do you see that evolving then?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.800
Am, over the last

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.480
maybe four or five years was a push towards 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.400
the digital so perhaps
there was a push towards the e-book

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.650
and the iPad format but actually

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.620
I doubt that's gonna change much
because there is nothing like the book

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.599
there is nothing like the paper, the book,

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.989
yeah, I I mean these are objects most of
these

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.560
books - all the materials have been chosen very carefully

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.209
chosen very carefully - you know you
can't do that with an iPad, the engagement 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.190
is completely different,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.430
you can produce something

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.750
purposely designed for an iPad

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.180
it could be video content or whatever and it will probably look amazing as well but

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.220
it's not the same as a photo book. I don't thing the photo book is going to go anywhere 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.660
and proof of it is not only this award but all the other awards that are out there for photobooks.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.620
It's a great time for photobooks then really

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.940
- it just keeps going and going.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.620
Ángel, thanks so much for joining me today - we are going to go down and have a look at more photographers.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.940
This is Ruth Medjber for AdoramaTV

You'll find every photo book imaginable

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.360
here at Paris Photo - pretty much everything that's ever been published whether it's rare or not

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.520
will be here - I've just come across my
favourite photo book of all time.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.920
It's by a photographer called Sophie
Calle and this is her connection her whole body of

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.720
work up until 2003 it's called M'as Tu Vue

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.080
and I strongly urge you to go and get your hands on it or introduce yourself

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.000
 to Sophie Calle - she's amazing she had some great stories and

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.361
the photography done is a little out there

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.380
but it's definitely worth the read - go and enjoy it like I did!

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.900
I'm here with Derek Ridgers and he's just
brought out this amazing photobook

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.780
78-87 and he's gonna tell us a little bit
about it. So, thanks a million for

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.420
for doing this with us, I'm are very grateful, cheers.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.520
How about you tell me, how does a photobook come to be?

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.860
From its inception to
having it here in my hand in Paris Photo,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.850
what's the stages? Well it was an idea really by the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.880
silversmith and designer Andrew Bunny.
Silversmith? Yeah!

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.640
He was somebody who was a fan of my work. He was

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.210
a fan of the book I did in 2004 as well.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.270
and because that sold out, it was an unlimited edition,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.840
he wanted to

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.040
published the same body of work, or similar body of work.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.619
So you just kind of rolled with it then, and does he have involvement then in the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.740
image selection process, that kind of thing? He certainly did yeah, 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.920
he found a designer, found a publisher,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.840
talked to several publishes and went and got me a deal really, I mean

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.030
he was the so the facilitator for this book really. He was a good man to know.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.640
Certainly is a good man to know yeah! Listen, thanks so much for showing us through your photobook,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.219
it's been a pleasure, and everyone else, 
definitely have a look at this,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.620
it's got some great characters in it, and
I think, I think it will be worth seeing it

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.560
in a gallery show too. To see the selected
pieces big.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.370
I mean, surely it has been designed as a book as well, but what do you prefer? Do you

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.600
prefer seeing your work in a book or in a gallery?

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.360
I've got a huge ego so I don't really mind where it is! 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.280
So just as long as it's out there. Yeah! Brilliant! I would agree with you.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.480
Thanks so much Derek, it's a pleasure.
You're welcome, thank you. Cheers.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.480
