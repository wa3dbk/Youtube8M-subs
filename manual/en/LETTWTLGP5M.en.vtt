00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.860
PHANTOM: You have come here

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.230
In pursuit of your deepest urge

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.900
In pursuit of that wish which till now

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.460
Has been silent, silent.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.930
I have brought you

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.980
That our passions may fuse and merge

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.610
In your mind you've already succumbed to me, dropped all defenses

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.320
Completely succumbed to me

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.380
Now you are here with me

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.420
No second thoughts

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.710
You've decided, decided.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.250
Past the point of no return

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.150
No backward glances

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.600
Our games of make-believe are at an end.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.130
Past all thought of if or when

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.470
No use resisting

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.380
Abandon thought and let the dream descend

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.890
What raging fire shall flood the soul

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.650
What rich desire unlocks it's door

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.580
What sweet seduction lies before us?

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.140
Past the point of no return

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.310
The final threshold

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.110
What warm unspoken secrets

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.810
Will we learn

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:21.590
Beyond the point of no return?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.140
CHRISTINE: You have brought me

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.900
To that moment when words run dry

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.500
To that moment when speech disappears

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.820
Into silence. silence.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.160
I have come here,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.770
Hardly knowing the reason why

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.340
In my mind I've already imagined

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.140
Our bodies entwining

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.830
Defenseless and silent,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.330
Now I am here with you

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.540
No second thoughts

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:25.310
I've decided, decided.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.640
Past the point of no return

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.100
No going back now

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.110
Our passion-play has now at last begun.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.220
Past all thought of right or wrong

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.730
One final question

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.280
How long should we two wait before we're one?

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.470
When will the blood begin to race

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.130
The sleeping bud burst into bloom

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.610
When will the flames at last consume us?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.540
BOTH: Past the point of no return

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.590
The final threshold

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.870
The bridge is crossed

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.470
So stand and watch it burn

00:04:45.950 --> 00:05:11.450
We've passed the point of no return.
