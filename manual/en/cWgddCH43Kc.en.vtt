00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.380
How to clean your motorcycle in 10 minutes.
The best way for a speedy motorcycle clean

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.499
that's effective will be you'll need a few
simple products. You can either use a mild

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:19.920
car wash detergent soap from your local motorcycle
dealer, buy a natural spray on motorcycle

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.269
cleaner degreaser. Your first step that you're
going to want to do is have access to a hose.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:33.050
Spray down your motorcycle with spray on soap,
and be careful if you're in direct sunlight

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.911
you certainly would not want that soap to
sit on the motorcycle for any period of time,

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:42.060
because it certainly could ruin your paint
or the finish on your motorcycle. Once you

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.140
have the soap all sprayed on, you simply rinse
off the bike with your regular water hose,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.539
garden hose. Once it's all rinsed the best
thing that you could do after that to dry

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.850
it would be is if you actually have an air
compressor or a leaf blower. You can plug

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.390
in one of these blow guns and blow your bike
completely dry. That'll get all the water

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.330
from all the crevices and certain areas where
water will collect where you don't want it

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.360
to; which could actually cause some corrosion,
so completely blow drying the motorcycle is

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.810
a great way to get all the water out of the
areas that you don't want. Next step after

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.280
you have the water completely blown off the
bike is a good product like a spray cleaner

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:36.610
polish, the microfiber towel or a old t-shirt.
Spray some polish on the towel and you can

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.521
get all the shiny parts any of the chrome
parts especially if it's a spray cleaner and

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:45.719
polish really speeds up the process, because
you can use it on the painted surfaces you

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.200
can use it on your mirrors, you can use it
on your windscreen and you can use it on any

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.200
chrome part. If you're actually going to spend
the time to do a hand wax job you certainly

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.909
would want to use a good quality liquid paste;
one that does not have any compound or abrasives

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.790
in it to remove any of your bikes clear coat
or finish. Doing those few simple steps will

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.030
allow you to clean your bike within 10 minutes.
