Announcer: Meet the Weavers. They've owned an apiary since 1888.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.005
Meet Skip. He thinks he's ready to start a bee colony.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:45.002
Skip: Hey, Binford. Binford: Hey.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.047
Skip: You know I've given it some thought,

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.007
and I think I'm ready to start my own bee colony.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.079
So I'm ready for my starter kit.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.045
Binford: Great. We'd prefer that you order it online.

00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:59.064
Skip: Right. Well, you know, I've seen you raise these bees here on the farm.

00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:02.014
But what am I going to do when I get back home by myself in

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:06.015
my backyard? Binford: Well, let's go out and let me give you a little demonstration.

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:12.062
Skip: Great. Binford: I will talk you through this,

00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:16.017
and I'll do the first one while you watch,

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:18.074
and then I am going to expect you to do the second one.

00:01:18.074 --> 00:01:19.056
Skip: All right, I'll try.

00:01:19.056 --> 00:01:24.049
Binford: These bees have nothing to start with.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.015
They have no stored honey.

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:32.097
So we have to give them some feed while they're getting started and getting their

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:38.012
combs drawn out. So we have a mixture here of sugar and water,

00:01:38.012 --> 00:01:40.009
at least half sugar to water.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.077
Okay. Here's your package, and this little aluminum strip,

00:01:45.077 --> 00:01:48.025
your queen is in her individual cage,

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:50.057
and she's hung from that little strip.

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:54.054
So the first thing we have to do is get the queen out.

00:01:54.054 --> 00:01:59.019
So let's pull that staple out that's holding the queen.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:04.084
Now, you want to have a good hold on that strip of the queen cage

00:02:04.084 --> 00:02:09.065
so that she doesn't fall down while you're getting the can out.

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:11.072
Okay. I got her loose.

00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:17.049
So I'm going to put the can back in while we prepare her.

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.098
Now the queen is in here in her own cage,

00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:26.057
and this white is what we call the queen candy.

00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:30.004
It is a mixture of powdered sugar and honey.

00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.015
Now, for her to get out,

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:37.061
we have to pull the cart plug out of the end that has the candy.

00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:44.008
I'm going to show you the method that has the least risk involved.

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:50.001
Skip: I appreciate that. Binford: So I pull out about five of your frames out

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:54.046
of the side away from the feeder.

00:02:54.046 --> 00:03:00.041
I get the queen, and you see she still has that little aluminum strip.

00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:05.031
So let's put her down in between two of these frames,

00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:07.027
do all that little aluminum strip,

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:10.095
bend it over. She's got her syrup,

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:13.024
got the queen hanging in there.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:16.032
So we're ready for the bees.

00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:22.037
The can that has the feed for her also acts as the hole stopper for

00:03:22.037 --> 00:03:28.023
the can. We'll pull the can out and just dribble a few bees over the

00:03:28.023 --> 00:03:34.021
top of the queen, put the can package back in the hive,

00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:39.003
with the lid open, and cover it up.

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:42.021
Presto, you've got your package hive.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:48.072
Now, in about two days you need to go in here and pull that queen

00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:56.054
cage out. Close it up and don't disturb it again for about a week.

00:03:56.054 --> 00:03:57.085
Then you go back in.

00:03:57.085 --> 00:04:02.026
It will probably need a new feeder of syrup,

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:08.035
and on these combs they should have started making wax and making comb out of

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:13.018
this foundation, and the queen will be starting to lay.

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:17.084
Now there is a trick for seeing and recognizing queen eggs.

00:04:17.084 --> 00:04:22.088
They're just a little white bar that's down in the bottom of that cell,

00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:27.079
and for a while you'll not be sure whether you're seeing queen eggs or not.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:31.062
But after a week, when you give it a new feeder of syrup,

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:35.096
in the second week, well by then if everything is well,

00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:39.008
the eggs will be hatching into the larva,

00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:43.043
and you'll see the little larva or little worms down in the bottom of these

00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:48.048
cells. Okay, Skip. Now we're ready for you to give it a whirl.

00:04:48.048 --> 00:04:52.055
Skip: All right. Binford: I have helped you out a little bit by getting the

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:55.085
queen cage out of the package.

00:04:55.085 --> 00:05:02.061
Skip: Okay. Binford: And remember, what's the first thing we need to do about feeding

00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:26.017
right? Skip: Yes, syrup. Binford: Okay.

00:05:26.017 --> 00:05:28.002
There you go. Skip: All right.

00:05:28.002 --> 00:05:33.072
Binford: Good deal. What are you going to do next? Skip: I'm going to come

00:05:33.072 --> 00:05:36.057
back in one day and check on it,

00:05:36.057 --> 00:05:40.084
pull the queen cage out, check it in a week to see if I need

00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:43.095
to add more feed. Binford: Which you probably will.

00:05:43.095 --> 00:05:48.081
Skip: Probably will. Now I've got to explain it to my daughter.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:54.037
Binford: Yes, sir. Skip: Well, that was easy.

00:05:54.037 --> 00:06:09.028
Thanks Binford. Where does that guy go to?
