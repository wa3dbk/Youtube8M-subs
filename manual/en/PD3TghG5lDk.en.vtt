00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.100
There was an article in the Chattanooga
Times Free Press newspaper recently

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.500
about how high school
football coaches in

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.900
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia,
Southern states basically,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.200
like 32 of them

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200
all said

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.200
prayer is a part of football practice.
It's part of the football culture

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.500
in high school, by the way.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.300
And what they were basically
saying is that prayer

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.600
and a team prayer

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.000
is just a part of their daily routine. It's what
they do to prepare for football games on Friday nights.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.400
And that's stunning
to me, because

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.800
there is no reason
any high school coach,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.100
even if they
are religious,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.600
they should not
be preaching

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.700
or, you know, pushing their
faith on to their students

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.200
when they are

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.900
working for the public
school that they're in.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.300
You know, if they want prayer
to become a part of a football game,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.800
or part of a practice
session, or a team

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.100
you know, bonding activity,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.400
go work at a private Christian school.
That's what they're there for.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.400
But when you work at
a public school, you know,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.000
why don't you focus on the football team and
how they can-- the skills they can get to get better?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And if the students
want to pray on their own,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.100
they are more than welcome to. No one
is going to stop them from doing that.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.900
But these coaches were saying,
you know, "I'm a Christian.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.400
So, you know, I want to make
sure my boys are Christian."

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.700
Like, that is not
just wrong, it's illegal.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.000
And they're just proud of it. They're saying, "This is
what we do here. It's the way it is and you can't stop us."

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.400
Well, yeah, we can and--

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.900
We can with a lawsuit and
I'm sure those are forthcoming.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.800
But here's what scares me, because I don't really
care about the coaches, I care about the students.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.800
And if you're a student on any of those
football teams and you are not a Christian,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.400
or you're a Christian who,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.100
you know, believes in separation
of church and state,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.000
you don't really get a choice here.
You are basically coerced into joining these prayers.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.000
And these coaches all say
it may be a student-led prayer

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.100
or, you know, everyone wanted to do it
and that's why we have these prayers.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.600
Like, no, that's not
really the case, because

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.000
if you are one of those,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
you know, the few players
who says:

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.700
"I don't want to do this."

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.900
What if you're the only one on the team who says,
"I don't want to be a part of this prayer circle"?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600
What's going to
happen to you?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
That's a legitimate concern
if you're a player on this team.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.500
Is the coach going to
put me in the game,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.900
because I didn't want
to pray with them?

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Am I going to get practice time?
Am I gonna get minutes in the--

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.500
in the game? Am I going to be called in,
you know, during a pressure situation?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.600
Kathryn Stewart, who wrote this
book called A Good News Club,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.400
she said it so well.
She said:

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.700
"A lot of"
-- I'm paraphrasing here --

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.200
"A lot of these kids know
the locker room is no place for dissent,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.200
and they know that
you basically have to pray to play."

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.500
And that is not the situation
high school students need to be put in.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.800
You know, I'm an atheist and I coach
a team at the public high school I work at.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.800
I would never dream
of telling my students,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.300
you know, "Don't pray before a big tournament because
God's not going to help you; your skills have to help you."

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.300
Like, why would I do that? It's not about me,
it's not about pushing my beliefs onto the kids.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.800
They do what makes them ready for a game
and what makes them comfortable.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.900
That's what a good coach
ought to do.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900
And yet 32 coaches

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.500
don't know the first rule of
how to be a good coach, which is,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.200
you know, you give the students
the tools they need to succeed.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.100
Then you step out of the way
and let them do it.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.900
I can't believe they're just
willingly admitting that.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.900
For them, their faith and
their working at a public school,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.700
those things
can't be separated.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.300
They're just-- they're asking for a lawsuit
and I hope that comes because they deserve it.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.400
My name is Hemant Mehta.
I write for FriendlyAtheist.com

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.200
and we'd love to hear from you.
Please, leave a comment below

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.700
