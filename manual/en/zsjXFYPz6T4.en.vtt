00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.480
Strong wind sailing with the spinnaker is
sailing at its most fun.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.000
The power of the wind simply lifts the nose
of the boat out of the water, and by moving

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.750
your weight backwards promotes planing and
allows you to travel at much greater speeds

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.570
than normal.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.090
Travelling at speed calls for careful concentration
and good team work.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.550
And good balance is also critical.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.000
You must keep the boat flat and be prepared
to move your weight extremely quickly around

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the boat as required.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.770
The crew adjust the sail exactly as before,
releasing the control sheet until the leading

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.620
edge flicks - and then tightening it a little.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.180
The helmsman is continually looking out for
gusts of wind on the water, which usually

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.410
appear as dark patches on the surface.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.980
When the dark patch hits the boat, the helmsman
reacts immediately by pulling the tiller slightly

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.570
away from the sail, this makes the boat turn
away from the wind slightly.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.830
This directs more of the windâ€™s force to
driving the boat forwards.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.970
And as the boat turns away from the wind,
the crew eases the spinnaker sheet just a

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.000
little bit, to encourage the lip of the sail
just to flick as before.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.220
When you feel the gust of wind having passed
you, the helmsman then turns the boat slightly

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.850
back towards the wind.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.850
This combination of turning the boat away
from the wind when the gust hits, and back

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:50.510
towards the wind when it has passed, allows
you to successfully get the best out 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:59.639
of 
the wind.
