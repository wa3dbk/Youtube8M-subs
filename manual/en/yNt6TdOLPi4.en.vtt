00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.410
Looking at it from the front, it has a sharp visage, a wide,
powerful grill, and sharp details everywhere you look,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.080
with the curves of the powerful fenders
positioned to wrap around the tyres.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.380
It looks as though all the forces are holding each other at bay,
but at the same time drawing each other closer.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.530
This is what produces the beastly, powerful look.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.400
From the first key sketch
to the final production model,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.470
the INFINITI CONCEPT Vision Gran Turismo was created
at the Infiniti Design Beijing that opened in Beijing just recently.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.210
In this newly born design studio,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.830
young designers of China learn the heritage of Infiniti,
gaining an understanding of the language for the Infiniti form.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.480
And they instilled this car
with their desires in the shape of a beast.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.530
“Sensuality &amp; Beast"

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.230
That’s the concept for the
INFINITI CONCEPT Vision Gran Turismo.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.170
A naturally aspirated V8 is mounted in the front,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.770
with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout
using a rear transaxle.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.770
Based on this, we packaged a car that feels good to drive
and that makes you want to watch your replays over and over again.
