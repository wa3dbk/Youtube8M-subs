MORGAN FREEMAN-STYLE VOICE: 'This is the story of one man and his quest for some classic cartoons.'

00:00:09.444 --> 00:00:12.704
STEAMTEAM GRUNTS

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.530
'It was then that SteamTeam found something he had not seen in a very long time...

00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:38.524
'SteamTeam marvelled at the old episodes - although the narration left a lot to be desired!'

00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:43.835
STEAMTEAM ON TV (HIGH-PITCHED): 'Dirty Objects. Toby and Henrietta enjoyed their work on the Island.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:49.926
Every morning, Toby took the workmen to the quarry, but they would often meet James at the junction.'

00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:52.696
Oh, God!

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:57.016
'SteamTeam knew there was only one man who could help...

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.926
'Eventually Mr BonEsterphon arrived.'

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:09.927
So, what's this urgent job then?

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:14.779
Oh, it's nothing much. I just need you to re-narrate a couple of old TrackMaster episodes really.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:16.699
Okay. How many exactly?

00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:19.689
Oh, only a couple. Not many...nine.

00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:25.973
Forget it - I'm not doing that. Get someone else to do it like SkarloeyRailway, Richie, TheTopHatts...

00:01:26.183 --> 00:01:26.873
THETOPHATTS: 'Hi!'

00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:27.853
Oh, hello.

00:01:28.063 --> 00:01:32.794
Look. You are my series narrator and I want YOU to narrate them.

00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:34.823
Well I'm not doing it!

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:43.416
Dirty Objects. Toby and Henrietta are enjoying their new work on the Island of Sodor, but they do look old-fashioned

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.957
and need new paint. James was very rude whenever he saw them.

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:54.990
'And so, five years after they were first made, these episodes will be released on YouTube for the first time.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:02:02.692
'Look out for the first episode in this restored series - Thomas, Percy and the Coal - coming soon

00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:06.003
'exclusively to CalicoBonEsterphon's channel.

00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:09.135
'Thank you for listening'
