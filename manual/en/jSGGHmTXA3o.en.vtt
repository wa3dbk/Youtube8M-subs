00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:14.134
(lighthearted music)

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:16.434
Voiceover: You're looking at one
of Ed Reinhardt's black paintings

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:19.508
but actually there is no
black on this painting.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.501
What may first appear as an all over
black square, actually is a grid.

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:28.588
A three by three grid
of well, nine squares

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:31.976
and each square contains
an intensely deep shade

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:34.726
of either red, green or blue.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.429
One could call this chromatic
blacks or colored blacks

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.626
because at the four
corners of the painting,

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.893
we see actually a deep shade of red.

00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:48.135
Across the center of the painting
we see a very deep green.

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:52.624
In midway, along the top and bottom
edges we find a very deep blue.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.068
Now if you don't see this at
first, there's a reason for it

00:00:56.068 --> 00:00:59.124
because even in front of
the painting in the gallery

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:02.066
perceiving this painting is a
function of the rods and cones

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.440
adjusting in your eye.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.342
It's actually the same experience you have

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:06.494
when waking up in the middle of the night.

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:08.901
When at first everything
is black and then gradually

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:14.371
as your rods and cones adjusts,
color forms slowly, gradually emerge.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:17.265
Perceiving this composition takes time,

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:19.339
it takes patience and it takes attention.

00:01:19.416 --> 00:01:23.877
Ad Reinhardt was actually very, very
interested in exactly those qualities

00:01:23.877 --> 00:01:27.616
for he's not to purify art
and the experience of it.

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:33.339
Reinhardt wanted to keep art
and business totally separate.

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:36.693
He relished the fact that these
paintings are almost impossible

00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:38.392
to reproduce in photography.

00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:41.052
Reinhardt was in the abstract
expressionist circle.

00:01:41.052 --> 00:01:44.373
However the paint qualities that
you associate with that movement

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:47.485
are totally lacking in Reinhardt,
and there's a reason for that.

00:01:47.485 --> 00:01:49.404
Reinhardt was an oppositional figure.

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:52.714
If he knew that he were lumped in
with the abstract expressionists,

00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:54.587
he would cringe at the thought.

00:01:54.587 --> 00:01:58.051
(lighthearted music)

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.161
Ad Reinhardt's painting process
was a very individualistic one,

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:04.252
a very unique one and he never
made a mystery of his technique

00:02:04.252 --> 00:02:06.392
like so many other New
York school painters did.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:11.157
Corey: The first step in preparing
this exquisite matte quality paint

00:02:11.157 --> 00:02:14.463
is actually involving these jars here.

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.881
Interestingly his materials,

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:20.043
despite the fact that his
paintings look so odd and unique,

00:02:20.043 --> 00:02:22.178
his materials are straight up classical.

00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:25.259
Nothing more than oil paint
out of the tube and turpentine,

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.921
the typical solvent for all oil painting.

00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:33.284
What he would typically do is to
use quite a bit of mars black paint.

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.592
To that entire quantity he
would add just a little bit

00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:40.322
of one of the three colors he
painted with: red, green and blue.

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:44.629
Next a generous dose of turpentine.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.197
What I'm doing now is making sure
that that oil paint is dissolving

00:02:49.197 --> 00:02:51.841
into that turpentine
very, very thoroughly.

00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.644
Reinhardt would then leave this jars on
his shelves in his studio for a week,

00:02:55.644 --> 00:02:57.408
for two weeks, for perhaps a month.

00:02:57.408 --> 00:03:00.455
The reason for that waiting period
is that the dense part of the paint,

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:02.999
in other words the pigment,
would settle to the bottom.

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.215
Meanwhile the light part of that
mixture would rise to the top.

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:07.440
What is the light part?

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.156
Well it's the turpentine
that he just added.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:13.366
Now the oil, the binder
from that tube of paint

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:16.968
now extracted from that pigment,
lifted up to the top of this jar.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:21.396
What he would do next is
this, he would open the jar

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:24.880
and then pour off all of that
solvent phase if you will

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.703
or all that light part
of the paint mixture.

00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:30.216
Leaving behind only that sludge of paint.

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:48.175
(lighthearted music)

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:50.844
Voiceover: Because Reinhardt has
withdrawn so much medium from his paint,

00:03:50.844 --> 00:03:55.186
the resulting paint surfaces are
almost free of any trace of brush work.

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:59.814
In addition, they are the most matte
paint surfaces you will probably ever see.

00:04:00.398 --> 00:04:03.590
Because there's no gloss, because
there's no reflection on that surface

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.178
there's no other light
hitting us in the eye.

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:09.459
In other words, we have the
opportunity to perceive color directly.

00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:13.189
Reinhardt was by far in a way

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.470
the most subtle colorist of the
abstract expressionist painters.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.995
His use of color was so subtle,

00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:20.500
in fact, that it's on the
very threshold of perception.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.508
To see these painting we quite
literally have to slow down

00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:25.263
the pace of every day life.

00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:28.740
His paintings demand our
patience and close looking.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:44.138
