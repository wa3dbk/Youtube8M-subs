00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:06.050
The award winning Outdoor Research Men’s
Deviator hoody blurs the line between insu-lated

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.580
jackets and base layer.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.410
Wicking fabrics on the sleeves, on the hood,
on the back panel manage moisture and increase

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:23.950
breathability while front panels have insulation
that offers warmth, but still allows air permeability.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.340
Let’s take a closer look at the Deviator
hoody’s fit and features.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.370
There is definitely some hybrid construction
in play on the Deviator hoody.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.570
On the sleeves, as I mentioned, on the hood
in the back panel, you have got polar tech,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.810
power dry, high efficiency polyester spandex
knit fabric.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.700
If I roll that back a little bit you can see
the spacing and the gridding that is on the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.210
back side of that.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.320
Really, really nice next to skin feel.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.110
It is definitely a trim and athletic fit.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.470
You have got a great range of motion for cool
or cold weather running, cross country skiing,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.740
any kind of aerobic activities.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.330
This re-ally does move moisture and allows
warm air to escape.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.770
Great for those purposes.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.030
But in colder temperatures your core often
has susceptibility to getting cold, especially

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.820
as you are moving and sweat is building up.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.940
Polar tech alpha insulation in the core, in
the sides here and on the front delivers really

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.659
nice warmth, but in a really low profile manner.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.150
The jacket weighs in at just 10.8 ounces.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.310
So it weighs next to nothing.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.460
That insulation dries very quickly if and
when it becomes wet.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.200
So even if you are using this for aerobic
activities and you are introducing sweat and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.270
wetness, it will dry quickly.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.310
You will be surprised how quickly.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.500
And you will remain warm, just really interesting
construction here on the Deviator.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.950
With this being an athletic piece and the
expectation that you likely are going to be

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.489
sweat-ing in it, Outdoor Research has utilized
a polygene active odor control treatment.

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.209
It is ac-tually recycled silver particles
in the fabric itself.

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.020
It fights odor by fighting bacteria, fighting
mildew buildup.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.310
So in these types of jackets, it is certainly
not unheard of that after multiple uses they

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.480
are starting to smell a little ripe.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.269
Thanks to that polygene treat-ment, that occurs
much more slowly in the Deviator.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.519
On the sleeves you have got a little bit of
elasticity there.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.079
You also do have integrated thumb loops.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.640
Always love seeing that feature on a jacket
of this type.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.870
Think about cooler, colder weather.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.010
That little bit of extra warmth across the
top of the hands and also on the palms is

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.010
nice.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.109
If you were wearing gloves it does away with
that annoying gapping that can happen between

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.480
the end of your gloves and the beginning of
the sleeve.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.449
That goes away with that entirely and I love
that feature.

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.129
There are hand warmer pockets here on the
front of the jacket.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.620
They are always open.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.069
For an athletic piece, I really like that.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.819
On that kind of jacket, I don’t really need
the zippers opened and closed.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.370
I just need to be able to get into those hand
warmer pockets when I want to.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.069
Inside the right pocket there is also an integrated
hem cord adjustment.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.089
So you can reach that, cinch the jacket in
around your waist for a closer fit.

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:38.980
One additional pocket here high on the jacket
on the chest so you can keep valuables, keys

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.449
or what have you, close at hand.

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.430
It is a nice deep pocket that is in play there.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.150
As the name would imply, it certainly is a
hooded jacket.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.790
And, as it should have—at least in my opinion—for
an athletic piece like this, it is a nice

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.029
form fitting hood.

00:03:56.029 --> 00:04:01.319
So it is not like a rain jacket or an outer
shell where you might be looking for a larger

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.620
helmet compatible hood with all kinds of adjustability.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.809
This hood just fits.

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:12.530
And it is, again, that fabrication, great
next to skin feel.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.410
There is some elastic in play here at the
hood that gives it such a nice, close fit.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.010
It just feels great.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.160
You could certainly put a helmet over top
of it.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.910
You could put a heavier garment or hat over
top of it, but for athletic pursuits, this

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.670
likely is all the warmth you need.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.760
So the Outdoor research men’s Deviator hoody.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.600
As someone who enjoys trail running, who likes
getting out in the woods in all different

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.790
seasons and different types of weather, it
is just a great piece, one I envision myself

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.500
using over and over and over again, whether
it is for those truly aerobic activities or

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.850
just something to reach for for an additional
little bit of warmth.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.570
I see this being worn year round.
