00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.280
Hi, and welcome to episode 10 of ValveTime Top 5.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.690
After all the hubbub regarding new
maps for Team Fortress 2 recently,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.710
we decided to dedicate a full episode of
Top 5 to talk about our favorite maps.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.100
While people love new weapons and cosmetics,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.160
maps and gamemodes are really the heart and soul of TF2,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.180
providing the platform for the nine classes and countless weapons

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.150
to thrive in different environments and scenarios.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.210
While TF2 may have started with a meager 6 maps,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.890
the game’s roster has since expanded to an impressive total of 50.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.410
The list is comprised of maps both
made by the community and Valve,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.670
so we’re going to simplify things a little by splitting it in two.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.010
For this episode, we thought we would draft in some help
from our good friend Frozen over at TF2Maps.net

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.660
to see what he thinks and to get some more detailed insight

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.410
into what makes so much of TF2’s
map roster so brilliantly designed.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.710
You might notice we’ll be purely focusing on official Valve maps,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.970
but don’t worry, as we’ll likely return
to the topic sometime in the future

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.350
to talk more about those made by the community.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.490
Anyway, enough with this introduction already;

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.270
these are our Top 5 Best Official Team Fortress 2 maps:

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.890
Number 5

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.650
Like several of our older episodes, this list
also features a few rather obvious choices

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.700
which are pretty important if the countdown is to feel complete.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.490
This is particularly true for our first choice,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.340
as any list discussing the best TF2 maps
should of course include Badlands.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.140
As a partial redesign of a Team Fortress Classic
map by the same name,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.570
Badlands was originally launched as a 5 control point map

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.510
before being re-released with new
King of the Hill and Arena variants.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.090
As far as 5CP maps go, Badlands is exceptionally well designed,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.050
something which has helped it achieve a status
as one of the most played and enjoyed maps

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.620
in the competitive Team Fortress 2 scene.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.060
As the game’s seventh original map after the
release roster and the CTF_Well variant,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.860
it unintentionally revealed Valve’s plans for an extensive
amount of post-launch content development,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.920
something they’d only really dabbled with in the past.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.200
Despite being released within 5 months of the launch of TF2,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.050
Badlands seemingly perfected the 5CP formula,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.980
making it the best official map within
the extremely popular gamemode.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.310
That said, we don’t really feel Badlands is particularly good

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.280
at any of the other gamemodes it has since been adapted into,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.520
making it pretty limited in regards to
the different ways you can enjoy it,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.970
leaving it sitting comfortably at number 5 on our list.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.420
Number 4

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.550
Describing Badlands as our favorite 5CP map has probably
given away the structure of our list a little bit,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.350
bringing us to what we feel is the best official,
currently finished gamemode, Payload.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.110
Depending on the structure of the map,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.960
the Payload gamemode offers a variety
of different gameplay possibilities,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.830
something highlighted very well within Thunder Mountain.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.030
As a multi-stage map released alongside the
highly anticipated Engineer Update in 2010,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.330
Thunder Mountain was the first Payload map to
really play with height and vertical gameplay,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.900
bringing Pipeline and Payload Races’ rollback system
into the Payload gamemode for the first time

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.800
and establishing it as a core mechanic to be
used in nearly every cart-based map since.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.430
Using various ramps, tall buildings, and a new elevator mechanic,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.870
Thunder Mountain offers diverse gameplay and good pacing.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.130
It can occasionally feel a little too clustered at several choke points,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.130
but we really feel those are minor flaws compared
to the rest of the map’s largely excellent design.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.810
The map plays well, it looks great, and it
features a number of cute easter eggs

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.750
which make exploring the level that bit more fun.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.390
Number 3

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.800
While we mentioned we were more or less
finished with control point maps,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.710
we didn’t mean we were entirely done
with those silver disks just yet.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.540
As with so many of the early class-themed events,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.260
the Sniper vs. Spy update introduced a colorful trio of new maps

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.490
in the forms of Pipeline, Sawmill, and Nucleus.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.800
All three definitely have their charm, but we
were really the most intrigued by Sawmill,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.460
a level which continues to stand as the only
asymmetrical map within a symmetrical gamemode.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.310
Despite being a little overshadowed by its shiny
younger brother, Viaduct, in the Classless update,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.620
Sawmill continued to stand out for us by somehow
managing to support Capture the Flag

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.220
and the newly introduced King of the Hill gamemode,
despite being noticeably asymmetrical.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.680
It isn’t a perfect map, and the weather
effects can be a little bit of a pain

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.740
for anyone with a less-than-stellar setup,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.740
but we continue to be astonished by how
balanced the map is while also supporting

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.400
all three gamemodes to an impressive degree.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.770
While the map is already visually interesting,

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.710
Sawmill also featured a unique aesthetic
style at the time of its release,

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.980
advancing the lush, bright green alpine
style established with Lumberyard

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.920
and introducing a slightly darker, more moody,
and rainy variant which we’ve enjoyed ever since.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.450
And that goes for you too, Thunder Mountain.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.290
Number 2

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.790
Now that we’re done talking about shiny silver
disks with light beams coming from the center,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.760
we can get back to talking about extremely
dangerous bombs on rickety wooden carts,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.440
and that brings us to Badwater Basin.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.450
As one of the oldest maps on this list,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.560
Badwater has held a special place in our hearts for a long time

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.200
after being originally introduced alongside A Heavy Update
as the first single stage Payload map.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.420
Its simple layout and excellent flow helped make
Badwater feel like a real improvement

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.910
over Goldrush’ already brilliant formula,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.670
effectively securing Payload as our favorite gamemode ever since.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.740
That isn’t to say the map’s layout is overly simplistic, however,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.030
as its complexity is cunningly hidden throughout
the wide open battlefields and tall structures.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.510
The great variety of well-structured locations

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.850
really allows all nine playable classes
to thrive in the various circumstances,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.230
from short, narrow chokepoints, to tall buildings,
tight corridors, and multi-story cliff faces.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.410
These varied environments also play with height very well,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.550
providing defensive and offensive opportunities for both teams

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.380
in a manner very similar to our old friend Thunder Mountain...

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.300
who should probably stop cropping up every few minutes.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.160
Number 1

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.480
Our number 1 choice for this episode was one of the few maps

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.540
for which we reached instant agreement among Nick and Frozen,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.540
both for its selection and its positioning on the list.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.290
Given the map’s current popularity, it probably isn’t a huge surprise

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.550
that we chose Upward as our favorite Team Fortress 2 map.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.130
While popularity isn’t always warranted –

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.470
Orange X we’re looking at you –

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.110
we do feel Upward is very deserved of its current
spot as one of the most regularly played maps.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.610
Like Badwater, Upward feels excellently paced
and provides plenty of opportunities

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.050
for all classes to excel at what they do best,

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.480
something most TF2 maps attempt but few actually perfect.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.000
Like its older brothers Thunder Mountain and Badlands,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.100
Upward also uses vertical gameplay to its advantage,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.910
providing both teams with areas and opportunities
to feel like they are in control of the battle at hand

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.570
without making the map feel totally imbalanced.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.450
With peaks and troughs appearing as core gameplay
areas throughout more or less the entire level,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.360
Upward’s name is extremely fitting,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.200
allowing height to play a much more important
role in almost every other map.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.220
This also heavily influenced the unique
visual style and setting of Upward,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.510
as the entire map takes place atop an industrialized rocky mountain

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.720
surrounded by numerous other peaks.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.860
It’s an extremely balanced and fun map which is
interesting in regards to both gameplay and visuals,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.160
making it our favorite Valve-made Team Fortress 2 map.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.350
And there we have it; those are our thoughts
on the Best Official TF2 maps.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.600
With so many brilliant maps on offer,
we obviously don’t expect you to feel the same,
