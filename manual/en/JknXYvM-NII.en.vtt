00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.330
Think if you had two cables, right and seeing if, I'll try and make this where

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.330
it's obvious. Does it look like I'm pulling a cable?
Now watch the other side

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.220
now it's not just that the back cable is
pulling the front one.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.760
It's that the front one is pulling the back one. Now you might say,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.760
well what's the big deal? Well the big deal is this, can you come here please?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.840
Just roll your shirt up.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.329
watch this. A hit is a hit.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.530
What you have to realize is the other side of Beng Chuan is the hand coming back.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.739
The hand coming back is a big deal because

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.739
lets watch his body. You see how I'm using my hand
coming back to control his body

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.360
He can punch me and I can go boom.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.360
Okay that's stopping him. Watch my hand now, I pulled him away now why is an important?

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.530
Watch. That's why I want you doing the same

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.049
more face this way. Look he punches at me,

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.729
see that's bringing him in. Guess what the next
part of this is?

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.909
Coming back to hit him. Now

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.630
if you are seeing this in more external
martial arts you'd actually be talking

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.630
with the function is something like this

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.729
one two hit

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.659
Do you understand? What does the one do... stops him. What does the two do...

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.600
bring him towards you the third one hits him. You see 
that 123?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.170
Watch when he goes to hit me. So the hand coming
back

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.850
is used to block an even more important
than block to capture
