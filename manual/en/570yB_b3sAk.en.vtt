Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we will
prepare our pocket section. Take the two front

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.299
two pocket sections and place them right side
together and we are going to sew all the way

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.699
around and leave a three inch gap. So we can
turn the two pieces. Now you may want to put

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.359
a pin into, hold the two pieces together while
you are working. I'm going to start about

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.960
here, we are using a quarter inch seam allowance.
A stitch length two and a half. Start by knotting

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.489
it when you come to a corner you can put your
needle in, lift the foot and pivot the fabric,

00:00:46.489 --> 00:01:04.989
then continue to the next corner. Put the
needle in, lift the foot and pivot it. Always

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.350
checking to make sure that the fabric is together
and not shifting. You want to make sure those

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:24.961
are together. Okay if it does shift a little
you can just make a adjustment it is okay

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:30.520
if the pocket is a little smaller. Make these
seam allowance a little bit bigger, put the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.619
needle in at the corner, pivot and I'm going
to stop here leaving a hole about this size.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:45.189
About three inches so we can turn it. Now
you want to go ahead and make the turn of

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.479
the corner, don't put your opening for turning
right at the seam lines because you don't

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.659
get the right shape of the pocket. You want
the open, you want it to sew all the corners

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:10.180
and leave the opening on the side. Now we
would turn that pocket piece (oops I forgot

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.970
one thing) first you need to clip the corners
of the pocket. Like this so that you will

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.430
not have so much bulk inside. Now you want
to be very careful to clip closely but not

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.560
to cut the thread. If you are clipping very
closely as close as you can get without cutting

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.860
the threads. Just a forty-five angle like
this from the corners. Now we would turn that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:52.920
you just turn it inside out using your fingers
to poke the corners of the pocket through.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.650
Through our opening look for that pocket.
You can use a pencil with a eraser end, you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.460
can use your scissors. If you use your scissors
you want to be very careful not to poke the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.620
sharp end of the scissors through your fabric.
If you use the scissors you want to be very

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:22.700
careful. You can use the back of a seam ripper
also to just push that up and get your corners

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:32.700
out the best that you can like that. Okay
we would take it to the ironing board and

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.700
we will turn it our open section and press
the seam allowance in.
