00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.210
now we talk about the new Torch EOS 10R

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.340
It comes as in this beautiful box

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.990
we open it and what do we find? we find
a very nice

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.050
pouch that helps prevent

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.990
any damage to the exterior surface of
the torch when traveling

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.140
it is divided in two sections in the main
section

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.610
we have the torch itself

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.510
and a user manual and on the other side

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.770
we have a small compartment for the
charger because the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.710
R of 10 R stands for rechargeable let's
talk about the charger first

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.789
the connection is on the back of the
torch

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.960
doesn't require any plug that has to be
removed or opening or anything

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.879
you just have to ensure that after every
Dive rinse it so the contacts are

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.080
always nice and clean

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.369
on the charger we have this plug that
just mates

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.830
perfectly with the contacts it will take
about four hours to charge the battery

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.530
from

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.540
totally empty to completely full and
this will give you two and a half hours

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.909
of burn time with a constant output

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.420
this is what makes the torch very a
special is that we have electronics

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.159
inside

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.240
that allow us to have constant light
output

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.930
throughout the life of the battery and
instead of having

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.110
dwindling light over time now

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.920
the torch is made out of anodized
aluminum and it weighs about 700 grams

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.649
so a little bit over one and a half
pounds for a total length

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.340
of 21 centimeters which should be a
little bit over eight inches

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.119
in water this will be perfectly balance
there is no

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.350
lift and there's no sinking.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.740
We have four centimeter slightly under
two inches diameter here

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.439
which allows you to hold it very
comfortably with or without gloves

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.830
we have a safety latch on the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.120
and mechanism to turn it on so that it
doesn't turn on inadvertently

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.890
this which itself is a magnetic switch

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.030
and you turn the light on by rotating

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.989
this ring a magnetic switch has the
advantage that there is no perforation

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:28.390
going

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.910
through the housing and therefore one
less chance of having a leak

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.750
into the torch itself the EOS 10 R
comes with a nice lanyard

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.950
attached to the back of the light one
detail about the back of the light

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.959
we have a over pressure relief valve

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.750
because we have rechargeable batteries
and this is a safety feature

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.330
you must have when you have
rechargeable batteries one detail about

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.170
the charger

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.019
it is electronically controlled so that
once it

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.510
realizes that the torch is completely
charge it cuts off power supply

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.120
so that you don't have any risk
overcharging or

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.180
anything else that might happen them

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.370
one more detail about the process of
charging the torch four hours for a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.540
complete charge

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.760
but one hour we'll give you forty eight
minutes of burn time at maximum power

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.459
at the choice anodised aluminum makes

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.629
so this a very rugged at torch with a
maximum operating depth about 150 meters

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.310
pretty much 500 feet

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.950
so let's talk about the technical specs
of the starch

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.310
we have a 9 watt high-power

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.840
Mono LED with about 1100

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.220
lumen output.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.970
We have about 12,500 lumen hotspot

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.970
and we have a very white crown for
improved visibility

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.030
on a night dive. Light is identified

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.720
by a color temperature which tells us
what kind of

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.500
color comes out at this light and lately
there's been the trend of using

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.299
a high power LED is that make a very
white light

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.939
or bluish light which is a great for
power consumption but not so great for

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.150
really appreciating what is under water
we have chosen

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.299
color temperature of 5000 kelvin

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.680
which really brings out the colours and
everything we have under water

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.199
and this pretty much sums it up a great
light with a lot of features

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.630
