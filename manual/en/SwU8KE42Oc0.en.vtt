00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.940
We got a call here at the station about of a guy complaining of

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.070
chest pains, trouble breathing. They said he had sustained

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.610
some sort of injury on the boat and that they were heading towards the inlet.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.650
At that time they were approximately 40 miles out

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.740
and the situation, we had an EMT onboard our boat

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.880
Transferred the EMT over to their boat. The way their boat was

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.920
designed, that canopy they had on their boat was not removable.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.040
So, what we did was had the helo rendezvous with us and drop a stokes litter down.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.220
So that we could safely transport the person from their boat to our boat.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.290
And then have the person medevac out

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.420
to the local hospital quicker then what we could do with our boat. We were still 20 miles out and it would have taken us at least an hour

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.450
to get back. So that the plan was just to go out, assess the situation

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.530
stabilize the person, wait for the helo to get on scene and then transfer

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.680
the person to the helo. It was successful in many ways, we were safe throughout the whole evolution

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.720
We got out there in a timely manner and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.810
was able to assess everything. Make the transfer of our EMT over to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.930
their boat. Make sure it was safe to remove the person from the boat

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.040
Also, able to safely pass the person back to our boat

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.070
and have the helo hoist up. It think the whole evolution to no more then fifteen to twenty minutes at most.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.150
And that's including dropping their stokes litter

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.290
their rescue swimmer and stabilize personnel back and forth.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:49.720
So it was like a second nature kind of thing, a smooth operation for everybody that was on the boat.
