00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.450
I throw on my diving suit, I jump in the bathysphere,
I take the dangerous ride to our underwater

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.050
office...and it never fails.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.690
I find boxes of donations from you guys.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.580
It’s the coolest thing ever that you guys
send us all this crap.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.630
But honestly, like...I’m always perplexed
as to where you get some of this stuff.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.630
And why.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.680
Case in point, our good pal Benjamin from
New York just sent us a whole freaking box

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.520
of games, and sure...there was Defender II,
there was Slalom, there were the games we

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.880
can all say we’re at least familiar with,
right?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.839
Then, there was...this, a game no one here
at CGRundertow had ever heard of.

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.440
In fact, we couldn’t even read its name.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.640
Looks like some kind of alien thrash band
from Kepler-10b.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:15.909
Nonetheless, we soon learned a lot about the
game.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.040
It’s called Seicross...or Seicross.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.620
We’re not sure how to actually say it.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.650
Frankly, we’re not sure how to actually
play it.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.610
It’s like, if you mixed Excitebike with
Tron, F-Zero and bumper cars, that’s pretty

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.650
much the concept at work here.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.310
That’s Seicross.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.310
Seicross.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.300
I bet Kepler-10b has a rockin’ thrash scene.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.200
So you play as...some guy...on a hovering
moped.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
He’s racing on this green grid or something,
and there are a bunch of these bad guys trying

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.720
to ram him into...dinosaur skeletons.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.810
Plus, dude has a real thing for the Blue Man
Group, because meanwhile, you’re rescuing

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.310
every godd*mn member.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.960
And shooting lasers.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:10.090
Where do you guys find this stuff?

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.540
So Excitebike, because...uh, duh.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.209
And F-Zero because, you know...hovering in
the future.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.660
But the bumper car thing is also a central
element to Seicross.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.700
Because you either blast these fools or you
bump them into crap.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.360
Of course, doing so drains the energy of your
ship, but you can pick up more all over the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360
track.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.230
It’s a fun mechanic that really gives the
game a unique feel.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.569
There are three areas to drive through, and
frankly, it’s hard as balls to do so.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.739
This game is not easy, as you might expect
from its relative obscurity and Keplerian

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.739
logo.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.879
Nonetheless, it’s still an interesting game.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.549
And if you’re into the futuristic style
of the 1980s, action racers or...I guess Blue

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.080
Man Group, Seicross is a game for you.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.999
Even if you’ve never heard of it.
