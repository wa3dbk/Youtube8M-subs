Hi, I'm Bob from Toronto Canada in this lesson I'd like to demonstrate how to play really fast runs on the guitar like this

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.189
Not only is it fun to play, but it looks and sounds impressive first might want to file down your guitar pick with some sandpaper

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.779
Like this like so this will help the pick to grab on the strings better

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.489
As far as ticking goes need to pick up and down as fast as possible as if your hand is vibrating

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.169
On the fretboard we want to be playing our hammer-ons and pull-offs at the same time yes

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.300
Faster

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.559
Like so wouldn't blend the two together, it should come out sounding like this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.890
Work like this in a minor

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.639
If you don't get it at first keep practicing and it will come

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.920
Just keep practicing. I hope this lesson was helpful and have fun playing and have any questions just message me
