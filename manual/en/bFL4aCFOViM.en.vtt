00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.070
according to the atlantic which is uh...
also the name of an emotion so it rested

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.149
fifty three percent of recent college
graduates are work

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.669
and according to her melaka adjusted
research on that phone she started

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.400
texting on them again from my research
done uh... so she says by their

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.570
for the average the amount that is
twenty six thousand dollars it's time to

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.180
time six thousand from twenty three
which is we used to be lower now is

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.109
higher this concerns me depicted

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.440
so my question is from ellen ratner
moment

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.180
my question is is collinsworth it or
should you just get goin on your your

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.960
lights vocation

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.590
i_d_ eighty

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.970
and that's it depends on your situation
i think that there are a lot of options

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.639
for cars and it's an even staying in
community college tuition is increasing

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:55.990
and not everybody can afford it

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.470
and i mean i can say that it's like that
yes i have death it's a little bit lower

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.460
than the average amount of debt

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.409
but what's really

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.700
e fears that a college from doing just
fine and you know there's like hope that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.970
i'm gonna pay it off in the next ten
years

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.340
by it to you

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.640
involved with that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.780
analysis

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.370
uh... we have now to finance he went to
see if i think that you have a activist

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.880
and a lot of money

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.710
on college enough to be committed to try

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.610
to make it work day you can just go to a
private school and decided just gonna go

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.860
fav

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.830
you really have to commit to make that
money was that it was a good a community

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.549
college in the best you can

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.670
and as often psystar apple community
college gotta stay

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.750
again many different options i think
sometimes people

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.970
really just go for it the really
expensive school that they can get into

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.210
an end up in a minute bells in dollars
in debt

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.680
yes i'd agree with this people go to

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.049
uh... a nice a good school if they take
their work are get a lot of work

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.640
part-time in high school

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.960
writing go to college

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.070
go to the net best cuz they can i agree
with this and a new day review like this

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.350
is the biggest ok cardiac ever been to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.759
that would pay fifty thousand dollars a
year just to get this drunk

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.000
and i'm gonna head to head onto

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.599
witness someone what do you think you
have an intense

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.779
financially it depends on what you're
studying mike i haven't agree in

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.749
film production which is not going to
help me financially alex my is the

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.329
degree that you would probably should
just go out and start right away if

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.139
that's what you're looking to do back i
wouldn't trade my college experience for

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.759
anything i think it is the best four
years of my life so far and so socially

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:38.089
and i mentally speaking it was totally
worth that that financial it's not going

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:42.399
to help me make more money i think i
think that nowadays

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.569
college education

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.119
area and the most people have college
execution and even with film production

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:54.329
yeah allister and she knew this and you
can view your alan project outside of

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.820
college that will

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.120
daily to the point you make a lot of
money

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.810
i think having college behind you is a
really good way to get into the door of

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.120
some production company otherwise the
wife why would people look at you and as

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.960
always other people that have

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.609
and that participation and they aren't
and t_v_

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.399
if you don't have any experience or some
sort of like

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.409
accreditation

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.839
i'd like they were having this
conversation here what's your job

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.879
and the producer and what's your job

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.459
an intern

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.169
what's your job

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.419
what's my general median so far

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.780
a lot of us went to college and we did
that

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.940
dangerous to the political science

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.530
and it's a bachelors of the arts degree
so i think the best of the arts in a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.519
science

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.420
it doesn't mean we make sense at all
that is of a science and the heart's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.939
masters of science and practice channels
and how is that a satellite from it

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.019
don't we believe you are not technical
skills but there are people who go

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.449
instead he now

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:55.720
and finance

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.060
who then are qualified in its actually
where the for them

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.490
to go and speak on those people don't
always get jobs

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.159
with their surplus of people can
disagree for once they go out

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.859
you know it's not guarantee they're
going to get a job because you have a

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.309
degree procedures it's on you stupid
america's not

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.029
don't you think

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.930
opa colleges must be about academics and
learning a trade to some extent but that

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.599
try to give reno's american colleges are
typically more focus on sort of liberal

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.069
arts training of the whole person and
all that then than in other countries

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.870
where the reasons like he tasted
certainly come to

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.080
u_s_ colleges more than they ever were
the past

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.439
so it's not just about learning the
traits but developing as a person and

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.310
learning about

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.610
how to be independent how to interact
with people diversity in all these

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.610
different things you know you're
interested in

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.879
and so here's yours i wanna compare

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.300
think about the people

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.479
uh... that that went to college so you
know

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.459
i think a lot of people that you and i
still within the norm college nothing

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:52.259
else he wouldn't go into college but i
think in general it's sort of a

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.409
different thing in the way that people
develop is sort of different

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.960
and so what do you think about that is
that reason enough even if it's not

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.069
gonna get to a better job just
developing as a person in that

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.270
collegiate sort of way is that the knife
reason to go to college test any old

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.699
bastard like me you know

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.959
and will say judges the best for use in
my life value every fucking lonely

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:15.449
fuck everything

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.580
the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.030
state presidencies
