involvement and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.860
uh... all sorts of different stuff
that's going on the list and almost hit

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.870
and run because hearsay

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.230
there was a good evening

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.770
yeah could have been hit and run

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.560
let's get into a bunch of stories here
c_n_n_ is now asking or they asked

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.810
whether markle rubios sip of water was a
career and are now i think this is a

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.630
little short this is a good example of
mainstream media trying to create big

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.000
drama around something that well it was
very very funny it obviously is not a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.050
career endure for marco rubio the
reality is that what he said before and

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.090
after taking that sip of water should
and his career it won't because a lot of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.359
people believe the nonsense

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.509
let's take a listen to what uh... the
cnn story wasn't on-screen during this

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.430
time

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.960
was the word currier endure with a
question mark of fatalism so can a drink

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.940
of water make or break a political
career a u_s_ senator possible

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.190
presidential candidate

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.150
where to find out there whether he likes
it or

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.549
the social media frenzy started

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.950
when a senator made an awkward pause
there there is right there

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.830
to take a sip of water bride ok so i
think that this is uh... being

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.310
this is an example of c_n_n_ being
overly dramatic there's of course

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.150
nothing career ending here now c_n_n_
was asked about this by political and

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.840
they said we were joking it was just a
tease

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.990
the thing is

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.220
this c_n_n_ really do whimsical
satirical teases like this i mean i know

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.380
they do about some things but did it
didn't seem to be anything joking when

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.550
then the follow-up is also is this a
career and her on the screen that that's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.810
not really it's heats

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.290
yeah i didn't sound like a tease uh...

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.200
i don't know you can blame them for
trying to make the drama i mean it is

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.400
time someone entertaining i guess i mean
i guess they would have taken this is a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.859
page out of the fox news notebook
rhetoric or when when president obama

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.450
uh... did a fist bump with michelle
obama

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.740
and foxnews teas that as uh... terrorist
fistulas harassed this jab and there was

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.870
a question mark on the end of it just
like with this so i guess that's not

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.200
real they're not saying it

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.450
they're just asking the question though
as that's all they're doing they're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.830
there to ask questions i will just say
c_n_n_ let's not stupid to to that level
