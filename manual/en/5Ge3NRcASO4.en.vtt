00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.433
- Earlier this season,
Rebel Wilson stopped by.

00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:04.666
We played a game
called "Pitch Please."

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.333
And here's what happened.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.200
You know how you sell
a product on QVC,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.700
but this is sort of
like that.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.766
You're going to have to really
sell the product,

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.633
but you don't know what it is.
- Okay.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.833
So I'm going to give you clues.
I'll ask you questions.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.333
You'll stand right here
behind it.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.333
- All right.
- All right?

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.600
- So I can't see
what it is.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.533
- You don't know what it is,
but you have to sell it.

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.633
So you're just going
to sell it.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.566
And then the audience
and I know what it is.

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.000
All right? Here's what
we're gonna be selling.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.266
Right there.
Okay?

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.166
First of all, why do--

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.700
tell everybody about these
and why they need it.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.966
- Well, as you know,
I use this product every day.

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.966
- Every day?
- Yes.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:45.066
- Um, and, Ellen--
- All day--all day, all night.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.633
- Basically, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.833
- And, Ellen, as you know,
the holidays are coming up.

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.900
And you're kind of like,
"What do I get my uncle?"

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.800
- Yeah.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.066
That's--that's very thoughtful
of you.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.533
Have you used them before?
Do you know how they work?

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.566
- Yeah.
And, um, look,

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.200
maybe it might be best
if I do the jingle.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.066
- Oh, okay.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.733
- Yeah.
It goes like this.

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.600
What do you need right now?
This.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.566
You really want to buy it.
This.

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.233
Can I buy 100?

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:24.666
No.

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.400
- Yeah.
So you would--

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.500
so the jingle says,
"Can I buy 100?"

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.000
So you think it would
be good for people

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.100
to have maybe 100 of these.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.266
- Or you can just have one.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.966
- When you put them
in your mouth,

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.733
what do you--what do you feel
when you put them in your mouth?

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:43.033
- Um, satisfaction.

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:45.700
[laughter]

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.666
- You know, a lot of celebrities
own these.

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.866
What celebrities would you say
own these?

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:56.033
- Channing Tatum,
I know for a fact owns this.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.533
- For--he for sure does?

00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.600
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.366
- And his uncle does.
- Uh-huh.

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.133
- And the great thing is
it's easily stored

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.200
under your pillow.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.266
[laughter]

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:12.400
- All right.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.566
Do you--when you're kissing,
would you say best to

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:17.366
have it when you're kissing
or not have it

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:18.766
when you're kissing?
- I wouldn't.

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:19.766
- No?

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:20.933
[laughter]

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.633
- No.
All right.

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:26.933
What would you think
could get stuck in them?

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:27.933
- Tampons.

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:32.266
[laughter]

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:35.433
I have no idea
what this is.

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:37.166
Should I--oh.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:42.466
[laughter]

00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:44.566
- You don't want tampons there.

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:46.233
No.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:47.866
All right.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:48.866
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:50.166
- My uncle really could
use these.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:52.166
- Yeah.
