00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.620
I like my job because I don't have to
wear a tie to work,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.090
I get to work with a lot of cool
equipment, and I get to travel.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.939
I get to go to conferences all across the country,

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.240
and meet with people who are doing the
same things that I am. But most of all,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.359
I like my job because I'm doing
something important, I'm making a product

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.990
that people

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.149
eat everyday. My name is Zach Perry,

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.059
I work for Central Milling in Logan, Utah
and I am a cereal chemist.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.320
Now cereal chemists is not like
serial killer,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.600
it's more like Coco Puffs, Froot Loops,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.649
those types of cereals, it's another name for grains,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.879
they're called cereals. So what I do

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.550
is I actually test the grains 
that are used to make

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.559
flours that make the things that you eat:
cookies, crackers,

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.320
bread, and cereals. Facility alone
manufactures

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.100
approximately twenty different types of
flour. So all sorts of food applications

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.439
have different types of flour that we use.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.900
You use a certain type
of flour for pizza crust,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.680
certain type of flour for donuts,
different type of flour for bagels,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.140
cakes, breads.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.160
So what I'm doing is I'm testing all of the
different wheats that we have out there to use

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.220
and I'm trying to figure out what
flours those

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.390
are going to work the best in. The test for it is the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.040
strength and stretch of the dough. And

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.189
this machine right here that we use is
basically just a fancy bread machine. I

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.360
make a dough out a it,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.860
and then I get to blow bubbles
with it to see how well it stretches.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.930
I always like to take things 
apart and fix things, so

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.360
one of my favorite parts of the job is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.500
making sure that all the equipment that
I use every day

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.549
is working properly. The grain is
actually a very sophisticated operation.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.410
We have lots of different heavy
equipment, and we have lots of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.420
specialized computers, and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.540
precision testing equipment.
So when I'm not being a cereal chemist,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.700
I'm a serious musician. 
I play guitar and sing in my band.
