in terms of implications is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.619
you know i didn't hear separatist espy lab

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.779

as and farmers

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.470

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.910
ends and acted

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.140
lists and really i have a discussion about
what's going on with

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.300
in oregon

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.180
and how to pharmacy into practice

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.190
and so this particular night we're focusing
on

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.220
on the next generation of farmers in oregon

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.840
a lot of you are here tonight

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.820
there's a lot %uh farmland in the next ten
years twenty five to fifty percent

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.200
working farm land in org and it's going to
go into transition

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.700
hate you don't want to see those turn into
condos are subdivisions

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.270
elaborate corporate

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.750
and turn it in my props then it's time to
start talking it's time to start coming up

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.520
with solutions on stubhub leave this will
be one of many conversations that that started

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.290
to insult of this issue

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.950
%uh one of the things that i would like to
do c

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.990
how many people in the realm

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.740
our partners and feel free to use the term
loosely

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.390
an animated gladiator hasn't exactly seventy
she's barber cease-fire

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.390
so we have a lot of farmers in the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.909
and asking that people are concerned about
their local clinic and let me say come from

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.640
an extended seniors exactly

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.609
typing for the largest hospitals

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.230
and my case it was going to send armenians

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.459
it's really almost impossible to make money
to buy a party farming and there's a lot of

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.790
really great internship

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.749
opportunities out there that they are hardly
and not to live off that especially if you're

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.419
living in the city

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:26.790
and sound

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.579
once you've completed those opportunities
actually make money is needed to brand manager

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.669
a limited self we both have off time jobs
sandton

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.149
we're saving so that %uh

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:45.239
ideally will be able to data from a car on
sundays

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.739
we had to be a family feuds people's lives

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.509
the purchase of these different format found
three days later i'd forget that my wife works

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:59.369
off a format really what makes it possible
landslide but there are any appetite by no

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:01.049
means that

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.810
a glorious solution in all this and we're
only talking about

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.620
young farmers on the land

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.379
but you know that's set by the recipient of
the road and %uh not having the wranglings

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.089
that we have

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:18.499
i would really encourage people not to be
so tied to the idea of owning a piece graham

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:23.650
i think there's going to be a lot more opportunities
and at least in the near future to find

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.509
super elegant very fertile these grounded

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:31.209
and quite frankly for me just %uh

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.829
it's a monster in many ways and you can really
be in your heart conveniently so secure beat

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.049
in every part of you do you think is is valuable
to the enterprise until you get your hands

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.229
in the dirt unrealized you know what it what
enterprises

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.039
i say section dot

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:51.789
so %uh enough for us at weekend we're going
to pass a landscape tonight unite thank thank

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:53.539
our lucky stars in

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:57.229
chickens distaste for getting us where we
are dominance obviously very easy for me to

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.449
say because i have been as people are sitting
on a piece of ground

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.459
at the bankruptcy make decisions for

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.259
but i know a lot of as i can overcome and
accounting and health

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.729
and see what's can become available

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.879
you know i think the plans made images it
is that

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.609
could be more reiterate this

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.870
pham the opportunities for guarantees that
are really not forget that much easier that

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.229
for those people are casting their energies
in the in the enterprise learning how to farm

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.500
informing with other people are four other
people

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.999
not making any money

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.300
so

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.169
to our farm jobs and tempers as you say

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.909
that's a long road ahead and freight com so
i would just like to go out as we have to

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.099
think about this ipod

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.679
you know not only your in their own experiences
that i could if it's possible to go out and

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:48.759
%uh cuny older farmers are you meet people
and holders two-star culture in that conversation

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.870
to say

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.419
you know if you're not using that land or
if you're not using all of it you know they're

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.639
creative opportunities to get people

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.409
and i think the real %uh real powerful %uh

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:01.429
hands-on

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:05.979
front end of this wage for you to be a lot
of people might be the same as rumor probably

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.409
living in portland

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.419
put down some form either or you don't have
that

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.389
proverbial let's go to make it work

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.669
we're going to go to a place within a half
an hour's drive and %uh really messed up

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.499
onto small acreage establish themselves both
in in a martin framework but also

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:25.990
in terms of their own

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.339
possibilities and and realistic possibilities
and then weaken the disciples out there

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.430
every night but he's interested

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.660
that we go to the bank did not sound like
fun

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.779
some ideal anything but

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:47.119
but did not sell now

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:51.439
advice about getting to know established farmers

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:53.059
is called

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:56.370
and it's especially important case you do
this

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.490
%uh even if they're very conventional andheri
production commodities oriented

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.479
com to come into that relationship

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:12.110
with all the landing respect for these people
because they are canceling incredible heroes

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.949
and knowledgeable people

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.409
and if you don't ever expect from a lot like
you

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.009
and they want to do things for you then

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.199
