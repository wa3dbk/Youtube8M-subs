00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.490
So I'm going to show you now how to create
beachy waves using a flat iron.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.691
This is a really, really great technique is
your hair is some where to my models, this

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.059
is her natural kind of wavy texture.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.430
It's just a way to bump that up to the next
level.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.420
Or if you have less wavy hair, maybe it just
has a big solid bump through, I would definitely

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.520
start with that texture and then build upon
it.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.669
It's really great because it going to add
a little bit more consistency.

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.980
So what you're going to do it, you're just
going to, I just go in and I hook probably

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.820
a little inch long sections.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.390
I have already prepped the model's hair with
a heat protectant spray, and a nourishing

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.230
oil at the end just to really protect it from
the flat iron.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.530
After you take your little one inch chunks,
I'm going to take two fingers and I'm just

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.330
going to wrap the hair around, and then I'm
going to gather that up, creating a little

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.330
circle here.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:09.719
Now what I'm going to do, is I'm going to
take the flat iron, and I'm just going to

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.570
heat up my little circle there.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.689
I will say be careful with this, with your
hands, because it does get pretty warm.

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.030
So after you feel like you've warmed it, I
just kind of hold it in my hand to cool it

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.490
and then when you let it down, you have this
really great little curl.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.999
So, I'm just going to continue to do that.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.079
What it's going to end up doing for her hair,
because it's already got a natural wave to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.880
it, is it's going to make it look like it's
more wavy than it is.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.240
So I'm just going to keep doing that, taking
little sections, I hold on to the ends, and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.020
then I just press my flat iron through it.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.229
I start on one side, so I can still hold on
to it.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.060
So I would just continue this around the head,
depending on what you're natural texture is.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.939
Some of you might need more than this, some
might need less than this.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.899
You can take bigger sections, you can take
smaller sections, the section size that you

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.190
take, is directly related to the curl that
you're going to get.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.580
Sometimes it's really beautiful too, to take
different sized sections, all throughout the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.110
same head.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.200
Keeps it very natural looking and organic.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.640
So I'm just going to continue this all the
way around the head, and I'll meet you back

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.640
in a minute.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.030
All right so now I've finished curling around
the whole head, and just adding different

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
textures, and dimensions to the hair, what
I'm going to have my model do is flip her

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.290
head forward, and we're just going to add
even more texture.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.010
So I'm going to take a beach mist, And I'm
going to mist this kind of salty spray through

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.760
the ends, and then I'm just going to mess
up the hair a little bit more.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.150
Which is a bit more messy.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.340
All right, go ahead and flip up.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.520
Now you can see that just took her kind of
naturally soft wavy hair and made it look

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.049
more like it was naturally curly hair, a little
bit more beachy, and that's a really great

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.409
way to get beachy hair by using a flat iron.
