00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:03.779
Online advertising has a language all its own

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:05.946
and if it sounds like a foreign language to you

00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:07.745
you're not alone.

00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:10.006
But it's important to get comfortable with the terms

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.089
so that you can make the most out of your AdWords investment.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.674
To help make sense of it all, here's a scenario:

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:18.745
Owen is planning a wedding

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:21.165
and Brenda is a photographer.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.585
Brenda uses AdWords to advertise online

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:26.006
to people who are looking for a photographer.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.216
This is one of her ads.

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:30.947
Brenda takes three types of photos:

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:32.007
Babies,

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:32.980
real estate,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.547
and weddings.

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:37.478
She uses different ads for each area of her business.

00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:41.262
Each collection of ads makes up an ad group.

00:00:41.262 --> 00:00:43.904
Brenda assigns to each ad group

00:00:43.904 --> 00:00:47.211
the words and phrases that are relevant to that part of her business.

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.173
These are keywords.

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:53.146
AdWords uses keywords to help decide which ads

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:56.800
to show to people searching for things online.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.949
Brenda's three ad groups make up a campaign.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.046
The campaign is where Brenda decides big picture things,

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:06.714
like her preferences for the devices her ads will show up on,

00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:10.631
and how much she spends.

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:15.997
Owen types "experienced wedding photographer" into Google.com.

00:01:15.997 --> 00:01:20.213
The phrase "experienced wedding photographer" is his search term.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.673
He sees two types of search results:

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:26.646
organic search results located in the middle of the page

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:30.173
are the websites that match Owen's search term.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.646
No one can pay to appear in these results.

00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:37.006
The second type of results, paid results, are usually located

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:38.312
at the top,

00:01:38.312 --> 00:01:39.174
bottom,

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:41.646
or right side of the page.

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:45.341
These are ads from businesses that are using AdWords.

00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:48.614
In most cases, an advertiser is charged when someone like Owen

00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:50.686
clicks one of these ads.

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:54.378
Does Brenda's ad appear when Owen makes his search?

00:01:54.378 --> 00:01:55.590
That depends.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.215
Whenever someone uses Google to search

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:02.423
there's an auction that determines which ads appear and in which order.

00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:05.460
Two main factors determine the outcome:

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.675
How much an advertiser is willing to pay for a click,

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:10.332
which is a bid,

00:02:10.332 --> 00:02:13.339
and something called "Quality Score."

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.713
Quality Score is an estimate of how relevant and useful your ad

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:19.279
and the page on your website it links to

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.981
are to someone seeing your ad.

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.612
Together, bid and Quality Score determine

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:30.713
where and if Brenda's ad appears on Owen's search results page.

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:33.319
Bids and budget are different.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.235
Your bids affect how much you'll spend

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:38.121
each time someone clicks one of your ads.

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:40.437
Your budget affects how much you'll spend

00:02:40.437 --> 00:02:42.863
each day on your entire campaign,

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:45.812
which influences how often your ads are shown.

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:49.713
As it turns out, Brenda's ad appears on Owen's search results page.

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:51.878
This is an impression.

00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:55.312
Owen clicks Brenda's ad to find out more on her website.

00:02:55.312 --> 00:02:57.198
This is a click.

00:02:57.198 --> 00:02:59.340
Owen likes what he sees on Brenda's website

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.104
and hires her to photograph his wedding.

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:05.746
Brenda's ad has gotten Owen to do something valuable.

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:07.214
Hire her for an event.

00:03:07.214 --> 00:03:09.840
This is a conversion.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.554
Owen is a satisfied customer.

00:03:11.554 --> 00:03:14.173
Brenda is a happy advertiser.

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:16.146
These are results.
