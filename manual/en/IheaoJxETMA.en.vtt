00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.569
How many home for sale signs do you see in
your neighborhood?

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:13.499
We are Dave and Mary from Front-Porch-Ideas-and-More.com
These are examples of homes for sale in nearby

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.800
neighborhoods.
How do you set your home apart from others?

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.150
How do you create a look that will give potential
buyers a reason to walk inside?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.220
How do you compete with other homes like yours
that are for sale in your own neighborhood?

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.432
Are you using your porch to sell your home?
You should! It is easy and it is inexpensive.

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:38.649
Your porch is a way to increase your home
curb appeal. Remember it is what potential

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.809
home buyers see first.
So how do you make it appealing.

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.039
We at Front-Porch-Ideas-and-More.com were
asked to give this suburban home some curb

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.499
appeal.
The owners did not want to spend a lot of

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:00.120
money. They wanted to create a welcoming look.
As you can see it's a fairly simple concrete

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.070
porch. Let us see what can be done in a day
to create the look the owners wanted.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.600
Let us start with two basic decorating ideas:
color and focal point.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.870
You want to select colors that complement
your home and you want to create a focal point,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.620
something that catches the eye.
We did both by selecting a beautiful spring

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.490
wreath in purples, yellows and greens to complement
the house colors.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.910
These are great spring colors that can easily
be used throughout the spring and summer months.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.520
The wreath can be seen from the street and
is an impressive site when you open the door.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.310
We found a wreath at Michaels craft store
on sale. The colors are bold but not overpowering.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.590
Now we use the same colors in the wreath on
other areas on the porch.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:57.810
While at Michaels we also found this spring
flag and purchased it for a nominal cost.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.120
The flag serves two purposes. It complements
our colors and it draws attention to the porch.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.970
Remember your 5 senses and try to incorporate
each of them in your porch decorating scheme.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.200
It is always a good idea to include something
with motion on your porch.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.210
It is seen by passers-by as it blows in the
breeze.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.600
Flags like this are easy to attach. A few
screws attach the pole to the column.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.510
Now you have instant color and movement.
Because this porch is small we wanted to use

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.700
all of it. It does not have much width but
it does have height.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.930
A hanging basket will help tie the upper and
lower parts of the porch together.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.860
Because it is still early in the year, we
decided to use artificial flowers in purples,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.560
yellows and greens.
We don't have to water it so it will keep

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.730
the porch cleaner for showing.
The hanging basket along with the wreath and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.010
the flag add interest to the upper part of
the porch.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.400
Now let us attack the lower porch. The concrete
floor had stains and was not the most appealing

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.350
part of the porch.
But that is an easy fix. We painted the floor.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.959
We purchased a gallon of concrete paint in
tan at Home Depot.

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.010
It only took about 20 minutes to paint it.
Then while the paint was drying we started

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.290
our next project.
Although our porch is relatively small, there

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.069
is space for a small bench. The bench serves
two purposes also.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.350
First, the bench fills the space with something
useable and we can paint it to complement

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.120
our color scheme.
It also serves as an enticement to the potential

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.110
buyers to sit and watch their children plan
in the large driveway or as a place for a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.500
morning cup of coffee.
We made the bench from treated wood lumber.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.709
It costs under $25 to build and we designed
it so that anyone could make it.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.360
It only took about two hours to construct.
We minimized cutting to only cross cuts and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.400
used exterior screws for assembly.
The legs are made of 1 x 6 treated deck boards

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.709
and the seat is made from 1 x 4 decking.
The back is made by cutting fence boards.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.430
You can either attach the back to the seat
or use it freestanding.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.870
Next we purchased 3 inexpensive pots at Home
Depot and painted it with a can of purple

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.070
spray paint.
We planted pansies and snapdragons in the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.640
pots. The same plants the homeowners planted
in an adjacent garden.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.340
Placement of the pots is important. We tried
several variations.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.540
This one is fine but it just does not give
us the look we wanted.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.470
They are just too low for the porch. So we
made a shelf out of the scraps we had left

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.650
from making the bench project and painted
it green.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.669
It gave us height but still didn't look quite
right. So we grouped the containers together

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.940
which gave us a lot nicer look.
The flowers because they were young did not

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.199
fill the pots. So we purchased some very inexpensive
artificial flowers and will remove them when

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.800
the real flowers grow to fill the pots.
We replaced their old black doormat with one

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.850
of spring colors to liven up the porch floor
and give it a little pizzazz.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.160
After we replaced everything on the porch,
we noticed it needed something.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.389
There was a lot of wall space between the
front picture window and the door.

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.230
We needed to break that large space and focus
attention on the porch.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:35.169
We found this nice sign at Michaels and with
a little crafting transformed it into a nice

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.550
sign for right next to the front door.
So there you have it - a curb appealing porch.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.880
The owners loved it and based upon the before
and the after pictures, we are sure a potential

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.900
buyer will love it, too.
Here is a competing home's porch. And here

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.830
is ours. Which one might you walk into?
We hope we showed you how to use your porch

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.479
to help sell your home.
