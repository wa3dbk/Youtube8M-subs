00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.790
When you are on the go or in an emergency,
you need products that are going to work with

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.400
you and make your life more convenient.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.980
We met up with Geigerrig and learned about
the most convenient piece of gear

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.699
beyond the go-person can possibly have.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.029
The Geigerrig Hydration Pack.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.199
The world's first truly effective hydration
system providing much more than just personal

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.199
hydration.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.970
With the Geigerrig hydration pack, you can
clean, cool and share the water you have with

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.970
you.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.210
The key to the Geigerrig hydration pack is
its patent pending pressurized system that

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.879
allows the water to effortly spray with nothing
more than a bite or a pin.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.769
At the 2011 Winner Outdoor Retailer Show,
3M Corporation gave Geigerrig their innovation

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.550
award for the best new hard goods product
of the show.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.120
After the show, backpacker magazine , Camping
Life Magazine and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.510
Adventure World magazine all gave Geigerrig
rave reviews.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.649
The probably most important and most exciting
for us was Branch Whitney.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.540
An expert, hiker, climber, author came out
used our RIG 1600 Geigerrig Hydration

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.939
Pack and declared the best hydration pack
he has ever worn.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.240
The spraying technology of the Geigerrig provides
them significant benefit.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.330
From spraying to drink, spraying to cool your
body off, sharing with a friend and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.930
also being clean up a wound and do things
like that.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.110
All of these are benefits.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.700
Additionally, the Geigerrig Hydration Pack
can be turned inside- out and placed on the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.910
top shelf of your dishwasher to be cleaned.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.090
Our
packs have a two year warranty from manufacture

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.659
defects and our bladders have a lifetime warranty
for leakage.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.460
Because the water in a Geigerrig is so convenient
to access, 30% more is used to drink while

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.479
50%
more is used to overall when compared to a

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.270
normal hydration pack.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.140
And when you run low, you can simply fill
up directly from a body of water abd ket the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.390
Geigerrig water in-line filter go to work.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.890
The Geigerrig hydration system, you end up
drinking more water than you do with the traditional

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.890
hydration pack.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.260
And the reason for this is because the system
do shoots water into your mouth which means

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.880
that you do not have to slow down to get your
heart rate down or your breathing right down

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.010
inorder to hydrate.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.160
He has bite that or pinch that and it sprays
the water right into your mouth.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.161
And as a result people find that they consume
water with one of these system, than they

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:22.030
do with the traditional system that require
them to suck.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.550
With the traditional hydration baldders that
require the user to suck, it was not advised

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.340
to fil up in a stream, a river, a lake or
a pond.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.980
And the reason for that is because they become
etri dishes for bacteria and grow.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.250
With the Geigerrig Hydration System that is
constantly expelling, it is constantly flushing

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.250
the system.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.300
You snap in the filter, it cleans the water
as it comes to your mouth, you end up with

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.220
a much cleaner, better, more sanitary system.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.390
When you are on the go, do not let old technology
slow you down.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.790
Be prepared with the Geigerrig Hydration Pack.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.330
The world's greatest and on-the-go hydration
technology.
