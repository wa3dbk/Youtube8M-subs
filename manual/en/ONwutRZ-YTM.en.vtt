Hi, this is Stephanie Manley with copykat.com.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.100
Thanks for joining me today,
and today, I'm going to make cold-brewed coffee.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.100
Now, I love this stuff.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.560
I
recently fell in love with cold-brewed coffee

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.820
while I was in Austen, Texas.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.100
But you know what, they don't have Chameleon
coffee everywhere, so I've

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.679
learned how to make cold-brewed coffee at
home.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.079
It's not hard to do.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.710
You
just need a couple of things to make it, so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010
let me show you what you need
to do.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.760
You need coffee beans.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.270
How about that?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.870
You actually need the whole beans,
like this, and what you're going to do is

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.700
you're going to grind them up in
a coarse grind.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.819
Now, if you don't have a coffee grinder, many
larger

00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:00.699
grocery stores do have a full coffee section,
so just change their setting

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.180
on their coffee grinder to coarse, and you'll
be in business.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.860
So we're
going to grind up our coffee, and I'll show

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.680
you what to do next.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.520
[pause]

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:23.200
Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and do my coffee
in a French coffee press

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.140
because these already have a nice filter in
them.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140
You don't have that?

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.979
You
know what, you can use a really large Mason

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.579
jar, and when you're ready to
pour the coffee off to serve it, just run

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.579
it through an old-fashioned
coffee filter.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.659
It's not too bad at all to do.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.380
So with this, I'm going to add about a half
a cup or so of the coffee beans

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.570
that are ground up, and all I want to do is
go ahead and make sure that

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.159
they're fully coated with the water.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.000
The next thing you have to do is you
have to wait.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.680
You have to wait a really long time.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.689
I like to let mine go
for about 12 hours before serving.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.520
So I'm just going to put the stopper up
on the pot just like this, and I'm going to

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.979
stick that in my fridge.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.390
Now,
this one I made last night, so I'm going to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.570
go ahead and pour this off.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:22.410
You can see you have a wonderful iced coffee
here.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.690
So now we have a cold-
brewed coffee.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.670
It doesn't cost near what you pay for when
you go out and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.709
get one of these, so here you go.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.819
Cold ice-brewed coffee.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.920
You could also
heat this up in the microwave if you wanted

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920
a hot cup of coffee.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.709
But if you
don't have a coffee pot, when you have coffee

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.510
beans, it's a great way to
make coffee.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.000
So if you enjoyed this video, please give
it a big thumbs up

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.980
here on YouTube and write me a comment down
below on what you like in your

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.980
coffee.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.589
I'm going to take this one black.
