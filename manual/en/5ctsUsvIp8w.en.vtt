00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.660
Plot the ordered pair
6, comma negative 8

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.360
into the coordinate plane.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.630
So this is a coordinate
plane right over here.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.000
The horizontal axis
here, this is the x-axis.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.160
The vertical axis
here is the y-axis.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
And the convention, when we
get an ordered pair like this,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.540
is that the first coordinate
is the x-coordinate,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.890
and the second coordinate
is the y-coordinate.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.610
So they're telling us that
we have an x-coordinate of 6.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.350
That means we count
up 6 on the x-axis.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.950
So let's count up 1.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.139
I could even write it down--
1, and then we have 2.

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.930
That's right there.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.200
Then we have 3.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.800
Then we have 4.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.990
Then we have 5.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.950
And then we've moved
up 6 along the x-axis.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.770
We started at the
origin, at 0, 0.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.040
That's the origin.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.860
And we moved 6 to the right.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.920
That's this part
right over here.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.680
Now, our y-coordinate
is negative 8.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.440
That means we move down 8
in the vertical direction.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.930
So we can see it
right over here.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.930
So this right here, I'll
just do that every two.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.360
So this is down 1.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.670
This right here is
negative 2, negative 3.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.600
This right here is negative
4, negative 5, negative 6,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.480
negative 7, negative 8.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.590
So we move to the right 6,
and then we move down 8.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.420
We move to the
right 6, and then we

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.070
move down 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.100
And we are right over there.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.592
So that is the point
, 6 negative 8.

00:01:41.592 --> 00:01:43.050
You could also look
at it this way.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.030
The x-coordinate is 6.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.620
So you move 6 there.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.630
And so we're going to be along
this line right over here.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.320
And then you can go, and then
the y-coordinate is negative 8.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.250
So you go down to negative 8.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.625
And you say, we're going to
be along this line over here.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.004
And the place that they
intersect is this coordinate.

00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:58.670
The easiest way I'd
like to think of it,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.280
move 6 to the right,
move along the x-axis,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.430
and then move along in
the vertical direction

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.540
along the y-axis.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.080
So you go down 8.
