Hello. Welcome to our bakery.

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:23.385
I am having a tea party today...

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:28.171
and I would like twelve under the sea cookies.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.933
Sure.  Anything else?

00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:33.617
No.  That will be all.  Thank you.

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:35.483
So when can I pick them up?

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:36.625
At twelve.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.446
Oh O.K. then.  Thank you.  See you later.  Bye.

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:41.671
Bye.

00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:56.940
Oh hello Little Mermaid.  Your cookies are ready.

00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:59.520
Oh thank you!

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:00.930
Here.

00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:04.400
Oh!  They're heavy!

00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:08.740
Be careful Little Mermaid.  They are really heavy.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.800
It must be the pearls.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.020
Yeah.

00:02:14.512 --> 00:02:15.550
Yeah.

00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:18.100
I think it's the pearls.

00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:21.810
We put BIG pearls in there.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.670
You know... pearls.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.270
Yeah.  Pearls.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.500
Please come-a-come... ha ha ha ha ha

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:56.720
