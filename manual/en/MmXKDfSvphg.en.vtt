00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:12.759
Hi guys, welcome, Today I am going to do Sloth
my 7 Deadly sins halloween makeup series.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.239
So, ket's get started.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.709
All the colors that I'm using are from the
Lorac Pro 2 Palette.

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:24.849
So, you can achieve this look if you have
that palette.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.119
And if you don't have it, no big deal.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.329
Just take a deep plum color with a fluffy
brush and go all over your eye as if you are

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.229
creating a dramatic socket from your eye.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:44.029
Then, I'm taking a deeper gray color form
that Palette and just applying this to exaggerate

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:46.779
the hollows of that socket.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:52.879
And with a red eyeshadow, I'm going to go
in underneath the lower lash line, and if

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.599
you notice, If you rub your eyes and you kind
get red when it gets irritated in that area,

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.459
so I wanted to apply this with a brush right
there.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:04.069
And, this part is probably the easiest part.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.749
Adding the eyeliner…

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:08.769
Because I'm going to smudge this out until
it looks so bad.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.659
Like, it's foolproof!

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:11.659
It's easy.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.099
So, just smudge it all out and then, with
a black or gray shadow, you can go in and

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.419
kind of set it.

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:23.409
If you'd like…

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:34.589
I'm going to add some lashes right on top
of there.

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:38.209
And add some silver glitter right on top,
to kind of make it cute.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.449
You know… just a little bit!

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:46.149
And with a Sonia Kashuk — I believe this
is a contour brush — I'm just going to go

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.358
in with the hollows of the cheeks and i'm
not really going to blend this in much, I

00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:52.368
want it to look that way.

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:53.368
I want it to look undone.

00:01:53.368 --> 00:01:57.699
And I didn't have a gray lipstick, so we are
going to make our own.

00:01:57.699 --> 00:02:03.699
So I just took a lavender lipstick, this is
from NYX Cosmetics and on top of that…

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:05.998
I'm going to apply…

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:07.369
Hold on…

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.769
Wait for it.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:10.969
A Black lipstick!

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.229
Right on top of that lavender lipstick, I
applied a black lipstick and it made the perfect

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:17.769
color that I really wanted for this look.

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.929
Cause Like I said, I didn't have a gray lipstick.

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:29.759
And it was sloppy and… it was just all bad,
but that was the idea of this tutorial!
