00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.580
Church of St John the Evangelist, Coolock

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.610
If you were a law breaker on the run many
centuries ago you would probably have been

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.090
very happy to see St John’s Church, because
there is a very old stone cross in the grounds

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.320
of the church, which may have been a sanctuary
cross.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.000
A sanctuary cross meant that if you had broken
the law you could stay within the area it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.030
marked and be safe from the authorities.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.780
You see they were not allowed to come into
this area and take you to jail.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.370
Usually four crosses marked an area of sanctuary
but the other three might have got lost.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.840
Experts say that the remaining cross is probably
there since the ninth century.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.070
St John’s was built on the site of a really
old church called St Brendan’s Church.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.649
Over the years the old church fell into ruin,
and in 1760 a new church was built.

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:15.050
At first it was smaller than it is now and
did not have a tower which was added in 1791.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.490
The oldest gravestone in the church grounds
dates from 1688 and marks the grave of a man

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.300
named Thomas Ward who lived in Kilmore.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.910
Some well-known people from the area were
involved with the church.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.250
The first Arthur Guinness and founder of the
brewery, for example, was a church warden

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.390
in 1777 and in 1782.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.140
The church, which can be seen from Tonlagee
Road, has colourful stained glass windows.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.630
The windows in the porch were made to honour
the people from the area who died during the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.610
First World War, among them Captain George
C. Colvill who came from a well-known wealthy

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.190
family in the area.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.640
The church which belongs to the Church of
Ireland is still in use today.
