Hi this is Matt on behalf of Expert Village
and today we're going to learn how to make

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.440
my Chinese chicken fried rice. Okay the first
thing we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.509
wash our vegetables. It's very important to
wash vegetables. You just don't know where

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.411
they've been, whose touched them, and you
definitely want to do that. Also I want to

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.990
talk about the two brushes that you can, I
mean you can wash them with your hands, that's

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.400
totally fine or you can get these brushes.
This one has a softer bristle for more delicate

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.279
vegetables, and this one has a harder bristle
for something like potatoes or carrots if

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.250
you want. So anyway we're going to use the
soft bristle right now on our peppers. So

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.520
just give them the once over. Just get them
nice and clean, just remember we're going,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.780
you're going to put this in your mouth, so
you just don't know where they've been. So,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.410
it's just always good practice to wash your
vegetables. So just kind of give them the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:09.350
once over real quickly. We'll work on our
red pepper here, there you go, and our bunch

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.680
of green onions here, just take the rubber
bands off and just give them a good scrubbing.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:26.140
And just always try to get in the habit of
washing your vegetables because it's very

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.229
important. Okay now I'm going to switch brushes.
I just used the softer brush for the more

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.530
delicate vegetables. Now I'm going to go to
the harder bristle here and I'm going to do

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.460
the celery and carrots with the harder bristle
because these are tougher. So just give these

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:54.880
a nice scrubbing and try to get, you know,
whatever leftover dirt in the crevices here

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:08.450
and try to get that out like so. Okay, now
the carrots, I mean, we're going to peel these

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.099
anyway, but still look how filthy they are.
And for me just for my own sanity I like to

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.980
just give them the once over anyway. Because
like I said I don't know whose been touching

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.889
them. So, and definitely for carrots or celery
or like potatoes, you definitely want to use

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:40.290
the harder bristle brush so, let's just kind
of, we're almost done here. Okay, wonderful,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.859
now that that's done, let's move on to the
next step.
