00:00:14.405 --> 00:00:16.221
Captain! It’s good to see you!

00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:19.189
Thanks for bringing us back, Mike.

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:20.717
I look forward to
hearing how you did it.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:22.679
But, later. Send me back down.

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:24.742
Me, too.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:26.102
The body, as well?

00:00:26.707 --> 00:00:27.793
Yes.

00:00:45.143 --> 00:00:46.294
Jack!

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:49.033
We’re all in one piece,
thanks to you, RT.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:51.181
Not all, apparently.

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:53.656
No, sir. Not all.

00:00:57.693 --> 00:01:00.691
His environmental
compensator was damaged.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.549
He paid a terrible
price for his actions.

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:07.799
Captain, I apologize sincerely
for what has happened.

00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:11.297
It was not our intention to
put you through this ordeal.

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:14.612
The rest of us are all right, now.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.379
But I think we left behind
an awful lot of questions.

00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:21.080
What has changed?

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:24.585
Yes. What’s different?

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.380
Everything looked
normal back on the ship.

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:29.897
We were only there for a moment.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.789
Nothing’s changed from my perspective.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.076
You two are just as I remember.

00:01:35.925 --> 00:01:37.656
You could use a shower, though.

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:41.901
Nothing has changed, Captain.

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:43.527
How is that possible?

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:46.336
We caused quite a
disturbance back there.

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:48.011
And Washington saw –

00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:52.646
Washington? Washington,
Washington? The Washington?

00:01:53.205 --> 00:01:55.460
Yes. The Washington.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.096
He was amazing.

00:01:58.612 --> 00:01:59.657
And tall.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:02.174
But he saw us leave.

00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:04.577
He saw us transport out?

00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:07.775
Probably more. I’m not sure.

00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:12.153
But what he did see
had to have changed him.

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.958
Changed history.

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:16.192
Not our history.

00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:19.940
What do you mean? Batarus
said something similar.

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.914
The Protellus Device allows us to
observe events in the past and future

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:26.707
through a dimensional doorway.

00:02:27.164 --> 00:02:29.170
A window into another universe.

00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:32.688
To look backward in our own
universe would be impossible,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.742
because disruption of
even the tiniest particle

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:39.552
would change our time continuum
and nullify the present.

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:41.927
Instead, another present is created.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.512
In another universe.

00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:47.110
Another universe? A parallel universe?

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:52.797
Not parallel, Captain. I think the
word "alternate" is more accurate.

00:02:53.982 --> 00:02:56.744
So you see, you could have
done whatever you liked

00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:59.146
and not changed a thing here.

00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:00.615
Who do you think you are?

00:03:00.657 --> 00:03:01.550
Captain?

00:03:01.592 --> 00:03:03.589
What gives you the right to interfere?

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:06.663
But there is no
interference, in our universe.

00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:11.284
But what about their’s?
It’s different now. Changed.

00:03:14.012 --> 00:03:17.532
You’ve taken away their future and
sent them down a different path.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.110
Even if we were able to get
away with minimal impact,

00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:22.744
they are still thinking differently.

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:25.713
They have memories of people
that don’t belong there.

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:28.237
Who is to say you weren’t
supposed to be there?

00:03:28.672 --> 00:03:31.384
Your journey is now part of our history.

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:34.959
Our most important law
is non-interference.

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:38.770
Yes. Your Prime Directive.

00:03:39.683 --> 00:03:41.885
It is the only way we
can explore the galaxy

00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:43.533
without damaging what we seek.

00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:47.880
Other cultures that will naturally
become what they are capable of.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.987
Only those that have reached
the level of interstellar travel

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.171
and communication are
contacted by the Federation.

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.690
Your Device cannot be used. Not by us.

00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:00.780
It shouldn’t be used
by your people either.

00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:03.138
What if another Batarus comes along,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.367
and wants to do more
than just ask questions?

00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:08.819
But it is only a tool for research.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:14.184
Your "research" can cause great harm
to any and all cultures you observe.

00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:16.701
The Federation may
consider that a threat.

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.616
A threat?! You would attack us?

00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:22.927
But we are a peaceful people!

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.989
Those aren’t my orders,
but that could change.

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:29.971
I assure you, Captain, the
Device will not be repaired.

00:04:30.674 --> 00:04:34.125
We will consider the
ramifications of our research.

00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:36.447
Thank you, Alondar.

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:39.682
We would be glad to foster a
new friendship with the Solonai.

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:42.583
Perhaps, in time,

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:46.308
the Federation will be willing to
help Solon Prime with raw materials.

00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:48.466
Batarus explained your situation.

00:04:49.453 --> 00:04:52.638
Thank you, Captain. We
have not misjudged you.

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:58.112
Carter to Farragut. Beam us up.

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.721
All right, son. You’re fit as
a fiddle. No sign of infection.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.770
I’d like to report for duty, sir.

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:30.516
You’ve earned a few
days of leave, Michaels.

00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:33.305
We all could use some R and R.

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:38.425
Helm...

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:39.612
Aye, Sir?

00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:42.175
Set course for Argelius, warp factor 3.

00:05:42.483 --> 00:05:43.297
Aye, Sir.

00:05:43.547 --> 00:05:44.797
Argelius? Really?

00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:47.544
Gentlemen,

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.417
I know this little place in
the south part of the city...

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:51.919
I don’t drink.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.665
Too bad. It might soften the blow.

00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:56.977
Of what?

00:05:58.224 --> 00:05:59.350
My damage report.

00:06:01.902 --> 00:06:03.764
The price of a successful rescue.

00:06:05.827 --> 00:06:07.501
OK, the first round is on me.

00:06:07.544 --> 00:06:10.357
Save your credits, RT. I’m
sending you the repair bill!

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:12.177
You don’t drink?

00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:14.480
No, but I do eat. How’s
the food there, Captain?

00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:15.791
Do you like spicy?

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:20.413
You know... you’re the
one who pushed the button.

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:21.850
So?

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:23.973
You’re paying half!

00:06:51.184 --> 00:06:53.957
The past. It is in the past.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.549
And yet my thoughts keep wandering back

00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:59.370
to those strange days
before the attack on Trenton.

00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:03.139
We took the Hessians without a single
death on our side of the battle.

00:07:03.514 --> 00:07:06.136
And then another success
a week later at Princeton.

00:07:07.322 --> 00:07:10.372
Until the strangers arrived,
I had not been a religious man,

00:07:10.414 --> 00:07:12.548
nor had I ever kept a journal.

00:07:13.196 --> 00:07:15.250
But no one else saw the way they left,

00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:19.638
and the new victories quickly buried
the memory of their short stay.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.064
The tale of the Jersey
Devil is fading into legend.

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:26.623
Now the battles are over
and we have our independence.

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:30.558
Debates rage on new and
old methods of government.

00:07:31.246 --> 00:07:33.709
A new nation has sprung
forth on this world,

00:07:33.751 --> 00:07:37.243
and yet, I cannot help but wonder

00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:40.990
if we weren’t meant
for something greater.
