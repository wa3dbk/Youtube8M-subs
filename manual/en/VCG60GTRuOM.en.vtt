bjbj Chef Walter: You know that you may have
grown too many zucchini if you move towards

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.520
your neighbors and they close their blinds.
Jan: I don t close my blinds. Chef Walter:

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.950
OK. I don t either. We use a lot of it. Jan:
We love it. Chef Walter: I went up to Blaine,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.480
visited with Heyday up there last Saturday,
and a nice lady said, Hey. Would you like

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.690
some zucchini? I said sure. Jan: This is a
new kind, isn t it? Chef Walter: This is a

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.030
new kind. Look how big these slices are. It
s just as tender as it can be. Jan: That s

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.050
beautiful. Chef Walter: Packed with seed;
it s just great zucchini. I don t know the

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.190
variety. At any rate, I thought that I might
as well share. We re going to flavor it up

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:51.070
a little. That was an 8-ounce package of already
cubed, precooked, ham. That s a can of chopped

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.480
chilies. Jan: Do you use mild or spicy? Chef
Walter: I use mild here, because everybody

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.460
here has little baby taste buds. I ve got
a hefty spoon of chili powder, of salt, of

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.979
garlic powder. Jan: No black pepper. Chef
Walter: No black pepper. You want to know

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.750
why? Jan: Why? Chef Walter: I just didn t
want to put it in there. Jan: That s good

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.930
enough. Chef Walter: Here, we ve got some
cheese; this is Monterey Jack cheese. I m

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.159
going to put about half of it in this casserole,
and the other half on top of it. Jan: All

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.520
right. Chef Walter: That s about -cup. This
is a couple cups of cooked rice that I cooked

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.950
first thing this morning. No, Jan, you don
t have to tell them everything you know. Jan:

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.599
I won t tell that. Chef Walter: I forgot the
rice on the stove and was off doing unnecessary

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.899
things like showering. Jan: I wasn t going
to tell on you. Chef Walter: These people

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.490
know me; I can t fool them. All we re going
to do now is stir all that together. We re

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.370
going to put it in a 9x13 dish or a 7x9 inch
dish. Jan: Butter? Chef Walter: I spayed it

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.009
with a little cooking oil. Jan: Sprayed it?
Chef Walter: Yeah, just to make it easier

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.959
to clean. This would not stick terribly. It
doesn t have eggs and things like that, that

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:12.770
really adhere to the pan. That goes in there.
Having done that, then we got to dress up

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.170
the top of it, just a little. I m not as good
at that as some people I know. At any rate,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.020
we ve dressed up the top a little by putting
thin slices of tomato. [inaudible: 02:24]

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.520
tomatoes are coming in. It s just about 1
months until we go to the Tomato Festival.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.190
Jan: I can t wait. Chef Walter: It is such
fun. Those people put their heart into that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.129
festival. Thank you. Jan: re welcome. Chef
Walter: ll turn the burner off so I don t

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.750
. . . Jan: Set us on fire. Chef Walter: No,
set me on fire. Jan: I can burn. Chef Walter:

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.860
There s no in this. Jan: I gotcha. Look. I
m going to give this one a hat. Chef Walter:

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.850
OK. You just never stop, do you? Jan: I can
t help it. Chef Walter: I know, [inaudible:

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:05.530
02:53]. My wife tried for 50 years to teach
me to feel that way. Bless her heart, she

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.320
failed. At any rate, I ll put the rest of
the Monterey Jack cheese on that. Then it

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.780
goes into a 350 degree oven. Jan: I have to
say, the fragrance is out of this world. This

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.380
one s hot. Chef Walter: Of course it s hot,
I just took it out. Look at the centerpiece

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.970
before we get to that pretty dish. I don t
like these little, tiny roses, but aren t

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.070
they pretty? Jan: ll take that one home then.
Chef Walter: No, I borrowed them. I don t

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.040
buy them because I m cheap. Let s take a look
at this casserole. I just want to show you

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.650
what s down in here. While I m doing that,
