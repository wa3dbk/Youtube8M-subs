00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.190
Are you training your abs enough?

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.910
Even if you told me you did them 7 days a
week, my answer to you would be no.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.540
Let me explain in today's video.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.509
What's up guys?

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.480
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.480
Ab training.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.480
How much is too much?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.560
Well, if you've seen any of my videos here
on our channel, you know I'm going on record

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.490
to say that I believe 5, 6, or even 7 times
a week ab training is great.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.490
Why?

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.059
Because these resilient, postural muscles
are built for that.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.020
These guys are ready to take on the work,
and the more frequent the work, the better.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.340
Now, that goes contrary to pretty much everything
else I believe when it comes to training.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.430
We have a very specific dose that muscles
can handle that beyond that, we wind up overtraining

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.850
and causing damage.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.130
The abs, because of their ever-constant firing
throughout the day, these muscles are different

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.289
and built for more volume.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.309
That said, is that all you need to do, right,
5, 6, 7 days a week?

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.309
No.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.540
Of course, you obviously need to have your
nutrition in place because even the best ab

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.600
program with the shittiest diet leaves you
with the shittiest abs.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Ok.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.090
There's just no way around it.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.580
But, there's more than that.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.400
We talk about direct ab training, and then
indirect ab training.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.690
And for anybody that's familiar with ATHLEANX,
you should know all about the core being at

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.970
the core of every single exercise that we
do.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.990
So, what I want today to do was to show you,
what about abs?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.800
Could we have a workout where we highly target
the abs and work them on every single thing

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.330
we're doing, but we're not even directly training
them?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.250
So, let me go right down, muscle group by
muscle group, an example exercise that's going

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.980
to highly integrate the abs without us feeling
as if we are training the abs directly.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.520
You add those two together, indirect and direct
ab training, you've got a pretty powerful

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.470
combo.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.230
Ok so let's start right off the top.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.230
Chest.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.230
Right.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.030
We take a Single Arm Dumbbell Bench Press.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.000
As you can see, when I demonstrate this exercise,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.520
if I have a dumbbell in one single hand and
I lower it down to that side, obviously, 60,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.110
70, 80 pounds, that's all pulling in that
one direction.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.950
So there's a lot of demand on my core to pull
myself back, keep my trunk from rotating in

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.110
the same direction that dumbbell is dropping.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.030
If you want to make this extra challenging,
you want to make it a little less of a chest

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.660
exercise, then lift the leg on the same side
as the dumbbell.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.360
And that's going to make it even harder for
you to resist the rotation.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.440
Next we look at back.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.730
Alright the king of all back exercises, the
Pull Ups.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.890
But as you see with this one slight modification
of the exercise that I'm doing here,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.270
the knees come up, we get a tremendous amount
of core activity.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.600
Matter of fact, we stress the lower abs which
is even better because these are even harder

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.810
for us guys to target.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.060
Now, how do I know this?

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.970
Because, as you guys might remember, if you've
been watching me for any length of time.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.930
Having a hernia surgery, I went through and
tried to do my recovery and speed it up as

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.930
fast as possible.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.500
I was down on the ground doing crunches, literally
three days later,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.900
but for three weeks, I couldn't even suspend
myself off of a pull up bar.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.900
Why?

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.370
Because it is one of the most demanding core
exercises.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.120
As soon as you lift your feet off the ground
while hanging from a bar, you already ignite

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120
those abs.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.710
So yet another way just by pulling your knees
up, to really engage the abs, at the same

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.930
time, you're getting that old classic killer
back exercise going.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.480
The next one I demonstrate here is for the
shoulders.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.110
Our Seated Long Leg Press.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.120
We all know, pressing overhead, tough activity.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.090
Even harder when we're on the ground right,
and on our butts.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.819
Because when we get our legs out in front
of us, we're really taking away any of the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.650
leverage that we once had with our legs underneath
us.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.560
Now normally guys, I want you on your feet
for every exercise that you do, because that's

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.900
being athletic; however, in this case, we're
going after a different target here.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.060
We're trying to work the shoulders, take away
any momentum, force them to do a lot of work,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.240
but at the same time,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.810
because our trunk has to stay upright as you
see me fighting here to keep myself upright,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.010
that's what's going to make the core work
overtime.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.880
Moving on to the biceps.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.010
Our Incline Variable Curls.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.549
Now, look at me do here what looks like a
regular Incline Dumbbell Curl.

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.549
But wait.

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:23.549
What's that?

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:28.920
As I come up, I actually am changing the angle
of where peak contraction occurs, right?

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:36.680
In an Incline Curl, peak contraction occurs
down here in the 45 degree range of motion.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.000
However, as I sit up, not only am I shifting
that focus to the end range a little bit more

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.889
to get a little bit more peak contraction.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.100
But, as you can see, the abs are working as
well.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.970
So, a nice way to integrate abs, again, without
even thinking about it into a standard, classic,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.630
effective bicep exercise.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.050
You guys know I love this one.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.530
The Bodyweight Tricep Extensions.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.980
This is a classic exercise that is basically
our way to take the great nose breaker/skull

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.900
crusher type exercise and turn it into something
we can do anywhere with just our body.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.810
You can do it on the back of a couch.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.000
But as you can see, this is sort of an elaborate
plank exercise, right?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.080
Besides what we're doing up at the arms, you
can see that the plank is established through

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.870
the rest of the body.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.050
You've got an established plank.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.630
You've got a tough tricep exercise with of
course a heavy dose of core.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.270
Finally, we wrap it all up with our leg exercise.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.820
Overhead Dumbbell Lunge.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.940
Now, before you start thinking, I know the
lunge.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.940
Great exercise.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.940
But how's it working my core.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.560
Well, take those dumbbells away from your
sides and put them up over your head.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.250
Thoracic extension is demanded in order for
you to do this exercise.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.790
And along with that, heavy core stabilization.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.889
As you can see, as I'm doing this exercise,
I'm going to have to lighten the weight because

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.040
it's a completely different feeling,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.169
and a completely different challenge for our
bodies than what we're used to if we're used

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.110
to having those dumbbells held at our side.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.330
But yet again, you can see at the core of
everything we do, whether it be direct or

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.330
indirect work.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.080
Well, there you go.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.780
How much core training is too much?

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.930
Well, if you're just doing your direct ab
work, guys, not enough, right?

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.410
As we see, core work needs to be done more.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.410
Right?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.350
We need to be able to integrate direct and
indirect work.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.530
And it doesn't even matter, even if you're
following our 6 Pack Ab Aap, our 6 Pack Promise

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.260
Plus, you're not going to get enough of the
combination of the two.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.870
You need to start integrating it into everything
you do.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.960
This is exactly what ATHLEANX Training is
all about.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.310
If you haven't already, guys, head over to
ATHLEANX.COM and grab our 90-day Training

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.310
Program.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.720
Remember I said, even the best ab training
workout, direct and indirect, is not going

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.790
to do anything for you if you have a whole
bunch of fat overlaying that.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.790
That's why we got you covered in the program
as well with our ATHLEAN X-Factor Meal Plan.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.240
It's geared to help you strip off the fat,
but at the same time maximize the muscle that

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240
you have.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
Right?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.300
This is not about creating skinny guys.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.210
This is about creating lean, ripped, athletic
guys.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.210
Alright.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.210
I'll see you guys over at ATHLEANX.COM.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.450
In the meantime, if you found this helpful,
which I hope you did, you'll see that there's

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.420
more to ab training than maybe you thought.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.710
But there is a solution.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.730
There's ways to do it.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.500
So, I will be back here in just a few days.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.500
Leave your thumb's up.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.500
Leave your comment.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.590
Remember, I'm getting a lot of ideas for my
videos based off of the questions that you

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.080
guys leave below.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.180
See you guys back here in just a few.
