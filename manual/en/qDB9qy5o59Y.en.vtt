- The Headquarters started to fill since then. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.640
- I’m detecting a dangerous smell.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.540
- These are Riley’s memories.  

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.620
- And most of them are happy! 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.054
- What happened? Sadness!

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.320
- She did something to the memory!

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.340
- Is everything okay?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.340
- Fine, I guess...

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.700
- I don't know.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.540

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.860
- Joy…

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.840
- The core memories! (all) Aah!

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.102

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.520
- Can I say that curse word now?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.660
- What do we do now?

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:15.715
- Nothing’s working! Why nothing is working!?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.700
- We have a major problem.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.020
...Joy would know what to do.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.015
Where are we?

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:22.840
- This is long-term memories.

00:01:23.254 --> 00:01:25.654
- We can fix this--we just have to get back to headquarters!

00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:27.080
- You could get lost in there.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.274
- Think positive!

00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:28.950
-Okay...

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.580
...I'm positive, you will get lost in there!

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.580
- Wohoo!

00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:38.154
- This is super big!

00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:39.595
- Imagination Land?

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:41.334
- Dream Productions!

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.240
- Rainbow unicorn! She's right there!

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.760
- I loved you in "Fairy Dream Adventure" Part 7. Okay, bye.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.260
I love you!

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.400

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.260
- That’s it!

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.040
- No, no, breathe! Think happy thoughts!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.740
- Things can always get better! You just need to make them fun!

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.000
- I’m horrible.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.094
- Of course not!

00:01:59.094 --> 00:01:59.794
- I’m awful.

00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:00.780
- We can improve that.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.760
- We didn’t die today! That’s what I call a complete success.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.334
- Who's the birthday girl?

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:06.884
- Ah!

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.200
- I got you.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.720
-  I wish Joy was here. 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.140
- Aah!

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.120
