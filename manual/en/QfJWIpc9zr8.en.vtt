00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.920
I am wearing the women’s Ulvetanna Hybrid
jacket by Berghaus.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.200
This is a very technical insulating piece
that has a combination of down and synthetic

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.870
insulation.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.220
The down insulation is really high quality
850 fill down and it is Berghaus’ Hydro

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.900
Down which is basically just a water repellant
treatment that is applied to each plume of

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.960
down and compared to regular down Hydro Down
is going to stay dryer longer in wet conditions.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.410
It is going to dry out faster if it becomes
wet and it is ultimately going to keep you

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.870
warmer in wet conditions.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.690
And the synthetic insulation that they use
is Hydro Loft Elite which is a synthetic material

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.940
that is made to mimic the unique structure
of down while still having the positive qualities

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.140
of a synthetic material.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.980
So in heat areas of your body like your core
where you want to hold in your heat and you

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.600
want to stay warm, you have got the down insulation.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.750
Under your arms and along the sides here,
all under your arms and along the center of

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.130
your back you have go that Hydro Loft which
basically gives you a lot more breathability

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340
in those high heat areas.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.060
Berghaus also uses different fabrics for the
different types of insulation.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.310
So on the outer shell in the down areas of
the jacket Berghaus uses Pertex Quantum material

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.659
which is very wind resistant.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.969
It has got a DWR finish, so you have a little
bit of water protection there.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:51.090
And in the synthetic areas of the jacket it
is a Pertex micro light which has a mini rip

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.090
stop.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.260
There is a full length two way zipper with
this jacket, so if you are climbing you have

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.710
a harness or you just want to vent the jacket
from the bottom, that is a really great feature

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.899
to mention there.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.600
And there is a stretchy draw cord that goes
around the entire jacket.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.220
You can adjust it from both sides.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.800
And as you cinch that bottom down, you know,
there is an area that catches it underneath

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
the jacket.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.080
So you have got two adjustment points there.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.180
Really simple, stretchy cuffs, so no adjustability
there, but really comfortable.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.710
And two hand level pockets.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.380
These pockets are set up a little bit higher
so that if you are wearing a harness you can

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.550
still access them and they actually hide away
really nicely when they are zipped up.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.190
The attention to detail and the little features
about the hood make it really nice.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.890
So starting with the brim of the hood, you
have a nice kind of harder material up here

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.480
for the brim.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.200
That makes it stick out.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.070
And underneath of that brim you have a nice
stretchy material.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:11.670
So as you cinch down the stretchy draw cord
around the hood, it cinches that down and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.180
it makes it fit really well.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.280
And as you just batten everything down, you
zip that up all the way, there is a nice chin

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.160
guard behind there and just cinching down
the rest of the hood it fits really well.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.210
It doesn’t feel like it is in my way or
too bulky, but it definitely is going to hold

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.150
in the heat where you need it.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.720
In my opinion the fit of this jacket is perfect.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.730
I am wearing a European size 12 and I normally
wear a women’s US small.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.080
So with outer wear pieces of other brands
it fits pretty true to size.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.300
And I can definitely get some layers on underneath
of this.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.110
I am just wearing a light weight t-shirt right
now.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.110
It fits well.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.210
It feels really comfortable with just a t-shirt,
but it can definitely get some heavier layers

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.650
under there if the temperatures drop.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.250
With your different types of insulation and
the technology there, with Berghaus’ body

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.050
mapping and even the different types of fabrics
that are in the jacket, the attentions to

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.770
detail and all the additional features, this
jacket is going to give you confidence in

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.130
the back country.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.640
It is the Ulvetanna Women’s Hybrid jacket
by Berghaus.
