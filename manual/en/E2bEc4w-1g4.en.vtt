00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.790
Hey guys!

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.020
I'm super excited about today's nail art design
because it's inspired by the new Pokemon Omega

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.300
Ruby and Alpha Sapphire games for 3DS.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.000
I've been a big fan of Pokemon since I was
a kid, haha, that's me outside with a marill

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.270
I made out of snow, food colouring, and a
metal coat hanger.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.570
I've played allllll the generations of pokemon
games because I think they're really fun and

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.200
great way to relax.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.860
So I'm really happy to have partnered with
Nintendo today to bring you a bright and colorful

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.550
Pokemon nail art design.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.370
It features the three partner Pokemon from
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.070
So let's get started!

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.320
The first design, which I have on my pinky
and thumb, is a poke ball.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.030
Begin by painting your nail red.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.829
Next use a white polish and paint the bottom
half of your nail with it.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.510
Then use a big dotting tool to press a dot
in the middle of the nail.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.170
Then use a black striper and cover the area
where the red meets the white with a solid

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.990
black line on each side.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.430
Finish the poke ball with a small white dot
in the centre of the black one.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.830
Next up is Treecko.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.000
Begin by painting your nail green.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.130
Then use a white polish and a toothpick to
create a white base for its eye.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.490
This will allow the colors placed over it
to really pop.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.780
Allow the white to completely dry and then
fill it in using a yellow polish.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.450
When using a toothpick for nail art, I like
to use a stippling motion for best results.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.650
Once that's done, use a black striper and
draw a long black line over the top of the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.510
eye, and then outline the rest of the eye.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.750
Then draw a black line down the middle of
the eye, and a thin curved line near the cuticle.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.350
Finish the design with some white on the eye.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.049
Up next is Torchic.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.090
Begin by painting your nail orange.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.750
Then use a big dotting tool to create two
large dots for eyes.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.090
For its beak, create a white base again using
a toothpick.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.829
I'm just doing a diamond shape here and then
extending the sides out a little.

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.139
When you're finished, give it a few minutes
to dry.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:23.010
Then add in some pink to the middle of the
white and then fill in the rest of it with

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.269
yellow.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.420
While you wait for that to dry, you can dot
the eyes with white polish.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.480
Finally, use a black striper to outline the
beak.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.469
Take your time while you do this and have
both hands rested on the table.

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.319
Finally we have Mudkip.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.370
Begin by painting your nail blue.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.690
Next you will want a big half circle on the
side of your nail.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.450
You can create this with a striper, or go
ahead and use a toothpick again.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.620
After that's done, you will need another half
circle at the tip of the nail.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.939
I just used a regular nail polish brush for
this.

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:04.379
Once those bases are dried, go ahead and fill
in the first half circle using a golden yellow

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.439
polish.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.269
Then fill in the other half circle using a
light blue.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.000
While you wait for that to dry, use a big
dotting tool to create an eye.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.469
Then using a toothpick dot two little nostrils.

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:24.060
And then use a black striper to outline both
of the half circles.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.730
Finally, dot the eye with white and add three
diagonal lines near the cuticle with a striper.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.379
There's a lot of black polish and detailing
in this manicure, so give it at least 15 minutes

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.779
to dry before applying a fast drying top coat.

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:43.319
Also make sure to use a generous amount to
prevent smearing and glide it across the nail

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.139
without the brush actually touching the nail
because that can drag the design with it.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.139
And that's it!

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.339
If you decide to give this design a try, please
share your recreations with me on Facebook,

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.419
Twitter, and Instagram using the hashtag #cutepolish!

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.659
Take care, and I'll seeya next time!
