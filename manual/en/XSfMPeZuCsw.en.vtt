00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.809
I'm Fred A. Kummerow.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.311
I'm over 100 years old. I'll be 101

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.090
October fourth this, this year. I'm a 
adjunct professor

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.590
in the department of

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.149
bio science in the College of

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.040
Veterinary Medicine.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.359
 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:39.190
 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.110
 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.810
 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.580
I didn't know that the trans fats

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.530
were involved

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.870
in heart disease at all. I got some

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.550
arteries

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340
from

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.740
both biopsy

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.920
at Carle and from people who had died

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320
of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.240
heart disease.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.299
We did an analysis on those samples

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.909
and extracted the fat from them

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.920
and then added

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.950
the solvent and did

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.259
a fatty acid analysis

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.329
on them  and found that it contained

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.549
fourteen different fatty acids

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.009
that were not in vegetable fats

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.310
or animal fats. They were strangers,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.060
you might say, to our body system,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.890
to our enzyme system. Then I showed by

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.469
feeding rats trans fat

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.909
that it was in their tissue too. So we knew

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.590
that this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.270
was actually in tissue whenever
somebody

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.579
or even humans ate that fat.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.610
And there were eight margarines

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.140
and these margarines averaged out 43
percent

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.010
trans fat. And every decade from 1910 when
this first came on the market

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.190
there was a great increase in death
from heart disease in the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.310
United States. Trans fats are dangers

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.459
because they prevent

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.580
the synthesis of a compound

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:49.050
that is necessary to keep blood flowing.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.410
It was and lonely battle.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.520
I advocated

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.130
eliminating all of 'em

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.840
but these fatty acids were too important
to the consistency

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.400
of margin. People liked 'em!

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.360
Nobody knew what was going on. Not even

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.610
chemists knew what was going on; Doctors
didn't know what was going on.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.630
They agreed to

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.320
reduce it from 43 percent to 27 percent

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.970
and increase the amount of linoleic acid

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.420
from eight percent to 25 percent

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.220
which was very helpful. After 1968,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.320
after this agreement that the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.730
amount of trans fat and

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.560
and margarine and and shortens would go
down,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.030
I noticed that the CDC yearly

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.900
data on heart disease was going down.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.580
Well I petitioned

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.629
in 2009 the

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.580
FDA to ban trans fat. I don't consider

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.200
it a triumph.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.799
I know what it was like for the
industry

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.959
to do what they did. I'm not here gloating

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.150
that this was done. I'm just hoping

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.389
that it'll happen.
