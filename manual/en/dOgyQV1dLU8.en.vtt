No party is complete without
everyone's favorite party

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.990
favor, glow sticks.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.690
But have you ever wondered
how these little tubes can

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.770
produce so much light?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.880
It's all because of a
little bit of chemistry

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.230
called chemiluminescence.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.910
[CRICKETS CHIRPING]

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.800
Huh?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.250
Chemi-- chemi--

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.230
Chemilum--

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.830
Chemiluma--
"chemiluminleshence"?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.360
No, no.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.015
It's chemiluminescence.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:53.515
Oh.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.990
The first part, chemi,
comes from chemistry,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.000
and the second part,
luminescence, means light.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.440
So together,
chemiluminescence means

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.110
light caused by chemistry.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.230
One example of chemiluminescence
is the glow stick.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.320
They're so popular
nowadays, you can find them

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.455
pretty much anywhere.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.187
Whoa.

00:01:18.187 --> 00:01:19.588
Whoa.

00:01:19.588 --> 00:01:21.456

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:22.470
All right, all right.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.854
No more funny business.

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:25.770
Let's see how these glow
sticks actually work.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.410
Hiya.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.285
Or you can just do this.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.630
As you can see, a bright
light is produced.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.150
You might think that when
you crack a glow stick,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.770
you're turning on
a switch inside,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.480
or that there's
a battery inside.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.480
But a glow stick
produces this light

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.360
because two chemicals
are combining together.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.200
Two chemicals are mixed
together inside the glow stick

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.260
to temporarily emit a
chemiluminescent light.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.352
Let's take a look inside.

00:02:01.352 --> 00:02:04.900
A glow stick has two parts--
the outer plastic shell,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.610
which we can see, and
an inner glass tube,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.330
which you might have
not known was there.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.050
In the outer layer, there is
a chemical called cyalume.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.170
Inside the glass tube is
a chemical called hydrogen

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.570
peroxide and a
fluorescent dye that

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.270
gives a glow stick its color.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.940
When we bend a glow stick,
we hear a cracking sound.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.810
This is because the
inner glass breaks.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.280
The hydrogen peroxide
inside the glass tube

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.980
flows out and mixes
with the cyalume.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.630
The mixing of
these two chemicals

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.450
causes a chemical reaction,
and they produce light.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.010
However, the chemiluminescence
light cannot last forever.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.150
Once the reaction
reaches completion,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.160
the glow stick
will stop glowing.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.980
This is why when
glow sticks are made,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.120
the different chemicals
are kept separate.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.730
Because they're so
lightweight, inexpensive,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.860
waterproof, and
produce little heat,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.140
glow sticks are useful for
many different applications,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.410
such as diving, police,
and military operations.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.440
Woo.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.660
All right.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.890
Let's go to lab now to
run some experiments.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.010
Welcome to lab.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.440
Before we get started, let's
be sure to wear our safety

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.940
glasses.

00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:17.460
Ready to go.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.252
All right.

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:20.375
In these two cups, we
have hydrogen peroxide

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.980
and a fluorescent dye,
which is typically

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.610
found in a glass
vial in a glow stick.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.790
And in these cups right here,
we have the chemical cyalume,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.910
which is usually placed
in between the glass

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.421
vial and the outside
plastic of a glow stick.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:33.920
Yeah.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.442
Let's mix it up and
see what happens.

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:35.923
All right.

00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:37.423
Let me go get the
lights real quick.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.660
All right.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.100
All right.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.683
Let's do this.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.240
Wow.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.000
Look at that.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.450
That's really bright.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.460
That was really cool.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.960
Yeah.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.530
I'm going to mix it back in,
mix it around a little bit.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.390
It's like a nice orange color.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.710
So this is exactly what
happens inside your glow stick.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.105
Yeah.

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:01.521
When you're cracking
a glow stick,

00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:05.130
you're basically mixing
these two chemicals together.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.630
OK.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.000
One more fun fact.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.140
Did you know you can make a glow
stick glow brighter or dimmer?

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.680
You can do this by changing
its temperature, which

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.450
will speed up or
slow the reaction

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.620
inside of the glow stick.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.209
So if you put a glow
stick in hot water,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.950
it'll get a lot
brighter, but last

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.780
for a shorter amount of time.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.330
And in the cold water, it'll
be dimmer but last longer.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.290
Here, I'll show you what I mean.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.170
Let's put some glow
sticks in and see how

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.470
they look after a few minutes.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.250
Let me dim the lights so
you can see it better.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.450
As you can see, the
one in the hot water

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.510
gets a lot brighter than
the one in the cold water.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.270
Today we learned that when
we combine two chemicals,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.640
they can produce light.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.070
This is called
chemiluminescence.
