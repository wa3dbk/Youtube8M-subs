00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.920
The depths of the ocean receive only feeble
light, if any, from the surface, but light

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.460
still plays essential roles in the ecology
of the deep. Many animals have adapted large

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.140
or extra-sensitive eyes, allowing them to
detect faint shadows or flashes of light,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.590
as they search for prey. Others can create
their own dim light to mask their silhouette,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.689
so they blend in when seen from below, in
a process called counterillumination. The

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.360
strawberry squid Histioteuthis -- about 8
inches long -- employs both of these strategies.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.519
It uses an array of light-producing cells
or photophores along its body to produce a

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.339
camouflaging glow. The squid also has one
normal-sized eye, and one extraordinarily

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.619
large eye. The large eye is thought to be
specially adapted to look upwards and spot

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.780
shadows against the dim downwelling light.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.030
Recently, scientists at MBARI deployed blue
lights on our remotely operated vehicles

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.000
to observe fluorescence in deep-sea animals
and further understand the ecological roles

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.030
of light in the deep sea. High-energy blue
light excites fluorescent green and red pigments

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.290
in many of the organisms: think of a highlighter
pen with fluorescent ink that appears to glow

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.780
on the page. When we shined blue LEDs on the
strawberry squid, for the first time in the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.570
squid's natural habitat, we were treated to
an impressive light show; we could see that

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.740
its large eye was brightly fluorescent, indicating
the presence of a blue-absorbing fluorescent

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.900
pigment.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.140
So, why have fluorescence in your eye? Some
predators, in order to break the camouflage

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.140
of their glowing prey, use pigments in the
lenses of their eyes to filter out short wavelengths

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.710
of light. For example, if the light from one
fish is slightly more green than the blue

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.479
downwelling light, then blue-absorbing lenses
will cause the prey to appear brighter against

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.590
the background.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.770
While many organisms have fluorescent structures,
the majority have functions we still don't

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.769
understand. In some cases, fluorescent pigments
are present because of their fluorescence,

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.640
but the eerie green fluorescent eye of this
squid is likely a by-product of the pigments

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.390
whose primary purpose is to absorb certain
wavelengths of light. In fact, the lens in

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.920
your own eye is fluorescent under ultraviolet
light. Mysterious phenomena like this demonstrate

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.080
how light performs important and unforeseen
functions, even in the deep dark sea.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.580
