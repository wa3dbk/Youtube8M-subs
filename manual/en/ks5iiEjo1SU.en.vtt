How to replace and install garage door
bottom seal weather stripping

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.539
by garage door nations. So, I'm Thomas Mello and
here is how to change at the bottom

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.220
rubber

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.259
on a garage door, if you have the T-type
bottom retainer

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.489
So, what we're gonna do is, you gotta pop out the
bottom roller.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.550
Never ever ever take it apart. You just
pop it out with the hammer. So

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.140
we're just going to take this bottom one,
pop it out.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.510
You wanna pull this out completely so it's
just kind a not up against the rail

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.410
like that. Can you take this one pop it
out, another both popped out.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.710
Now, you wanna be careful, because if this
bottom panel was to come out and flip up

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.800
you have a real bad problems. So, you
wanna make sure

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.249
we have we have some storage bins
over here, that are in the way from

00:00:58.249 --> 00:00:59.440
stopping that, but

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.649
if you didn't know what you're doing any
pulled on the door really hard

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.330
it definitely make that go away. So,
typically when guys are putting this in

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.150
what they'll do is they'll pinch down the
bottom, that makes it tough to pull that

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.550
rubber out. So what I usually do is, I'll
take a thin screwdriver

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.230
and make sure that it's not pinched up
very well, so

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.130
here's the screwdriver or we just gonna
take it.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.380
Make sure that this is a pinch-ted all
this one's very pinched.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.650
What they did is that a lot of times
they'll take a a

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.550
We'll take a pair players and pinch it tight,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.880
so you get to figure out

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.810
how to get this pinch out of here

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.810
like this and can't get it with a
screwdriver

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.180
but I gotta work that pinch out of it.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.330
work this pinch out

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.650
usually you should leave this poll rate up

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.150
if somebody pinch it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.600
made it into this right here

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.670
Okay, so we're gonna replace the bottom rubber on this
store, but as I started to get into

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.060
it, I realized that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.590
the last person that did a bottom rubber
it really really cramped

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.300
the channel that the bottom rubber runs
through. So, we're gonna replace the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.460
bottom retainer.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.940
So, here's how you change out the bottom
retainer and the bottom rubber in your

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.780
garage door.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.120
So, this is the new channel, we're
gonna be pulling and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.330
if you look at it, it's 2 T's that and the way
that the bottom rubber works

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.380
right over here, is where we're going to
be sliding in the new rubber.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.590
Once, we get this old one off, so just
gonna slide right in there

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.140
but we gotta cut that off this old bottom rubber
first. So, we're just gonna take

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.330
this knife

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.330
slide it all the way down. So, you can see
here is pretty nasty in this old

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.800
bottom rubber

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.800
and then I'm gonna go ahead out of here and
cut the old this side off.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.580
So, there's the old one

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.920
cut that off. We won't need the knife
anymore. If you look here, you can see

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.790
where it was

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.360
really messed up. So, right here is where
it was pinch too much

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.340
and we're gonna start taken out all these bolts

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.340
use in the manufacture, use these little
ones.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.410
So, we're gonna go down the whole line it
take these apart.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.410
 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.570
So, we got all those out and now

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.290
just take the screwdriver. Should carried out

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.640
 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.640
 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.900
 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.900
once I did it

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:55.419
 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.489
so this side gonna pull right out

00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:05.729
now this

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:12.729
side pulls right out. You get the new
one

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:30.389
all I'm going to do is get it started in this

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.649
T-channel. One side started

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:39.849
 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:46.849
other side started

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.259
and it's kinda got it in there

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:00.319
and you want to take a little tag at
it. Others got just like a foot at a

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:00.899
time

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.919
go ahead

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.539
keep going, we're good we're good

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:15.759
we lined up

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:22.759
 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.040
and what we're gonna do is because this sense
really messed up, just pull this

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.070
 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.470
right to the edge there and then I'm gonna
wrap-up three inches on this side

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.180
for overhangs. Can you take this

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.280
and lead extra here

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.870
extra three inches and you tuck this and
there

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.790
but you wanna make sure it's tucked in
all the way, because you don't want to

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.220
rub against the relic, that side 
perfect

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.990
so I'm tucked it instead not straight to
the edge

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:13.030
and they're gonna pop back in the
rollers seems like it's finagle distance

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.550
 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.550
and that's it the bottom rubber is installed, the
rollers are back in

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.639
