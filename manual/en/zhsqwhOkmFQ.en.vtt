00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.559
Mister: Weight Issues

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.330
Alicia: I’m Alicia, and this is my husband
John. And that’s Coco, and this is Mister.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.270
John: Our family is very active. They load
up in the car. We take them everywhere with

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.529
us. We hike. We take them swimming. I mean,
they’re basically our kids.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.859
Alicia: Mister has been my longest relationship
that I’ve had in my entire life. I adopted

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.090
him from the pound 13 years ago. You know,
I was just feeding him whatever was at the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.850
grocery store. I just was under the impression
that dog food is dog food and that they’re

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.170
all created equal. One day, I really noticed
that Mister was lazy and didn’t have any

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.600
energy and didn’t want to go hiking or to
the dog park and —

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
John: He was gaining weight.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.100
Alicia: — Gained a lot of weight. I was,
you know, bound and determined to do whatever

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.790
we could to make him a lot healthier.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.590
John: So we focused on nutrition.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.330
Alicia: We tried dehydrated food, organic,
canned, soft food.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.830
John: Well, the vet recommended that we try
a natural diet.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.010
SUPER: 43% of dogs are overweight or obese.*
* 2012 Banfield State of Pet Health Report

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.790
Male Voiceover: According to a recent study,
more than 40% of dogs are overweight or obese.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.610
Extra weight can cause a number of health
problems, including reduced mobility.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.610
SUPER: Lite Formulas

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.670
Male Voiceover: Owners with overweight dogs
should look for formulas classified as “lite.”

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.490
These are true calorie-restricted diets as
defined by the Association of American Feed

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.190
Control. Lite formulas offer complete and
balanced nutrition while promoting healthy

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.190
weight loss.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.190
SUPER: Weight Management Formula

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.729
Male Voiceover: Consider a weight management
formula if a dog is prone to weight gain or

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.210
needs help maintaining their ideal body condition.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.210
SUPER: Follow Feeding Guidelines

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.119
Male Voiceover: It’s always important to
follow the feeding guidelines on your dog

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.140
food packaging. Just like John and Alicia,
if you’re uncertain or have questions about

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.840
your dog’s weight, activity level or diet,
you should consult your veterinarian.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.700
Alicia: After about, I’d say two or three
months on the natural diet, we started noticing

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670
his energy level was way up.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.010
John: He was already starting to lose a little
weight.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.679
Alicia: He was whining to go on hikes.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.130
John: His eyes were brighter. He was just
a totally new dog. It was great.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.331
Alicia: We know that he’s in the best health
possible for his age, and that he’s the

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:22.230
happiest dog that he can be.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.660
John: Today, we are very conscious about what
we feed both of them.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.240
Alicia: We want to feed them the best because,
obviously, we want them around for a long

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240
time.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.240
SUPER: The makers of NATURAL CHOICE® Dog

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.240
