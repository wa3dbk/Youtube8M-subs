00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:18.000
Technicolor’s original goal was full spectrum

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:21.416
color photography for motion picture screens.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.666
Technicolor achieved their goal by
completely redesigning

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.833
the camera that they had been using in the 20’s. 

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:32.666
The new camera was designed by J.A. Ball

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.041
Technicolor’s technical director in the early 30’s.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:41.083
The cameras were manufactured by the
Mitchell Camera Corporation in Glendale, California

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:46.625
and remained in commercial use
from 1932 until 1954.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.291
Unlike the two-color system, which recorded the film

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.458
on one strip of black and white negative

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:57.250
this new camera ran three black and white
negatives simultaneously

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:01.791
and that is why it is known as three-strip Technicolor.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.500
The magazine on top of the camera

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:07.166
which is the part that looks like the Mickey Mouse ears

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.375
was triple the width of a normal black and white camera

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:13.541
because it contained each roll of negative to capture

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:16.166
your red, green, and blue records.

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:21.958
Inside the camera, directly behind the lens was
the beam-splitting prism.

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.833
This had a gold flecked semi-transparent mirror
in its center

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:29.791
which allowed half the light to go directly
through to the green record

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:32.833
and the other half to be reflected 90 degrees

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:35.750
onto two film strips in bipack.

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:39.083
The bipack was two negative films sandwiched together

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.458
emulsion to emulsion in the gate. 

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:43.458
The front film was the blue record.

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:46.791
And on its emulsion was a red dye,
which acted like the filter

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.708
for the red record directly behind.

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:56.041
When shooting in Technicolor,
you weren’t just getting the camera

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:59.791
you rented from Technicolor an entire package

00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:04.541
which included the camera,
a camera crew with three assistants

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.083
the film, the processing

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:10.541
and a Technicolor color consultant.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:15.291
To dampen the sound,
the Technicolor camera was enclosed

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:18.333
in an enormous box known as a blimp.

00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:22.333
Made of metal with soundproofing material on the inside

00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:26.958
it was four feet high, two feet wide, and four feet long

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:32.541
which brought the camera up to a weight
of 400 to 500 pounds.

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:37.458
The blimp made the camera very unwieldy,
which limited its mobility

00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:41.916
and caused cinematographers to become very
creative in their filmmaking.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.208
The blimp was so large, that it was referred to by

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:49.125
English cinematographers as the enchanted cottage.

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958
Twenty-nine three-strip cameras were manufactured

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:57.250
between 1933 and 1950, for live action photography.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:00.958
An additional three cameras were manufactured
for animation

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:06.541
and another three were made for
high speed photography for slow motion effects.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500
In England, because the demand for Technicolor
was not as high

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:14.750
as it was in the American studios,
only four cameras were made.

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:19.750
For his remarkable achievement of inventing
the three-color camera

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:23.625
J.A. Ball won a special Academy Award in 1938

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:28.125
for his contribution to the advancement of
color in motion picture photography.
