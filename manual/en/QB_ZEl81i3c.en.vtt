00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.720
Today I will be making aloo methi.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.810
Potatoes with fenugreek leaves.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.660
Fenugreek is leafy green vegetable packed with nutrition.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.450
Potatoes cooked with fenugreek leaves

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.940
makes a healthy and delicious side dish with any meal.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.060
This recipe will serve 4.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.080
To make aloo methi we will need:

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.439
4 medium size potatoes

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.119
Which I have already peeled and cubed in bite size

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.520
and this will make about 3 cups of cubed potatoes.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.620
2 cups of chopped fenugreek leaves (methi)

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.460
I have used 2 medium sized bunch.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.180
3 tablespoons of oil

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.619
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seed (jeera)

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.081
1/8 teaspoon of asafoetida (hing)

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.520
3 whole dry red chilies

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.140
1 tablespoon of coriander (dhania)

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.980
1/4 teaspoon of red chilli powder (lal mirch)

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.300
1/4 teaspoon of turmeric (haldi)

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.730
1 teaspoon of salt

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.320
1/2 teaspoon of mango powder (amchoor)

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.180
If you don’t find the fresh fenugreek leaves

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.560
you can use the dry one.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.840
Which is known as kasuri methi and is readily available

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.320
in very Indian grocery store.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.020
So 2 cups of fresh fenugreek leaves

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.540
you replace with 1/2 cup of kasuri methi.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.020
Before using that give it a good wash.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.160
So now first I will show you how to clean the fenugreek leaves.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.480
So we don’t use the heavy stems

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.820
so just pick the leaves and tendril stems

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.540
and discard this heavy stems.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.980
And after doing this you give it a good wash

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.520
and roughly chop the leaves.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.700
I am ready to make aloo methi.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.520
So let’s get started.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.340
Heat is on, medium high.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.980
First I will add the oil and let oil get hot moderately

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.080
before we add the cumin seeds.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.220
Oil is ready it takes almost a minute

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.420
before it's enough hot.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.080
So as you see it’s cracking.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.820
Red chillies

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.600
Stir.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.740
Add potatoes.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.540
Stir.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.120
Now we are going to add all the other spices.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.960
First fenugreek leaves.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.900
Coriander powder

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.600
Red chilli powder

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.860
Turmeric

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.540
Salt

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.620
Mix it well.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.080
And lower the heat to medium.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.300
Mix it well.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.080
And now cover it and let it cook for about 15 minutes.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.560
But do stir couple of times in between

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.200
and I have lowered the heat to medium.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.200
It has been 5 minutes.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.600
So I will check it out and give a good stir.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.300
When you open this it smells really good.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.900
Fenugreek leaves have very strong aroma.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.580
And just cover it again.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.200
So we will check it after another 5 minutes.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.140
This has been about 15 minutes.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.320
So it’s time to check this should be really ready.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.460
Mix it.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.940
It’s looking really good.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.160
Some nice color.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.940
And just press it.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.480
Potatoes are very tender.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.340
And now it’s time to add the mango powder (amchoor).

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.020
Mix it well.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.600
And aloo methi is ready to serve.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.540
Aloo methi is looking great, has a nice aroma.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.480
This healthy green leafy vegetable is enriched

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.900
with minerals, vitamins and fiber.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.340
This is my daughter in law's one of the favorite dish.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.540
I will be serving this today with dal, rice and roti.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.320
Whenever I am making aloo methi

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.240
I like to make some extra so I have left over

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.720
for next day to make sandwiches.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.380
Enjoy this great dish.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.700
