Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village. Okay when
the shorten and the butter are all mixed smooth

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:18.110
then you can add the confectioners sugar we
are going to be adding 4 cups and again make

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:42.940
it flat and even. You can put in your vanilla.
If you want your frosting to come out pure

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:54.770
white you can find a pure white vanilla in
a specialty shop. Now we are adding our milk.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.960
Mix that up until it is smooth sometimes you
want to start off slow so the confectioner

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:12.020
sugar does not puff out of the mixer. You
can alos take a bag and place that over the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:46.240
mixer to avoid the mess. Stop part way and
scrap down your sides to get all that dry

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:55.030
powder sugar mixed in. Again stop the mixer
to when you scrap down to avoid any accidents

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:11.440
and continue beating for quiet a while to
make sure that it's smooth and fluffy. We

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:19.520
are going to stop it now and check the texture
it should be very smooth and spreadable. If

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.730
it feels a little to thick then you want to
add just a little bit more milk and then you

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:36.220
run the machine again.
You can make this frosting again and store

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.230
it in your refrigerator but you have to rewhip
it right before you are going to decorate.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.260
You can also make this frosting with butter
instead of the shorten or the margarine it

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.760
would have a little better flavor but it would
be a little harder to work with cause the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.779
butter is a little temperature sensitive.
