00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.280
Change is being driven
by new technologies.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.080
It´s being driven by new services that are out there
enabling people to do more with their photos.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.280
The traditional photographic markets today
are perhaps no longer the most relevant players

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.040
and now we see a lot
of new companies,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.240
a lot of very much smaller
companies coming up

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.360
that can perhaps offer more
relevant services to consumers.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.280
I´m a big fan of digital
technology across the board.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.440
Indigo technology has brought
new opportunities for printers

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.760
who had traditionally been in
the offset of the web press area.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.400
It´s enabled workflows and personalization
capabilities that haven´t existed previously

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.200
and it´s allowing customers of the
HP product to provide new products

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.960
and new innovations to their customers at
price points that were not achieved previously.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.000
Photobox has been using Indigo
technology for the last six years now

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.920
and it´s been key in developing
our range of products.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.960
It helps us to keep innovating with
new paper, new formats, new sizes

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.040
and new manufacturing workflow.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.040
We saw some great examples
today in the demo show

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.960
and it´s a great way to have
photo quality with innovation

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.640
which is basically the two things
driving our operations today.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.240
I think that Indigo 10000 will be
very important for our market.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.720
I´m only in the
photographic market.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.920
Our core business is
digital wedding albums.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440
It´s very important
because of the size

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.360
and it gives us a chance
to make two leaflet books.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.560
We only need to
buy the machine.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.960
We don´t need to change
anything in our production

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.080
because all the other machines
will fit in our work flow

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.280
so the size is really important.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.880
Photo books are key
products obviously.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.840
Calendars, cards are key products and there are
many ways to keep developing these products

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.520
using new platforms and new
ways to engage with customers.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.560
Another big area, a big
opportunity we think,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.400
is wall décor, canvas, home
decoration, and desk decoration.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.480
All of that is a key
area of success.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.440
Cards and personalized gifting are key areas
of development as a product for us.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.200
Finally, goodies which is a very broad
word to describe everything

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.360
from a Smartphone case to a mug

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.000
There´s a big area here to
personalize people´s souvenirs

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.880
and people´s memories
into physical products.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.400
HP´s Photo Summit has been very good
from the point of view of the number of people

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.320
and like-minded people and
industry fellows to be involved with,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.520
to network,  to have
discussions with.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.960
It´s been very informative.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.000
It´s interesting to see what goes on
all around the world and different trends.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.640
There are always opportunities to
take little pieces of things away

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640
that work for your
business and your market.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.840
So, it´s a really worthwhile event
and I´m certainly glad I came.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.120
Nobody should miss this
event or events like these

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.120
because here you do a lot of
networking with other companies.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.560
You see the latest news,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.200
new things,
new applications

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.600
and that´s one of the
good things that HP has.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.440
They don´t sell us a machine.
They give us a solution.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.280
Solutions that can help us to
grow and build our business.
