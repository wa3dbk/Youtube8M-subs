00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.394
My nickname is Opasniy (means "the dangerous one")

00:00:01.394 --> 00:00:03.394
Which unit do you serve in?

00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:04.534
Miners' division

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.080
Tell what were you doing before all this, who you were in peaceful times?

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.600
Builder until the last moment

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.380
And also did repair jobs

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.380
Didn't get involved in anything at all before

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.080
Until the grief touched me personally

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.400
People were killed near my house

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.200
House, roof was destroyed by their shell strike

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.080
So I...

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.080
decided to join militia

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.820
It's... in which district, which town?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.820
Krasnogorovka, Maryinka

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.080
So you saw real events and...

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.800
-- Yes, and...

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800
Decided at once, right that 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.020
I will be defending my Motherland

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.800
So now your all you do is

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.840
defending territory of Donetsk People's Republic

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.100
our land, homes, families who live here

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
-- yes..

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.540
My home, my land, my grannies, my grandpas,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.540
my relatives

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.160
But I have friends that have evacuated

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.800
though they were normal guys, doing sports

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.860
kinda should have backbone, but...

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440
at the moment they aren't here

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.500
Well...

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.000
but there are also guys who stayed with me

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.940
till the end

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.900
And we will be

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.820
protecting our home till the end

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.080
Protecting our Donbass, Donetsk

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080
We won't retreat

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.020
I think this grief that touched us

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020
It has indeed

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.200
shown for real who has backbone

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.520
and who is which friend, comrade to whom 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
in such situation

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.980
We have arrived to Shakhtyorsk to help there

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Helped guys there

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.640
Got wounded

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.520
At the moment I'm serving here in Donetsk

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.780
and I'm ready and willing to go in combat again

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.340
till the very end

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.400
... hold there, it's not much long left I think

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
soon we'll go

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400
in combat

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.600
And we'll show these scumbags, fascists who are Donbass boys

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.280
We'll fight till the end, we will be tearing them all apart

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.500
those assholes

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.980
-- So...

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.580
we, as our grandfathers and great-grandfather before us...

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.700
-- Yes, yes

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.100
will ...

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.100
God is with us

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100
we're fighting for good

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.300
we're fighting for our grandmothers, grandfathers

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.300
for our families

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.540
will fight till the end

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.180
And I'd like to thank all who helps our army

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.620
To thank our people

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.240
people support us greatly

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.400
Literally yesterday, granny approached us

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400
she was with her granddaughter 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.880
So she approaches and gives two processed cheeses to me

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.040
and the bun

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.000
and says "Son, here, take it please...

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.880
I want to thank you with what I can

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.360
Thank you very much"

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.000
I answer "Granny, thank you but stop it, we're fed here, everything is okay"

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.100
"No, no, son, take it or I'll be offended"

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.900
So I want to thank such people

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.180
Who understand all this

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.420
I am very grateful to our people

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.640
Thank you very much for your support
