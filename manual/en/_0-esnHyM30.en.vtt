00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.970
Your pooch might be an adorable pet today,
but it's quite likely that she was once more

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.220
than just a cuddly companion.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.460
Many dogs were bred to perform a specific
task, and their physical characteristics were

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.950
selected to make them great at their jobs.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.450
Here are five dogs with crazy résumés.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.220
St. Bernards were once search and rescue dogs
in the Alps.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.580
They were kept by monks at a hospice on a
treacherous path between Switzerland and Italy

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.030
and saved travelers from snowy deaths.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.500
Originally, St. Bernards had relatively short
hair and a great sense of smell to find victims.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.300
But in the mid-1800s, the hospice workers
mixed them with another, longer-haired dog

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.110
in the hopes of improving the breed.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.110
The result?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.680
A larger dog with longer hair that accumulated
snow.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.329
These longer-haired dogs made poor rescue
animals, so they were given away to villagers

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.649
living nearby.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.680
And today there are still long- and short-haired
varieties of the breed.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.629
Poodles were bred to be hunting dogs.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.339
They have moisture resistant coats, which
made them great at fetching prey out of the

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.339
water.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830
So, what's with the fancy haircut?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.890
Some people say that shaving the dog may have
made poodles more hydrodynamic.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.910
And the strangely placed tufts of hair were
left to protect their joints from cold water.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.890
(Other people disagree and think the haircut
was first given to poodles who were performing

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.289
in the circus.)

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.360
Dachshunds were originally bred to hunt badgers.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.229
Their long bodies and short legs make them
great at squeezing into badger dens and maneuvering.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.400
They also have strong lower jaws to kill their
prey.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.550
On top of that, they have tails that are long
enough for hunters to grab onto to pull the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.080
dogs back out of holes.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.060
The Komondor is from Hungary, where it was
used to guard flocks of sheep.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.610
Its mop of dreadlocked white hair helped the
breed blend in with the livestock.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.750
The corded coat is also very thick and could
protect the animal if a wolf attacked.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.840
Bulldogs got their name because they were
bred to be "bull baiters" in Europe.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.090
The dogs would grab a bull by the nose and
pin it to the ground, distracting it while

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.459
the butcher brought his cows in to be milked
or slaughtered.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.709
Bull baiting was later turned into a sport,
but was outlawed in England in the 1800s.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.280
Bulldogs have muscular shoulders, large heads,
and strong jaws to withstand being shaken

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.430
by bulls.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.110
Their noses are set back to ensure that they
could still breath while holding the bull

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.270
down with their teeth, and the wrinkles around
their faces were meant to keep blood from

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.990
running into their eyes.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.520
Despite this fearsome occupation, bulldogs
are actually quite gentle animals and are

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.599
known for being loyal and good with children.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.379
Dogs had tons of other jobs, too, and many
dogs still perform the jobs they were bred

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.400
for.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.840
But others have found new roles.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.680
Some dogs guide the blind, and some have become
therapy animals.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.980
And some dogs have found jobs you might never
have expected.
