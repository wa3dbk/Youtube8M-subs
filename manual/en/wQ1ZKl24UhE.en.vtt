00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Christmas 2014

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
These upcoming days are marvelous, because they bring us 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000
the announcement of our Lord's coming to live among men.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.800
The moment the word "Christmas" is heard 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
people right away think: happiness, joy....

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.200
For some, it is a merely external happiness: parties, lights....

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.500
We Christians should pray that all mankind may come to know

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.300
the gift that our Lord grants us by coming to remain with us.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.700
Not only for ourselves, but also for our families 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.500
so that each home may be an extension of the marvelous home

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
formed in Bethlehem and Nazareth, despite the poverty and material deprivation. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.300
It is important to pay attention to what the Gospel of St. Luke tells us

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.300
when recounting how the Angel comes to seek out the shepherds, 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.400
who are filled with fear, as is only natural, at this amazing news

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.400
that is attested to by the Angel's presence.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.200
The Angel tells them: I bring you marvelous news,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Christ the Saviour has been born for you. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This is what happens each day with our Lord,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
who wants to come to dwell, to remain with us.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.500
Consider the people present at the Nativity scene.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.500
Jesus, all-generous, giving himself completely,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.000
because being God omnipotent, being God without limits,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.500
nevertheless he becomes a small creature so that all women and men, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.900
in every place, may dare to draw close to him and speak with him.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.000
I am moved on seeing how, thanks to God's goodness, the custom is spreading, 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and I ask our Lord that it not be something merely external,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.300
of placing in many homes a Crib scene.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.600
May it not be merely an external adornment,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.300
looking at our Lord and not responding.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.700
We have to love him, responding to his love.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.000
There we have the school to learn to love him,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
in the figures accompanying him, in Mary and Joseph.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.000
It's extraordinary how Christ chose to come into the world: in a stable, in Bethlehem.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And nevertheless, there, where all material goods were lacking,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.000
was found the richness of heaven that the earth cannot give.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And therefore, Mary and Joseph constantly tried

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.000
to thank our Lord by their behaviour, by their care for him,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in response to what they had received.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
They never cease marvelling at the gift they have received from God.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.500
May every person and family have the constant desire

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.800
to strive to live facing God and for God.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.500
We will draw a lot of good from this,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500
since by being close to God we will learn to treat better

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.000
our friends and colleagues, and also those we don't know.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.300
I think that the atmosphere of external joy found in many cities, 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
with so many decorations and lights, needs to be a spur for us

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.300
to speak about its real meaning: that it shouldn't be something merely external,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.300
but that it should also lead to a deeper fraternity and unity among all mankind.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
We have to spend these marvelous days united to all humanity,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.000
and specifically to those who for whatever reason are suffering:

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
the sick, the poor, and also the people in countries

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.400
where peace is lacking: also external peace, because of war and aggression. 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.500
It's only logical that we children of God, on seeing this God of ours

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.500
giving himself to us with such great generosity,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.500
also want to follow in his footsteps and give ourselves to the others.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.000
And we have to begin in our own family.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.200
We wouldn't truly love mankind nor people in other places

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.000
if we didn't love, in Christ and for Christ, all the people in our own family. 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.000
I hope that this Christmas will be a personal feast, 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and also a family feast and a feast shared with all mankind. 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.000
May God help all of us to be each day more faithful.
