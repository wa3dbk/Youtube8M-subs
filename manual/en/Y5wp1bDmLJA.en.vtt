00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:09.055
- Hey, so everyone has a name.

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:09.888
I have one.

00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:10.721
You have one.

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:11.554
Everyone has one.

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:12.912
And that's extraordinary
when you think about it,

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.610
because it's one of the
very few social things

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.222
that all human beings have in common.

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:21.246
So you might be a Kevin, a Felicia, bye,

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:23.570
a Muhammad, a Holly, and so on.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.286
This name is part of your identity

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:26.632
and it helps separate you

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:28.551
from that teeming mass of humanity.

00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:31.532
But how much does your name affect you?

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.538
Could it determine your future?

00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:36.350
Well, it doesn't determine
your life exactly.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.842
See, economists Steve
Levitt and Roland Fryer

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.047
studied decades worth of children's names

00:00:41.047 --> 00:00:44.438
only to find that what
your parents name you

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:47.094
doesn't really impact
your economic future.

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:49.466
Congratulations, you're not
gonna be doomed to poverty

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.076
just 'cause your name
is Ernest or something.

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:55.671
But your name certainly
will affect your future.

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:56.771
See, a study called

00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:00.608
"Are Emily and Greg More
Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal?"

00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:04.154
unearthed at least one
disturbing trend about names.

00:01:04.154 --> 00:01:05.053
And it's this.

00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:07.952
Job applicants with equal qualifications

00:01:07.952 --> 00:01:10.689
or even otherwise identical resumes

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.993
are about 50% more
likely to get a callback

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:17.424
if they have, get this,
a white-sounding name.

00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:19.744
This indicates that,
despite numerous laws,

00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:22.686
discrimination still
thrives in the workplace.

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:25.504
Your name doesn't just
tell people about you.

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:27.338
It tells people about your parents.

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:29.909
And it gives them a way to place you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.745
in their vision of society.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:34.154
And this isn't about whether
their vision is correct.

00:01:34.154 --> 00:01:35.254
That's a prejudice.

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:37.009
But it does affect how people

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.746
with these expectations and mindsets

00:01:39.746 --> 00:01:42.355
will address and interact with you.

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:43.782
And that's not all.

00:01:43.782 --> 00:01:46.969
Your name may also play
a role in your career.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:47.911
This theory is weird.

00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:50.031
It's called nominative determinism.

00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:51.991
The idea that your name may affect

00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:53.866
the way you interact with the world,

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:57.335
including anything from donations
to your choice of career.

00:01:57.335 --> 00:01:59.988
So, for example, is
someone named Helen Painter

00:01:59.988 --> 00:02:01.782
more likely to be an artist?

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:05.740
Or someone named Jimmy Hog
more likely to work with pigs?

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.026
Matthew Mirenberg and John Jones think so.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:11.169
In their study, see if
I can get this right,

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:15.051
"Why Susie Sell Seashells by the Seashore:

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.622
Implicit Egotism and
Major Life Decisions."

00:02:17.622 --> 00:02:19.133
It's long, but that's the title.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.483
These researchers found that

00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:22.973
people are more likely to choose careers

00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:26.111
whose labels resemble their own names.

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.825
So, to use one of their examples,

00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:30.359
people named Dennis or Denise

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.776
are overrepresented among, can you guess?

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.646
Spot on, dentists.

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:39.094
Mirenberg and Jones believe this happens

00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:41.094
because people prefer things that

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.825
they connect with themselves,
including their names.

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:46.272
Other scientists, like
University of Pennsylvania's

00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:49.864
Uri Simonsohn, are skeptical
about this whole idea.

00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:52.560
You know, are we drawing
tenuous conclusions

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.703
where none exist just to
support a neat thought?

00:02:55.703 --> 00:02:58.636
Now, we haven't even talked
about name changes yet.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.867
Or the weird name changes
people have tried in court.

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.619
And, yes, I'm looking at you,

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.434
Roman CEO Sir Tasty Max Billion.

00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:07.699
And we also haven't talked about

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.274
the multi-generational popularity cycle

00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:11.541
that names experience.

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:12.560
Or, as I like to call it,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.745
the rise and fall of Britneys and Ashleys.

00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:18.176
But let me know what you think.

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:20.999
What do you think your
name says about you?

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.434
Guys, I hope you dig this video.

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:23.945
If so, make it official.

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:26.029
Toss me a like somewhere at the bottom.

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:28.315
Let your friends know there
might be more to their names

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:29.758
than they suspect.

00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:32.174
And be sure to subscribe so you don't miss

00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:34.013
a moment of Brain Stuff.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.092
Oh, yeah, and my name's okay.

00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:37.716
But, if I have to trade it for something,

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:42.291
I would go with Max Powers:
Astronaut with a Secret.

00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:43.965
The whole thing, though.

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:44.798
The whole thing.

00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:48.631
Like Max Powers colon
Astronaut with a Secret.
