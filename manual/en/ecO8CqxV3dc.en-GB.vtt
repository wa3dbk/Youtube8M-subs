00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.820
I am Leszek Borysiewicz, 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.220
the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.700
Today has been a very special day 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.280
at the University of Cambridge. 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.900
In this event of recognising 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.900
the gift of the Sierpiński Tree.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.900
We are very happy that we can have 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900
the Sierpiński Tree here, 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.080
especially next to the Faculty of Mathematics. 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.780
The Sierpiński Tree underlines 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.040
an important principle that here was 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.040
a basic piece of work that was done

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.180
that is only seeing its true benefits 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.860
in the mathematics of today. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.220
And its location 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.080
between the Institute of Mathematics

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.060
and the Newton Institute

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.920
actually portrays where it rightly sits. 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.280
Some people  whom I have met here

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.000
knew Sierpiński,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.880
so they remember him and his achievements.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.040
It was in 1915 that he was researching 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.240
on topological properties of curves.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.400
He constructed a curve with the property

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700
that every point of it was actually

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.000
at the end of three disjoint arcs of the curve.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.900
He started that at large scale

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600
and then got smaller and smaller.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.500
And the curve filled a shape 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.120
which looks like a number of triangles

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.280
of a large size, and then many more

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640
triangles of smaller size joint together. 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.740
And this these days is knowns as

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.040
the Sierpiński triangle.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.400
A very natural extension 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.960
to an object in three-dimensional space 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200
is what we call the Sierpiński tetrahedron,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.960
which consists of four tetrahedra,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960
one sitting on top of the other three,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.380
and then again you have the self-similarity.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.520
From there is but a short step 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.020
to introduce a branch and sub-branches

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.780
that join up the parts to get the Sierpiński Tree.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.260
Many areas of mathematics are

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.960
very much dependent on the work

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.600
that has been done in Poland. 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.420
Polish mathematics continues 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.180
to have an enormous impact.  

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.480
The relationship between 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.480
the University of Cambridge and Poland 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.280
are hugely important. 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.200
Many of the linkages that we have 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.200
are very real and very active today.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.560
We have a teaming proposal together with

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560
the Wrocław University of Technology.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.040
I have direct bridges with 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.200
the Jagiellonian University in Kraków,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.780
particularly in life sciences.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.940
We have linkages with the University of Warsaw, 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.920
also in Gdańsk and Łódź as well. 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.860
These are really important

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.280
because at the end of the day

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.920
we live on a very small planet

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.060
and working together we can solve

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.460
many global problems.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.600
I’m Stanley Bill, 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.960
Lecturer in Polish Studies at Cambridge.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960
Poland is by far the largest 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.560
of the new member states 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.540
of the European Union,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.840
so it’s an important market

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.360
for the United Kingdom going forward.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.380
Secondly, its geostrategic significance, 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.000
and that’s becoming increasingly clear

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.220
over the last few years. 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.220
So that’s why I think the study of Poland

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.740
is particularly important to Britain.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.980
Besides the fact that it’s a fascinating subject 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.940
worthy of study in itself. 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.680
I thought I was privileged to be part of

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.880
the pioneering course at Cambridge,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.760
studying Polish. 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.900
Living in a country where we have

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.440
lots of Polish people coming in,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.560
we really don’t know anything

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.720
about their own past. 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.020
It really opens your eyes 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.160
to what lies beyond

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.380
our concept of western Europe. 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.700
It’s been so much fun pending into

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.700
history you’ve never considered before 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.260
from en eastern perspective. 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.920
I think it’s been a really interesting opportunity. 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.160
The main purpose of this new pilot program 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.100
in Polish Studies at Cambridge:

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.940
first of all to introduce 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.940
a new generation of British students 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.000
to the history of Polish culture

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.140
and to the Polish language. 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.180
Secondly, to have a broader impact.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.600
We organise a series of special events

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.960
which are open to the public. 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.300
We can see ourselves 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.580
almost in a promotional role for Poland,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.840
but also at the forefront of new,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.280
innovative approaches to teaching 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.040
and researching Polish culture. 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.980
Here at Cambridge University 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.060
we have Polish students, 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.060
more than 200 students here. 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.720
In the UK there are 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.060
around 8,000 Polish students right now.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.600
I think it’s a great number

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600
and we are creating a wonderful community.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.200
The Cambridge University Polish Society

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200
was created in 2008.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.680
Every year we’re organising a range of events

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.680
aimed to promote Polish scientists,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.680
Polish students here in Cambridge.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.000
The most important initiative is probably

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
‘Science. Polish Perspectives’ conference.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.540
Apart from that we are organising

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.820
‘Next Step Poland’ conference.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.540
It’s aimed to bring along Polish students 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.540
interested in their career in Poland,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.540
as well as Polish employers

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.080
who promote opportunities for Polish students,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.800
as well as show that actually in Poland

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.240
there are as many challenges 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.420
and as many great places to work at

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.480
as here in England.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.040
We need such fantastic Polish students

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.180
here in Britain, 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.120
and we hope they will 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.020
come back to Poland.
