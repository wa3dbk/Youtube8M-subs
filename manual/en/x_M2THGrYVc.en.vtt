00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.210
I am Rudolf

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:07.810
My big town is Madang.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.445
My small village is Matugar. 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.295
I left my mother and I will travel to the white man’s place.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.655
Men and women together came and cried for me.

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:45.940
I left my small village and traveled to the white-mans’ place. 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:01:03.150
I arrived in the white-mans’ place, I saw many things and many men and women. 

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:13.644
I arrived at the white man’s place called Santa Fe. 

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.882
There I attended training.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:30.564
At the Living Tongues Institute I learned many things. 

00:01:36.978 --> 00:01:49.326
At the end of every class, together we have dinner at restaurants.

00:01:51.978 --> 00:02:07.872
One night each of us talked of our place, we talked about our language.

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:21.480
Finally, I came back to my village. 

00:02:22.254 --> 00:02:34.848
I’ll tell everyone the things I learned from school.
