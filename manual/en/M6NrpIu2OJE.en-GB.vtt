00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
This video covers recommendations on setting your controls up 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.900
to improve ability using Flight Assist Off.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.440
To adequately control a ship with Flight assist off,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.980
 you absolutely need access to all 6 degrees
of freedom.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.010
These 6 axes are as follows:

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.090
The three rotational axes pitch, roll and yaw.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.040
 I am controlling these with my right
hand stick.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.109
The three positional axes are lateral thrust,
vertical thrust and throttle.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.640
I am controlling lateral and vertical thrust
with my left hand joystick and throttle with pedals

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.820
Though my set up is unusual, the arrangement

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.820
of these controls matches with common setups
such as HOTAS, gamepad or a joystick and keyboard

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.960
With a HOTAS I would recommend using your

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.569
stick for pitch/roll/yaw and a thumb or finger
hat on the throttle

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:09.200
to control lateral and vertical thrust.
For a gamepad we could consider my 2 joysticks

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.200
as matching the two thumb sticks on the pad.
For mouse/keyboard users it will be a little

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.140
different.
I recommend setting the mouse to control pitch

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.250
and yaw, the WASD keys for lateral and vertical
thrust

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.420
and the Q and E keys for roll. Throttle could
be increased and decreased using thumb buttons

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.530
on the mouse
or your preferred choice of keys. If you only

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.240
have access to digital on/off keys for throttle
then

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.899
binding keys to forward and reverse thrust is recommended for FA-off flight.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.770
Finally you will need easy access to turn
Flight Assist on and off. If you do have a

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.390
joystick
I suggest setting this to toggle in the options.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.969
If using mouse and keyboard you may prefer
it to be a hold/release

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.759
function and only use FA-off for quick maneuvers.
Watch the next video to see how to perform

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.509
basic FA-off control.
