Long Island Web Design. Maybe you're thinking about having your
first website or

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.090
maybe you just need a new better one in
any case

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.759
you should know at least some other
basics about web design no worries

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.379
it will only take three minutes first
ball let's face it

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.160
the website is the core of your online
marketing activities if you look at all

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.030
the marketing channels and techniques

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.030
what the actually do is bring visitors
to your website

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.070
in the main purpose of the website is
turning these visitors

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.170
into customers in marketing terms this
is called conversion

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.519
a bad website will basically cuz you to
waste money and other marketing methods

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.289
because you don't need more visitors if
you can turn them into customers

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.719
so the better your website is the more
visitors are converted

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.609
into your customers then it doesn't
really matter whether your cell consumer

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.909
products online provide local services

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.100
or build house s many people in the
industry called themselves the web

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.800
designers

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.679
but they really are just a bunch of
geeks with some basic coding knowledge

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.979
of course without much planning they
will pretty quickly create a website for

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:02.409
you

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.290
with lots of information photos contacts
but the question s

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.390
is that the way to turn the visitors
into your customers

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.200
is that what you need in the answer is
simple: no

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.000
what you have to do is look for someone
serious about web design

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.120
well that's where we come in this is how
we

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.960
make web sites by following this seven
phase web design process

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.530
phase one analysis the first step is
always about

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.680
information-gathering identifying things
like the website purpose calls

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.970
in target audience phase 2 planning

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.200
a plan includes a definition of this
site map structure

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.410
in technologies that were about to use
face three

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.780
design not only do we focus on wireframe
models

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.660
individual style in this stage but also
on the usability of the user interface

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.430
for the best possible user experience

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.310
face for content a very important part
of the process

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.500
is choosing the right tax photos or
videos

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.340
all optimized out only for your visitors
but also for search engines

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.690
face fact development here we actually
create the website using the Hypertext

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.280
Markup Language in cascading style sheet
with some help from databases

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.240
in other technologies as well

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.150
if needed our website can be made
accessible to mobile devices still

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.270
face six testing we test all the
technical features

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.850
like cool in scripts compatibility with
major browsers but we also ask ourselves

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.420
if the website really fulfills its
purpose face seven

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.810
deployment after we launched the site
our job is definitely not done yet

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.740
we always monitor what's happening after
the start enabling us to fix any

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.340
possible deficiencies

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.410
and if you want we can also manage to
future maintenance

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.670
in updates for you as you've just seen

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.200

should be done hand our customers agree
