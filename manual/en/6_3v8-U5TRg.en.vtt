00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.239
- [Instructor] Welcome to
Tomahawk DIY, everyone.

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:04.470
Today I wanna show you how to build

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.534
a simple swing set.

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:08.244
It's very easy to put together,

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:09.711
doesn't take much time,

00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:13.153
and it'll save you a lot
of money over buying.

00:00:13.153 --> 00:00:15.153
So you can see the construction of this.

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:18.153
It's simply two A frames at the end,

00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:22.042
with the beam across the top.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.257
And then there's some swings hung on it.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.295
It'd be very easy as well

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:27.228
to take and build a platform on one end

00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:29.734
and secure a slide to it.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:32.067
So let's take a closer look.

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:36.760
On the A frame we've got
some four by four posts

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.486
that have been put together.

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:40.736
These were some 10 footers.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:46.448
And then a couple support
beams here and here.

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:50.946
This one's got a bolt going through.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:54.011
Going into it, rather, a big lag screw.

00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:54.844
And some other screws.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:56.163
You could use some decking screws,

00:00:56.163 --> 00:01:00.163
or get some lag type
screws to go into the wood.

00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:04.889
So put those together.

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:09.551
One of the keys to this swing set is

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:12.551
up at the top of the A, you can see.

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:15.055
The key to the construction here

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:17.559
is getting your crossbeam secured

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:20.129
with the two As on the end.

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:22.605
You can see this angle bracket that's used

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.503
to simply help hold things together.

00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:26.890
And the four by four posts

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.640
have been notched out right here.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.002
Running through from one side to the other

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:36.335
is a large bolt.

00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:41.604
It's simply drilled through

00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:45.271
to help secure and hold
everything together.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.438
On the top of your A frame,

00:01:52.438 --> 00:01:56.188
you wanna cut the four
by four legs for the A

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.479
so that they line up nice and smooth

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.105
with this four by six beam across the top.

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.385
There's a plate put over
the end of the A frame

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:09.969
just to cover up some of the mess there,

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.289
leave it looking a little bit nicer.

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.622
So, once you construct the two A frames,

00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:19.779
put the beam up,

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.863
and then it's simple a matter of securing

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:23.883
whatever attachments you want

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:26.999
to the top of your beam here.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.966
You can see these brackets with chains

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.682
and simply some swings.

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:33.926
Obviously you could put rings up,

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:37.176
or trapeze bars, things of that nature.

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:41.297
So, there you have it,

00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:44.061
a very simple swing set to put together.

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:46.812
Easy to do, doesn't cost too much money,

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:49.661
and can be done in an afternoon.

00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:51.464
If you wanna take it a step further,

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:52.318
build a little bit more,

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:55.587
add a platform on one end
of the A frame with a slide,

00:02:55.587 --> 00:02:58.527
kids'll have a great time.

00:02:58.527 --> 00:03:00.958
Take a look below, I've
got a link to Amazon

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.411
where you can pick up swings

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.331
and equipment to secure your swing set.

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:08.734
Thanks for watching Tomahawk DIY.

00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:10.151
Have a great day.
