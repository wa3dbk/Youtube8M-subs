00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.220
My PS4 beeps but won't turn on.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.170
This is really annoying.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.060
Check to see if it is stuck in rest mode,
with the light staying orange.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.040
One shortcut is actually turning it off and
then back on.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.250
That may only fix it until the next time it
goes into rest mode.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.499
Once it comes on, go to the settings menu
and tell it not to update in rest mode.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:34.350
The unit may beep but not turn on because
the unit cannot complete downloads of updates,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.590
has errors trying to complete updates, or
connection problems timing out the update.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.580
I’ve heard jokes about software engineers
thinking they can fix hardware problems and

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.490
vice versa, but this is literally.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.490
Literally literal.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.830
That is not funny.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.400
What else might it not be turning on?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.650
Make sure it is not giving you the blue light
of death; that may only be fixed by taking

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.820
the HDD out and putting it back in.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.380
I thought disconnecting everything, turning
it off, reconnecting everything and turning

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.360
it on could fix that.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.610
Hold down the button for thirty seconds, long
enough for two beeps, until it comes up in

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.180
safe mode.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.740
Please do not tell me this is the Sony equivalent
of if in doubt, reboot tech support.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.940
After bringing it up in safe mode, you can
select to run any updates that might have

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.760
failed while it was in rest mode.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.710
Use the update system software option.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.520
I can restart it at that point, too.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.580
You can do a restore to default settings,
if it updated recently and then lost its mind.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.920
Sometimes the updates themselves cause problems
like this.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.180
How do you know it might be the update?

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.930
Because Playstation 4s were getting stuck
in rest mode after a firmware update in the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.930
past.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.290
I would not be surprised if it happened with
a subsequent update.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.460
What do you think about rebuilding the database?

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.430
You’ll lose the information that is not
saved to the cloud, but it is less destructive

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.490
than initializing the PlayStation 4.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.009
It also does not delete the system software.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.390
That’s what initializing PS4 with the reinstall
system software does.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.530
That’s pretty much the last option short
of declaring it a brick and practicing shot-putt

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.570
with it.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.320
No, calling tech support is the option before
that.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.750
Any other ideas of what I can try before that
point?

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.060
Log into PSN with your account and make sure
it is still active, and update any information.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.190
You might verify your email in case the PS4
will not come on because it cannot figure

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.730
out how to give you a verification screen
coming out of rest mode.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.990
I’m just tired of glitches like that.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.580
Still not as bad as an Xbox One.
