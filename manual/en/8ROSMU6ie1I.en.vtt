Hi! This is Elise McMahon for Expert Village.com
and in this video series we are talking about

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.980
puppy care. If you would like to find out
more about my services, you can visit my website

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.150
at canineheadstart.com. So in the last video
clip we were talking about puppy crates and

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.840
why we crate puppies. We showed you an example
of a small puppy crate and we are now moving

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.250
up as the puppy grows the crate size needs
to increase, so we have got here a larger

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.119
crate size, you can see it right here. This
crate is a front door opening crate. You can

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.050
get crates that open in the front and some
crates have a door that opens on the side.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.780
So depending on where you are going to put
the gate, you might want to consider what

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.850
kind of crate you need. Another thing to think
about when you are thinking about crates is

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.290
you want to have the crate in an area of high
traffic. You want the dog to be with you,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.399
so if you are going to have a puppy in a crate,
you do not want them in a basement somewhere

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.760
or in a small confined place, this crate is
situated right in the middle of the first

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.600
floor of the house and like the last crate,
this crate has a metal bedding on it and then

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.310
it has a nice soft bed on top of the metal
bedding. You will see that I have got a sheep

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.619
skin blanket on top and I am using the top
of the crate to store some stuff and inside

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.340
the crate we have a squeaky toy for the puppy
and in my hand, I have got a treat ball and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.520
inside the treat ball little cookies for the
puppy, so we are going to show you how to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.560
get the puppy to go in the crate, Hey baby
Raven; puppy is unfortunately sleeping, okay…

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:52.169
You want a cookie. Come on, let’s go. Okay
toss the cookies in the crate and we have

00:01:52.169 --> 00:02:00.170
tossed the treat ball in their for the crate,
make sure tails are in, and you can close

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.259
the door. You can see that she fits just fine
in there. There is room for her to stand up;

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.670
there is room in there for her to lie down.
She can sit down, she can move around, she

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.050
is not confined; she would be quite comfortable
in there, if I had to leave her for a couple

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.710
of hours. She is probably going to stay in
there and see if she can get the treats out

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.270
of the treat ball.
