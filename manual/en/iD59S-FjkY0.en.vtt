00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.900
In computing, teamwork is absolutely
crucial, to be able to work with others and

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.010
come up with innovative, multi-minded
solutions

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.200
and that's very important, and you'll get so many opportunities. The degree offers so much directly offer so group work.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.900
What I've really enjoyed about the course so far is interacting with the lecturers - they're so enthusiastic

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.669
and I love learning from them. And also the extra opportunities as well.

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.939
I've had a chance to be involved with the
student company so I developed software.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.150
So what's running behind me is my graphics coursework that I produced for the graphics module.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.020
I have had no experience of graphics up until
this point so it's quite a challenge,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.620
putting everything together and seeing
how things worked and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.500
learning about the mathematics behind
the graphics, as well.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.929
The hardest part of this coursework for me was making sure that everything matched up

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.890
so when one domino falls... making sure the other one falls at the specific

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.100
time in which it's supposed to and not anytime before or after.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.859
I think I could definitely improve this
graphic coursework but I am pleased with...

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.100
I had no experience before and I've learned quite a lot.
In my second year, during the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.950
first term, I studied professional and
social aspects of computing and I...

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.799
I was a bit wary of this module but then
I started to get into the swing of

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.420
things and it's just so valuable to
know about the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.290
external environment and how that
impacts on the computing field

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.950
and how we impact on that field and I've
really enjoyed that module.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.420
Aston Active Software Engineering deliver software for real clients.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.500
We have the opportunity to interact and learn from these real clients and I really enjoyed that.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.820
It's easy to forget that software is
for end clients

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.270
and not to get carried away, developing and to listen to their needs.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.799
The challenge was to create a course
information system

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.810
so all of the... EAS, schools, courses and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.610
the programmes, the modules on that course, just so the information is centralised

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.149
and can be easily managed.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.850
I helped to run the Computing Science Society so that involved just getting

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.400
together like-minded students and
exploring our interests of computing some more.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.500
And we host all sorts of events.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.600
I'm hoping to get into the software engineering field, so manage software projects - I really enjoy that.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.700
And I'm always looking to shadow
industry professionals to get more experience and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.489
the contacts I've made through lectures and

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.170
the society have enabled me to learn more about the work culture of these companies

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.840
and exactly what their
requirements are.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.800
I think what I'll really take away from
Aston is just getting to know the lecturers

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.120
and my colleagues on the course and just
learning from them. They've given me

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.879
such lovely tips that I can take away and
hopefully use to better myself.
