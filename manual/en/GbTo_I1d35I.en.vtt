00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.230
-Ready?

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.420
-Yeah. Fight night!

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.420
-All right, remember everything we
talked about.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.580
Don't panic, don't get angry,
don't be over eager,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.620
and don't talk to Trish.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.690
You control the pace of the fight,
not your opponent.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.640
Who's first?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.400
Come on then.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.040
-You okay?

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.640
-Yeah.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.160
-Next?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280
-Watch out for that right hand.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.960
TEN: Uh oh.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.160
Oh no.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.000
-I'm not going to hold back 'cause
your a girl, okay?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.940
-Good. Me neither.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.920
-I'm not a girl.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.680
-Prove it.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.860
-That's gender stereotyping.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.700
-Good eye.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.920
-Good thing I'm here.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.800
-Fight!

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.520
-Do we call that a tie?

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.520
[Groans of approval]

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.320
-Good

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.000
-Yeah.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.320
-Nice tie!

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.240
That's a really nice tie.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.910
-Round two.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.960
-Oh no, Ten. Here he comes.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.280
-You want to get in on this?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.440
-Oh, definitely.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.640
-P-A-I-N. Here comes the pain,
here comes the pain.

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.709
-In a little bit.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.789
-The M-A-N, here comes
the man, the man with the--

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.680
-There it is!

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.681
-Booch!

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:32.280
Are you okay?
Is your windpipe collapsed?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.480
-I'm fine. That was sweet.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.611
[Guys chuckling]

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.219
-Enough fooling around!

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.960
-Well, I guess that makes it
my turn.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.040
-Let's go, Riley. C'mon now.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.640
JONAS: You I'm a little more
reluctant to hit.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.400
-I could have sworn you were
dying to hit that.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.289
-Hey-o!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.870
-Thanks, Sebastian. This wasn't
weird enough already.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.110
-Are they a thing?

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.720
-Okay. You got me. Good game.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.440
-This is not a game! Get back in
there and actually fight.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.080
-I'm on it!

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.320
-No nut shots, please.

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.489
My stomach still feels like it
was squeezed like a sponge.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.880
-Let's go, Riley!

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.560
-Ha ha!

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.280
[Guys cheering in surprise]

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.440
-Yeah!

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.450
-Really? You're not gonna
hit me?

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.040
-You should just fight Sebastian.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.680
-Come on.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.000
Come on!

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.150
-Oh!-kay.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.200
[Guys laughing]

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.680
-Ha HA!

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.960
-Oh!

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.600
[Laughing]

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.760
-Come on!

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.200
[Laughing and clapping]

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.760
RILEY: Okay!

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.000
RILEY: Goodness!

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.000
-I'm tired of this game.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.480
Oh, yeah. They're a thing.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.320
[Guys laughing]

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.540
-OH!

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.120
-What?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.680
-He doesn't get back up.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.960
[Bat lands, Riley groans]

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.120
[Bat lands, Riley yelps]

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.240
[Bat lands, CRUNCH]

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.800
[Bat lands, smack]

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.080
[Bat lands twice more]

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.590
-Still think this is a game?

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.920
How 'bout you, Riley?

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.500
Riley, doesn't think so.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.680
Why are you guys here?

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.400
What do you expect to get
out of this?

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.240
Danny?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.960
-Money.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.760
-Why?

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.340
-Because girls like guys with money.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.400
-Then you don't want money,
you want girls.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.420
Why?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.440
-Why do you think?

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.750
-Answer me!

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.230
-Because I'm alone.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.790
-Fine. Ricky?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.080
-Respect.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.160
-Well, joking around all day is a
great way to get it,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.640
don't you think?

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.560
Precious?

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.560
-For people to use my real name.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.120
-That's the same as Ricky's,
you want respect.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.070
Well, guess what?
You're not going to get it.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.620
Respect comes two ways.
It's earned or it's taken.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.720
You bunch are never going to
earn any respect.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.500
You don't accomplish anything,
you don't build anything,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.970
you don't care about anything.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.860
I'm trying to show you
how to take it.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.080
If you throw money at someone,
they don't respect you,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.420
they respect your money.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.480
But if you HURT them,
they respect YOU.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.960
You can't ignore pain, you serve
it or you get out of its way.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.760
We know where there's more power
than anyone has seen before

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.440
and we can use it to hurt...

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.280
everyone.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.920
This is not a game.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.180
By the time I get back, you guys
better be ready to

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.180
fight the Electricon.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.280
And get rid of Riley's body.
