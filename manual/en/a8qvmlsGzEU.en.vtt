I'm here with Alvar "Araneae" MartÃ­n, a well known Spanish jungler and League of Legends personality at Gamergy. What do you think about the event so far? 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Each time more people come to these eSports events and they have way more audience each time. Another positive aspect is that each time more people know people like us or xPeke,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that were a bit more hidden in the past. People used to come to see youtubers and stuff.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, little by little, people know more and more the Spanish scene and its professional players like us. It's an honor, I like this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now that you've mentioned youtubers, you've recently started in the content creation world. Are you satisfied with your work so far?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The thing about YouTube is that you are never satisfied when you start. An example of this could be Rubius (a famous Spanish youtuber), 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
who was around a year with hardly any visits and now is a kind of boom.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
People watch you more and more and you start growing. That's more or less the moment I'm living. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I've been creating videos for a month, I don't have many subscribers and either a salary that made me say "Hey, this is done, this is the future". 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But I do think that YouTube could give me a good monetary future. That's why I'm focused on that, so I can develop my subscriber base and grow little by little.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So there's no possibility for us to see you in the competitive scene in the short therm?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There's a possibility. If it was up to me I'd choose to play, but you have to play a lot of hours and so many hours of work.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I have the mentality but maybe not the passion that used to make me want to improve, and that stops me a bit.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Peke has said that there may be a Spaniard in his team. Can we discount you for that then?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Has Peke said that?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It could be Mithy but...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Well, we'll see. I don't know, I don't know. I wish Peke the best and I know he's going to succeed, but we'll see.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You've always been known for being a good theorycrafter. How do you see the new jungle? Do you think that Riot has done a good job?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I always like changes like these, that people have to adapt to that many changes in the game. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The new jungle has its downsides though. Right now it seems like the upgrade of the machete is brutal, and even if it's a bit complicated for some junglers almost any champion can jungle with the upgrade.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Even if people complain a bit at the moment it's still the same jungle as always. But if they adjust the upgrade thing it could be a quite funny  and different jungle.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Any unconventional pick that you think that we could see with those changes?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The little I've tried... 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Excluding the broken ones like Warwick.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Among others I've tried a champion that needs a bit to ramp up but works quite well: Aatrox.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:09.000
His W he has a lot of sustain in the jungle. Pantheon too, he's being the flavor of the moment. Those who are disappearing a bit are Lee Sin and Kha Zix. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You have to be truly good with Lee to make him work and Kha Zis isn't really worth it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It was a pleasure to have you here. I wish that you have a great time here and reasons to keep smiling as always. Goodbye Ara.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
A pleasure, Â¡bye!
