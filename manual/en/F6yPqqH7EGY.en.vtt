00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.689
&gt;&gt;Terry Kovel: Hi, I’m Terry Kovel and we’re
at the Dunham Tavern [Museum] Show in Cleveland,

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.820
Ohio, and I’m talking with Fern Larking
Kao, with a g.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.930
She says she is related to show people.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.030
And if you are a collector, you know what
I mean.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.670
At any rate she has clothing that you won’t
find anywhere but a show which is one of the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.270
reasons why you should go to antique shows.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.130
You have vintage clothing.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.450
&gt;&gt;Fern Larking Kao: Yes, vintage clothing
and ladies accessories.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.840
I’m very fond of this dress.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.210
It was made by Sir Norman Hartnell the Queen
of England’s dressmaker.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.940
He made the queen’s wedding dress, coronation
dress and many other garments.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.030
He made this dress, designed it in 1947 and
it was in his collection called “Puritan”

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.989
because he said he designed it to look like
an

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.120
antique Puritan dress,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.120
&gt;&gt;Terry Kovel: It does.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.940
&gt;&gt;Fern Larking Kao: but of course add the
famous Hartnell embroidery.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.390
&gt;&gt;Terry Kovel: How much is it?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.650
&gt;&gt;Fern Larking Kao: It is $1,400 and the Hartnell
label is in one of the seams in the skirt.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.730
&gt;&gt;Terry Kovel: Now, could you wear it?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.380
&gt;&gt;Fern Larking Kao: It can definitely be worn.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.380
It is too long for me.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.619
It must have been worn by a much taller woman
because there were inches left on the floor

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.619
on me.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.719
[laugher]I’m not very tall.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:21.380
The other early pieces I have is the christening
set which is one set.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.890
The dress, coat, cape and bonnet.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.210
That is $1,200 and is over a hundred years
old.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.829
&gt;&gt;Terry Kovel: Very nice.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.079
How do you take care of this?

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.170
Do you hang them?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.349
&gt;&gt;Fern Larking Kao: They are on padded hangers.

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:38.009
This is turned inside out by the waist, there
are loops on the waist and it has padding

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.849
around here to hold it out.

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.429
So, I turn it inside out.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.460
These [christening set] [laughter] are wrapped
in tissue and the bonnet also is wrapped in

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.460
tissue.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.340
&gt;&gt;Terry Kovel: Kovel: In archival tissue?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.340
&gt;&gt;Fern Larking Kao: Yes, archival tissue.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.340
&gt;&gt;Terry Kovel: Very good.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.340
Thank you.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.340
&gt;&gt;Fern Larking Kao: You are very welcome!

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.530
&gt;&gt;Terry Kovel: So remember, you never know
what you’re going to find at an antique

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.530
show.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.219
