00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:09.850
Myocardial infarction, commonly referred to
as heart attack, is the sudden death of part

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.349
of the heart muscle due to loss of blood flow.
This occurs when one of the coronary arteries

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:22.820
-- the arteries that supply blood to the heart
-- is blocked. The blockage is commonly due

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.820
to atherosclerosis - cholesterol plaques/fat
deposits on the wall of blood vessels. 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.560
As the plaque builds up, the vessel becomes narrow
restricting blood flow. Under stress, the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.440
plaque may rupture. This triggers formation
of blood clot on top of the plaque leading

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.829
to complete blockage of blood flow. When this
happens in a coronary artery, the downstream

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.250
patch of the myocardium dies from lack of
oxygen. Weaken heart muscle may disrupt electrical

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.250
activity of the heart and subsequently cause
cardiac arrest.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.409
Coronary angioplasty is a non-surgical procedure
used to open narrowed or blocked coronary

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.409
arteries. It can also be performed as an emergency
treatment for myocardial infarction. The first

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.750
part of the procedure is to localize the site
of blockage. This part is called cardiac catheterization.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.479
A guiding catheter is inserted through the
femoral artery at the groin and threaded all

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.479
the way to the aorta. The tip of the catheter
is placed at the beginning of the coronary

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.149
artery to be investigated. A radio-opaque
dye is injected through the catheter into

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.149
the coronary artery. This enables real-time
visualization of the artery using X-ray imaging.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.420
A narrowed part of an artery would appear
as a bottle neck on an x-ray image. 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:06.859
After the location of narrowed artery is identified,
angioplasty can begin. A guidewire with a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.930
deflated balloon is inserted and pushed to
the location of blockage. The balloon is inflated

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.440
to crush the plaque. At the end of procedure,
the balloon is again deflated and removed

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.200
together with all catheters and guidewire.
In some cases, a stent is inserted together

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.510
with the balloon, inflated and left on place
of the plaque to keep the artery open permanently.
