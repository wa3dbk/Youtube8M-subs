00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:28.369
and salt.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.800
Again mix it.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.560
It will be looklike a rough paste.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.119
After 2 minute my potato mixture is looking like this.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.020
And this is done.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.429
My potato mixute is done and let it cool for
10 minutes.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.149
After that i will mesh it.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:56.100
My potato mixture has cool down,
and i am going to make the balls from this mixture.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.880
First i will tranfer it into my bowl,

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.889
now i will make potato balls.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.120
and i will put some bread sticks inside the potato mixture.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.400
So it will be look like chicken drumsticks.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.480
Yes it is looking like chicken drumsticks.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.750
Now just

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.840
deep into the

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.449
Cornflour mix water,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.899

My all the vegetable drumsticks are ready
to fry,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.829
You can use small baby corns instead of the
bread sticks.

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.829
Then you can get the better result.
Becouse it will be sronger then bread sticks.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.130
In the hot oil i am going to fry the vegetable
drumsticks.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.580
Just pour it very gently,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.400
becouse the oil is very very hot.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.300
One thing remember that the heat should be
very very low.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.400
And Let these drumsticks fry,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.060
when the vegetable lollipop will look golden brown 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.980
then it will be done.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.180
My vege lollipop is looking golden brwon,
and i am going to remove from the hot oil.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.650
