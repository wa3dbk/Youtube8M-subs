00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.170
Tom: Hi I’m Tom.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.250
I work at Schneider National and I love big
Truck.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.100
Let me show you what we have here.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.809
So, we’re known for much more than our big
orange trucks.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.110
I’m going to show you around the place a
little bit.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.110
I love working here.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.470
We have associates here for 30, 25, 25, 30
years working here that work here.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.560
Let’s show you what we have.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.970
Tom: Now, this is an exciting event at Schneider
because right now we have a driver coming

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.810
in from over-the-road, from who knows where.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.610
It could be California.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.890
We know it’s not Hawaii.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.890
We know it’s not Alaska.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.930
Joe: I’m Joe Mays.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:32.930
I’m headed from Texas.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.769
I’m stopping by the shop to get the airlines
on my trailer fixed and I sure do love my

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:38.769
pumpkin truck.

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.339
Tom: Joe just talked about that he needed
to get some maintenance done.

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.339
He’s already in the shop.

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.339
He’s getting fixed.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.820
He’s going to be on his way in no time.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.829
He’s going to Texas.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.549
Tom: We even have a TV lounge at Schneider
national, you can see.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:54.639
Watch hockey, football, baseball, all the
movies you want and for some reason Full Metal

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.589
Jacket is the favorite movie drivers watch.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.600
Tom: Our drivers are the best in the industry.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.620
They get to protect million dollar loads.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.879
This is a load of gold right here going to
Fort Knox.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.030
Let’s go for a walk.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.400
Tom: Talking about our cafeteria you see right
now, open most of the day, and our drivers

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.840
go ahead and head here instead of over the
road.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.140
Tom: Right here we have over $30,000 worth
of tires right now.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.329
Getting ready to put on our tractors and trailers
just in case they need them, so they can go

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.329
out and haul freight.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:24.329
Let’s go for a walk.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.430
Tom: As our drivers get to come to our operations
center, showers are clean, cleaned after every

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.430
use.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.549
They don’t have to pay for them.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.689
Let’s go for a walk.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:33.689
Tom: Your name, sir?

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.689
Jeff: Jeff Hudson.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.079
Tom: And where you headed to?

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.540
Jeff: Taking a load of gold to Grand Prairie,
Texas.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.540
Tom: Outstanding!

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.780
Well, you have a safe day there, sir.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.780
Jeff: I will.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.780
Tom: This is America.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.810
Americans need jobs.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.590
So you want to work for a great company, you
want to stay somewhere for 20, 25 years, you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.950
want to make a difference in yourself and
what your community does, and what our nation

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.950
has?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.950
Because everything you see, everything you
see, minus nature, has been hauled by a professional

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.479
truck driver.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.080
So, come see us at Schneider National.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.420
Let’s see if you meet our criteria and let’s
get you working.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.590
Let’s go for a walk.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.500
Tom: Here we have Darin, our world class therapist.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.160
Don’t tell him he’s world class.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.819
You’re a world class therapist, Darin.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.680
Tom: And at Schneider National we have world
class leaders.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.450
Here’s an example of one, fictitionaly.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.230
Tom: There we go.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.040
We have our gentlemen getting ready to use
the simulator and we don’t want to show

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.040
you anymore.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040
Let’s go for a walk.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.040
Tom: His name is Scott.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.060
Scott, say a few words to the future employees
of Schneider National.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.060
That’s enough.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.140
That’s all we need to hear from Scott.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.360
Let’s go for a walk.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360
Scott: Hi.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.650
Tom: Grand Prairie, Texas!

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.180
Did you hear that?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.880
Tom: We have great associates here.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.459
Some of the most world class trainers.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.200
Let me turn one around here.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.450
Let me get a shot of our world class trainers.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.450
Say hi, guys.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.450
Schneider National Trainers: Hi guys.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.909
Tom: You can cut that.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.549
Tom: At Schneider we have world class security.

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.930
Right now we have Joe manning the desk, ready
to bounce on anything at a moment’s notice.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.020
Tom: Some people say, “The simulator is
not the same as the real thing.”

00:03:05.020 --> 00:04:46.460
That’s why they call it a simulator; otherwise
they would call it the real thing.
