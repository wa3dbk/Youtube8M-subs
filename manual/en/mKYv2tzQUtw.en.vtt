00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
All new on The Doctors!

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.380
Well, today we're talking about

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.160
how well
does the inside of your body measure up?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.900
That's what
we're covering throughout the show

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.220
and right now
we have cardiologist Dr. John Kennedy,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.700
back in the procedure room.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.900
He's with Sarah

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.320
who's wearing
what's called a cardiac event monitor

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.620
and, Dr. Kennedy,
why is Sarah wearing that monitor?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.720
Yeah, so Travis,
Sarah has a really common problem,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.500
as you know, palpitations,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.280
and palpitations are
caused by an irritable electrical system

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.060
and when we're trying
to make the diagnosis of, you know,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.320
what are causing the palpitations,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.260
we typically use a,
a monitor called a Holter monitor

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.400
and the Holter monitor is great,
if you have symptoms in 24 hours,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.540
but, as Sarah will attest,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.960
sometimes we,
we don't get symptoms in this 24-hour period

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.660
and so we move to a more accurate device,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.660
which is patient activated,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.500
and the event monitor,
it's this simple little device,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.380
and when Sarah's actually having symptoms

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.720
she holds it up to her chest,
presses it to her chest,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.320
and then she presses this button.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.800
That then is transmitted to my office

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.940
and I can actually see
what's going on with her heart,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.220
when she's having symptoms.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.440
And I want to point out, to everyone watching,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.080
that right now, Sarah,
you have the electrodes hooked up,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.900
you can't see it,
that's why we call it a 24-hour event monitor,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.800
because you may be having palpitations,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.680
but you don't want to sit there,
in the hospital, for 24 hours,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.920
hooked up to a big monitor,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.720
so you can go about
your daily activities, right Sarah?

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.420
Absolutely!
Just carry it with me.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.860
Does everybody know what palpitations are?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.540
Well, we're going to
talk about palpitations a little bit later,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.280
but you're right!

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.480
It's that sensation that
your heart is skipping a beat

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.980
it's going fast...

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.720
and palpitations can be
the sign of something serious

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.180
so later in the show
we're going to show Sarah

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.820
her up to the minute heart monitor result.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.040
How does your body measure up?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.920
Specifically, your heart?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.640
Well, back with us
is cardiologist Dr. John Kennedy

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.940
and his patient Sarah,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.640
who says
she's been experiencing an irregular heartbeat,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.020
something we call palpitations,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.260
so, Sarah, describe to everyone
these palpitation sensations.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.080
My heart's racing
and I feel like I can't breathe

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.660
fast enough to catch up with the heart rate

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.760
and I feel a little, faint,
but I don't actually faint,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.820
just kind of lightheaded.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.560
And it's scary!
Yes, very!

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560
And what we didn't say
is that Sarah does have

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.000
an underlying condition.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.280
That's right, yeah!
She has a really common, actually,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.700
underlying condition
that causes palpitations,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.420
known as mitral valve prolapse.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.180
Walk us through
what mitral valve prolapse is in Sarah's case.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.280
Yeah, so I'm going to show you over here

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.600
on the ultrasound
and this is an ultra sound recording,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.500
which is the same technology
we use to look at babies when women are pregnant,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.320
and this is the valve

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.240
which is a doorway
that connects the top-left chamber

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.180
to the bottom lower chamber of the heart

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.660
and it's allowing blood
from the lungs to go down

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.660
through the top chamber
into the left chamber

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.920
and this is pumped out
to your brain and the rest your body.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.380
And, as you can see,
this valve leaflet is ballooning upward

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.680
or prolapsing into the top part of the heart

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.180
and what can happen
with mitral valve prolapse

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.960
is this leaflet can become
really weakened, really tethered

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.700
and it can start to leak.
And that leaking of blood,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.280
which we see in this view here,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.160
is what tickles the heart or irritates it

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.640
and causes our heart to skip beats

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.000
and all the symptoms
that we're seeing Sarah experience.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.960
And we have an animation
to further describe this?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.620
Yeah! Now the left side is what,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.720
what a normal heart looks like.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.680
This is the blue blood
coming from all of our tissues,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.540
it's being pumped off into the lungs,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.740
it's getting oxygenated

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.180
and then it's collected
in this left upper chamber,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.020
called the left atrium,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.400
it goes down through the saloon doors

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.060
into the left ventricle
and that gets pumped out

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.220
to the brain of the rest of our body.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.660
If you come over to the right

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.420
you'll see same process
coming through the right side to the left,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.000
collecting in the left atrium

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.320
and you can see,
as the leaflets close,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.760
they balloon upward,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.880
which is the prolapse
and as it stretches, as that leaflet stretches,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.220
it doesn't close correctly
and the blood then leaks back

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.060
where it regurgitates
into the left upper chamber

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.120
and that extra volume of blood

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.220
can tickle or irritate the heart
and cause skipped beats, palpitations

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.780
and a lot of the symptoms that Sarah's experiencing.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.020
And that's a great explanation

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.020
because, in the end,
your cardiovascular system

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.520
it's a plumbing system.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.700
With that prolapse
things are going in the wrong direction,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.640
you can get
the heart tickled.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.400
So, the one thing I want to highlight

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.540
because a lot of folks
get these palpitations,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.660
I see people in the ER all the time

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.080
and they may not have
the palpitations when they come,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.240
they may say:
"I had them for 10 minutes, but now they're gone"

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.900
that's where
this monitoring comes in to play

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.180
and I love the fact,
you wore one for how long?

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.500
I wore one for 24 hours straight

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.440
and then I had another
that when I felt something coming on

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.580
I would apply to my chest and record.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.120
And what were the results?

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.800
Sarah, luckily, 
I'm happy to say

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.900
that she had,
when she was having symptoms,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.540
she had what's called sinus tachycardia

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.860
which is a normal body responds to stress

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.160
and so what I can tell...
