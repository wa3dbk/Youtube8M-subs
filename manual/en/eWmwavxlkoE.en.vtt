00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.939
 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.519
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.990
Hi everyone. So

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.200
the Microsoft announcement was yesterday. We now have a much better idea of what

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.599
the launch features and functionality of
Windows 10 is going to be.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.289
Now it seems Microsoft are going to
be striking across multiple device types

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.619
including Xbox, tablets,

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.699
desktops and smartphones as well.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.090
All of this all running Windows 10 - one
operating system across all devices

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.840
exactly as we expected the unified
architecture as it were.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.550
Microsoft is going a step further. On
the Xbox side of things

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.870
they've promised us that Windows 10 PC
users

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.450
will receive an extra boost from gaming. Now I personally thought this might be

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.860
a case that we'd be able to play Xbox One
games on PC

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.739
and I was right. This is going to work in
a very similar way

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.559
to Nvidia's Shield streaming technology,
the game stream technology.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.259
Essentially you start the game on your Xbox One, you head over to your PC

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.130
fire-up the Xbox smart glass app and start playing the game on your PC.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.450
Now in part this is really cool but it's not
quite the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.829
boon I was expecting for PC users. For starters

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.380
this is not really a way to reward PC
gamers

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.020
but a way to sell more Xbox Ones.
Essentially Microsoft seem to be saying

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.459
here

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.950
PC gaming we don't care about. But play
it on Xbox One and stream it to your PC.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.109
Microsoft this is not the way it's supposed
to be.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.200
You're supposed to be treating both ecosystems which are now one unified ecosystem

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.829
equally and here all you're really doing
is propping up the Xbox One still.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.109
What we really needed to see were some
announcements related to

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.619
gaming on PCs using the PC hardware
and architecture not

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.609
streaming from an Xbox One. It's pretty
lazy and actually it's pretty basic

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.310
really from what we know of this streaming technology and the fact that pretty much everyone else beat

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.979
you to it.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.540
But,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.010
let's leave that to one side for a
moment because what Microsoft 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.120
have announced is this holographic system -

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.460
holograph glasses for all intents and
purposes. Now

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.780
this is potentially where PC gaming

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.150
is going to take a massive massive
uplift. If you think that Oculus Rift

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.840
provides that kind of 360-degree

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.280
immersive gameplay what

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.080
Microsoft's holo technology does it says the world around you

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.360
is the game essentially. That is very
very similar

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.650
to Google's Project Tango. Essentially
what Microsoft are doing is

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.970
painting onto a front layer of glass

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.760
on these glasses a display. Now that display can be

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.420
absolutely anything and owing to the cameras built into the glasses

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.720
it can see the world and project information
on top of it,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.540
including understanding where your hand
gestures are. Very Kinectish.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.190
But really what this actually means is a
whole

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.320
new classification of games - essentially
augmented reality

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.790
and this is where we've kind of had a promise for a very very long time since

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.739
AR was first kind of first bursting onto the
market but no one has ever

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.380
actually taken it to a point where you could
kind of use it for something practical.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.750
Microsoft does seem to be about to
change that.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.440
This new technology looks very
impressive

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.260
certainly it appears to be more fully
featured and well thought out than Google

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.830
Glass

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.620
or even Oculus Rift at this stage. Microsoft does seem to be at least a year ahead

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.080
of these other devices coming into the market but

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.470
it all depends on when they launch it and
the price point is going to be absolutely

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.410
crucial as well.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.230
If you think Oculus Rift is targeting a £199 £299 price point,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.220
Microsoft can't launch for any more than
that. Likewise when they do launch

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.310
they need a software suite available -
games and apps that

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.100
really demonstrate the principle of this
new holographic technology.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.270
Now the final thing to say is I don't necessarily any consider this to be

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.350
holograms in the traditional sense

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.520
kind of thinking princess layer  and R2D2 here.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.380
It's not quite like that. What this really is is two panes of glass

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.720
effectively. One pane of glass at the very front appears to have

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.170
this essentially laser etched onto it in
real time and

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.670
that's what gives us this kind of holographic the display is hovering in front of us.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.299
Now there does seem to be another set of glass there which I believe may be some kind of  focal

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:20.810
piece

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.840
essentially so you can always make sure the depth perception is correct. But it's very

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.120
interesting technology and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.830
I can't wait to see how Microsoft actually
rolls this out. Some of the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.850
other features coming to Windows 10
include well basically

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.390
rethinking what Windows 8 was and what
Windows 7

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.100
is and attempting to kind of merge those
two elements together.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.830
And it certainly looks like they've
done a pretty good job so far.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.840
A lot of the things we were complaining
about during the technical preview

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.370
have actually been fixed this time including
new features where necessary.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.980
If you go back to Windows 8 when Microsoft had its fingers in its ears and was simply

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.900
going lalalalala we're not listening,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.480
anything that was being suggested as
being necessary to make Windows 8

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.050
usable for Windows 7 people was being
ignored. This time around

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.400
essentially Microsoft is saying please
Windows 7 users please Windows 8 users

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.880
all is forgiven as it were. We don't hate
you any more you were telling us the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.360
truth

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.110
and we're now fixing the operating system to make sure it is perfect for those users.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.919
When we throw into the mix the fact that
Windows 7 users and Windows 8 users

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.370
will be getting a free upgrade to Windows 10 if you upgrade in the first year

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.010
it's pretty clear that Microsoft is very very focused right now

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.930
on moving people off those old operating
systems - even Windows 8

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.350
and into this new unified architecture for
obvious reasons.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.020
So what do you think?  Were you impressed with what Microsoft announced or 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.160
