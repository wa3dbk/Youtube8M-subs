&gt;&gt; I'm Patricia Menendez and I'm

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:12.278
in Creative Photography,
Still in Motion.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.747
I'm actually a lawyer,
cooperate lawyer,

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:17.149
and I felt like all
my life it's--

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:19.552
I just felt really
passionate about photography.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:24.623 line:92%
I feel like I'm an artist.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:28.961

concentrate all that you need

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.464 line:92%

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.466
in the real world
in just two years.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.136
From just how to hold your
camera and how to behave

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:40.339 line:92%
to clients and treat talent.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.475
And you just got
to keep shooting.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.043 line:92%
That's the most important thing

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.045
because if you don't get
the picture that you want

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.913
at the first try you've
just got to keep going,

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:51.250 line:92%
keep going, until you make it.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.788 line:92%
The instructors are fantastic.

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:59.358
They're so well rounded
in knowledge and they're

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:02.128
so generous in what
they give you.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:05.030
They give you tips like
what do you have to--

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.933
What do you need to have in your
studio when you receive a client

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.035
like cookies and coffee
and stuff like that.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:15.174
So from the simple stuff to the
high end quality tips like how

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:17.409
to use your flash,
your camera, your gear,

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.080
how to treat talent,
all those things.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:24.817
People might think that
you just use the camera

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.553
to take pictures here but
they give you business.

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:30.356
I mean, they give you-- You
have to create a business plan

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.392
in order for you to
know how they work.

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.828
They help you create
your portfolio also

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:39.865
so you could leave here with a
book to show it to your clients,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.967
to your potential
clients, to just apply

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.103 line:92%
for a job and get jobs.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.608
I would like to have
my own business

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.377 line:92%
and take pictures by myself.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.180
I'm willing to, you know,
work for somebody just

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.317
to get more experience and
to just feel like a fish

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:01.487
in the water when
I'm starting my own.
