00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.820
Hi, I'm Mike Corliss from Tormach. 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.039
And today I'm going to show you...

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.349
...fixture plates, 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.710
a couple different fixture plates we have,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.059
and different ways to locate then or other
large flat pieces that you might be...

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.649
machining

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.270
For using the fixture plates...

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.230
...you can nest multiple parts, or if it's a big part
you have a hard time holding any other way,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.010
with fixture plates it's easy to...

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.400
...just drill and tap..

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.280
...mounting holes, whatever you need.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
uh... if you are using these to do multiple
parts...

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.720
...it's nice to put...

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.079
...a couple holes in...

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.340
...for picking up your zeros,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.490
and then you can cut a reference edge too.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.050
One of the quickest ways, if you are going use them for a quick change...

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.620
...fixture plate...

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.860
...we have these little locators.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.210
Tighten these set screws down in the back,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.520
and that's going to lock them against the...

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.010
...t-slot.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.080
They just slide in.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.740
There's some play in them.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.750
So what I'll do is to split the difference.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.320
And then tighten up the set screws...

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.320
...to lock them into position.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.140
Now the fixture plate can lift on and off.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.670
It's going to locate off those two pins.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.550
And no I can clamp this plate down,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.470
and cut a reference edge, cut a reference
mark, cut a reference part,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.770
drill and ream a hole, whatever I
want.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.429
And then the plate's...

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.509
...marked and I can have as many plates as I want to interchange them.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.259
Now they'll just slide on and off those pins.

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.529
Now if we wanted to use the bigger plate,

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.469
like this,

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.039
we can use this other style of locators.

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.819
These locators you tighten the screw through the dowel so you put them on,

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.909
locate the plate,

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:40.909
and then tighten them into position.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.319
Again, the first time I put a fixture plate on...

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.379
I would either split the difference in the play in the t-slot,

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.139
or I'd indicate it to the edges

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:09.139
as I was clamping it down.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.979
Ok, once the locators are tight

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.089
you could clamp your fixture down,

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.149
machine your nests or whatever you're going to do.

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.809
And then this plate,

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:32.809
you can rotate it. Snap it on the pins.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:42.409
And you can have multiple plates, because the spacing will all be the same. They'll just swap in and out.

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.239
So if you're using locators...

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.769
...to locate the long edge...

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.549
...of a flat part,

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.989
you've already had those in,

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.939
that'll straighten your part for you, squared up to the machine.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.869
And then you can use this for a stop.

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:04.879
Just put a socket head cap screw in,

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:11.879
with a washer,

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:18.579
and then lock it against the t-slot.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.219
And then you can just...

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:24.809
...switch your plates.

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.210
And then clamp them down.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.919
Another way to hold these plates down,

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.869
instead of using a strap clamp set,

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:34.270
you can...

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.370
drill and counter bore or drill and counter sink for a flat head cap screw...

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.839
...to hold these in place.

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:45.439
You can also use miniature clamps
for holding,,,

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.790
...multiple work pieces.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.350
That's about it on the machine.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.000
That's just different...

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.809
...fixturing plates...

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:59.739
and different uh... ways to locate them
repeat good for you.
