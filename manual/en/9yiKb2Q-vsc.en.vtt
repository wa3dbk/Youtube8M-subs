00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.490
There were 4 or 5 universities that were all
starting the event in 1995 as an effort by

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:18.630
the Children's Miracle Network to spread this
around, and we were one of those first universities.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.830
The craziness of the event really is the magic.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.740
It's all about the change in the students'
lives, and how you're setting them up early

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.279
on to have a philanthropic life.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:42.300
And you don't even understand that until you
get to the end of the event, you see the flipcards

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.309
raised, you see those extra commas, those
extra decimal points, and you see all the

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.460
people around you crying, and you hear the
music playing and you're dancing again.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.879
You're not sitting down, you're dancing.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.120
That's when you realize you're committed for
life.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.780
I walk in here, to the O'Connell Center, but
when I come in here, I don't think about basketball.I

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.780
don't think about volleyball.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.220
When I come here, I smell Dance Marathon.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.780
The blood and sweat of thousands of kids who've
come through here.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.860
Young adults who've committed their entire
weekend to this wonderful cause, and without

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.780
knowing yet, they've committed their entire
lives to philanthropy.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.600
The first year, nobody really knew if the
event was going to happen, when they threw

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.410
the event in the Rion Ballroom.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.480
Sue: There weren't that many dancers, but
it was nice.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.530
They were dancing, and you knew they were
dancing for a cause.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.390
And we've just seen it grow every year.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.640
ERIC:They decided that the Rion Ballroom wasn't
going to work so the negotiation was made

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.909
to move it to the O'Connell Center.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.670
Even then, there was a lot of discussion about
legacy, and what we needed to do in order

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.250
to make sure this event lasted forever and
ever, because it's not just about the facility.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.070
It's not just about Shands Children Hospital.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.060
It's about the camaraderie and fraternity
of students who have created their own club,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.229
which now, in my opinion, the most successful
event on campus.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.599
JAMIE:The fact that we continue to grow and
be so successful after 20 years is such a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.689
testament to the student body and to the alumni
who have come before us, and made us what

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.689
we are today.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.709
MOLLY:The 20th year is a huge celebration
to us.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.970
When you think of 10 years, wow, that's a
huge number, but 20 years... that means you've

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.870
been doing something good.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.870
Something is sticking.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.349
SUE:It's something that's done by students.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.079
It's not adults putting it on.

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:38.510
It's students, and for us to realize that
these are kids doing and devoting so much

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.299
time - it takes them over a year to do this-
and to realize that they really care about

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.299
kids.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.819
They really care about what they're doing,
and it just amazes me.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.810
JAMIE: I think Dance Marathon at UF has the
potential to grow and be philanthropy of the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.510
Gator Nation, and it's just part of being
a Gator, like going to football games or being

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.510
in the Hub.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.510
It's just something that everybody does.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.514
