00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.154
So here we are at the remains of a...

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.920
stone structure here

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.300
Another one

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:31.615
This house was built

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:33.814
according to the sign 1785

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.420
and it was destroyed by fire in 1974

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:47.155
obviously this is all that remains

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.660
an interesting fact is that the second floor of this house a a door called a funeral door

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:58.774
so when family members died

00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:00.581
since the staircases

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.255
were so narrow in these house if they died upstairs in there bed

00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:04.674
they had a door

00:01:04.674 --> 00:01:07.476
up on the second floor so they can get there casket out of the house

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.920
kinda cool information

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.900
fireplace

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.520
not really much left of this one

00:01:26.095 --> 00:01:28.255
looks like a basement down there

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:49.855
let see if we can find anymore

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:33.755
Here is another one I found. More in the woods

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:44.054
another old home.. just the ruins, stone ruins

00:03:07.974 --> 00:03:11.414
hate when they do that, i am not doing anything wrong

00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:12.615
just taking pictures

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:27.535
here is the inside

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.180
pretty neat

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.480
steps are pretty neat

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.414
must of been the front of the house here

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:54.577
water pipe, can really see it but

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:01.635
I just find it amazing, these stone structures

00:04:03.694 --> 00:04:04.494
everything

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:25.535
looks like a fireplace right there, whats left of it..
