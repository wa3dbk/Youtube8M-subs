00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:10.661
So, the first thing we want to know is
whether consumers seek out

00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:13.420
fair trade certified products in the
marketplace.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.560
In oder to test that, we took fair trade
certified coffee,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.440
we labeled it as fair trade certified in
one set of stores.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.180
We label it with a placebo label, that had
no ethical component to it,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.840
in the other set of stores.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.100
And we observed what happens to sales,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.930
as consumers are making their day to day
purchases in these stores.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.747
And what we found is that sales increased
by 10%, a remarkable margin,

00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:36.020
given the competitive,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.538
competitiveness of the industry under the
Fair Trade Certified label.

00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:44.120
The second main finding that came from the
study is that once we

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.445
raised the prices on the Fair Trade coffee
sales actually continued to grow.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.540
There was a positive price elasticity, but

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.920
this was only true for one of two Fair
Trade Certified coffees that we tested.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.930
For the less expensive coffee, and the
sales actually decreased dramatically.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.370
And so that suggests to us that there is
two segments in the market.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.370
There's consumers who are beginning to
support the price increases that come with

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.470
Fairtrade certification, but there are
also consumers who will not support this.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.914
And, you know, it's about an equal split.

00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:17.049
[MUSIC]

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.490
I think the main takeaway is that there's
substantial support for

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.790
fair trade certification in the
marketplace today but it's not unlimited.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.400
So, I think there is a fair segment,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.700
fairly sizeable segment that is not
willing to pay more for

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.570
these ethically made products, as much as
we might want to.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.483
But, there are, like there is a fairly
large share of consumers that

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:38.599
are willing to pay more for these
products, and that's something that,

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.631
you know, companies, I think, can take as
an important lesson.

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.627
I mean, I think, this, this gives you an
opportunity to differentiate your

00:01:45.627 --> 00:01:49.440
product from your competitors, and to
really, like, you know, have,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.989
I think there is a business case for these
ethical differentiation schemes where,

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.693
you basically, try to pass on some of
these costs for

00:01:56.693 --> 00:01:59.918
ethically upgrading your supply chains, to
the consumers.

00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:03.121
[MUSIC]

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:06.178
I think the lesson that comes from our
experiment is that this is something that

00:02:06.178 --> 00:02:07.980
you should look into seriously.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.810
You should look into whether you can
ethically differentiate your product,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.970
because there are consumers out there,
depending on the market that you're in,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.690
that are really willing to reward you.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.690
And who might, on the other hand, punish
you, if you don't go down this road, and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.520
might be singled out as the company that's
kind of left behind.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.091
While other of your competitors are
ethically upgrading, you,

00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:26.600
you're not doing that.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.480
And, and so, I think there's a risk in, to
not considering these schemes, and to not

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.530
thinking about, you know, what can I do to
produce my products in a way that it's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.160
environmentally more friendly, that it's
sort of more ethically more sustainable.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.364
That has a better impact on the planet,
which are things that we all care about.
