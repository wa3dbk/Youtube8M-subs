00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.641
Hey everybody, Dave with AmericanMuscle.com
and I'm here with stage 3 of project Grabber

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:20.520
Boost, where in typical project car fashion,
we've changed our performance, we've tackled

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.980
our suspension, and we've added some bolt
ons, and we're happy with where the car's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.950
at, but now is the time to set the stage for
some of the larger mods, and for our showdown

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.760
with the 14 GT.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.820
Before we get there, let's have my team and
I give you an idea of how we got to where

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.620
we're at with our 06 GT.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.920
In stage 2 we completed overhauled our suspension,
starting with an arsenal of parts from SR

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.820
performance, finally we gave project grabber
boost some serious stopping power thanks to

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.811
DBA slotted rotors and hawk ceramic pads along
with some brake lines from J&amp;M. now that we

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:59.300
have the basic foundation laid out, it's time
for my team and I to get down to some bigger

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.170
mods, with a name like grabber boost, you
probably have an idea where we're going, Mike,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.060
there's a few others ways to make horsepower
right?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.490
Mike: absolutely, I mean one of the ways you
can do it is increase an engine's displacement

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.940
increasing pressure ratio, both of which are
going to require us to pull the motor out,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.250
take it apart, rebuild it, and put it back
in.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.750
There's a few other things we've done to the
motor like a throttle body or cold air intake

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.070
and axle back kit to really help it breathe,
but there's still something left, and that

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.980
would be a set of long tube headers and off
road mid pipes.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.550
Steph: That's why we installed this set of
Kook's long tube headers, along with their

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.650
off road x pipe, Kook's is one of the best
brand names in the business, and it's not

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.070
only because they have a quality product,
it's because they have great fitment as well,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.540
so you're really getting what you paid for
with these modifications.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.940
Dave: could you give these guys an idea why
they're so important, why they're going to

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.940
help our car breathe so much better?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.720
Steph: Sure, so the stock headers we used
to have on here, along with the stock mid

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.860
pipe, are really restrictive, and as a result
it's going to hang our performance, but adding

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.160
these long tubes and an uncatted mid pipe
will add power and we should see good gains.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.800
Dave: Now our car is ready to throw more air
it's safe to say we're ready for our power

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.349
adder.Before we get to that though we have
to make sure our clutch and drive train can

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.530
handle more power right?

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.040
Mike: Absolutely, what we want to do is go
with the Exedy mach 500 stage 3 clutch, as

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.420
well as they mach 3 flywheel.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.380
This setup is going to be great for holding
up on the street as well as the abuse we're

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.819
going to give it down the road.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.500
We went with the full face design as opposed
to a puck, a puck would have individual teeth

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.770
on it, which are going to be really great
for a track environment but not so great for

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.560
daily driving, you get more in and out with
a puck.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.940
With a full face, it's going to give us stock
like driveability but hold up to the pwer

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.390
that we're going to add in stage 4.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.510
Dave: Mike, we've done a lot to the car, if
you don't mind, give these guys an idea of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.510
what we've got.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.490
Mike: Absolutely so we wanted to make sure
the rest of the drive line is going to hold

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.660
up as well, so we have a stock 2 piece driveshaft,
it's heavy, it's weak, we want to get rid

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.750
of that, we went with the aluminum one piece
driveshaft, it's going to save us 20 lbs of

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.380
rotating mass, which should save a few tenths
on the track.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.180
Dave: that sounds great, it really does, there's
one more thing I want to show the folks.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.300
We went ahead and installed a Billet competition
short throw shifter from Hurst, we took the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.740
car to the track in the first couple stages,
and actually broke the bolts of our stock

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.740
shifter pulling off, so we have to go with
something stronger and better, we chose the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.190
Hurst for the short throw shifts to reduce
our quarter mile times the most we can so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.050
we can bang gears all day long.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.190
That was the last part we wanted to install
in this stage before we get our car over to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.370
the Dyno and see what kind of results we get
before our showdown with the 14 and before

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.540
the power adder.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.240
Last time we ran grabber boost on the dyno
in stage 1 we put down 292 horsepower and

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.720
307 ft/lbs of torque, with our stage 3 mods
we just ran 301 horsepower and 316 ft/lbs

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.620
of torque, giving us a peak horsepower gain
of 9 and curve gains of 13 horsepower and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.110
13 ft/lbs of torque.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.140
Grabber Boost made great power in stage 3
and it's right where we want it, in stage

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.510
4 we're going to pull out all the stops and
give this car the power adder it needs.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.709
We're going to get this car down the track
and see how it performs against project coyote,

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.049
we'll see you back here for the end result
