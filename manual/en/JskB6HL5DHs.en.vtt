It's American ingenuity,
American sweat, and America's can

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.920
do attitude that flows through
the hands of American workers.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.210
Who knows about quality and innovation?

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.470
Flowmaster.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.060
Craftsman Restoration Rollout.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.250
Welcome back to the Craftsman
Restoration Rollout.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.200
I'm Sandy Ganz, the Garage Professor.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.080
Today we're here at Morris
Mufflers with Tim Morris,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.580
and we're going to install
our Flowmaster muffler system.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.060
Tim, tell us a little bit about what's
going on and your experience here.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.500
Well, we've had this shop
going for 15 years now,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.560
and I've been doing this for a
good 25 years of the experience.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.090
And we've been working
with Flowmaster a lot.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.760
So this should be a great
sounding exhaust for this car?

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.120
A perfect exhaust for this car.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.791
All right, Tim.

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:44.290
Absolutely.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.270
Well, I'm going to let you get
to it, clear out of your space.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.000
All righty.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.561
Thanks a lot.

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:49.060
You got it.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.000
The first step is to lay out the
Flowmaster Thunder Exhaust kit

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.840
in position underneath our project car.

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.160
The next step is to fabricate the
connecting pipes from the headers

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.600
to the exhaust system.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
We're going to use a wire to figure
out the length and bends of the pipe.

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.445
We are flaring the end of the
connector pipe to fit over the exhaust.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.120
The next step is to weld the
connector pipe to the header flange.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.940
And we'll now secure the flange using
the Craftsman 1/2 inch composite impact

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.080
wrench.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.160
Once this is done, we'll weld the
opposite end of the connector pipe

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.360
to the exhaust system.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.250
We will now weld on the
mufflers to the exhaust system

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.630
and add the muffler hangers, and once
again using the Craftsman 1/2 inch

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.390
composite wrench to secure them.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.011
The last step is to weld
on the exhaust tail pipes

00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:49.260
and secure the muffler clamps.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.310
And in the next episode we're heading to
the Sears Auto Center for the front end

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.510
alignment.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.280
Tim, how did the muffler install go?

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.250
The installation went no problem.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.280
Everything fit really nice and good.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.460
Looks great under here,
stainless tips look awesome.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.020
Everything looks beautiful,
you did a fantastic job.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.270
These Flowmasters are going
to sound and look great.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.790
