00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.920
Hey everybody.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.680
Today we’ll talk about DirtMotoShop adventure/dual sport motorcycle saddlebags 70L.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.840
First of all, you have to decide

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.120
if you need saddlebags at all for there is another option that is aluminum or plastic panniers,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.760
which seem much more convenient on road.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.160
Actually if you ride only asphalt roads, it can make sense to buy an aluminum or plastic panniers.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.980
Falling while travelling off-road is as natural as riding itself.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.480
Fabric saddlebags won’t break after falling and their fasteners won’t break away.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.320
Moreover they will partly bear the break, what will help to save your bike from possible damage.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.360
This is the reason why we don’t use vinyl as a fabric for our bags, because it can tear.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.040
Let’s take a closer look at bags from DirtMotoShop.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.620
The bags are bound by shifting straps.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.480
60cm (24‘’) straps are adjusted with durable buckles.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.060
The bags can be placed either on trunk or closer to the pilot on passenger seat.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.140
To safely attach the bags you will need side frames like these or other similar frames.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.480
Actually, you can do without them, but you’ll need to figure out something for the muffler to avoid firing the bag.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.620
Inner part of each bag has a hook&amp;loop fastener.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.720
With this fastener you attach the bag to upper crossbar of the side frame, if you have one.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:45.240
In addition inner part of the bag has straps with buckles to attach the bag to the frame to prevent jumping on bumps.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.780
For full safety you can use a luggage strap.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120
Each bag has two big pockets on each side,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.000
where you can put a 1,5l (50oz) bottle of water.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.020
In addition to side pockets there is one more pocket.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.100
It’s not as deep as side pockets,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.680
but it can be useful for flat things such as maps or cloth.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.320
There is one more small pocket with a zipper closure, for example, for documents.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:25.520
Each bag is provided with a rain cape in the bottom pocket to protect you from rain.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.020
For better reliability and durability back part and bottom part of the bag are enforces.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.400
Actually you can use some other rigid material, if you don’t like the standard one.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.260
Size of one bag is 40cm (16’’) height, 50cm (20’’) length and 16cm (6’’) width.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.280
Capacity of one bag including side pockets is 35l and 70l for two bags.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.700
The bags are available in 7 colors.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.560
The construction of the bag is proven in practice in many off-road trips of DirtMotoShop team.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.760
When you go on a long trip don’t forget to get a bag at DirtMotoShop because it was made by off-road travelers for off-road travelers.
