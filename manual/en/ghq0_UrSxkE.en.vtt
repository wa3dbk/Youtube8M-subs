00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:18.590
Seha Lee, report your status.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.190
Seha Lee, report...

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.990
Hey! Seha!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.791
Whoooooaaaa! Damn it!

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.937
If you don’t shut that game off right now, I’m coming down there to smash it myself!

00:00:38.947 --> 00:00:43.727
Okay okay, I’ll turn it off.

00:00:43.737 --> 00:00:49.189
Jeez, you’re worse than an addict!

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.459
Mission name...Black Lambs?

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.417
Yes. I see here that the Union has decided to put you in charge of this one.

00:00:56.427 --> 00:01:01.740
Selection Plan for 
Developing and Deploying Youths

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.620
Wow, is this for real?

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.690
Of course it is.
Have you ever known the Union to have a sense of humor?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.290
The human rights commission would have a field day with this one.
Deploying kids...

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.794
As you are probably well aware, a number of Status Gates have started becoming unstable.

00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:20.590
We just don’t have the people to deal with something like this.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.150
Well, obviously we need to fill our ranks with little kids.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.790
Don’t be so sarcastic.
They may be young, but they have potential.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.490
With a little help from you, 
I’m sure they’ll soon become top quality closers.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.801
I can’t believe you, can’t your game wait until tomorrow?

00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:44.371
Well, you just don’t get it, do you?
There are times you just can’t quit in the middle of a game...

00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:48.039
I think you’re totally addicted to that game, Seha.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.627
We’re on a mission. We need to focus.

00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:53.878
We need to do better on our next evaluation.

00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:56.493
What’s so important about getting a good evaluation?

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:59.568
They might make us actual agents!

00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:01.071
Can you imagine?

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:04.152
Union agents are rank 4 public officials!

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:09.672
They get a house and full pension.
Think about it, we’d never have anything to worry about again!

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:13.190
Oh...really...

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.256
The kids won’t be alone out there.

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:20.027
We’re pulling one of our best closers out of retirement to join them.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:24.498
Hmm… Retired 8 years ago, reinstated 2 months ago...
Special features...

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:26.016
Neurotic gastritis

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:27.483
Stress related migraines

00:02:27.493 --> 00:02:28.254
Anemia

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:29.784
Rheumatoid arthritis

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:30.734
Acrophobia?

00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:32.692
And several other chronic illnesses?!

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:35.815
This is what you consider our best?!

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:37.910
Well...that all depends on the job.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.788
After all, he is a veteran of the Dimensional Conflict.

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:44.484
Geesh, how many times have I told you to read up on the new weapons?!

00:02:44.494 --> 00:02:45.690
Hmm...

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.902
So mister, why’d you come out of 
retirement?

00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:51.660
I have my reasons.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.988
Grown-up reasons?

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:54.683
A lover’s quarrel?

00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:57.016
A sense of duty? Is that it?!

00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:59.720
No, I ran out of cash.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.479
Oh...I see...

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.706
And I’m not a mister.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.659
Consider me an older brother.

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.228
Hah...so where are they right now?

00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:12.519
Oh ...I meant to tell you...

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:18.450
Something came up…
They’ve been at Gangnam Station for the last 30 minutes.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.840
What?!

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.670
[Seha Lee/STRIKER]
Come on, bring it on! I’m ready!

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.326
  [Yuri Seo/RANGER]
Guns! Swords! Bang bang!

00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:43.986
[Seulbi Lee/CASTER]
Let’s get started. Leave no one standing!

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:45.996
[J/FIGHTER]
Take it easy, children, let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:20.150
Black Lambs Temporary Headquarters

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.583
Hah...

00:05:30.593 --> 00:05:35.910
Welcome. I am special agent Yujeong Kim.
I will be...

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.181
guiding...you...

00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:42.775
Nice to meet you.
Seulbi Lee and crew, reporting for duty.

00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:45.864
Excuse me~ do we get to be formal agents? With a pension and everything?!

00:05:45.874 --> 00:05:47.737
I’ve gotta get home miss, let’s get this over with...

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:51.437
Our medical insurance covers injuries in the field, right?

00:05:51.447 --> 00:05:54.091
...

00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:56.033
Uggghh...!
