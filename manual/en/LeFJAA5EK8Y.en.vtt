00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.210
COMPUTER TV 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.120
Have a look at this.  It's the ACER EXTENSA EX4420 NOTEBOOK,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.120
and it's a pretty serious machine. It's got more ports and plugs,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.790
than most notebooks out there, which means, you know what that means,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.630
it means it's better, than all the other notebooks out there.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.000
The more ports and plugs, the better the notebook, period!

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.400
That's what I always say. Right. Everyone agrees.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.940
It's got an AMD Turion Dual-Core Processor on board, running at 2.0 GHz.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.670
It's got a full 4 GB of DDR2 RAM in it, which is nice.  

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.730
Plenty of room to breathe in this thing, and it does come installed,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.310
with Vista Home Premium.  It's got 250 GB Hard Drive.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.320
It has a Dual-Layer DVDRW Drive built in.  14" Screen which is a nice size you know.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.200
We're on the low end of the mid size laptops here.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.360
It's got a 1280 x 800 Resolution, and one of the great things,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.730
about this particular notebook is, it's got the Radeon X1250 graphics on board.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.270
So quite a bit better than the Intel GMA graphics that you find,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.100
on a lot of notebooks out there. So it's going to be a little bit more capable,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.910
than most of the lappies out there on the market.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.410
It's got up to a 3 hour Battery Life, which is really nice.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.390
Pretty solid battery life. But other than that the details here,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.560
are in what kind of plugs and ports it has and it's got plenty for you.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.530
Plenty of room for expansion. Up on the front you're going to find,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.340
that it has a Three-Button Scroll Pad down here.  The middle button being used,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.800
for horizontal and vertical scrolling. Up here on the front as well,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.480
you're going to see that we have physical switches for both,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.140
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, right up here and you also have ports,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.120
for your Headphones, for your Microphones and a Line Out. 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.960
You got a USB Port right up on the front as well and on the front you've got IE1394 or

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.660
Firewire Port as well as an Infrared Port along the front too. Over on the side here,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.600
you got a couple more USB Ports, an S-Video Port, which is great,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.870
if you're wanting to hook up to a TV or a projector maybe,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.100
that doesn't have VGA or if you just want that extra output you've got the S-Video.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.380
You've got your LAN Port here, VGA.   Now over on this side,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.550
your're going to find another USB Port. A Multi-Card Reader, right here,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.360
that'll do SD, MMC it'll do Memory Stick Pro, it'll do XD and your DVD Player is right here.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.490
And on the back we're going to find a single, lonely Modem Port,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.800
on the back of this particular notebook. It does have a Webcam right up here on the top,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.240
which is perfect for all of your video conferencing,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.780
and video blogging built in, to the bezel up here.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.450
And also up towards the top, or down here at the screen,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.850
below the screen,  are all your Quick Launch Buttons.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.750
You have quick launch buttons to get to you internet, to your email.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
You've got a programmable key right here. 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.430
You've got the Acer and powering technology button,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.860
which is going to allow you to get to very very easy back-ups and maintenance,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
of your computer system. A button to quickly lock your computer.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.360
As well as a quick search and a refresh button, right here along the top as well.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.100
So it's got plenty of room for expansion in fact, I'll just show you because,

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.220
it's a little hidden. You also have a PCMCIA Slot on the side as well.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.410
So you've got room for expansion on this notebook,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.390
with the PC Card Slot and all  of those included USB Ports.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.860
Everywhere you turn on this thing you find a USB Port,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.160
which is really really convenient. 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.100
