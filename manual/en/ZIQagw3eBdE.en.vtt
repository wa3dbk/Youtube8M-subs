 At the shores of the Xuello river,

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.829
 there are three small towns

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.529
 all of them make what the geography books call

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.529
La Ribera.

 Soon it will have finished, drink.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.920
 The baby will not be born

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.500
 How can you do it? Take away from me! I hate you!

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.259
 The baby must die

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.960
 The creature is cursed.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.580
 The baby must die!

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.920
 She is the best cook of La Ribera

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.600
Yes, mummy

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.519
 That the fears of foreigners leave my Being

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.040
 and purify my soul of Guardian.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.700
 I try to escape my fate, can I?

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.320
Doubts are chasing me, Haunting me, and seducing me.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.460
 I dispense candies every morning, ith the soul bathed in horror.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.511

 A book by
Concepción Hernández Sánchez.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.199
With the permission of Concepción, I would like to say goodbye

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.120
with a saying of her,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.539
but, in addition

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.309
I want that somebody cooperates with me

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.659
Somebody who is really close to her, Paula, her daughter.

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.310
One day I thought to create 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.599
and I get a result immensely beautiful,

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.059
Almost without realizing a song 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.100
of love and forgiveness came to me, and I called it

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.400
“Tears of bread”

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.820
Love for the rest and forgiveness for me.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.820
Nice evening
