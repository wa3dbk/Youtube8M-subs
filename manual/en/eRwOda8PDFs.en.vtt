(music)

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:19.669
The RME

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.380
Octamic XTC is an incredibly powerful
and versatile

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.960
audio interface with high-end preamps
and 24-bit 192 K

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.359
A/D converters along with extensive
digital I/O

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.519
routing capabilities. The new RME Octamic XTC,

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.140
which is due to ship this summer, is also
the world's most powerful audio

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.519
interface for iPad.

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.730
You might call it the audio production
Swiss Army knife.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.449
So what exactly do you get? Well let's
stop by look at the I/O.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.640
The Octamic XTC gives you

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.760
8 high-end Mic/line instrument preamps,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.870
ADAT I/O, AES, and what makes it
particularly interesting is the

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.149
optional MADI I/O. You also get word
clock,

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.479
MIDI I/O, USB 2 for control,

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.510
and two stereo analogue outputs.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.670
On the front panel you have a series of
powerful yet intuitive and easy to use

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.640
controls.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.250
Below each pair of mic pre's you have a
Select button

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.940
and pushing this brings up the control
parameters for these two mic inputs on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.760
the screen.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.580
Next to the screen you'll find a set of
four buttons

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.060
that give you access to a whole host of
useful features which could be navigated

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.940
with these knobs.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.720
options.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.880
Using either USB MIDI or MIDI

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.320
over MADI connection, you can directly
control gain

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.009
and a variety of other features of the
Octamic from within TotalMix FX.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.160
You could even have a whole raft of Octamic's in various locations

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.040
transmitting audio over MADI and being
controlled remotely by TotalMix FX.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.700
On top of all this, the Octamic XTC
is the world's most powerful

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.200

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.170
you can add high quality analogue inputs,
stereo line

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.989

professional power to the intuitive

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.129
interface capabilities of the iPad.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.329
You can easily select which combination of
channels is sent to the iPad;

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.359
mic inputs, ADAT, AES/EBU, and even
MADI.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.199
