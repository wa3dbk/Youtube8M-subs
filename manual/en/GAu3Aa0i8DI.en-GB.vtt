Hello everyone this is Moocluck and in this video
I will be giving you the lore of Gul'Dan in

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.849
about 1 minute, so let's not waste any 
time and let's begin.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.940
Gul'Dan was the apprentice of Ner'Zhul, who
at the time was tricked by Kil'Jaeden pretending

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.429
to be one of the orcish ancestors. When Ner'Zhul
realized and backed out, Gul'Dan took over

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.720
in his lust for power, creating the Shadow
Council, using Blackhand as a puppet Warchief

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.089
and tricking most of the orc warlords into
drinking the demon blood. Eventually he came

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.529
into contact with Medivh who at the time was possessed by the fallen titan and he promised him great

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.129
power from the Tomb of Sargeras if he would
use the Horde to conquer the world of Azeroth.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.360
Soon enough the Alliance discovered the truth and were on their way to dispatch Medivh for his trechery while Gul'Dan

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.460
had entered his mind. He was still deep in Medivh's thoughts when they killed him which caused Gul'Dan to fall into

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.690
a coma. Blackhand was then slain as well as most of Gul'Dan's warlocks by Orgrim Doomhammer.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.559
Gul'Dan begged Doomhammer him for his life and in return he made the first death knights that would

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.570
serve the Horde.
His loyalty didn't last long as Gul'Dan betrayed

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.809
Orgrim at the most crucial battle, absconding with both the Stormreaver and the Twilight's

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.549
Hammer clans, which forced the Horde army to retreat. Gul'dan sailed to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.210
the tomb of Sargeras and raised it from the
ocean depths in the search for the godlike power,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.140
only to be torn to pieces by demons and to realize that all along he was a puppet 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.210
fulfilling Sargeras' dark agenda. Later his skull was acquired by Ner'Zhul and after that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.070
Khadgar who used it to close off the Dark Portal. After the destruction the skull was discarded

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.229
but later claimed by the Burning Legion to corrupt the forests surrounding Hyjal, it 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.390
was soon discovered by Illidan Stormrage who absorbed it's power and became a demon - night elf hybrid

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.120
Gul'Dan may be long dead, but his dark deeds haunt both the Outland and Azeroth, to this day.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.300
That was all there is for this video, thanks for watching,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.970
