Howdy folks how is it going welcome to my
virgin kitchen it is Barry here and today

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:16.640
we are making some homemade Kentucky style
fried chicken hashtag naughty. Looks amazing

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.720
right and it smells chicken tastic in here
right now this is just another very simple

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.320
world cup style snack you can make I showed
you how to make oven baked ribs the other

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.250
day which you guys loved and Kentucky fried
chicken is just another one of those simple

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.699
but hashtag naughty things you might want
to try so if you want to have a go at making

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.190
this very very simple but a little bit dangerous,
do not worry about that just be careful enjoy

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.650
it, hit pause now write those ingredients
down this is how you do it.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.239
Righty ho so the first thing to show you is
this zip lock bag and in there are all my

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.579
chicken pieces and it is surrounded by buttermilk
that has been in the fridge for 2 hours and

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.719
what that does is help to moisten up the chicken
and helps our seasoning all cling to it later

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.219
so make sure you can do that leave it for
2 hours minimum but if you can leave it overnight

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.750
even better.
To make our seasoning into a mixing bowl I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.980
combined some plain flour, salt, pepper, paprika,
garlic powder, my nickname basil, oregano,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.360
ginger, nutmeg and mustard powder. Give that
a real good mix together, it actually smells

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.760
pretty darn good! Just to say you can adjust
those quantities to your liking so if you

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.120
want it a little bit stronger or maybe you
want to add some cayenne pepper in there whatever

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.320
you want to do. Obviously kfc have got this
hidden secret recipe with 11 herbs and spices

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.510
this is just like my own little twist on it
but you can do what you want to make it your

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.780
own chicken baby, that was a chicken yeah.
Once you are ready get your saucepan onto

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.280
a hob you can use whatever size pan you like
I am using a small one for more control but

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.540
of course use a bigger one if you like. You
want to get that oil nice and hot around about

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.220
300 degrees Fahrenheit but what I like to
do is just tear off a bit of bread dunk it

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.400
in and if it goes golden brown quickly we
are nearly there my friends. Take a piece

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.560
of chicken out of the buttermilk bag and place
it into the seasoning which I actually transferred

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.070
to another zip lock bag and then shake it
up. You can do a crazy mosh pit style shake

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.710
if you want to but stuff could fly everywhere
that could be bad.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.700
With the chicken nice and coated carefully
transfer it to your pan of oil it will bubble

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.250
a little bit so be very careful, fry until
it is golden brown then simply take it out

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.700
again rest it on a nice little rack and repeat
those steps with all the pieces of chicken

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.750
until they are all done chicken tastic.
Shiver me timbers guys that tastes amazing

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.490
trust me that buttermilk step is really worth
it the chicken there is so tender, you can

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.910
do without it so you do not have to but it
really is worth it you have those seasonings

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.460
in there all working together remember ramp
it up make it the strength you want it it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.860
is your chicken like BFC Barry fried chicken

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.170
