00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
I know I look good. They're just jealous.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.440
Dear eNtR fans, I'm Melissa.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.920
I'm On The Beat for you

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.400
at the Fairy Tale Tea Party in Berlin.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.640
Let's see what happens with these pretty ladies.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.600
DJ SISEN'S FAIRY TALE TEA PARTY

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.520
Unbelievably, this is a tea party.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.360
You'd think those only existed

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.080
in 18th century England,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.200
but the guy with the purple hair

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.280
managed to organise a tea party

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.320
where everyone looks pretty.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.400
I'm with Hedoluxe who looks amazing,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.920
like Tin Man from Wizard of Oz.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Why are you wearing this today?

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.160
Why not?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.400
Had I known I'd find such beauty here,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.920
I'd have made more of an effort.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.080
Even more?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.200
It's not like you find yourself

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.920
in a room of beautiful people every day.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.920
It's simply wonderful.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.520
There's yummy cakes here, too.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.640
I must have eaten 20 Ã©clairs.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.920
Could have been 40.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.960
I'm going bananas with all this cake.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.320
If the people have no bread...

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.240
There's not just cakes,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.640
but also lots of stalls selling colourful things.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.480
Like this one.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.280
Why do they all look funny? What is this exactly?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.600
Most girls here are wearing Gothic Lolita clothes.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.080
It's a fashion trend from Japan from the 90s.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.560
Many viewers want to know what's underneath?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.280
Why is this so fluffy?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.440
It looks fluffy when you wear

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.800
30 million different petticoats.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.080
I'm wearing one, two, and a third one

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.080
but that one's too short.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.000
Showing that would be too kinky.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.280
I'm with three beautiful ladies now.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.960
We like the Lolita fashion style.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.960
At first we were interested in Manga and Japan.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.280
Then we found out

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.760
there are great fashion styles in Japan,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.400
and we each developed our own style out of that.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.200
It's a great example of integration.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.240
Japanese, Germans, Chinese, Englishmen...

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.320
And everyone gets along. No trouble.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.480
We had a lot of fun and cakes and tea

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.880
and to have lots of nice, pretty people

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.240
in one place is rare.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.040

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.400
DJ Sisen and I say bye-bye.
