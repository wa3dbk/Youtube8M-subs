00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.650
One two, one two, one two, 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.300
One two, one two…  

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.380
Come on!

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.169
One two, one two, one two, one two…
Huh, huh?

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:28.119
What’s the matter, Patrol?

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.180
Keep going… 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.290
one two, one two, one two…

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.620
Corrupted souls!

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.030
You are inciting others to sin and fornication.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.800
Young people nowadays are losing their values. We should have a little chat about what we just saw.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.519
You know that the story…

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.650
about the birds and the bees or the stork isn´t true

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.559
Are you trying to talk to us about sex, Father Beto?

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.790
You can´t come up with a better word than that, Juan?

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.220
Like what?

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.600
Life! 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.549
Make sure you understand this: procreation is only possible between a man and a woman

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.100
who have been joined by sacred marriage vows.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.790
Everything else is against the will of God.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.190
What´s “everything else”?

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.930
Everything else.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.250
Dancing really close and touching each other?
Kissing someone and feeling really good?

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.220
Abstinence, patrol, abstinence! 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.480
Do not give in to the unhealthy pleasures of the flesh.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.050
If God didn’t not want us to feel pleasure then why did he give us a clitoris,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.900
which has no other purpose?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.710
What are you whispering about, Natalia?

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.650
Nothing. 
The thing is, Sister Juana told us something different.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.120
Oh really? 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.620
And what does Sister Juana say?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.760
God gave humanity the gift of sexuality

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.250
and every person has the right to feel pleasure.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.830
Because God did not create human beings for them to be unhappy,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.890
but for them to enjoy this wonderful reality 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.990
that he gave them.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.259
Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.619
I sat beneath the shadow of the one whom I desired, and his fruit was sweet to my palate.

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.969
He took me to the wine cellar.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.169
What is going on here, w-what is this pornography, patrol?

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.859
It´s the Bible.

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:21.919
The Bible? 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.589
How can that be the Bible?

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.539
The Song of Songs! 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.169
It is so lovely.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.359
Oh my God and I said this was…

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.269
I’m going to give up tamales for a year.
