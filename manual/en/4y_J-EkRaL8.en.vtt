00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.080
Do you think going vegan means giving up your
favorite holiday meals? Does a turkey-free

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.100
Thanksgiving sound desolate and wrong? 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.980
Is your only impression of a vegan Thanksgiving this thing? 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.980
[horror music] 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.780
Well fear not,
because I’m here to show you how to have

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.510
a deliciously abundant and epically ethical
thanksgiving dinner.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.070
Hi it’s Emily from Bite Size Vegan and welcome
to another vegan nugget. While Thanksgiving

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.109
is certainly a time to gather with family
and focus on the things we’re grateful for,

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.720
if we’re really being honest, it’s about
food. Lots and lots of food.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.160
Now if you’re a new vegan or considering
going vegan, the idea of a Thanksgiving without

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.030
the familiar turkey-based array may seem disheartening.
That’s why today I’ve brought in a team

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.390
of specialists to create an epic vegan spread
for your holiday meal. Here at Bite Size Vegan,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.750
I tend to focus on the “why” of being
vegan, speaking to the ethical and moral basis

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.969
for a vegan lifestyle and encouraging people
to make the connection between the food on

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.500
their plate and the individuals from which
it originated. To find out about the ethical

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.569
issues with American Thanksgiving, including
the horrors that turkeys endure, you can check

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:11.889
out my video on the truth about Thanksgiving.
But equally important is the “how” of

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:16.219
being vegan because you can make the connection
and decide to never eat at the expense of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.299
another being again, but strong ethics and
morals won’t make you a sandwich.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.380
Trust me…I’ve tried.

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.889
And if you know me, you’re familiar with
my serious lack of culinary skills. So I’ve

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:33.450
teamed up with eight incredibly kitchen-adept
vegan YouTubers to bring you the “how to”

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.279
of an epically ethical Thanksgiving dinner.
They’re each going to give you a little

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:41.240
peak into their dish and then I’ll give
you the link to the full playlist a the end.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.739
And when you do head over to their videos,
be sure to hit their subscribe buttons for

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:49.819

ado, let’s get thankful!

this savory seitan roast stuffed with herbacious

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:05.179
classic holiday red dressing. Show no mercy
and drown it in mushroom gravy. And pay no

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.719
attention to the mess as you devour its innards-
it's delicious, cruelty-free innards, that is.

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.940
You do not need to eat meat! 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.220

her citrus spiked cranberry sauce.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.389
Jenelle: This is a very simple recipe. Now
if you're used to the cranberry sauce in the

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.560
can, this isn't going to be anywhere near
as sweet as you're used to- this is so much

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.319
better for us.
