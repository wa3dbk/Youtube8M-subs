00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.810
Okay, in this next clip I'm going to show
you now how to just smooth everything out

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.570
and make it all blend. Alright, so you've
done everything that you think you could do,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.630
now realize there's not enough, or a little,
or a lot, it's your preference as to when

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.880
you want to stop with the scraping and the
sanding and the beating up of the wood. I

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.769
like what I achieved, now it's time to just
get everything right, and smooth, and finished.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.489
So what you're going to do is with your scraper
is just lightly scrape, you're going to lightly

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:38.710
scrape everything down like so, we're just
giving it a quick scrape to get off any excess

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.410
or anything, and what you want to do then
is come back with your rag, just give it a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.461
quick wipe off with your rag for any loose
dust or sand or particles. And what you're

00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:56.370
going to do then is get your steel wool; your
steel wool will smooth everything out. If

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.690
you go with the steel wool, triple zero, very
fine, very smooth, just to like sort of smooth

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.999
everything out and sort of feather any of
the paint or the sanding that you might not

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:10.020
have accomplished with the sandpaper, just
to give it like a feathering effect, and we'll

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.899
also smooth everything. If you don't have
steel wool, you can go up to a 220 or even

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.619
a 300 sandpaper, usually a 220 is the standard
number for that, for smoothing out. You're

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.689
just going to want to work everything nice,
same way you did it, and you'll see like just

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.959
by doing this you're giving it a nice smooth
look, you'll feel it, it's nice, no splinters,

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.159
you don't want anyone to get splinters, and
just look at how beautiful this looks! I mean

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:45.640
this, we took a pretty inexpensive piece of
pine armoire that was relatively cheap and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.939
we turned it into something that looks very
old and antique, and we did it in one weekend.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.039
So come back, I'm just going to talk to you
a little bit about where to get everything,

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.229
about cost, and about how to do this on a
weekend project with you and your family.
