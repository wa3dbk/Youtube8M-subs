00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:05.832
Aquarium setup â€“ based on potting soil

00:00:07.963 --> 00:00:13.803
90 days after start

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:22.813
i think tank looks good, most of the plants had already been pruned

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.120
plants which were growing in the middle of the tank are in good condition

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:38.392
 those which were on right and left did not survived

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:42.372
there was not enough light

00:00:53.021 --> 00:01:00.021
sagitaria (lawn) took almost the entire front lawn

00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:20.103
by rare cutting

00:01:20.103 --> 00:01:24.843
second and third plan merged into one

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:44.986
the lower part of the plant, despite the absence of light

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:49.786
looks nice

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:30.129
plants which were on the sides of aquarium did not survive

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.089
they melted away

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:40.709
You can see what has left from Ceratopteris siliquosa

00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:11.134
on the left is hygrophila polysperma, which is less demanding and somehow coping

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.350
aquarium needs another trimming

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.070
some plants are over 50 cm long

00:03:41.047 --> 00:03:47.487
