00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.910
Whatever your physical capabilities, or level
of fitness, it's essential that you prepare

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.310
yourself adequately before a climb, especially
the steep climbs and climbs that last over 10 minutes.

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.570
 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.340
 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.610
First and foremost, you must ensure prior
to the ride that the gear ratio you have will

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.490
suit the terrain. Fortunately, most modern
gear setups have compact-style ratios, with

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.490
50 tooth x 34 front chainring, and 12-25 or
28 rear cassette. On the very long, strength-sapping

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.319
climbs, it's a good tip to be actually be
slightly under-geared and have a reserve sprocket

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:48.260
or two, just in case you get into difficulty.
Remember, spinning is better than churning.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.229
Know your route.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.489
So that you are suitably mentally prepared,
it is definitely a benefit to know your route

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.749
beforehand. Not in minute detail, but certainly
if there are any significant climbs to tackle.

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.959
Not knowing your route can be exciting, but
hitting climb after climb and not knowing

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:08.950
what lays ahead can also be pretty demoralising.
So, get clued up.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.440
Try not to eat when climbing. Get any solid
food down you a good 10 minutes before you

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.440
hit the climb. Believe me, when you're trying
to gulp in air on a climb, no matter how tasty

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.610
the bar is, it's a pretty difficult challenge.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.120
Of course, there's no harm in sipping drinks
while climbing.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.920
Clothing.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.300
Even in colder weather, it is remarkably easy
to overheat while climbing, with the increased

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.560
workload and lack of cooling wind due to the
lower speeds. If you can, and where it is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.560
safe to do so, remove any arm warmers, capes
or gilets prior to the climb, so you can effectively

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.780
assist in keeping your body temperature regulated.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.770
On the approach.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.659
Your level of fitness will dictate how hard
you can hit the foot of a climb, and of course

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.750
how fast you can actually climb it. For those
of us not as gifted as Quintana or Froome,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.409
it's best to try and rest a little on the
run-in to the climb, so you start climbing

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.510
in a relaxed state, which will have a knock-on
effect of enabling you to get into a steady

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.959
rhythm with no sense of panic.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.060
You're now prepared for a climb. Go for it!
