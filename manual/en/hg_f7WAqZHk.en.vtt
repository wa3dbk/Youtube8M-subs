CHICKEN PARMESAN RECIPE

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:02.399
Hey there and welcome to No Recipe Required.

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.779
I’m Dave and tonight I’m going to make
one of my Italian favorites for you, simple

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.779
chicken parmesan.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.429
Well, we’re just going to pound out the
chicken breast, sear it off and layer it with

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.560
my favorite tomato sauce, one you can find
on the site, a little bit of cheese and kind

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.710
of put it all together.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.710
It’s absolutely delicious.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.060
I love it, I know you will too.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.150
Let’s go ahead and get started.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.199
Okay, so let’s go ahead and get started
on our chicken parmesan.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.980
We’ve got a pan hot on the oven, a little
bit of olive oil there, and then we’re going

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.480
to sear off two chicken breasts.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.750
Lay down one, lay down two; you want to hear
that nice sizzle, seasoned obviously on both

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.460
sides with salt and pepper.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.920
And then on the back burner I’ve got my
basic tomato sauce that I pulled out of the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.370
freezer, just heating up.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.160
And once we get the chicken seared we’re
going to top it with the sauce, then we’re

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.780
going to throw it all together.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.740
Okay, so I’ve got my chicken seared off.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.190
Now it’s most of the way cooked, but it’s
not quite all the way.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.080
We are going to bake it off in the oven.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.420
We’re going to top it off with a generous
amount of our tomato sauce and I don’t frankly

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.980
mind if some of that sauce leaks off because
I like to cook some pasta and serve my chicken

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.159
parmesan with some pasta and what falls off
the chicken breast there, makes a great sauce.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:34.860
So once I’ve got that on there I like to
throw just a little bit of parmesan cheese

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.090
on top and then a little bit of mozzarella.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.170
I happen to be using fresh mozzarella that
I just cut but you can certainly, you know,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.180
use grated.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.240
And then I’m going to pop this into a 450
degree oven.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.830
A nice hot oven that’s going to melt the
cheese quickly and finish cooking the chicken

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.710
through, then we’ll have our chicken parmesan.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.220
Okay, after about 10 minutes, the cheese is
going to be melted but not yet nice and brown.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.289
I don’t want to overcook the chicken so
I want to get even higher heat on it.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.010
I’m going to throw the broiler on high.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.519
Throw this under the broiler for probably
three more minutes once the broiler is up

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.069
and running and then our chicken parmesan
will be done.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.480
This is also the time I’m going to cook
up some angel hair pasta.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.580
Okay, I just pulled my chicken parmesan out
of the broiler.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.640
I’ve got the nice crust on the cheese.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.139
I’m going to turn the heat back on just
to keep my plate warm and I’m going to move

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:43.000
my chicken over to a holding plate and I’m
going to drain my pasta.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.140
I’m going to come back and add our pasta
directly to this pan.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.640
Okay, I’ve got my pasta here, drained.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.980
I don’t mind if a little pasta water gets
in there.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.010
I’m going to toss the pasta.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.090
I’m going to hit it with a little bit more
olive oil and use my tongs just to, you know,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:09.530
get up all that extra cheese and extra sauce
that is on the bottom of the pan and make

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.139
sure it’s nicely absorbed in the pasta.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.650
Now I’m not looking for this pasta to be
like a true, you know, marinara pasta or pasta

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.599
pomodoro.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.709
I just want a little bit of that flavoring
on there which is what I’ve got.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:31.430
I’m going to turn the heat off, give it
a couple cracks of pepper, little bit of salt

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.219
and finish it with a little bit more parmesan
cheese.

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:47.889
Give it one more glug of olive oil, give it
a quick toss and then we’ll serve our chicken

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.919
parmesan right over this pasta.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.519
Okay, let’s go ahead and serve up our chicken
parm.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.169
I’ve got my pasta here that we’ve just
flavored with the, kind of the pan drippings

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:06.079
off that chicken parmesan.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.730
Then we’ll take our chicken, lay that right
on top of the pasta.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.790
Do a little wipe and we are good to go.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.300
I’ll see you next time on No Recipe Required.
