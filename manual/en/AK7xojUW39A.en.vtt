00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.740
Hey, I'm Alison.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.980
Look at this fabulous cake
stand and matching tutu favors.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.670
It's so perfect for a
princess-themed baby shower.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.040
I'll show you how I made it.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.039
Here's what you'll need.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.070
Place the elastic band
around your hat box.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.810
Cut lengths of pink and white tulle
so that they are approximately double

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.960
the length of the hat box.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:32.152
 

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:35.280
Loop each piece of tulle
around the elastic band,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610
alternating pink and white.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.090
To finish your princess
baby shower, check out

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.100
the tutorial at the end of this video.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.600
For the princess baby shower, I also
made these adorable little tutu party favors.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.480
To make these decorative candy
jars, here's what you'll need.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.370
Small canning jars with lids and rings.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.880
Pink and white candies.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.330
First, fill each jar with
the pink and white candies.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.660
Next, instead of cutting strips of
tulle, cut three circles of tulle,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.600
making sure the smallest size is large
enough to overlap the canning jar ring.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.640
Place the tulle circle cut-outs
on top of the canning jar lid.

00:01:31.878 --> 00:01:35.310
And screw on the canning jar
ring to secure into place.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.030
Display the favors on
the tutu cake stand.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.040
The mom of honor will sparkle
when she sees the tutu cake stand

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.350
that you created for the party.
