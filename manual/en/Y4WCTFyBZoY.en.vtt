00:00:04.553 --> 00:00:05.949
- In this part of the tutorial,

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:08.131
we're gonna do another
milk and cookies shot,

00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:09.282
and this time I want to show you

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:11.390
how we're gonna do it on
a medium format camera.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.894
This is the Hasselblad H4D-60.

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:16.104
Let's talk about a couple things.

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:18.533
We wanna look again at
leading the eye through

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.136
and this time we're working all

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:21.111
with natural light.

00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:23.829
So let's take a quick shot here

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.865
I'm just using the huge bank of windows,

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:27.528
wow, it's really starting to blow out.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.574
The light is really
starting to pour in here now

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:33.774
as you can see so my exposure's
completely blowing out.

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:35.558
And this cookie's terrible.

00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:37.382
It's coming off of the frame,

00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:39.510
there's a giant negative space in here,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.718
(ominous music)
I just don't like that

00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:42.408
so let's go ahead and
we're gonna reframe it

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.378
(ominous music)

00:00:43.378 --> 00:00:45.028
and we'll go ahead and take another shot

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:47.695
(ominous music)

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:51.491
- The time has come

00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:54.493
(ominous music)
- Nah-uh, not again, Cookie!

00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:55.326
- Cookie.

00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:57.184
- Cookie.

00:00:57.184 --> 00:00:59.451
- Cookie! Om nom nom nom

00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:03.408
(ominous music plays faster)

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:06.224
(plate crashing)

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:07.057
Buh-bye.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.181
- That's exactly why
you have to be prepared

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:15.623
and have two of everything.

00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:17.385
I've got a second set right over here

00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:19.883
completely duplicated and ready to go.

00:01:19.883 --> 00:01:22.154
I've found over the years that
clients really appreciate it

00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:24.762
if I have a contingency
plan for the curve balls

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:26.234
that are coming in every job.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:27.417
So, we want you to take a look

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:29.592
at The Complete Guide to
Editorial Food Photography

00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:31.953
that RGGEDU has prepared for you.

00:01:31.953 --> 00:01:33.860
It's over 17 hours of content.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.405
It's gonna give you a ton
of amazing information

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:39.922
of not only how to shoot great
images and edit great images,

00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:42.499
but how to deal with issues
like the Cookie Monster.

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:45.082
(upbeat music)

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:52.565
♫ Ten cookies looking mighty fine

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:54.175
♫ Cookie Monster eat one

00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:58.408
♫ Mmmm, now there are nine.

00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:01.163
♫ Nine cookies where there used to be ten.

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:05.330
♫ Wish that we could
have ten cookies again.
