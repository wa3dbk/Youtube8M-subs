00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.010
Nearsightedness also known as myopia

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.480
is the condition when a person cannot see
distant objects clearly

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.290
unless glasses are worn

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.319
many children develop myopia during their
school years

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:15.929
can we prevent a child from becoming nearsighted?

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.489
this information is brought to you as a public service 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.109
by the International Myopia Prevention Association

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.819
a nonprofit research organization dedicated
to preventing nearsightedness

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.239
nearsightedness is caused by focusing on close
up objects such as a book or a computer for

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.490
for long periods of time

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.150
prolonged close working is unnatural and stressful

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.760
the eyes get stuck in the close up focus position and can focus only at shorter and shorter

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.290
distances

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.079
this happens because the focusing muscles
also called ciliary muscles lock up

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.980
causing the eyes to become more elongated and thus more nearsighted

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.960
clear distance vision is lost forever

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.930
what can be done to prevent nearsightedness
in a child?

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.420
the problem must be caught as soon as the child experiences the first difficulty in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.320
seeing distant objects clearly

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.630
such as the TV or the writing on the board
at school

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.120
don't delay or an irreversible over elongation of the eye will occur

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.280
eye doctors prescribe distance glasses to correct blurred distance vision

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.329
but this makes the problem worse because they
force the focusing muscles

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:28.750
to stay locked up

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.189
which further elongate the eyes

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.260
this results in the need for stronger distance glasses

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.260
the child is thus doomed to a lifetime of reliance
on distance glasses and worsening eyesight

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.170
there is an alternative!

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.689
if a child uses reading glasses for prolonged
periods of reading and other close work

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.960
the focusing muscles should not locked up

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.160
and nearsightedness should be prevented

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.080
the child will not be reliant on reading glasses

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.370
reading glasses are just a protective tool
to be used for periods of close work

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.730
instead of prescribing distance glasses the
eye doctor should inform parents about this

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.730
option of using reading glasses for reading
and prolonged close work

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.530
for the child who is on the verge of becoming
nearsighted

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.260
[plus three] reading glasses should usually be
prescribed

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.829
there is no need to sacrifice a childâ€™s vision
