00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.689
Police Helicopter

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.869
Set number 30222,

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.869
contains 33 pieces, and recommended for ages 5 to 12.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.359
So we're going to be building a police helicopter here.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.750
And this is in a bag.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.750
Let's see what we got inside.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.820
So I'm taking it that all of the pieces are just in the bag here,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.820
and we do get the instructions.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.770
So let's put together our Lego City Police Helicopter.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.550
So let's put together our Lego City Police Helicopter.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.360
So let's put together our Lego City Police Helicopter.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.530
So our helicopter is assembled.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.640
Let's take a look at our mini-fig.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.850
He's wearing a helmet. The visor does come up and down.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.820
He's got a smile on his face.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.380
I like the police fatigues, dark blue.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.500
I like the police fatigues, dark blue.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.670
I like the police fatigues, dark blue.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.560
Really nice mini-fig.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.979
And you get some extra parts and such.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:46.930
An extra antenna, visor and a slope.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.500
An extra antenna, visor and a slope.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.320
Now let's take a look at the Police Helicopter.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.380
Now let's take a look at the Police Helicopter.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.460
The blades do spin around,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.679
and the cockpit does open up.

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.049
and the cockpit does open up.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.150
We can easily seat our mini-fig in here.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.079
We can easily seat our mini-fig in here.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:19.209
Kind of just set him down in there.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.519
Close it up. Everything fits nice.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.010
Close it up. Everything fits nice.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.309
Propellers, the tail-wing.

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:31.869
Very simple build but it's really great

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:32.899
for only 33 pieces.

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:36.189
for only 33 pieces.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.659
It's a great addition to any Lego city.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.789
So this is the Lego City

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.900
Police Helicopter. Set number 30222,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.719

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.859
It's a great little helicopter.

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:57.419
