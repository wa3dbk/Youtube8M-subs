00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.526
&gt;&gt;Elisabeth: I feel
like I basically live

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:09.536
in a science laboratory, whether
it is the crops that are grown

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:14.366
in the field, the nutrition that
dad has to figure on his cattle

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.226
to figure out how they're
going to gain best,

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:17.976
or helping my parents
in the vet clinic.

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:23.316
&gt;&gt;June: They help us in
most everything that we do,

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:24.576
and I just see it as life.

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:26.986
This is what we're doing,
and they do it along with us,

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.816
but there's nothing
that we do here

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:30.886
that doesn't probably
involve science.

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:41.666
&gt;&gt;Ryan: I'm the fifth
generation to operate this farm.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:46.216
On this farm, we grow corn
and soybeans and some alfalfa.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.046
Most of the corn gets fed
to our cattle that we feed

00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:50.546
at the feed yard, so it's kind

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:53.976
of a fairly common Midwestern
type of family farm setting.

00:00:57.626 --> 00:00:59.476
&gt;&gt;June: He has a
veterinary science Bachelor's

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.106
and I have an animal
science Bachelor's.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.636
And then we went on and
got our Doctorate degree.

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:06.536
Yes, we're scientists,
and that's what we do.

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:10.676
But I see myself more as a
food safety veterinarian,

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:12.716
making sure that your food
is healthy, so you don't have

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:15.006
to worry about it when you
cut into a steak or a piece

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:17.256
of chicken or whatever
it is that you choose

00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:17.886
for your protein source.

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:23.866
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Drove 4, so I'm putting
in 5340 high moisture corn,

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.976
and up to 5850 a supplement.

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:30.036
&gt;&gt;Elisabeth: In the livestock
industry, that's all science,

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:34.436
the feed rations that dad has
to plan are very in-depth,

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:36.976
and it takes a lot of
strategic planning and thinking.

00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:41.576
&gt;&gt;Cort: Why do we give more
hay to the younger cattle?

00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:43.476
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Because they
came off the pasture

00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:45.126
and so their tummies
are used to--

00:01:45.456 --> 00:01:46.156
&gt;&gt;Cort: And hay is like grass.

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:46.306
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Roughage.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:46.686
Right, right.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:48.996
&gt;&gt;When you look at the cattle,

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:51.016
they're a biology
experiment right there.

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:53.706
Ruminant nutrition, it's
different than mono-gastric,

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:55.666
so you can look at
nutrition on how they eat,

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.736
and the ingredients
that they eat.

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:01.426
&gt;&gt;June: So there's
a triangle here.

00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:03.506
And this is her jugular vein,

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:05.966
and that's her cervical
vertebrae.

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:07.536
&gt;&gt;Ryan: You can look at them

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:09.016
from an immunological
standpoint,

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:10.806
how your vaccines prevent them

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:11.976
from being sick,
those kind of things.

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:18.936
&gt;&gt;Elisabeth: So this morning
I vaccinated the five-way

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:22.406
vaccination, so that prevented
five different viruses.

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:26.256
And because of the
prevention, we don't have

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:27.676
to use as many antibiotics.

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:30.336
It's much more efficient for us,
because there's less sick cattle

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:33.976
in the long-run, and it's for
the health of our animals.

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:35.296
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Should be good.

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:36.976
We get Reveler 200,
Bogo Shield cleanup.

00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:40.026
&gt;&gt;Elisabeth: Computers
are definitely used

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.506
in every aspect of
our operation.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.686
At the feed yard, we have a
program that we enter treatments

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:47.946
and vaccinations for
different pens of cattle.

00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:50.706
And because of that,
we're able to make sure

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:52.416
that the withdrawal
dates are correct

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:53.776
and that cattle aren't sent

00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:56.126
to market while there's still
antibiotics in their system.

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:58.926
This steer has an abscess
right here on his neck.

00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:00.746
You're okay, buddy.

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:04.196
&gt;&gt;Cort: Normally, we just
give them the vaccine.

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:06.936
But usually there's
something wrong

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:10.876
with at least one steer other
than that it needs vaccines.

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:12.826
One of the cattle
had an abscess,

00:03:13.466 --> 00:03:15.196
like right under
his chin, there.

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.926
So we had to flush it out.

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:26.496
&gt;&gt;Ryan: You can go
over to the crop side,

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:27.356
and you turn to agronomy.

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:29.376
You know, that's something
you learn when you're little,

00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:32.066
fertilizer, nitrogen,
phosphorous, potassium.

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.386
And water conservation, erosion.

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:36.976
I mean, it's just seems
like it is all around us.

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:42.476
&gt;&gt;Elisabeth: Even the way
our pens are designed,

00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:44.326
whether it's the
slope of the pens,

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:46.866
or how the water
run-off happens,

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:49.246
or even the electric
fence, that's all physics,

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:50.026
and that's all science.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.976
So like I said, I literally
live in a science laboratory.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:58.906
&gt;&gt;June: My kids, since they
were newborn have ridden

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.386
in the saddle with me at the
feed yard, and so they've looked

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:03.016
at steers every day
since they were little.

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:06.946
And so steers are what they do.

00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:09.936
&gt;&gt;Erika: I go with Liz and
we ride pens at the feed yard

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:13.566
in the morning, and check
for sick or hurt cattle.

00:04:13.676 --> 00:04:17.926
Also every morning we
wash our 4H show cattle,

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:19.866
and brush them up,
just working with them,

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:20.816
get them ready for the fair.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:29.016
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Okay, question
number one,

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:31.976
which steer is the
Hereford market steer?

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:34.186
&gt;&gt;June: This is a
market steer class,

00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:37.576
and so these guys will
be hamburger and steak

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:41.126
in a little bit, and so he's
evaluating them, good structure,

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:43.756
and he wants good balance, he
wants a thickness throughout

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:45.736
from his rear all the
way to his shoulder,

00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:48.096
and you want a wide
back, because that's

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:50.806
where the main part of your
tenderloin, your prime rib,

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:51.976
that's where that comes from.

00:04:55.626 --> 00:04:58.846
&gt;&gt;Carsten: So what we did, we
had about six different animals.

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:00.526
There was a market
and a breeding

00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:01.656
for each type of animal.

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:04.006
And we just had to
pick the best one

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:05.506
that would suit it
for that thing.

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:08.176
Like you'd pick the
largest animal

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:09.976
with the best muscle for market.

00:05:13.606 --> 00:05:15.056
&gt;&gt;Elisabeth: As far as
the pet clinic goes,

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:18.326
I've been taught anatomy
since I was three.

00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:19.976
Just watching them and
learning from them.

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.966
&gt;&gt;June: So cats don't
have as long

00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:24.776
of a cervix, or a
body of uterus.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:28.876
So with dogs, that'll
stretch the womb out.

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:30.466
You want to get closer
to the ovaries.

00:05:30.716 --> 00:05:31.976
With cats, you can usually
pull their ovaries out.

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:34.516
&gt;&gt;Elisabeth: The
spay that we did,

00:05:34.516 --> 00:05:38.636
I've helped mom do those
spays for many years.

00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:41.976
And I learn about suturing.

00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:45.236
&gt;&gt;June: Their little minds,
ever since they were little

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:46.746
when Ryan would be
doing an necropsy

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.796
on a calf, "What organ is that?

00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:50.306
How does that organ function?"

00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:54.976
He did life science and anatomy
and physiology as they went.

00:05:57.516 --> 00:05:59.426
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Critical thinking
is something I want my kids

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.906
to learn more than anything.

00:06:00.906 --> 00:06:04.316
And that goes beyond the farm.

00:06:04.316 --> 00:06:07.766
Whether, you know, just
thinking critically about,

00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:09.646
"Does this process make sense?"

00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:12.076
Or, "Should I do this or not?"

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.846
&gt;&gt;Elisabeth: I think there's
absolutely no comparison

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.086
to actually just doing the
work and watching it happen.

00:06:21.086 --> 00:06:25.436
There's no way that you
can learn that by sitting

00:06:25.436 --> 00:06:27.136
in a classroom and having
somebody tell you that.

00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:30.616
I think that since I've grown
up with my parents, I've learned

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:33.406
so much, just basic
problem solving

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:35.956
that I don't think you would get
if you're not in the workforce.

00:06:37.666 --> 00:06:38.716
&gt;&gt;Ryan: There ya go.

00:06:39.236 --> 00:06:39.626
&gt;&gt;Cort: There we go.

00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:39.716
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Okay.

00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:41.786
Now, make sure, are
they on zero?

00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:44.666
&gt;&gt;And I think through
problem solving,

00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:47.326
I think it teaches our kids
to not be dependent on others.

00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:50.296
Create your own opportunities,
don't depend on somebody else

00:06:50.346 --> 00:06:51.686
to come along and
fix it for you.

00:06:51.686 --> 00:06:55.226
And as a parent, sometimes
it's hard to step back

00:06:55.226 --> 00:06:58.336
and let them problem solve, put
one of the kids to do a job,

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:00.256
and they're doing it
wrong, and you just have

00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:01.796
to walk away and let them learn.

00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:03.766
And my dad did that to me.

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:06.166
And I think as a parent,
I'm finally realizing,

00:07:06.886 --> 00:07:10.206
he did have to bite his lip
or turn his head, and say,

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:11.776
"Well, figure it out."
