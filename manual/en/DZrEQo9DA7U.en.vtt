00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.000
Senator Lugar:
I reacted with joy,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.367
as I'm certain any
American would

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:07.200
in understanding
the Medal of Freedom

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000
and all of the background
implications of that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.633
It was certainly a time
in which I could reflect,

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.333
and my friends have,

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.367
on the work we did
with young children,

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.400
as a school board
member in Indianapolis,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.467
then as Mayor
trying to unite our city

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.233
with the city and the county,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:30.000
all around it, at a difficult
time that really led to growth.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.834
Over the last 40 years,
it's been exciting to witness.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:37.700
Then 36 years of Senate service,
which I had a great partnership

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.033
during much of it with
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia,

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:43.700
on the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative
Threat Reduction Act,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.667
in which we managed to bring
about with cooperation

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.867
of the former Soviet Union,
and then the Russians,

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:55.333
the destruction of almost
all of their weapons.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.967
There are still about
a thousand warheads to go,

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:02.100
some chemical weapons being
destroyed as we speak.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.800
But as Mayor of Indianapolis,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.433
I had no idea
that we were targeted.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.900
That the whole city
could have been wiped out.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.400
When I got over to the former
Soviet Union, at their request,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.100
and found out really how we
could work together

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.700
to take care of those problems,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.800
it meant a great deal to me,
to my city, to my country,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.200
and we continue
to work on those dilemmas.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.500
I would say that the best
advice that I've received

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500
is to be honest.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.600
Maintain your integrity.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.400
Tell the truth.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.133
That is difficult
advice to follow,

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.333
under all circumstances.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.367
But very good advice.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.967
Learn how to speak,
learn how to write,

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:48.533
have objectives from
their scholarship,

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:52.100
and do that scholarship well,
but do it --

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.266
hope to devote a portion of 
their lives to public service.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:02:00.133
Obviously, it would be great
to have a good marriage,

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:04.333
to raise children, and to
have all the joys of family.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:07.133
But then to extend
that to other families,

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.967
to the community
in which you live.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:12.200
Or the state or the
country, as the case may be.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.467
That is like fate, to make
your life much more satisfying.
