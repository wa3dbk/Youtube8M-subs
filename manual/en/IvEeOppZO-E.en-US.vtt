00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:09.457
Acceptance to the lost

00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:12.268
dade : If you show me an example (of Lulu), then I'll do it.
Kang Min : Hyunwoo, give an example.

00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:14.973
Hyunwoo : Ah~ I'm good at mimicking voices in general.
Kang Min : Yeah, show us!

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:20.009
Hyunwoo : "Let's go! Let's go"
Kang Min : Stop doing that. It's been years you're doing that.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.427
Hyunwoo : "Hugeify!"

00:00:22.427 --> 00:00:24.500
Kang Min : That was bad.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.633
Hyunwoo : "Too tall! Much too Tall." Something like this?
Kang Min : Okay. That was good enough.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.149
Hyunwoo : Ah. My voice was hell. My apologize.

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.287
Kang Min : Next is dade!

00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:34.984
dade : Which one do I have to do?

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:38.422
Kang Min : It's the same. You can do Lulu's "Too tall! Much too Tall."

00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:41.479
dade : Do I have to do that?
Kang Min : Yes. That's Lulu.
dade : I think the difficulty increased.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:47.380
Kang Min : No, no~ You just have to do it once. He just followed it.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.871
Kang Min : "Too tall! Much too Tall."

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:54.383
dade : Can I go with "Hugeify!"?

00:00:54.383 --> 00:01:00.383
Hyunwoo : Do it!. You can do it!

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.679
dade : "Too tall! Much too Tall."
Dade : Sigh...

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:17.226
Kang Min : He can't say anything because of phlegm.
Go with "Hugeify." Do "Hugeify."

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:20.113
dade : Hugeify!

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.851
Hyunwoo : The tone itself wasn't that bad.
Faker : The tone wasn't bad, but...

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:27.650
Hyunwoo : But? Then you should show us.
Faker : No, never mind.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.467
Kang Min : You lost? Did he win?
Faker : Yes, I lost.

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:34.566
dade : Why are you so fast at admitting the loss...
Kang Min : You were like that.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:39.655
Faker quickly admits a loss in order to stop mimicking voices.

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:43.618
Sniper ban for Wolf

00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:49.618
Kang Min : Zilean and Gangplank are banned.
Hyunwoo : Well, the players are putting too much meaning to the bans.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:55.633
Faker : No, Wolf plays a lot of Gangplank and he is a real troller with it.

00:01:56.003 --> 00:02:02.003
Hyunwoo : So, you banned in order to prevent from your team's Wolf doesn't play it?
Kang Min : In the solo rank, lots of people do this.

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:12.708
Hyunwoo : Another weird champion.
Kang Min : Faker bans Ga, Gal, Gang (Garen, Galio, Gangplank) in the solo rank.

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:16.896
Faker : Ah? I didn't ban...
Hyunwoo : Huh? You didn't use one of your ban cards...

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:22.896
Kang Min : Faker's mentality is broken now.
Faker isn't holding up tight. This is a problem.

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:26.331
Hyunwoo : Fast~

00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:29.135
Faker : I had to all the Wolf's champion.

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:34.163
Faker seems to be short on ban cards to prevent Wolf being a troller.

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:39.501
This is my area!

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:41.787
Kang Min : Wait, wait.

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:43.098
Faker : I'm not going.

00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:46.257
Hyunwoo : Ah. Why? dade is going to the mid lane.

00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:47.970
Kang Min : dade is really going.
Hyunwoo : Hurry! Hurry! Change the lane.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.815
Faker : It's okay. I'll leave it to Wolf.

00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:55.924
Kang Min : Wait.
dade : I kind of knew it, so I was about to do Graves.

00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:57.894
Kang Min : Change it! Change it! Is it too late?

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:00.673
Faker : I have to run away from him.
Hyunwoo : Everything was planned out.

00:03:00.673 --> 00:03:06.114
Kang Min : Change it. AH. Mata rejected the exchange.

00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:10.848
Faker : I have to run away from him.

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:13.764
Hyunwoo : Faker chose Alistar for trolling.

00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:18.234
Kang Min : I know. What a guy.
dade : Sigh, Faker.

00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:23.262
Faker took the troller spot as he cheered for playing Alistar.

00:03:23.262 --> 00:03:27.367
Did Faker planned this out?

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:33.367
Kang Min : This is an event match pick vs. LOL Champs pick.
 Faker's team chose LOL Champs champions.

00:03:34.203 --> 00:03:40.203
Hyunwoo : However, in the lane phase, dade's team is little bit better.

00:03:42.184 --> 00:03:47.170
Kang Min : dade is in the mid lane...Oh...Nice Lee Sin.
Hyunwoo : This is bit dangerous. No Flash.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.170
Kang Min : He got pulled!
Faker : He got pulled by blitz.

00:03:54.887 --> 00:03:58.705
Hyunwoo : 1 level fight.
Kang Min : Why is the 1level fight so "dog-like"?

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.232
Faker : "dog-like" fight...
Kang Min : Why is the 1level fight so "dog-like"?
dade : It's not "dog-like."

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:07.232
Kang Min : It's unorganized.
Hyunwoo : Just using all the skills and... Pawn is waiting!

00:04:07.482 --> 00:04:09.433
Hyunwoo : The spot is offensive.

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:11.150
Kang Min : Grabbed a whopper.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.912
Hyunwoo : I think it's a kill.
Kang Min : Faker! Faker!
Faker : No kill scored.

00:04:14.912 --> 00:04:17.033
Hyunwoo : Oh~ Deft. There is Deft.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.472
Faker : Let's go.
Hyunwoo : Deft is dead.
Kang Min : Kayle, please.

00:04:19.472 --> 00:04:25.472
Hyunwoo : Oh! Wait. Kill...
Kang Min : Plan?!
Hyunwoo : Wait. I think it's a quadra for Faker's team.

00:04:30.357 --> 00:04:35.009
dade : Sigh. No mana.
Faker : You have mana!

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.155
Hyunwoo : There is re-game request. It's a quadra kill. 0:4

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.044
dade : Basically the game is over.

00:04:42.044 --> 00:04:45.915
Kang Min : What is this?
Hyunwoo : Re-game requests.

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:49.150
dade : Nidalee is really useless.
Hyunwoo : Useless Nidalee.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.851
Kang Min : Starting from 1vs1, everything is a 2min game.

00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:58.851
dade : Invade fight was one sided because Nidalee wasn't there.
Hyunwoo : Because they are professional players, can they overcome this?

00:04:59.568 --> 00:05:02.598
Kang Min : Do you think you overcome 0:4?

00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:05.173
Hyunwoo : Who got the most kills in the 4 kills

00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:06.859
Faker : Riven? Lee Sin?
Hyunwoo : Riven and Lee Sin got 2kills each.

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:12.294
Faker : Solo laners got 2kills.
Kang Min : Did you plan this?
Faker : Of course, did it.

00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:18.294
From Faker's plan, Faker's team start off with 4 kills after invasion fight.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:33.494
