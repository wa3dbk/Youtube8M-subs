00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.299
Hi, I'm Dominic, thanks for watching Dominic's
Woodworks. And, well, I've had this order

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.120
sit in my shop for a while now, and I thought
I should get around to it, but I just got

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.120
entrenched in work, and it was so exhausting.
Well, let's see. Oh, it's from Wilhuff himself.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.910
They need this piece asap... as usual... and
the designers just thought they could x-wing

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.180
it... He said he'd tear them a new exhaust
vent and they replied they already had one.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.860
He really should learn to get to the point.
We really need to work on our communication.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.980
Oh well, I think I should get around to it.
After all, I don't want to bail on Bail.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.600
For the shape of things to come I will be
using my table saw, for he who controles the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.600
saw controles the universe. Oh, the grain
is strong in this one. Over on the miter saw

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.180
I always have this ugre. I want to take my
wood and strike it down with all my hatred,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.889
and my jurney towards joinery will eventually
be complete. It is so easy to cut the right

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:16.889
angle, since the angles are always right from
a certain point of view. Oh my, it is trapped!

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.979
I will have to use the fork! The glue is what
gives a woodworker his power. It surrounds

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.020
the wood and penetrates it, it binds the galaxy
together. I don't like sawdust. It's coarse

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:38.209
and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere.
Not like sandpaper - it makes everything soft

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.079
and smooth. I told them - had they used wood
colors, the whole things would have been a

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:51.079
lot easier to make. But no, these days, you
need a corporate identity. Now to apply a

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.369
final coat of proton sealer. No power in the
verse can break this. Some of my finest work.

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:09.569
Well, off to shipping. And for the most important
part, the bill. Emperor's black bones... The

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.390
due-date was two weeks ago! I have a bad feeling
about this... Happy may the 4th! Today is

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.219
may 4th, and it's kind of an inofficial Star
Wars holiday - may the fourth be with you

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:45.629
and so on. So you might have noticed other
YouTubers uploading similarly themed videos

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.680
today; you can find the links in the description.
Have a good day, hope you enjoyed this little

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.219
video, it was more on the parody side rather
than an actual project, because I expect this

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:05.219
grate to come back witgh the recipient unavailiable.
