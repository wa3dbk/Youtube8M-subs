00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hot off the press -

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.720
the historic test match
between the All Blacks

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.840
and Manu Samoa in Apia
finished a few minutes ago

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.200
and we can reveal the score.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.680
The final score was 25 - 16
to the All Blacks.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240
To break down this
significant event,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.840
we cross live
to Oriini Tipene-Leach.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.760
Scotty, of course we knew
this would be a big game.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.680
We haven't seen a game played
as fierce as this for 80 minutes.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.960
All of the players playing
with passion.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.440
We knew there'd
be big hits with Manu Samoa.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.280
Surprisingly though,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.280
the All Blacks threw
their own bodies on the line.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.480
While both sides were guilty
of throwing a few penalties,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.280
Dan Carter scored many of them,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920
making up the bulk

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.640
of the All Blacks'
winning score 25 to 16.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.040
And today Oriini, two players
debuted for the All Blacks.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.480
They were Charlie Ngatai
and Brad Weber from Ngati Porou.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.040
No doubt Ngati Porou
are celebrating.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.760
However, Oriini this was always more
than just a rugby game,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.880
it was something
of a cultural exchange

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.280
between two Pacific nations?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.680
That's right.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.360
Let's not forget Israel Dagg,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.720
he was also on the field today
as well.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.800
Over the last few days,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.280
we saw All Blacks dressed in shirts
with Samoan designs.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.240
Clearly it was a mark of respect
to Samoan culture.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.640
The cultural 'exchange' was perhaps
best reflected

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.560
in the pre-match ritual
where the haka faced up to the siva.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.080
Oriini,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.720
the All Blacks may have beaten
Samoa's beloved home team,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.680
and only by a close margin,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.400
but I sense they'll
be fare welled as heroes?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.480
Yes, you would be right
to come to that conclusion

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.520
as we reflect on a big visit
like this by the All Blacks.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.760
For more than 90 years NZ,
has had a relationship with Samoa.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.800
They've been received
like superstars,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
with fans excited to see

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.400
their favourite NZ
All Black superstars over there.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.080
They've come out in force
for both the game and both teams.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.800
There is no doubt this match

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.680
will live on in the memories
of the Samoan people.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.920
Thank you for the update,
Oriini Tipene-Leach.
