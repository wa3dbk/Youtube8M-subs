00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
[Music]

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.600
Ah, hello!

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.020
As summer progresses, gaps inevitably
start to appear as plants are harvested.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.480
But leaving the
ground bare

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.109
not only attract weeds and leaves the
soil prone to erosion,

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.349
it's also a wasted opportunity to grow
another crop.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.429
Luckily at this time of year, warmth and light are still on our side

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.960
and there are plenty of vegetables that go from sowing to harvest in very little time at all.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.950
In this video, we'll look at 5 of these super-speedy
vegetables

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.080
that will give you a harvest in just a few short weeks.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.040
Radishes are one of the fastest vegetables, taking
just 3-4 weeks to reach harvest time.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.980
They're also exceptionally easy to grow.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.060
Seeds can be sown into prepared ground or pots of potting soil.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.020
Sow the plump seeds very thinly, spacing
them about an inch, or 2cm, apart.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.700
Sowing small batches every
3-4 weeks until the very end of summer

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.080
will give you a continuous crop of the
peppery roots.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.480
The seedlings will pop up within 3-5 days.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.440
If necessary, thin the seedlings so the
roots have enough room to expand.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.840
Keep the ground free of
weeds, and water in dry weather

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.400
Harvest the roots before they get too
large when they can turn woody in texture

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.620
and overpoweringly hot.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.100
Ever-versatile salads
present a symphony of leaf shapes, textures and tastes,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.830
ideal for livening up mealtimes

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.630
Grow individual varieties or create your own
salad blend

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.660
by mixing two or more varieties together before sowing.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.780
Suitable salads include lettuce, mustards and other Oriental leaves, kale, and rocket (or arugula).

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.980
For the quickest results, sow a mix of salads sold for repeat (or cut-and-come-again) harvesting.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:59.580
Sow the seeds very thinly into drills
spaced about 6-10 inches (15-25cm) apart.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.180
Cover the seats back over then gently
pat the surface of the soil down.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.320
Water along the rows, then keep the
soil moist and weed-free as the seedlings grow.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.340
If summers are very hot in your area, you
may need to wait a few weeks

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.630
or use shade cloth to reduce temperatures for
germination and good growth.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.020
Harvesting usually starts just 3
weeks after sowing.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.080
Take 2 or 3 outer leaves from each plant at any one time.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.440
This allows the remaining
leaves to grow on

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.240
and provide another cut in a few days'
time.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.720
Cut little and often for best results.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.660
The quickest pods in town, dwarf beans (or bush beans) can be sown immediately after a previous crop

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.500
to give a speedy picking before the end
of the current growing season.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.580
Taking just 2 months from sowing to
pod production

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.480
these trouble-free beans are a must - and
kids love them!

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.900
In summer the beans can be sown directly
into the ground

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.230
or into pots of potting soil.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.080
Poke the seeds into the soil,
spacing them 10-16 inches (25-40cm) apart.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.040
Sow a batch once a month until the end
of summer.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.580
The young seedlings look like this, and grow on to produce short, bushy plants

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.740
which soon come into flower.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.500
Pick the pods every few days as they appear,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.080
so that you enjoy them
while they're still small and tender.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.840
Regular picking encourages plants to
continue forming pods.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.080
Savour the beans raw in salads, or lightly steamed with a curl of butter and a grind of the peppermill.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.580
Carrots are not the most obvious speedy vegetable,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.420
but choose a quick-growing, finger-sized variety

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.100
and you can expect sweet crunchy roots
in just 6 weeks.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.560
Sow into pots of potting soil, spreading the seed thinly over the surface,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.040
then cover with a thin layer of sieved potting soil.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.600
Or sow the seed into drills spaced about 6 inches (15cm) apart.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.300
Cover back over, and water.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.960
In some parts of the world 
the larvae of the carrot fly can prove a nuisance,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.520
burrowing into the roots and spoiling the crop.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.140
A row cover will stop the flies from
laying their eggs.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.400
Once the seedings have appeared, thin them on a
rainy day

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.640
when there will be fewer carrot flies about,
or failing that, on a still, cloudy day,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.600
watering afterwards
to settle the soil back around the roots.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.860
Thin to around an inch (2cm) apart.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.540
Pull up the tender carrots while they're
still young.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.520
If necessary, use a border fork to first
loosen the soil.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.380
The smooth, succulent leaves of spinach are extraordinarily versatile.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.220
Use them in salads, as a key ingredient to quiches and flans,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.100
or stirred into risottos or pasta dishes.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.640
Start it off once a month to enjoy right
up until the first frosts.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.400
Sow into rows about a foot (30cm) apart.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.160
Space the seeds an inch (2cm) apart within the rows

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.780
then thin the seedlings to leave 8 inches
(20cm) between them.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.560
Plants can quickly bolt in hot weather,
which causes the leaves to turn bitter.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.880
Prevent this by sowing in
light shade during the heat of summer,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.640
and by always keeping the ground moist.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.000
Cut the leaves away using a sharp knife or scissors.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.420
Don't let the leaves get too big, and remember
to harvest little and often.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.440
Later sowings can be covered with a
row cover or tunnel

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.380
to help growth along as the weather
turns cooler.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.920
Sow your super-speedy crops into well prepared soil.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.820
This simply means insuring your soil has
enough nutrients to support healthy growth

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.960
and has the right texture to encourage
even germination.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.000
In most cases all that's needed to
prepare the ground

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.100
is to sprinkle on a top-up of organic
fertilizer

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.640
before raking the soil to a fine tilth.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.120
All of these super-speedy vegetables can be grown in pots of good quality multi-purpose potting soil.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.060
While our quintet of super-speedy vegetables
will have little time to attract pests,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.420
do take a few precautions.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.940
Carrot fly has
already had a special mention.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.800
Use the same row covers protecting your carrots

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.720
to guard against flea beetles on radishes and some salad leaves.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.500
Slugs can decimate seedlings, so set up
beer traps

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.340
or shady retreats such as an upturned grapefruit shell,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.000
then collect up and discard any you find.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.940
Don't forget to report any pests you find on our Big Bug Hunt website.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.520
We'll use your reports to help us develop
warning systems against common pests.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.200
Even up until surprisingly late in the
summer

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.380
it's perfectly possible to grow some of these
super-speedy vegetables.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.820
Try some of these quick croppers for yourself,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.560
and get ready for a bonus harvest in just a few short weeks.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.560
We'd love to hear what super-speedy
vegetables you recommend for your area.
