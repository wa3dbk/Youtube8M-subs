Hi my name is Lauren and on behalf of Expert
Village I'm here to discuss short strait hair

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.780
styles. The next day after you have your blowout
and your hair may be falling a little bit

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.269
flatter you may decide to put your hair up.
Now Heather has pretty short hair with a lot

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.329
of layers in it. So what you can do is do
different options in order to get that hair

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:28.059
up. If you do diagonal partings such as so,
you can kind of piece the hair back and work

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:34.180
it. So now if I am going to twist that piece
of hair in that triangular section I'm going

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:45.130
to take a bobby pin, put the bobby pin, insert
it into the twist in order for it to stay.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:53.030
Then you can grab another section, and this
is kind of more or less your funkier updo

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.280
look. This is what you're gonna do when you
have a little bit more of a flirty, fun personality

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.180
which Heather definitely has. So you can manipulate
the hair and twist it. Use a little bit of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:21.060
pomade if you feel as if you need a little
extra smoothness, and you can lift up your

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:32.380
sides. Again piece it in. With shorter hair
you tend to get those smaller pieces that

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.990
come up and that wind up popping up. I would
say just kind of go with it especially if

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.690
your personality can carry it. You can literally
spray them and kind of have them fan out as

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.659
you go. You can make them as small or as tall
as you like. You can piece them out in order

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.060
to kind of have it show and just kind of play
with it. And the most important thing whenever

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.350
doing anything kind of on the funkier side
to your hair is really just allowing your

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.279
imagination to go and your creativity to pick
up. Grab random sections and piece it. You're

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:19.489
always gonna want to go in towards the scalp
and then down. The important thing is to literally

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.191
have those bobby pins hide by the hair. You
don't want them to see, you don't want to

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:28.999
see them. They also come in bobby pins that
actually come in a bronze, light brown, and

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:35.579
that you can get in order to match your hair.
If you wanna leave some pieces down in order

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.349
to kind of create with the style and kind
of go with the style you can do that. And

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:48.180
you just kind of wanna take your pieces, have
fun with the hair. All you're gonna do is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.040
row it over and grab some of those pieces
to kind of stand out. Take your pin, place

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:04.719
it in the hair. If you need another one in
order for it to go then you just place the

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:16.849
other one in. It's important when you do up
styles like this, that you don't want those

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.260
pins to show. It's also important to suit
your personality with it. If you're going

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.790
to a business meeting in a business suit you're
not, this will not be your choice. You want

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.360
it to play with your personality and with
where you're going. You don't want to go out

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.659
of the norm if you're going into a business
meeting. Heather would not put this in her

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.680
hair if she was going to sit down with a bunch
of executives. But would maybe for a night

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.030
out in the town with friends.
