00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.331
The easiest way to install the bed hook adapter
is to put the bed hook adapter into the head

00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:16.289
board first and hook it in.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:26.030
Then attach the bed frame.Attach it at two
points on both sides.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:33.960
We turned a bolt on bed frame into a hook
on bed frame.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.870
Pretty Simple!

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.449
So here we're going to use a queen size bed
frame with a full size head board.

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.460
The headboard hooks on, and the bed frame
bolts on.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.040
So, we're using a bed hook adapter, this is
it right here.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.880
So we're going to go ahead and hook the bed
hook adapter in and then we're going to use

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.470
a mod plate, and we'll use these two little
gadgets to make this work out.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.570
So we have the bed hook adapter, it's already
in there and then we're going to attach the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:23.590
mod plate right here.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:34.030
It comes with all the hardware that you need
to attach these two little guys.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:48.680
That what the mod plate looks like attached
to the bed hook adapter.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.170
She's putting that through the frame and the
mod plate.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:14.560
Yep, so they're all attaching.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:29.100
And once everything is attached, there you
go!
