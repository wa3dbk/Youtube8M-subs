00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.850
This is allium tricoccum, also known as ramps in the South. Up here in

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.739
New York, they're leeks and that's an ethnobotanical, cultural

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.249
background kind of thing. It has a rhizome

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.569
with

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:25.619
lacy roots.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.700
It actually does not have a bulb, but we
call it a bulb because it does have

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.320
a protrusion

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.700
down here which slides into the
petiol...

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.860
a characteristic...has a pink petiol

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.870
that then goes into

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.370
on average

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.400
two leaves

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.740
but in this case three leaves

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.470
and I have seen

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.570
one plant that had four leaves.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.030
Most people

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.660
harvest the whole plant

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.830
...so they dig it up. They cut it up

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.160
and then they harvest that...

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.420
and then they take the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.070
protective sheath off of it.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.430
And then they eat it. The best way to eat a ramp

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.170
is in the woods

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.870
like we are this morning

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.100
listening for turkeys.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.830
They say it's a cross between a garlic
and scallion.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.050
Right. so it's really garlicy.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.370
As Ken Mudge was saying, "It's really
peppery too."

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.800
So it's a mix between

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.110
your garden onion, your scallion and

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.900
garlic.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.439
Really has a strong after-taste that
comes in...

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.840
kicks in like a minute or so after you've

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.630
indulged. You could go from virtually

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.030
wild to segmented to more managing it...

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.880
moving the plants around a little bit and
encouraging the plants

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.380
to then really intensive

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.600
forest farming

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.790
where you're setting up beds

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.839
planting bulbs, or planting seed preferably.

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.409
So you could take something like this

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.139
and I could envision an area like this
where we actually have

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.509
beds - raised beds

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:23.519
strategically put into this landscape
where we're harvesting - we're planting

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.929
ramps.

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.849
And it could be integrated into a
patch like this.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.859
I don't have a lot of land access to land...but
l got a little patch of ramps

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.900
like this - I can make it work for me.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.919
I'm managing a wild patch.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:42.869
I'm enhancing the wild patch through
farming techniques

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.019
but I'm doing it under forest,

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:45.890
i.e.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.490
forest farming.
