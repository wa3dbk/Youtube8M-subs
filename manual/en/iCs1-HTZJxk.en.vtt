00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.920
When we're talking about teamwork,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.040
we have to remember
that it is just that.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.760
To be effective,
a team must work at it

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.000
and that involves the leader
motivating people

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.920
to really engage in effective
communication, provide feedback,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.640
to question...positively question
the actions that are taken.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.600
What it must also do is ensure
that everyone understands

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.360
what's involved in a task,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.200
what their role is,
what their responsibilities are

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.280
and actively engage.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.560
The best teams in the world
are full of individuals

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.720
who are working on their strengths.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.280
And so in a crew situation,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.160
what you could have is a discussion

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.960
of "What are your strengths
as a crew person?"

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.400
and get people
to identify those things.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.240
"Well, I'm, yeah, I'm good at all of
this, but I really love doing this.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.680
I get a real jazz from doing this."

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.240
"That's good. Who wants to do that?"
"Oh, that's me," you know.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.040
"I'm not so great at that."

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.760
"Whoa, but that's my strength."

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.560
You know, so that's what you...

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.720
That's the kind of conversation
you can have

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.320
to make a team really fly.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.920
The best teams have players
or individuals

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.000
working on their strengths

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.040
and that needs to be identified.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040
The only way you can identify that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.760
is to ask people, "What are you
the go-to person for?"

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.080
Some people don't like
talking about that

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.360
because it's like a tall poppy thing,
you know.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.800
You're up yourself or you don't get
too carried away with yourself.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.600
But we need to do that.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.960
Because otherwise you don't find
that out. You can assume.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.520
But you're the only one that knows
what your strengths are.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.880
On a day-to-day basis, we had
sometimes dozens of fires to put out

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.840
and problems to solve

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.280
and they had to be solved
very, very quickly indeed.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.520
So it was made very, very clear from
the management right from the start

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.400
that there would be no blame games
assigned to any of the departments.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.160
Basically, we were often encouraged

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.240
to admit to any of the technical
problems we were experiencing

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.520
and rather than all the impetus
being put on one person

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.000
to solve that problem,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.520
it became the team's problem
to collectively work together

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.240
and solve that particular issue.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.600
So quite often we'd be in a situation
where we'll all be in the room

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.240
troubleshooting one particular issue

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.560
and we knew that we weren't going
to leave that room

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.920
until one, two or three different
solutions had been suggested

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.960
and then later implemented.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.120
So that worked on a number
of different levels.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.760
Not only did it provide us
with some really useful insights

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.600
from other departments
who could feed in to the process,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.320
but also it helped develop
an incredible sense of teamwork.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.960
We were all in it together

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.520
and it wasn't just a question

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.840
of, you know,
some of the departments relaxing

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.240
because one department was having
a particular problem.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.440
It really helped to engage the team
and unite the team together

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.840
by knowing that solving these
problems was a team process

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.880
and just an individual.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.800
High achievers will lift all boats.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.080
When they go back out and
they can take this into the field

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.720
and demonstrate that it works

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.800
and continue to grow
in their own professionalism

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.880
and influence and mentor others,
that's how culture changes.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.120
You win the war on air
one heart and mind at a time.
