Hello, this is I'm J.B. I'm with Austin Home
Brew Supply in Austin Texas and today I'm

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.120
going to discuss a little bit about equipment
regarding making your own beer and your own

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.220
wine at home. Now one of the things that you'll
want to do when making your own beer and your

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.660
own wine. Is take something called a hydrometer
reading. Hydrometer measures the density of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.581
a liquid. OK, so it allows us to know what's
going on with the fermentation. It's one of

00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:36.829
the only ways that we have as experts here
to be able to help you troubleshoot. What's

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.250
going on with your fermentation. So that being
said it's obvious that taking accurate hydrometer

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.699
readings is really important. So one of the
tools thats come along in the last few years

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.059
is made by a company called Firm Tech and
they make a couple of really, really nice

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.460
products. Now this one I think is really slick
it's called The Thief. OK, this is the Firm

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.240
Tech, Thief. What this guy is. Is a simple
plastic tube with a valve built in onto the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.070
end of it. So now this valve the way it works
is at this point it's closed and at this point

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.930
it's open. So what how does this thing work?
What you do with this is say you have a vessel

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.510
like this full of liquid that you wanted to
take a density reading on. Using your hydrometers.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.710
So the hydrometer measures the density of
liquid. Now The Thief which costs eight dollars

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.560
by the way. If you wanted to get a hydrometer
reading out of this glass container. Will

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.860
if I drop this hydrometer into it. I mean
retrieving it's going to be just this side

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.630
of impossible. So this is how you take a hydrometer
reading. You would make sure that every things

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.120
sanitized and don't have you hands all over
it like I do here but you would simply. Put

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.680
the hydrometer into The Thief let it slowly
come to the bottom. Then what I'll do is immerse

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.370
it into into the liquid. I just have a colored
liquid here. So that we can see what's going

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.110
on and just shake it a little bit and that
will get this guy to fill up and if you see

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.750
when I pull it out of here. If I got enough
liquid in here to where the actual hydrometers

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.450
floating. Then you can read your density right
off the line where the meniscus is here at

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.500
the hydrometer. So this item here is called
The Thief it allows you to get a hydrometer

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.860
sample out of a glass carboy. Once you done
if you touch it against the inside like I'm

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.640
doing here. It'll drain back down into the
carboy. Allowing you not to have to waist

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.160
anything during your, during your testing
procedure. So this guy here is called The

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.939
Firm Tech Thief. Highly recommended great
little product.
