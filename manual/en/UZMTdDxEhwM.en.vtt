00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.159
Hello everyone.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.229
Here we are with Falling Fred.

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.469
This is

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.409
the latest in a long line of 
Fred titles.

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.359
Which generally involve him,

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.460
well, having a really bad day.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.480
Let's start this and calibrate

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.570
the gyro again.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.449
Basically avoid

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.730
obstacles.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.839
If you bang into something

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.180
you end up taking damage,
hit something too hard

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.660
and you die, it's as simple as that.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.180
You need to collect power-ups as you are 
going along and fall as far as you can.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.550
Really, really fun addictive game. It
takes the kind of endless 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.510
runner concept in a new direction
because the level doesn't end until

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.540
you die, so you're really competing against
your own reflexes and how gnarly

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.520
the computer is going to be

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.520
at throwing random things at you, how fast 
can you move out of the way and judge.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.800
Fred just bounces basically.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.700
He has no kind of other movement
other than falling and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.650
a little bit of left right

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.910
down control as it were.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.360
The graphics are absolutely fantastic,
really, really nice, 3D

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.380
and quite colourful.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.560
Probably more of mature title

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.440
not going to want to hand this
to an eight-year-old kid with

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.290
blood splatters.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.290
A really, really clever game.
