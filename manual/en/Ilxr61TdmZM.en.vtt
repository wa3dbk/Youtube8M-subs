00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.000
Hi mates, today we are at the airfield, 
we have a windy day

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.880
and it is perfect to practice what we will do today: Reverse inflation with the paratrike.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.320
It is important to know that we can do this 
with paratrikes of low hangpoint

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.160
With paratrikes that have upper bars it is very difficult, not impossible, but it is frankly difficult.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.800
It is a technique for people who can already take off well facewind, and who can reverse-launch with paramotor.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.700
What I did is to prepare the glider 
and leave it in a rosette 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.420
otherwise with this wind there is no way, 
it wants to inflate all the time.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.480
Now I'm going to take the paratrike 
and I'm going to hook up. 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.720
Then I will go out to fly just as it is, from there.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.920
We are ready

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.260
 ready to fly

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.560
with the Thor 250

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.320
Tip: Experience the limits of your paratrike on the ground. Lift a wheel!

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.460
Visualize the side you are going to turn to.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.600
Avoid tangling the lines with the direction foot bars

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.320
During the inflation, use both feet on the ground to brake as you control the wing

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.380
Pull the risers gently and symmetrically

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.100
Once the glider has inner pressure and it is centered, make a 180Â° turn propelling yourself with the motor.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.820
Take your time to keep the glider under control 
before moving on to fly.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.100
Use the brakes and the thrust to keep the wing's pressure  

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.640
Learn to ride backwards to put down the wing. 
It might save you a scare!

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.740
Practice putting down the wing with control and security. 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.480
You have to practice a little. 
And it is mostly a maneuver for showing off, for fun.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.840
But hey, what is flying for if not for fun?
