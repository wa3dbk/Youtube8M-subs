00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.560
In today's video that will see how to grow
Swiss Chard in containers

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.590
Swiss Chard is grown for its leaves

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.310
It's green leaves

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.110
Now its stems might have different colors

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.240
But it's more like a substitute for growing
spinach

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.500
Simply because it's just so easy to grow

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.750
And it produces a lot of greens

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.540
And the best part about Swiss Chard is that
it grows year-round

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.449
So for Swiss chard you need a container which
is about 16 inches wide

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.860
by 6 inches tall

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.480
And I'm growing about 3 swiss chard plants
in it

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.090
For a single plant you might get away a 12-inch
container that's about 12 inches high

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.539
The Swiss chard leaves and stalks can be in
multiple colors

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.690
They can be green or red, white stalks, red
stalks

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.780
And one of the most common varieties that
people grow is called bright lights

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.050
Which is basically some mixture of yellow
green and red Swiss chard

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.920
And for the most part that's a good variety
to grow

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.670
But there is one variety that I highly recommend
growing

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.940
And that is called Ruby Red Swiss Chard

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.720
And the reason I recommend growing Ruby Red
is that

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.250
It's just so easy to grow them

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.130
They are very disease-resistant they produce
a lot and are easy to maintain and taste very

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.660
nice

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.330
One thing I do want to talk about swiss
chard as we are harvesting these leaves

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.250
Is that act swiss chard is mostly harvested
for its greens

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.170
So the kind of fertilizer that you need to
use for Swiss Chard

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.250
Needs to be wither a balanced fertilizer

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.170
Or a fertilizer that's high in nitrogen

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.250
That's gonna give you nice big leaves

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.530
And if you wanna go the organic way just make
sure

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.890
you use a lot of compost and a lot of manure

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.890
to give you that nice the big leaves that
Swiss chard is known for

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.750
And this Ruby Red variety is very prolific

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.700
Grows really well, very easily in containers

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.440
And will give you harvest all season long

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.710
Now those of you who have grown spinach
would know that Spinach is a little hard to

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.680
grow

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.350
The leaves are very small

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.250
So you need to grow a lot

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.860
And spinach is a cool season crop only

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.610
So it's really hard for you to grow spinach
in summers

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.950
Because they go to bolt

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.200
They producer flowers very soon

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.250
And then you're done

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.210
Swiss chard on the other hand can be grown
year around

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.610
And they will keep growing and growing till
its the end of the season

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.350
And you just get rid of it

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.260
Because a Swiss chard plant can produce
a lot of greens throughout its life cycle

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.260

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.130
So I hope you enjoyed this video

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.040
Happy Gardening!
