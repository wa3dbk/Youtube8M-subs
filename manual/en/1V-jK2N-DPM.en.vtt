Hi Everyone, today I have another winter snowflake design for you using the  XL image plate K

00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:13.471
So many people liked this plate, I wanted to give you guys some more chances to win them in this week's December giveaways

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:18.267
Another popular holiday item from my website are the Christmas Stickers

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:25.236
So, I'm going to use them in a holiday themed nail design as an alternative to using the stamping plates

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:30.597
They are both super easy to recreate and obviously they will be in the giveaway as well

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:34.541
Before I start I wanted to give a shoutout to Jen from meejmuse

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:39.396
She is a fellow aussie youtuber with an awesome beauty channel which I like watching

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:44.635
Checkout her  KPOP Makeup and Hair tutorial for some holiday beauty inspirations

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:48.503
As Always apply a good base coat to prevent your nails from staining

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.959
Then apply a coat of black nail polish as your base color

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:13.015
For a festive holiday look, you can't go wrong with some glitter polish. Apply to all of your nails and let it completely dry before continuing

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.753
Using XL image plate K available from my website,  pick your favourite snowflake image and apply stamping polish over the design

00:01:27.357 --> 00:01:32.655
Scrape of excess polish with the scraper, then transfer the image using the stamper

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:37.835
Check that the image is complete, then aim and roll it onto the nail

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:45.140
you can stamp the print randomly onto each nail to mix it up

00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:51.140
In between stamps, you can clean the image plate, stamper and scraper with nail polish remover

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.890
make sure all surfaces are dry then repeat steps for the remaining nails

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.719
I really like this blue glitter polish from sinful colors, it has at least 4 different sized glitters including strips and hexagon shapes

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.620
When applied on top of a black base color, it reminds me of a blizzard in the middle of the night

00:02:13.623 --> 00:02:18.910
That's why I chose this really fuzzy and delicate looking snowflake to stamp on top

00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:29.080
To decorate, just add some random sized white dots using a dotting tool to resemble the falling snow

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:39.517
To really make the design pop, I added a rhinestone in the center of the snowflake. I think yellow or red rhinestones contrasts very well with the blue and white background

00:02:39.517 --> 00:02:46.196
Alternatively, if you don't have a stamp set, you can use some snowflake stickers instead

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:52.030
place them on the nail as you would the stamps

00:02:52.027 --> 00:02:59.480
This set of holiday stickers comes with silver, gold and white toned designs that goes perfectly with this set of blue nails

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:05.180
you can do snowflakes for all your nails or mix and match the designs like I have here

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:20.620
Again, add in some random dots in the empty areas then finish with top coat to protect your designs

00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:32.870
For week 3 of December Giveaways,  winners can choose Either an XL plate of your choice, Or a set of Nail art brushes with a dotting tool and 3 nail stickers of your choice from ww.meliney.com
