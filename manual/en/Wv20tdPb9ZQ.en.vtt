00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.500
Hey youtubers it’s Charlie and this weekend
is the Walking Dead finale.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.900
I’ve already done a lot X,Y, Z predictions
in my previous videos, so this time I thought

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.740
it would be fun to ask a question.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.339
How do you top last year’s finale in Woodbury
and the mid season finale?

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.890
How do you raise the level of intensity without
just adding X number more people X number

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.910
more tanks?

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.039
The answer is really simple, you make things
much more intimate and you change your core

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.100
characters in ways that fundamentally alter
the way they’re perceived by you and me

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550
and by the other characters on the show.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.550
What does that mean?

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.950
Well first we have to examine what went down
during the previous finales and then compare

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.210
it to where everyone is emotionally right
now using data as a guide.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.210
So let’s look at the facts from the Season
3 finale.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.710
Number 1 - There was The Governor.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.180
The black hat wearing villain.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.860
He was actually brought out after complaints
that the show lacked a central villain for

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.700
the audience to rally around.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.050
It worked, the show became even more popular.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.700
The midseason finale should really be considered
the end of his arc on the show.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.100
So what is going to take the place of the
Darth Vader of Georgia and what’s going

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.880
to take the place of the Andrea Milton element.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.930
You have to have a broad threat to the group
and a very intimate threat to someone you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.930
love.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.659
Number 2 - The comics.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.659
The source of all Walkers.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.290
You can’t have a story about The Walking
Dead tv show without addressing the comic.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.750
The writers are literally adapting the comic
to make the episodes.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.299
That being said a lot of stuff gets changed
for various reasons.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.939
Which is where we find ourselves now.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.240
We’ve got some new people in a new place,
led by a very ominous feeling Gareth character.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.380
Suddenly it almost sounds like the exact same
sequence of events is going to unfold.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.619
Here’s what we can confirm.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.850
Gareth is what Robert Kirkman is calling “an
interesting twist” on a notable comic book

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.850
character.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.350
If Abraham, Eugene and Rosita are any indicator.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.330
The person Gareth resembles will very close
to someone in the comics the actor resembles.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.039
Which could be any of at least four characters.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.850
Robert Kirkman made it sound like he’s only
a spin on one character.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.380
So even if they do combine a few things, I
think we can localize our guesses to people

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.740
that show up around where the story is right
now.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.870
Which leads to the Hunters.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.020
Terminus also isn’t something directly from
the comic books, but it’s seemingly the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.700
last stop before Alexandria, which also supports
the Hunters theory.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.090
Number 3 - The Terminus Hunters

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.470
So if you have this very similar situation
to the season 3 finale unfolding, how do you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.950
do it differently in a way that doesn’t
just add more guns, more tanks and more walkers.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.900
And doesn’t just swap Darth Vader for another
Sith Lord.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.210
I think it’s really important to remember
how the Andrea Milton situation unfolded.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.830
We never got to see him turn then chow down
on her.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.069
They chose not to show us that and instead
focused more on the governor with his death

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.959
star machine gun, just mowing people down.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.070
So what I think will happen is, they’ll
just shift focus and the largest portion of

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.340
the story will be in that locked room.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.370
And when I say that, I’m just using that
term as a metaphor for something horrific.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.170
Something so unthinkable you can’t eat for
a few days.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.670
A mass murderer is realtively abstract, but
Andrea’s situation was very personal and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.670
very intimate.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.909
So it was much harder to shake off.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.900
Number 4 - The Breaking Point

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.450
Rick will be the one to break in this episode.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.790
That’s what the description “Rick Comes
Face To Face with Shocking Brutality that

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.780
threatens everyone's lives.”

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.310
Essentially it means he’s going to have
to take a page from the Governor’s book

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.580
and eliminate the threat.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.790
He’s been farmer Rick for most of the season.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.989
But remember what Carol said before they split.

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.790
“You can be a farmer, you can’t JUST be
a farmer.”

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.660
One of the reasons Carl lashed out at him
in episode 9 was because he’d become so

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.750
ineffectual as a result of his new chosen
profession.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.150
There’s this really old chess analogy, the
best move is to not move.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.970
Meaning the best action for everyone to take,
is to not take action.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.250
But I feel like the characters get to do that.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.150
At least not without paying a price.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.300
What does that mean, Rick is going to brutally
kill a lot of people in really up close and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.560
personal ways.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.560
If you want to see what this looks like in
the comics, read issue 57.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.000
It deals with the Marauders.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.199
Which I think are represented by Joe’s group.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.770
I also think that Rick’s brutality will
overlap with the crazy people at Terminus.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.050
Number 5 - Terminus Is Not A Good Place

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.600
Even scumbag Joe agrees Terminus is bad news.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.550
That tells you everything you need to know.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.700
Then there’s the similarities between Michonne’s
painting and Mary and the fact that Mary is

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.750
wearing a very similar poncho to Beth’s
when she was kidnapped.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.210
Red Warning lights are flashing everywhere.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.120
All those yellow flowers are secretly walker
venus fly traps.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.910
This is where larger threats to the group
come into play.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.081
All evidence suggests that even if the people
at Terminus aren’t carbon copies of The

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:12.340
Hunters, they are practicing cannibals.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.610
Meaning not only will survivors die, they’ll
get eaten.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.150
Either completely or just partially.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.660
This all bends a lot of stuff from the comics,
but again Terminus and Gareth are both totally

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.169
new things inspired by the comics.

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.830
The real conversation now is who is going
to get eaten or get part of themselves eaten.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.350
Number 6 - Final death predictions.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.350
Maggie is still my best guess based on rumors
and things from the comics that have just

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.350
been flipped.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.100
Remember, how do you top that scene with Andrea?

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.860
You show it play out in excrutiating detail,
with someone even more precious.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.600
Which could be any number of the characters
this late in the series.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.199
But Beth, Carol, Glenn, they’re all marked.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.569
I think we all expect Rick to limp away from
this again, but he could totally be one of

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.920
those partially eaten people.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.449
So now let me know how you would top the season
3 finale and the prison massacre.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.770
What do you think this finale needs to be
even bigger without just repeating the same

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.770
things.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.259
Really, I just want to see Daryl save Beth
and chop some people up.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.420
It could totally happen if he steals another
poncho.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.660
Those poncho’s double his crit rating with
that crossbow.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.580
Boom headshot, boom headshot.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.539
This sunday I’ll be posting my finale review
right after the episode airs.

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.550
Be sure to subscribe to get it.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.590
I’ll also be doing a double giveaway.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.270
Two people will win amazon giftcards instead
of one.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.539
I’ll also do a season 5 predictions video
after my Q&amp;A next week too.
