00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.160
Since old times, a handmade things considered valuable

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.680
But who could have imagined that a 16- years old graduate student can do such a model?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.840
Alex, how long have you been doing this?

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.440
I started to do this almost two years ago.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.540
I became interested in papercraft, basically in Star Wars papercraft

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:28.000
I have found swmodel.ru. There have been many templates and I started to practice.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.220
It wasn't so good for the first time, but then I've started to improve my skills, many were impressed by my work

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.240
Is there're any special term for tecnique you are using to make your models?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:58.220
Not sure. I think, what I'm doing now is can be considered as sculpting, but everything starts with paper base.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640
Why Star Wars?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:09.820
This universe is very attracting for me. I'm a fan of SW almost 5 years.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.560
How long it takes you to make such model?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.960
I started paper base for this one in the last December. I worked a few month on this.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.720
On next the months I researched about how to process it, how to make stronger and how to paint etc.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.840
From the last month I started to process it. The armor is not finished yet, but close.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
- So you doing this almost half of the year?
- Yeah, something like this.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.180
Before you get such a model, it must go through several stages of creation.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:59.520
In the begining, my works look like this. From paper details I'm making a solid base of helmets. And a deer.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.520
Is there any models you like the most?

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.000
This helmet (ARF trooper).

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.040
I spent a lot of time on it. And I think it was a good choice.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:21.800
- And your grandpa likes this deer?
- Haha, yes! He recommends me to make more figures of animals and humans.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.720
But for now I'm making armor and helmets.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.420
But in the future I might create some characters and animals (which is true, lol, check my Deviantart for Pepakura Projects)

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.480
Did you make any such gifts for  your friends ? Did they asked you to make somethinng?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:48.200
Yes, I have one "order" already, but for now I'm just working with 3D model. After this I'l' make it from paper.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.560
Do you want to improve your skills in the future?

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:08.120
This is hobby for me, so I'm not sure I can quit. It's like drug for me. I need to create and make something. It's importnant to me.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.840
What you are started from? When you become so passioned about craft?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.660
My first work was a helmet model (actually it was Star Destroyer a while ago).

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:29.980
Whell, first work is the first work. It wasn't really good. But then I've improved my skills. And here's the result.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.520
Who gave you the idea of such hobby?

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.600
The idea came itself (thank you, Internet!).

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.720
I mean, I wanted to make a model of Star Destroyer. I've searched on Internet and found swmodel.ru.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.520
And I've found so many templates there and it kept my interest.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.120
Have you tried to wear the armor?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.000
Of course. I wanted to make sure about appropriate proportions, so I'd feel comfortable in it.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.320
So, you actually can wear it and walk on the street?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.780
Yes, yes! It's real!

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:14.840
How do you decide, what kind of character you're going to do? Do you imagine it in your head?

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:25.640
No, there's a special technology on desktop. You can unfold 3d model on 2d plane.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.160
And I use it as guide for building.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.400
Do you share your works on network?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:44.520
Yes, for example on swmodel.ru there's a lot of contests: helmets, weapons, ships...

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.200
So, I just won one of these contests and got one free model for building.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.480
Making of such stuff takes a lot of time and strength.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.520
It also needs to have a place where you can work on it. So, Alex has his own a little workshop.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:07.040
For my job I need such tools as Dremel. It's a multifunctional tool

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:16.620
which contains a lot of different attachments: drill bits, saw blades, emery wheel.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:28.160
Then I need bodyfiller, resin and fiberglass for strengthening a model.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:39.400
First, I put a few layers of fiberglass and resin. When it's dry, I put bodyfiller. And when it's done too

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.740
I grind that it's smooth and even enough without any holes and damages.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:51.760
Then I coat ith with primer and paint with Car paint.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.400
It's good, when you have your own hobbies to which you spend all your free time and enjoy life.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.560
In order to make such model, you need to spend a lot of time and strength.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.840
For example, in order to make such helmet and armor it took a whole year.
