00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.350
This obnoxiously titled follow-up was released
in June of 2003 by director John Singleton.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.070
Despite feeling like a shameless cash-grab,
the PG-13 rated film managed to triple its

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.160
$76-million dollar budget.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.650
Paul Walker leads an entirely new cast, where
the FBI reunites him with an old friend so

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.960
they can take down Miami's criminal kingpin.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.020
Still acting and dressing like a spoiled teen,
Walker is aimless and aloof without Vin Diesel

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.739
at his side: who sadly sits this picture out.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.700
Tyrese Gibson however is a welcome addition
as Paul's fast-talking, wise-cracking childhood

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.460
buddy who injects the film with effective
comic relief.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.679
Cole Hauser is not nearly menacing enough
for the bad guy role, but rapper-turned-actor

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.180
Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges is actually really
great in his small supporting role, I only

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.890
wish he was utilized a bit more.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.850
Rounding out the core group is the stunning
Eva Mendes as an undercover Customs agent

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.750
who may be getting too close to her mark - in
a parallel to Walker's original dilemma.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.280
It's the playful and contentious relationship
between the leads that makes the 107-minute

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.400
feature worth watching, like when Gibson nervously
asks his partner "You're not gonna do what

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.690
I think you're gonna do?"

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.110
moments before Walker performs a dangerous
stunt.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.170
Light on substance, but heavy on style - this
picture lives up to its namesake with fantastic

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.310
race sequences, even if the drivers do seem
to execute a seemingly infinite number of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.310
gear changes.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.140
A sharply edited four-car race through the
well-lit roadways of Florida includes an awesome

00:01:20.140 --> 00:02:03.479
computer-assisted shot that zooms past each
vehicle in a single unbroken move.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
Far too much of the dialogue boils down to
disposable trash talking, with each sentence

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.630
annoyingly punctuated by "bro" or "bruh".

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.120
"2 Fast 2 Furious" at least provides fun introductions
to eventual mainstays of the franchise; besides

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.910
Bridges and Gibson - this is also the first
time we see Walker's Nissan Skyline tearing

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.010
up the roadways.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.180
As the only "Fast" film not to feature a single
major character death though, the resulting

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.480
tone has a far less serious vibe.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.030
Which is why a torture scene involving a flesh-eating
rat feels particularly gruesome and out of

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.030
place.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.010
Pulling a "Will Smith"-move, Ludacris performs
four separate tracks on the film's rap-oriented

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.200
soundtrack, which is an appropriate fit for
the scantily clad women, neon lights, and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.940
bright sunshine of south beach.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.560
The stark departure from the themes that bind
the rest of the series together makes this

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.319
film the weakest of the bunch.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.910
But racing fans should enjoy the smoothly
paced on action repeat viewings.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.860
Often unrealistic, and generally pretty stupid,
"2 Fast 2 Furious" boils down to a brainless

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.209
romp with occasional thrills and spills - I
thought it was ALRIGHT.
