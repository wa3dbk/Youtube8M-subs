00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.090
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.970
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls' Hair Styles.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.481
And I'm here today with Bailey.

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:08.980
-Hi.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.840
-And I wanted to just to let you
guys know how great and amazing

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.830
you made my birthday.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.430
I loved all the extra special
comments and the videos

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.270
you sent me.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.740
So thank you, thank
you, thank you.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.120
Big hugs through the camera.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.100
Big kisses.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.180
Let's do some hair.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.555
We're going to
show you today how

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.800
to do a lace braid into
a twisted ponytail.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
You start by parting
the hair in the middle.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.883
And then I'm just going
to pick up a section here.

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:31.520
And we're going to be doing
a regular French braid

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.400
and making an interlaced braid.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.670
So don't do the Dutch version
where the hair pops out.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.880
So we're going to just start
by beginning our French braid.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.620
And you know that
in a lace braid,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.740
you only pick up hair
from one section.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.280
And I'm going to add hair
into the section on the right.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.689
So right by her ears.

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.480
So I'm going to add
hair there, but I'm not

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.549
adding hair into
that top strand.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.340
And we're just going
to continue to do this

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.360
all the way down her head.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.170
Now, one of the great
things about this hairstyle

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.440
is that it's great if it's
on dry hair or wet hair.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.720
Or you can see that Bailey
has layers and bangs,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.890
and it will work just
fine on her hair, even.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.400
So it's a really good
complementary hairdo

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.969
to many types of hair.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.510
You could even do
this on curly hair,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.720
and it would look
fantastic, too.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.710
So you can see we're
creating the lace braid.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.190
We're going to just continue
to wrap it around her head.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.960
And when we get to
about right here,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.620
I'm going to quit braiding.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.820
And I'll show you why.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.474
So a lace braid wants to
fall forward like this.

00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:37.640
And we want it to lay nice
and flat against her head

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.950
and be extra-cute.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.750
So at this point I'm
going to stop braiding.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.050
You can see I've got
the braid right here.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.720
And I'm going to start adding
in hair and twisting, instead.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.580
And I'm going to be twisting
towards the center of her hair.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.040
And I'm going to just keep
adding a few extra pieces

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.150
until I feel like it's
about halfway through.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.715
Like about halfway
down her part line.

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:04.790
I think we're just about there.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.620
So I'm going to leave the rest
of that for the other braid.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.729
Now, I'm going to
just twist this.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.570
Just hold it and
secure it in place.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.700
And you can hold it with
an elastic or a clip.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.726
Just for ease, I'm going
to her hang onto it.

00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:19.350
Now, I'm going to
repeat the same thing

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.010
on this side of her head.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.550
So again, I'm going to
pick up a section of hair

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.490
and begin a lace braid.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.110
We're only going to pick
up here on this side, which

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.310
this time is the left side-- or,
again, the side above her ear.

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:45.787
Continue the braid
all the way down.

00:03:04.561 --> 00:03:05.060
OK.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.980
Now, again, when we get
to about this point,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.550
we want to start twisting the
hair instead of braiding it.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.050
So, again, I'm going to
take a piece of hair,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.132
and I'm just going to twist
it right into the braid.

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:22.730
I'm going to pick up another
little section of hair

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.570
and twist it in.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.280
And twist it until we
have a nice little twist

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.060
at the bottom.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.971
Hold me, please.

00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:32.470
Thank you.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.650
Now, I'm going to
take the two pieces.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.500
You can see we
have them twisted.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.875
And I'm just going
to secure them

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.850
with an elastic at the end,
a little tiny bit lower

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.240
than I normally would.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.440
I think this just helps show off
the little twisted ends, which

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.210
I felt like.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.160
Secure it with an elastic.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.500
And then I'm going to
go back, and just where

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.730
these pieces pull in, I'm
just going loosen them

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.820
up a little bit, because
I want that accented

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.200
that we pulled the hair in.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.450
I just think it adds a
little bit of fun pop.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.492
Just give them a tug.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.603
And finish it off with an
adorable ribbon or bow.

00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:27.472
And you are set.

00:04:27.472 --> 00:04:30.730
I think it looks adorable.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.440
OK.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.360
Let's spin her.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.225
So you can see the
cute lace braids.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.330
The cute bow.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.889
All the way around.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:40.680
And we're finished.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.860
So you guys are actually
extremely lucky today,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.420
because you're going to get two
videos instead of one from CGH.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.430
So many of you were
asking what happened

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.310
to CGH3's hair in
the bedroom tour

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.360
that Show Me Cute did on
their channel of CGH3,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.090
because she had really
crazy curly red hair.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.720
Well, we were experimenting.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.710
And we were practicing for a
Merida video for Disney Style

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.380
Channel.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.405
So you can check out
that video over here.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.030
I think you're really
going to love it.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.220
It's a no-heat
straw curl tutorial.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.520
So we did a bunch of curls
using straws, which was amazing.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.460
They turned out great.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.710
So make sure you check it out.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.350
And we will see
you guys next week.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.850
-Bye.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.757
-See you later.

00:05:18.757 --> 00:05:19.340
Sectioned off.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.290
You can see how this bottom row.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.920
So I lifted everything else
up, and held it out of the way.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.780
And then did the straw
curls on this part.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.740
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:35.680
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.105
-Did you get it?

00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:45.862
-It's hard.

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:46.570
-How many straws?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.072
-21.
