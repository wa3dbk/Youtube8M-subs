00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.880
[Sell Your House For Top Dollar - We Buy Houses Fast] - At Finally Sold we will give you a
fair and competitive offer

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.980
that will make it truly a "No Brainer" for
you to pick the Finally Sold Way

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.370
over the Real Estate Agent Way.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.070
When we meet with you for your free in-home consultation, we will actually show

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.630
you a customized side by side comparison

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.240
of how much you will net by going with us
versus using a real estate agent.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.820
When you take the time to examine our
aggressive formula closely,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.800
You will see that on average you'll typically wind up 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.680
with only about one percent less

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.000
in net proceeds by selling to us versus going with a real estate agent 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.340
Sure, you may net a little bit more by going with a real estate agent

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.100
but, is it really worth it???

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.000
Remember, with the Finally Sold Way, you get the speed and certainty of getting your house

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.879
Finally SOLD in just 10 days! Not to
mention how priceless it will be for you to

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.750
avoid all the stress, anxiety and
inconveniences of using the long and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.350
drawn out real estate agent way

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.140
when you add it all up wouldn't you
rather have the speed, convenience and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.080
certainty of The Finally Sold Way instead?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.430
Still not convinced??? Okay.  Let's examine this

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.270
a little closer. Now as you can see with
the real estate agent way,

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.230
the starting point is a sales price of
100 percent of whatever the current

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.890
market value is for the home.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.260
Whereas with the Finally Sold Way, it's just a flat 80%

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.970
Now, at first glance that may seem like
the Finally Sold Way is considerably less

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.200
than what you get from using a real
estate agent. But when you really break down all of the 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.530
visible and hidden costs of using a real estate agent,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.710
you will come to the conclusion that the two net values

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.840
are actually nearly the same. Now here's what we mean

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.200
you see the 100 percent offered for the
real estate agent way

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.550
is just a starting point, but don't forget

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.350
you still have to deduct a lot of things
from that amount until you get down to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.900
the final net proceeds.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.600
#1 - Commissions - Now the first cost of using a real estate agent is their typical 6% commission.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.500
This is their fee to cover all their
marketing expenses and to compensate

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.909
them for their time and expertise

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.700
and they deserve every penny of it too.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.700
# 2 - The Buyer's Discount - The next cost is that buyers typically wind up negotiating

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.900
about a 5% discount off the list price.
Now it's really just a case of human nature,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.100
because who doesn't want to negotiate and
feel like they got a good deal 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.400
when they buy a house right???

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.890
#3 - Miscellaneous fees -

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.830
The buyer will try to get his down
payment to be as low as possible

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.540
and they'll normally ask you to share
in as many costs as their mortgage company

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.180
will permit.  When you add up these fees, 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.610
they easily come to one percent. In fact many times

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.020
it winds up being more like 3%, because, aside from the obvious ones of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.400
the appraisal fee, the home inspection, the home warranty plan, a cash-strapped buyer

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.290
will often ask you to pay for a slew of other permissible loan costs

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.000
like prepaids, loan origination fees, PMI, and etcetera.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.180
#4 - Ongoing Monthly Payments -

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.900
Now the next fee is one of those hidden
costs that some people forget to take into account

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.700
Now you surely have heard the expression that time is money.  And when it comes to selling your home

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.920
it's no different.  When you add in all
the costs that you have to pay while the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.230
home sit idly on the market, like the
mortgage payment, property taxes

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.500
insurance and all the costs just to maintain the property, it usually comes to about

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.290
1% each month.  And when you take
into account that it takes an average of

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.069
five months to sell your home,

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.300
the cost for all this waiting equates to
about a five percent overall fee.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.200
#5 - Standard Closing Costs -

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.860
These costs vary from region to region. But when you add them all up

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.300
the seller's portion typically comes to
at least 2 percent of the final sales price.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.950
So, after all is said and done, the real
costs of selling your home

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.140
with the slow and hold fashion real estate agent way

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.100
is about 19%, whereas when
you sell your home fast with the Finally SOLD Way,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.900
you merely give us a 20% discount up front.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.879
So, therefore, it is as if you're just paying a tiny 1% premium

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.700
to save all of that time and avoid all of that stress,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.630
anxiety and headaches of going with the
messy traditional way.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.850
Hmmm... Let's think about that for a moment

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.170
80% Now or 81% FIVE Months from now!

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.980
You decide!  Which one makes more sense for you?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.050
Well, maybe that old expression of a bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.300
has some great wisdom to it after all!

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.700
It's no wonder that once you experience the speed, security, convenience, professionalism,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.000
and certainty of the Finally Sold Way, that you will never want to sell a house any other way again!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.200
