00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.603
What do you think of Debian vs OpenSUSE vs
Fedora?

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:18.493
Debian gets points for being one of the oldest
Linux versions, rivaling Mandrake.

00:00:18.493 --> 00:00:22.483
Mandrake is now Mageia, or some variant thereof.

00:00:22.483 --> 00:00:27.033
At least Debian’s iterations have all been
under the same name, with mostly the same

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.533
set of developers.

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:34.083
And it has a good set of applications and
its own drivers, though that creates compatibility

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:36.333
issues with some devices.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.993
What do you think of OpenSUSE?

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:43.323
If you love the KDE interface, you’ll like
OpenSUSE.

00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:45.553
And it interfaces well with Novel products.

00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:48.153
Of course it does.

00:00:48.153 --> 00:00:49.873
Novel backs it.

00:00:49.873 --> 00:00:55.223
Fedora spun off from a graduate project by
Togami or some such name.

00:00:55.223 --> 00:01:00.253
Its developers focus on leading edge stuff
and essentially have no backward support.

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:03.253
If I want a lack of support, I’d go with
FreeBSD.

00:01:03.253 --> 00:01:08.283
That at least lets me install earlier versions
if they work better.

00:01:08.283 --> 00:01:13.283
Fedora uses Gnome3, similar to the one in
Mint and Debian but very different from Ubuntu.

00:01:13.283 --> 00:01:18.033
Is that before or after the Unity interface
everyone hates?

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:23.183
It is a Windows versus Mac difference, now
Unity versus pre-Unity UI.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.723
What else does Fedora have against it?

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:30.583
Fedora doesn’t support many games or even
development of games without a lot of added

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:32.023
software.

00:01:32.023 --> 00:01:34.573
Even Ubuntu allows you to run Steam.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:39.903
Ubuntu is considered Unix for everyone, being
easy to install and run.

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:45.763
Of course they have basic features like playing
games, in addition to a hand-holding OS.

00:01:45.763 --> 00:01:51.663
Whereas Debian makes it harder, asking complicated
questions through the installation interface.

00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:55.753
You could always use the command line installation
with Debian, too.

00:01:55.753 --> 00:02:00.143
If I had that skill level, I’d be more than
happy to go with OpenSUSE and put it on my

00:02:00.143 --> 00:02:03.103
resume as proof of my skill-set.

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:09.073
FreeBSD is more the Wikipedia version of Linux
than OpenSUSE, though OpenSUSE does make you

00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:11.893
look like you have the Linux equivalent of
the latest iPhone.
