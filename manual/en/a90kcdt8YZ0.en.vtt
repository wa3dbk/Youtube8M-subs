00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.150
What's up homies?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.200
Started out as a high school reject
Nothing much was expected from me

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.760
My mistakes, I recollect,
I didn't care in retrospect

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.140
No indication
My life direction

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.820
No group formation
But now we are

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.680
Sitting
Hands on my controller

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.429
Seems to be the only thing we control
Power on (power on)

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.700
Worries off
They just seem to fly out the window

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.280
All indication
To my life direction

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.120
In group formation
Now we are

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:30.020
Broken but we're picking up the pieces
We're! broken but we're picking up the pieces

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.980
Scattered gathered, yeah we all matter
Doesn't matter who you are

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:46.860
Here we are, we came this far alright
Here we are tonight, Homies Unite!

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.620
No indication
My life's direction

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.560
No group formation
But now we are

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.320
All indication
To my life's direction

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.220
All in formation
Now we are

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.920
Broken but we're picking up the pieces

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:39.740
We're! broken but we're picking up the pieces
We're! broken but we're picking up the pieces

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.660
Scattered gathered, yeah we all matter
Doesn't matter who you are

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:55.140
Here we are, we came this far alright
Here we are tonight, Homies Unite!

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.460
I win!

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.660
I love you guys! Thank you so much for watching,
