Good afternoon everyone, my name is Amrita Saigal and this is Katie Smyth.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000 position:95%
We are from MIT and we have developed a manufacturing process

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000 position:73%
to make sanitary pads out of banana tree fiber.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000 position:97%
Katie: We were approached about a year ago now with a significant problem in Rwanda.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000 position:97%
36 percent of young girls in Rwanda miss up to 50 days of school

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000 position:98%
or work a year due to lack of access to affordable sanitary protection.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000 position:98%
In the future we'll be able to produce cheap affordable sanitary protection

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000 position:64%
because we use locally available material

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000 position:97%
this banana fiber which is stripped from the trunk of banana trees

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000 position:91%
and we're able to process this into a fluffy pulp material

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000 position:77%
that can be used as the filling material for pads

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000 position:97%
and this actually has similar absorbency properties to what is

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000 position:69%
currently being used in sanitary protection.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000 position:97%
Amrita: We aim to provide low cost sanitary protection to girls and women in Rwanda.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000 position:98%
We plan to use a social enterprise model in which women can own and operate a machine

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000 position:81%
and be able to sell pads in their local communities.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000 position:98%
We predict that they'll be able to sell these pads for a price of 75 cents for a pack of 10

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000 position:86%
for significantly less than what is currently available

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000 position:77%
which sells for $2.20 for a pack of 10 in Rwanda.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000 position:97%
Katie: So there is still work that needs to be done right now we're still in the design phase.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000 position:91%
We're looking to improve the quality and look of our pads.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000 position:95%
Amrita: We would love to hear anyone's suggestions and advice

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000 position:98%
on how to scale up our manufacturing process and actually help us

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000 position:95%
and give us suggestions on the implementation of our project.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000 position:97%
Katie: Its been a great opportunity presenting here, and that's our project.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Amrita: Thank you.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
