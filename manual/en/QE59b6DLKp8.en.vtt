Hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's Kitchen's What you Want

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.730
This week's recipe request comes in from the Facebook user Nathan Laverne and he asked me to 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.529
make a Kit Kat scake

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.379
so let's get started!

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.219
[song]

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.009
So, we're making a Kit Kat cake 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.410
and the first thing that I want you to
do is make 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.250
the cake. So I'm going to be using two cakes and I've made them

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.500
before on Nicko's Kitchen. We're making a white chocolate mud cake and a chocolate 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.660
mud cake.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.090
Now like I said, I've made these cakes before and I will pop a link

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.690
to those videos in the description below, so you can go and check them out. 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.120
And I've also made

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.899
a chocolate frosting as well

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.169
on those videos so you can check that out as well.
We're going to be using a chocolate frosting

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:05.580
for this video. Now I got some
chocolate frosting here and I'm just going to place it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.050
on the top of the cake.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.050
And I'm just going to mix that around and this will help the two cakes stick together. 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.470
So we're going to get the chocolate cake

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.870
and just place that

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.710
straight on top. Just press down

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.090
nice and firm. 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.650
Now what I want to do now is completely frost

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.650
the cakes. So on the top

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.650
and around the sides as well with our
chocolate frosting.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.010
So guys, this is what we're after here

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.560
with the frosting

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.189
on the cake. Now it doesn't have to be the
most beautiful job in the world, because

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.950
we're going to be putting KitKats on the side of this and then filling it up with M&amp;Ms on the top.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.369
So guys obviously you're going to need some KitKats. But the ones I got here 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.000
are the King Size ones, because
we've double layered our cake and I want the KitKats

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.560
almost like a tower around the cake and I don't want them to be too short. 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.880
If you just want to use one cake and it's quite thick you can just use the normal

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.059
size KitKats, that's fine. 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:15.729
They got so many different flavors. This is just the normal standard one. You could use the

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:16.900
white chocolate

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.709
dark chocolate - up to you!

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.209
Now all I'm going to do is I've just broken the KitKats in half and

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.659
I'm going to place them upright

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:32.659
on the cake so they'll stick right there to the frosting. 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:38.509
And of course like I said we're going to be putting some M&amp;Ms on the top and filling up 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.869
that top of the cake. 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:45.569
So again you can use any flavors of the M&amp;Ms. The peanut ones, all the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.359
assortments. 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:53.359
I'm just using the standard milk chocolate ones for this. 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.180
So guys this is exactly

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.189
what we're after. So we've just filled it up with some M&amp;Ms. They all sit on the top

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.099
with that icing. Of course they will still be a
little bit loose on the top obviously.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.909
Now I want to put this into the fridge for about
half an hour just until that frosting

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.729
can set a little bit

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.299
with the KitKats

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.670
and it just becomes a little bit more
stable if you like. 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.339
So when we cut into it it doesn't all sort of fall apart.

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:28.369
So, we've just pulled it out after thirty
minutes in the fridge. Now it's time 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:35.369
to cut this bad boy open and let's have a look.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.779
Alright, the KitKat cake!

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:50.779
I've got a little bit of everything here, KitKat, M&amp;M, cake - so here we go!

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.019
That's good. You know what?

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.679
I've got a saying. 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:59.640
Anything

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.309
that is fun

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.919
is also fun to eat. 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.519
That was fun to make. It's going to be fun to eat. 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.189
You're not going to make it every day. 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.319
Just enjoy it!

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.109
And it is going to be fantastic for kids
parties anybody's parties really

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.549
but in any case

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.549
give this a try it is sensational!

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.309
So I hope you enjoyed the KitKat cake, it is fantastic

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.770
for birthday parties or any special occasion really

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.569
