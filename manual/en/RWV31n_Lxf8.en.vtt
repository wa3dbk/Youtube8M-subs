00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.610
In this clip we're going to start with the
basics, we're going to do back flip and reverse.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.820
This is the two flips you want to learn first,
they're the easiest flips. First we're going

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.500
to talk to you about toe side back flip. I'm
right foot forward so I'm going to start on

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.711
the driver's side and work over to the passenger
side. The first thing you're going to want

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:19.120
to do is you're going to want to cut out,
be about two or three feet outside the spray,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.919
give yourself some room. I'm a little narrower
because I'm a little more advanced but when

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.579
you start you want to be a little wider so
you're two or three feet outside the spray

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.449
and you want to bend your knees. Make sure
your knees are bent right in here, both those

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.070
knees out, just like that and get on your
front foot, on the glide, you really want

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.091
to get on your front foot. It's like ninety-nine
percent on your front foot, one percent on

00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:42.730
the back foot with flips because if you don't
you're going to slide out on the landing.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.000
Knees bent, two or three feet outside the
spray, front foot, you're going to come in

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.690
like this, you're going to edge progressively,
start slow, build up higher. You don't want

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.490
to start too hard and you don't want to finish
too slow. You're going to start slow, build

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.040
up to a hard cut, you're going to go hard,
and when you're cutting, you're going to start

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.400
forward going the same way the boat is and
you want to make that ski go all the way backward,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.890
it's like a tug-a-war of the boat. The boat's
going that way, my ski's going that way, who's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.350
going to win? The boat is and what do you
do? You do a flip, just like that, that's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.350
all you've got to think about right there.
When you get the ski backwards like that,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.749
all you're going to do is you're going to
take your hip, you're going to put it right

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:25.229
up here, right into the handle, and then you
just enjoy the ride, absorb the landing, watch

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.259
to see if any hot girls are watching. Then
the reverse is kind of the same thing except

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.240
it's a little more floaty. Same thing, start
on bent knees, two or three feet outside the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.060
wick, and you're going to be on your front
foot. This one really is more front foot,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.249
this one's one hundred percent front foot
not ninety-nine percent, not too much of a

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.969
difference. You're going to come in like this
and this one what I want you to do is I want

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.289
you to throw your head towards the boat because
it's really easy to fall away from the boat,

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.490
on this one, because it's a different landing.
You're coming out like that but when you make

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.240
that ski ski away, just like that two side
one, but I want you to throw your head to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.740
the boat, keep your hips up here, throw your
head to the boat when you take off, land,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.340
absorb, look for the hot girls. You've got
it.
