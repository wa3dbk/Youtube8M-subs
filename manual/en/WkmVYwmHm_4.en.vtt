00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.670
To me first is about inspiring everybody everywhere.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.080
First is the opportunity to do something you

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.680
never thought of, to do something that you
never imagined yourself doing.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.340
First isn't just a hobby its more than that

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.460
when I do first I feel like I'm doing stuff that really matters

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.000
It has shown me what I really want to do with my life

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.660
First is children finding their future.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.340
We take students in when they are in year
eight or year nine and they’re not really

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.690
sure about themselves, they’re not really
sure what they want to do but by the time

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.680
they get done with TDU and their at university
they’ve totally transformed. They are so

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.820
energised about STEM and what TDU is all about.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.580
There was a gap, there seemed to be programs

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.020
wrapped around it for university education, but not a little bit before that.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.680
When I first joined the team I thought that
“Hey robots are cool, but engineering is

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.940
really boring. Why would I want to be an engineer?”
I’ve now seen that was a really silly mind

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.340
set to have, and I’ve seen that engineering
is solving problems and, 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.000
I can solve problems my whole life.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.500
‘FIRST Ladies’ is 300 women from eight

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.479
countries who have come together, and it really
forms a safe community for these girls, who

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.810
for many of them are the only girl on their
team.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.650
Mentors without borders breaks down the barriers,
one of the notions in first is that we operate

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.190
as a team, and it totally just removes that.
We’ve had mentors fly to china repeatedly,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.520
we’ve had mentors uh goto the, dominican
republic and we've actually done things in

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.660
reverse and invited mentors in.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.920
Probably one of the most exciting experiences

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.760
of last year for me was working with the team
to partner with our very first indigenous

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.270
teams in the northern territory, this was
a group of students that had never even seen

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.340
a robot let alone thought that they could
build one or program one, or compete in a competition.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.299
The percentage of free time that students

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.060
on TDU devote to others it’s absolutely
mind boggling. Weather its giving back to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.700
an FLL team, weather its doing relay for
life, or collecting cans to raise money for charities.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.440
When the team first started, they helped run

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.700
a couple of FLL events, then we took on FTC,
and then we started the duel down under, it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.400
was bigger events; bigger robots; bigger teams.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.160
The energy, the industry, the intellectual creativity

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.510
that our students and the academic staff bring
to this program is truly exceptional.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.690
And the program keeps growing every year.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.300
I’m now enrolled in mechanical engineering

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.730
in one of the top universities in Australia,
and I’m very proud to be chasing my ambitions.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.910
FIRST’s shown me that by being passionate
about something, I can change the world.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.230
Everyone everywhere, to me means engaging
and supporting and mentoring and encouraging

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.750
teams remotely, and I think that is one of
the things that I love most about it it is

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.480
really is for everybody everywhere.
It’s like the words of Margaret Mead, “Never

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.069
doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed
citizens can change the world. Indeed it is

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.200
the only thing that ever has.” And I think
TDU shows that every day, by going out and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.120
doing the impossible.
