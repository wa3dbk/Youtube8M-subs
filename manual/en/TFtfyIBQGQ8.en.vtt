00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.420
I GOP strategist was recently speaking
to dog 11 on CNN

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.630
and she is making the argument that you
know almost seems to play the race card

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.780
a little too much

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.799
and it's a little frustrating now keep
in mind that this happened

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.960
I on Monday an OK day and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.010
her argument seem a little questionable
Alice is a president playing the race

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.660
card is Palin suggest sorry just stating
the obvious

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.029
well two more words on this stop yet of
course is playing the race card and a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.920
problem we have here is specially

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.860
on MLK day of all days is become far
we've come we have not only elected

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.600
their first african-american president

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.879
we've reelected him and the fact of the
matter is he's not

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.440
people don't know if I can because he is
a black president has nothing to do with

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.120
its because he's a blind president but
not about the pigment other skin it's

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.410
about his policies his

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.629
job-killing policies and the numbers
that you really need to be concerned

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:51.780
with the fact that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.649
53 percent of Americans don't trust okay
Obama has never played the race card

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.800
Obama is not a good one said

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.430
my opponents dislike me or conservative
Republicans dislike me because I'm black

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.229
but never come out of his mouth %uh
Sarah Palin seems to

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.939
for some reason think that he said that
in the past I even applied in the past

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.130
%uh this didn't this strategy is
strategist Alice Stewart seems to think

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.439
it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.869
but in the most frustrating part about
it is she refuses to acknowledge

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.000
that yes there is a population of people
out there

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.979
that dislike Obama because he's a
biracial president right it's actually

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.540
crazy to say that because he was voted
for once and then reelected that there's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.340
no racism that makes no sense

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.930
first up we know that only about 40
percent of people vote in the first

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.960
place so you got sixty percent of people
that could be braces just

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.750
then and there and of course there's
some percentage of people that won't

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.439
vote for him because he's black that
that doesn't mean you can have a

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.570
legitimate policy

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.399
we complain about all the time you know
you cannot legitimately policy issues

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.130
with the guy

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.420
and that doesn't mean it's based in the
race so that she wanted to be in some

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.890
perfect world where that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.930
is only eight but that's just not the
world we live in well they will never

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.420
ever admit that I think that that's
something that they

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.710
realize that the republicans and
conservatives realize this is constantly

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.259
lobbed upon them and I think that there
is justification for for

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.690
obviously that there is still racism and
there are segments of the population

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.470
that will vote against him because he's
black but

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.420
he also said there are some segments of
the black population that will vote for

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.780
him because he's black so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.930
she wouldn't even acknowledge that part
you know I think that for for Obama

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.010
just being black is playing the race
card for these people absolutely so it's

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.170
a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.180
take a look at the next video she
continues and Marc Lamont Hill actually

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.200
%uh rebuts sum up what she says and I
love it take a look

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.640
don't think would be disingenuous said
test think that all people who dislike

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.890
the present dislike him because of his
policies

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.120
I know black people who didn't like
george bush because he was white

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.120
at that's the truth you don't think
they're white people who don't like the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.480
president because the black

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.120
I think the concerns people have the
reason people don't like president Obama

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200
is because I love policy is nothing to
do

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.720
but tomorrow ballot good guy I want to
question

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.300
out that when the question quite what do
you think there are any not you think

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.860
that their

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.290
a majority to the point years 39 percent
white people voted for Obama most white

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.760
people

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.110
did not vote for Barack Obama and I have
no doubt that some updated on racial

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.349
grounds but let's be clear

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.360
president obama also said that there are
some black people or only support him or

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.940
give him the benefit of the doubt

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.400
because he is black was not the Obama
came out and said white people are

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.569
picking on me he saying

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.830
that some people black people and white
people both along

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.280
racial lines and support along racial
lines but what they hear that is this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.260
whole race car thing

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.150
just because you mention race doesn't
mean you're playing the race card

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.590
somehow the race cars become this thing
to stop black people from talking about

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.970
raising

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.220
you know and everything right to bring
about playing a race car

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.159
I love what he says there doesn't
absolutely true and look it

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.530
all right now everyone is making an
argument based on absolutely no evidence

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.269
right away the mashup okay let's see

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.629
white pebbles and public figure who had
to say about a bomb in the past

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.340
when you take a look at colin powell you
have to wonder whether that's an

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.730
endorsement based on

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.780
issues or whether he's got a slightly
different reason for preferring

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.900
President Obama you now to Obama's gonna
come out in this case much more

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.689
forcefully

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.560
and he's gonna throw a lot of Spears
Barack Obama is a drug dealer of welfare

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.060
Obama is the best food stamp president
in American history. pick this past

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.030
had I had essay size side

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.110
shot testified you're never right

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.479
now call worker haha

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.160
I think that when you have somebody have
your own race that you're proud to be

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.790
present in the United States

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.220
I applaud colon to standing with a
permanent dependency in my judgment

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.979
evolving spokes on the federal somehow
getting benefits benefits benefits

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.060
I'm prepared if the NAACP invites me

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.800
now go to their convention and talk
about why the african-american community

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.090
should demand paychecks and not be
satisfied with food stamps

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.419
let me just be candid my party is full
of a racist

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.090
and the real reason a considerable
portion of my party

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.910
wats President Obama out of the White
House has nothing to do with the content

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.229
of his character

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.699
nothing to do with his competence as
commander in chief and President

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.050
and everything to do with the color of
his skin and that's this big ol

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.669
damn mmm-hmm plan on line you know do
you think that if president I was

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.520
playing the race card more that black
people would be benefiting more from his

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.400
policies

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.440
because almost every number that you see
that it be income inequality between

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.280
back to my place actually getting worse

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.850
yet there's more unemployed black people
than there were before President Obama

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.520
took office

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.560
so if you're gonna play the race card at
least we'd have some evidence are being

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.419
played

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.460
but actually I don't see lol has done

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.080
nothing when it comes to but certain
disparities between black people and

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.979
white people

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.900
and I think part of the reason why he
hasn't done anything is because he's

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.820
worried

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.970
that he is going to get that criticism
from the most right-wing

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.620
opponents right so for instance you
mentioned wealth inequality

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.710
and income inequality I'll that gap is
definitely widening

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.580
right and Obama hasn't done much to
address it now you can make an argument

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.370
that it's because I love you know his
corporate donors

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.370
and money in politics that's definitely
influencing him as well

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.560
but how often do you hear him addressing
the african-american community or the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.280
black community in the United States

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.610
and how a disproportionate amount of
them or

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.150
I imprisoned under our justice system
great for doing the exact same

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.979
activities that what people are doing

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.430
so marijuana use is one example that
they're out there you know so

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.669
these are all issues that he has never
addressed and I think that it's

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:31.560
problematic

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.850
and I think that he's worried about that
criticism yeah and you know I think you

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.600
could also argue that when you have a
certain ethnic group or religious group

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.060
a in your pocket no matter what you
don't have to do anything for them

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.400
so it's true I mean really is true so
you know something like ninety percent

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.530
of black people voted for Obama

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.360
so in a weird way he owes them nothing
will now he's not running for reelection

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.759
but in another week he knew going into
the last election that they were going

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.940
to vote for him in huge numbers
regardless well then it shows what you

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.199
have to do much

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.849
for them it the first time around I like
to look a little cynical to look at it

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.150
that way but i i think there's some
truth to every penny reminds me a while

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.840
Obama always comes to california just to
raise money in any leaves he never gives

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.220
a speech he never

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.800
you know meet with the constituents here
and then par the reason why is because

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.940
california's always gonna vote for the
Democratic candidate now it's just the

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.259
way it works
