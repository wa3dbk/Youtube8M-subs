00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:10.500
Speaker 1: Before we even play the drum, we
have to learn how to hold the djembe drum

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.969
and what position to be in so that you can
be comfortable to play for a long period of

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.270
time.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.820
The first thing I do is I tilt the drum away
from myself so that the sound can come out.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.350
If the drum is flat, there's no sound.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:36.870
I tilt the drum away from me, but it's going
to fall, so I have to gently put my legs around

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.559
the drum.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.920
It's not a thigh master.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.100
You don't have to sit here and squeeze it.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.600
You'll make yourself tired.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.360
You want to gently cradle the drum.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.589
You can see my knees hold the drum and my
legs come around the drum so that it's comfortable

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.070
and that the drum isn't going from side to
side.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.440
I'm not leaning from side to side.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.289
It's straight forward, relaxed.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.260
I could sit like this for a long time.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.590
Speaker 2: Also, when you hold the drum, you
have to relax.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.189
If you're not relaxing, you're not going to
get a better sound.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.650
The way I'm sitting, like this, I'm more relaxed,
more comfortable.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.810
If I'm more relaxed, my sounds are going to
come out.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.759
Speaker 1: What about your arms and your shoulders?

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.039
Speaker 2: Your arms too.

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.180
Make sure you don't hold your arms when you
start to play the drum, because if you hold

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.810
them like this you're not going to have a
better sound.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.300
The more you relax your feel and your body,
because there's a body connection with the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.300
music.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.460
The way, you see how I'm relaxed here, I'm
sitting like here, I'm relaxing.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.570
That way if I want to hit the bass, I only
do use that bass.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.570
That way I'm relaxing.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.390
Speaker 1: And you're lifting your arms.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.250
You're moving your arms.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.890
You'll notice that my body is still.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.890
I'm not going side to side, but I'm lifting
my arms up and down, and I'm staying center.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.549
Those are some tips on how to prepare yourself
to play the djembe.
