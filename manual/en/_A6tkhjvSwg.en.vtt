.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.960
ILES: Tell me about "Body of a Comic."

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.260
LONGO: No (laughs)

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.500
ILES: Perhaps we should start

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.500
with the title.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.830
It was dedicated

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.230
to Andy Kaufman, which I thought

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300
was this extraordinary comedian,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.600
who I thought was like the best

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.460
performance artist at the time.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.060
Andy Kaufman played,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.260
he did one of his routines was where

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.400
he played a bongo, a conga drum.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.100
I think these guys dying

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.130
reminded me of my, you know...

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.830
were a little kind of... they scared me,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.600
you know, and it was a kind of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.460
strange experience at that point.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.230
And I always thought that if I dedicated

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.930
the piece to these people,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.400
it would, like, get me points in heaven

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.530
or something like that.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.000
Like when I die and I got to the gate,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.100
they say, "Oh, you gave me...

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.260
"you dedicated art to those people,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.360
you can come, it's okay," or something.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.030
One of the things about the piece

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.400
that was important to me

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.130
is that the piece died,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.500
and it came back to life, and it died,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.630
and it came back to life.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.000
I remember in my studio in the...

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.360
in the workshop area

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.360
where I kept the tools

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.430
and stuff like that,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.600
there was a fluorescent light,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.830
and I remember whenever I plugged

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.030
the fluorescent light in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.160
and I'd turn it on, it would go,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.460
bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-BOOM,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.900
you know.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.160
And I thought if I put those

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.500
fluorescent lights inside,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.260
it'll have this...

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.930
this kind of awakening feeling.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.660
At the same time it almost looks like

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.560
distant thunder or something like that.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.200
So the way the piece shuts off,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.560
it shuts off pretty quickly,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.260
but when it starts up again,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.230
it has this kind of like

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.460
awakening feeling, and the drums,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.200
it takes a while for the drums to crank up

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.630
to full speed and things like that.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.260
ILES: So destruction somehow,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.900
the idea of possibility of destruction

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.530
built into the&amp;

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.960
Yeah, I wish I could have made it...

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.130
so at one point,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.430
we actually hooked up microphones to it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.600
and tried to have speakers.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.860
I wish I could make the whole room,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.930
like, shake when it happened,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.200
you know what I mean,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.230
(makes rumbling sound).

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.130
But I also remember at one point I was,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.260
it was one night--

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.460
I think I was way too high--

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.530
but we had hooked a piece up

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.560
and it was running,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.900
and I remember looking at it,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.000
and I thought, "This is probably...

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.360
"these three drums are probably

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.200
"what God looks like," you know.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.130
You could die and go to heaven,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.230
and there he is.

00:02:14.300 --> 23:59:59.000
.
