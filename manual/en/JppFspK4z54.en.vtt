Leveling your garage door,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.770
by garage door nation. Hi, my name is Thomas Mello, and I'm gonna show you how to balance

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.280
your garage door.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.670
If your garage door is not balanced, you're
gonna ruining your opener

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.610
and no time, so makes sure your garage door is balanced and the only way to balance

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.830
your garage door,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.470
is if you have the correct springs on. If
you don't have the right springs on,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.119
there's no

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.320
chance you're gonna be able to balance it
out correctly, so let's just look at this see if 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.749
this garage does balance.

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.769
I got a manual released, first the wall

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.000
and I'm gonna go ahead and lift it up

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.210
and I just left it up a little bit and

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.219
its falling pretty bad now, right here

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.290
this bottom foot is super heavy

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.590
so when a garage door is balanced and has a right springs, it should be able to stay in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.570
any position

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.190
and actually stay afloat. One thing you
never wanna do is adjust an old spring.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.390
I personally install this store over a
year ago. I know there're new springs.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.530
This is how people get seriously injured
or die, so I highly recommend not working

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.280
on a door

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.149
at Super all. I got some parts here, some
tools

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.170
that you should put your vice grips on
there locking in a place.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.240
Otherwise, your cable is gonna loose
tension. For now, we're just gonna loosen up the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.940
spring

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.340
and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.759
I'm gonna go ahead and wind the spring
one,

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.840
two, three winds

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.110
to get it balanced out. Now, you might have to play around

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.430
general. You're gonna wanna go on a
7-foot door,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.430
28 to 30 quarter churns. So

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.610
this doesn't have the white lines in it
but for every white line usually you could 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.960
tell one for revolution, so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.969
so that's nice and tight

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.340
and I know I gotta put some winds on this one as well, 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.200
is that a garage door is super heavy.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.299
just because it balances out at the center
doesn't mean it balances out at the bottom.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.100
It's so heavy at the bottom, there you gonna where the heck out of your opener. So,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.620
we're gonna go have one turn

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.620
two turn. What I'm gonna do is two-and-a-half

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.660
so as I have turned make sure the set
screws are tighso there is a half turn. Make sure these set screws are tight, but not too tight.t but not too tight

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.090
Once you get tighten, just do a quater
turn. So I'm gonna go ahead and remove my

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.770
vice grips

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.130
and now let's feel the door, that's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.530
perfect. You see how I just left it up
really easy. You should be able to open

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.070
the door up with one hand

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.960
super easy. If its easy for you, its easy
for the opener.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.490
Last thing you want to check on is when the door is all the way up.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.640
Do you have cable tension? So, I'm just gonna go here, look at my cables like its see

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.540
is great tension on, so I know everything set, my garage door is balanced and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.310
that's how you balance a garage door.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.840
Thanks very much for watching this video.
