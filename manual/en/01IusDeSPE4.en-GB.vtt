What is Money?
We all use money

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.430
We need it to buy things
We work hard to earn it.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.040
We save it for retirement, or a rainy day.
We all rely on money - so why don't we know

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.060
how money works?
Why is there sometimes too much of it, making

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.119
us believe that the good times will never
end?

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.090
Where did all that money come from?
And why is there suddenly not enough money

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.390
around? Why are people struggling to pay their
bills?

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.580
Where did all that money go?
The surprising fact is that most of the money

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.180
in the UK is created by banks.
Like a magician, banks make the money appear,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.690
seemingly out of nothing, whenever they make
loans.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.360
But this money is not what it seems. This
money is credit and is temporarily on loan

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.300
from the banks.
We use it as money. We believe that it is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.620
money.
But because it is credit, at some point in

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.560
the future it has to be paid back.
And when it is paid back it disappears.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.290
This is not a trick -- this is how almost
all of our money is created and destroyed.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.200
So how dependable is this bank created money
that we all rely on?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.969
Well, banks make their profits by charging
interest on loans, so as long as they're confident

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.759
in the economy, they want to lend as much
as possible.

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.720
More loans and mortgages means that more money
is created, and before you know it, house

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.979
prices go through the roof.
But if they make too many loans the debt burden

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.429
becomes too large, so people can't afford
to pay them back.

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.659
So then the banks stop lending, and suddenly
there is not enough money. Businesses go bust,

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.399
people lose their jobs, and houses are repossessed.
This is what caused the financial crisis.

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:04.020
And fundamentally nothing has changed since
then. Money is still conjured up by the banks.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.030
And it still disappears when debt is repaid.
Until we change this, we'll never have a stable

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.370
economy, safe jobs or affordable housing.
But it doesn't have to be this way. Positive

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.959
Money is campaigning to change the way money
is created. And we need you to get involved.
