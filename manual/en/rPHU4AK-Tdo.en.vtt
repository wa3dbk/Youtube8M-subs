00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.700
A TV show that was starring
evangelical Christians as the host

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.400
just got cancelled
before it even airs.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.300
So, the bad news is
it's not Duck Dynasty.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.500
The good news...

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.600
I don't really know if there's any
good news, but here's what happened:

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.800
HGTV offered a show
to David and Jason Benham.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.800
And these are twin brothers whose plan
was they were going to renovate houses:

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
they were going to turn bad houses

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.300
into beautiful dream homes.
And that was the gist of the show.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.100
But after they already started, you know,
after they signed all the contracts and everything,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.400
it came out
that these brothers

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.800
are not just Christians because, you know,
who really cares about that?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.300
But they're pretty
nasty Christians.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.600
These are guys who have said horrible things
about gay people, people who've had abortions.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.300
And their father's
even worse.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.600
Their father, Flip,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.000
is the head of
Operation Save America,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which is one of those nasty anti-abortion groups
that protest outside of clinics, making women who are

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.100
getting the procedure
feel even worse.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.900
They've also--
Flip also stood outside

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.000
mosques and said things like,
"Jesus hates Muslims"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.500
as people were walking
into the mosque.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.200
And one of the brothers actually took after
his father in this sense. He would join them--

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.300
He would join his father on these rallies
and these protests.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.200
David Benham actually led a protest outside
the Democratic National Convention in 2012.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.100
And he's also been known for going on the radio
and saying things like, "We gotta stop this radical homosexual agenda

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.400
and Muslims,"

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.400
not extremist Muslims might do,
"all Muslims are the enemy of America."

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.400
And his brother joined him too
on a lot of these protests and rallies.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.900
So, when this news came out
on the website Right Wing Watch,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.700
HGTV said: "You know what?
We're not going to air this show."

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.300
And it's a smart decision by them,
because why deal with this media firestorm?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.000
Why alienate so many of your
gay friendly viewers

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.100
when you have these brothers who have not proven
themselves, who don't have ratings hit yet?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Why not? It's just easier for them to just say:
"You know what? We're not going to deal with this controversy."

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.100
And by the way,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.700
this isn't to say HGTV took away
their free speech.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.200
No one's taken away these brothers' free speech.
They can say whatever they want,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.100
but no one owes them a TV show
for spouting these awful things.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100
You know, HGTV had to decide between
promoting these bigots

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.400
or, you know, alienating all of their viewers.
And I think they made the right decision in that aspect.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.200
But this controversy does raise
an interesting question, because

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.900
there are a lot of evangelical Christians,
who are on television,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.200
and a lot of them are very outspoken
about their views. So you would think:

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.700
"How come their shows
are still on the air

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.400
and this one got cancelled?"

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.600
So, let's just-- Let's run through a few of these
shows and talk about why they're still on the air.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.500
We know the guys from
Duck Dynasty are homophobic.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.100
We know the patriarch of the family,
Phil Robertson,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.500
got in huge trouble when he made very homophobic
comments to a magazine, you know, last year.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.800
And that show-- They basically put the father
on temporary, you know, suspension

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.000
with the full intention of bringing him back
once the controversy died down.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.600
And that's pretty much
exactly what happened.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.500
When you have the highest
rated show on cable television,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.700
they're not just going to cancel you
because you said something stupid.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.100
They're just going to try
to ride this one out.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.100
And as much as
I hate to admit it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.400
-- and it did for their show --

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.300
it seems to have worked.
I don't think most people

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.800
seem to care so much
about what he said anymore.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.300
But they're not going to cancel
the highest rated show on cable

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.400
just because someone says
something homophobic.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.500
Now it's just--

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.000
The basic line is:
"You know, this is the Duck Dynasty family.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.200
They're Christians.
This is what they believe."

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.000
So, you know,
take it or leave it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.100
And they know full well that people aren't leaving it.
If you like the show, you love the show.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
So, they don't care about
alienating anyone else.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.500
What about the Duggar family from
19 Kids and Counting?

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.700
You know, that is an entire--

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.600
What is that? 21 people who are evangelical
Christians, all raised in that tradition.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.700
And the father, Jim Bob Duggar, is very
outspoken about his conservative principles.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.400
But if you actually look for any outright
homophobic statements he's made,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.500
he doesn't really say a lot of nasty things.
They actually tend to keep away

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.200
from the culture war battle
in that sense,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200
unless I missed something, and I'm sure
you'll let me know if I did.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.800
But they don't come right out and say, you know,
"This is how we feel about gay people, this is how we feel about abortion."

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.800
Their show is mostly about how their family
operates with so many kids,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.200
and that's the gist of it.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.100
So, they're not going
to get cancelled.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.300
It is interesting to note that HGTV
has offered another reality show

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.900
to another evangelical Christian.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.600
This person's name is Jen Hatmaker
and she's a popular Christian blogger.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.400
She's actually a conservative Christian,
who has said marriage is between one man and one woman,

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.900
but she pretty much left it at that.
She actually thinks it's better if you just

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.100
don't take sides
in the culture war.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.100
She thinks that's courageous. I think
that's cowardly, but that's a separate issue.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.900
But basically she hasn't made
any nasty statements about gay people

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.500
and she calls out Christians who do say
nasty things about gay people,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.800
even though she doesn't think
they should be allowed to get married.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.800
So, I've been thinking her show's probably
not going to get cancelled, because remember

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.100
this is-- As much as some
Christian right people

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.700
are going to make
this out to be

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.800
a story about persecution, you know:
people are going after

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.700
these Christian brothers. And

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.700
even the magazine Christianity Today,
their headline about the story was

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.700
"Too Christian for cable?"

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.500
Like, "No, their Christianity
has nothing to do with it.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.900
It's the fact that they're bigots."

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.900
That's it, pure and simple. So, other
Christians can have their TV shows.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.200
We all know there are
Christian TV stations,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.600
we know there are
Christian TV hosts.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.100
But if they say something
that's truly hateful,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.600
and what the Benhams have said
is truly hateful,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.600
I don't think anyone expects these cable
television networks to keep them on the air,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.500
especially when they
haven't shown anybody

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.100
why they should keep their shows.
It's not like their rating is bonanza.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.600
It's not like they're so popular
that the station could fire them

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.400
and people would flip out.
No, that's not going to happen.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.200
This is a small controversy
in the Christian world.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.200
And you know what? In a few weeks
no one's going to care about these guys at all.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.100
So, the Bedhams
don't have the show anymore,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:19.300
but if you are concerned about them, you know,
I wouldn't be too worried because I'm sure Fox News
is going to give them a show soon enough.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.300
