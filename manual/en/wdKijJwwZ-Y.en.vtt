00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.520
check out the description box below for more
information this video is because of an email

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.730
that I received from Amber and Amber says
that she has 4c the how like I do for her

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.900
problem is she want her edges to look like
mine so she wants to know how to get my it

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.870
is all slick so nice and so neat so I'm going
to give you my secrets on how to lay your

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.480
baby hairs to the side and I'll give you some
suggestions on what you can do to maintain

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.739
for the very first thing is you don't have
to use additional product if you have very

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.860
fine hair because fine hair doesn't need a
lot of product to hold down so you don't have

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.590
to my hair then use water in a heavier oil
or butter like castor oil or Shea butter or

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.630
Shea oil or something like that and you want
to lubricate your edges with oil while your

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.210
hair is wet that this is the perfect way to
do this for fine hair because you don't need

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.020
a lot of product or much of any product to
do this so make sure that your hairline is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.820
damp from like spritzing it with water and
just rubbing it with wet fingers of something

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.170
like that in the RUB a little bit of Shea
butter your edges and then tie your hair down

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.240
with us are or you can do this with the molding
strip a molding strip is usually what you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.890
see a lot of people use in salons when they
are trying to do a molded set of finger waves

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.950
and things like that to the hair which is
really not as popular anymore finger waves

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.170
but molding ships are great for keeping your
hair in a sense frozen in a certain type of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.220
swoop or design if you have very fine hair
now I have a mix of fine hair and also have

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.930
a mix of thick hair so water in oil really
doesn't work for me and what I use is typical

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.720
hair gel I like to use hair gel that doesn't
have protein in it because it build up too

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.759
much protein along my hairline so I just use
gel with main ingredient that has water in

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.620
carbomer in it carbomer is the holding agent
and gell that is going to keep your hair stiffer

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.230
in place so in this instance what I like to
do is use the pads of my fingers I get a little

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.480
bit of gel just a little bit and I smoothly
hello my hairline I constantly smoothed the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.350
gel until it starts to become drier starts
to feel almost little bit tacky and then I

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.150
use just a small toothbrush that I just use
a small soft toothbrush that I just use to

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.230
do my hairs on my hairline and I like to smooth
them over in the type of design so that way

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.170
it looks really neat and things like that
after I do that it depends on the way you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.349
want it to look if you want your edges to
kind of way but just a little bit them air

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.160
dry that's what mine does not want to look
a little bit more wavy for what you can do

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.379
is tie her hair down with a silk or satin
scarf and tie down hairline down with a molding

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.629
strip now if you want links to anything that
I have mentioned here if you need additional

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.210
information check out the description box
for my website but when you are tying down

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.739
your hairline do so gently because you don't
want to cause headaches from you trapping

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.100
all the blood near your head so just use a
scarf to just tie around hairline after adding

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.709
gel and smoothing it with your fingers a small
comb a small tooth comb or a soft toothbrush

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.560
tie it down for about 5 to 10 minutes and
will be dry and then your hair will come out

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.740
looking nice so you just have to experiment
a little bit maybe the water in Shea butter

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.470
trick will work for you or just using a little
bit of hair gel the secret is that if you

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.170
want to hold you got to make sure that the
gel contains carbomer and it and to provide

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.129
to prevent too much protein from an overload
on your hair and causing her hair like to

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.450
be very hard and brittle make sure that the
gel does not have any protein in it so those

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.450
are my tips for you to lay down your 4C hairs
