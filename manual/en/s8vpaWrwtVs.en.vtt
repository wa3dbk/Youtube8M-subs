the david nachman show david dot com
welcome to the show how the everyone

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:20.059
watching live from the we survived but
he will survive obama if the page and

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:24.099
the i love it when i wake up in the
morning and brocco bomber is

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.429
baseball pay track of both of those

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.739
yesterday was debate number one
presidential debate that number one we

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.050
have so much to say about it i did get a
picture on twitter just before the start

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.140
of the debate from trevor james

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.060
who had a data package a teacher he was
ready to debate

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.370
in his david package that he should have
to say

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.530
does this kind of a little bit like me

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.430
yet there seems to be somewhat of a
resemblance there but anyway trevor

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.110
sending in this picture

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.130
ready to go

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.420
for the debate with his uh... dated back
and show t-shirt

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.760
here's my general dot on this debate

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.440
i was keeping track

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.030
of this on two fronts question by
question i was going on who want on

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.040
style and presentation

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.790
and who won on substance

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.580
if we had all those up matt romney

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.990
did very well in yesterday's debate on
style

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.070
on substance president all bomber told
way less lies and he was much more in

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.340
line with the reality of the situation
now the problem is that doesn't really

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.290
matter if you see a transcript is the
only

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.560
debate people absorbed was through
reading a transcript of it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.120
mitt romney's answers and flip-flopping
would have been completely

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.700
unintelligible

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.680
when president obama would have
absolutely dominated that debate

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.230
as we know and as we've known since
uh... john f_ kennedy debated

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.940
uh... way back when in that incredible
first television debate uh... modern

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.360
television debate

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.940
uh... it's not just about what you would
look like i a transcript of mit romney

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.530
did do well as far as that goes now
today as expected we're seeing the right

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.820
wingers say that mit romney did
incredibly well

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.800
and i'd predict it will probably see a
one to two point bump for mit romney in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.649
in some polls now the question is

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.500
how many and of undecided voters are
there really an ohio for example we were

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.550
talking about

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.880
obama's already pulling more than fifty
percent so even if romney gets all the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.019
undecideds

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.289
he actually needs to get people that
were had were already decided on

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.219
president obama

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.439
switch their votes and that romney
nothing really happened in my opinion

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.879
that would get someone to make that
change

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.529
no you're right he here is way more
enthusiastic end animated

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.179
and um... all's completely different
person from when he was giving his his

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.789
speeches no question about it and the
other thing also let's talk about before

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:37.299
we get into the specifics before matt of
the debate this format was terrible

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.979
and jim lehrer was not a good moderator
on a number different fronts do you guys

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.579
agree

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.509
hundred-percent

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:45.949
number one the format of the debate

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.579
essentially allowed and foster deciding
a talking point in a vacuum and not

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.959
really pointing out from president obama
even though for reasons will get into he

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.999
didn't seem to want to point out the
incompetence and flip-flopping from

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.359
romley on every single issue

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.849
jim lehrer tried let's be honest jim
lehrer tried number one to be remotely

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.529
in control of the debate

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.609
but number two to get them to address
each other during the first question

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.889
during that first question about jobs i
would you create jobs

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:12.870
jim lehrer said

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.829
respond directly to what he said i think
he said it to a bomb or maybe seven

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.750
sarami and they didn't and this happened
in two thousand eight we went in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.409
expecting fireworks

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.799
they barely talk to each other

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.109
obama and mccain in two thousand eight
same thing here it seems to be a

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.239
strategy it really seems to be the
strategy now that being said

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.880
the questions were not good

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.499
ladies and general

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.789
a lot of jim layers questions were what
are the differences between the two of

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:38.659
you

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.909
it's an open-ended question let's get
some specific questions here

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.400
to make it more obvious that there's no
answer being given

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.949
if you say what are the differences

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.739
it's chill weezy to just say talking
points and talk about whatever you want

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.790
i've noted not gonna answer jim

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.840
but at least ask a more specific
question are they did do the job

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.340
he had no control over the the the the
debate either

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.249
yet he didn't really yast even one
specific question he would say

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.569
let's talk about that this topic now you
can start and one of the differences

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.659
between the two of you on this very
broad topic bright and the only other

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.959
thing he would say is respond to that

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.019
it was not good awful the other thing i
was actually looking forward to the

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.079
split screen that we got because i liked
looking at what how weak and it was

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.440
reacting when the other was talking a
president obama did look

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.310
board irritated in many of the cases
when mitt romney was talking

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.330
may romney

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.650
when president obama stalking had that
vapid cycle paprika look on his face

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.369
that he seems to go to

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:40.839
anytime you have to listen to someone
else pecan it on your birthday

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.949
you didn't like the side by side

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.710
i didn't like the side by side uh...
when i saw a clip of the debate of the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.100
same thing that i had seen before in
split screen

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.390
using the needle before being shot that
was on obama all pummel looks a lot less

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.490
board and a lot less uncomfortable

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.650
then it seemed in the split screen in
the closeups though uh... so does that

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.380
work for more than you might get you
think that this was screen actually

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.660
heard of bob

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.639
yes of those military-like he said
ronnie had this very bizarre look on his

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.009
face like he was salivating and just
like eating everything up but it was

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:10.889
very bizarre

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.180
as far as a nurse and then we'll get
into the contacts for singers

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.069
all the singers we were expecting to
hear there was nothing the one that

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.190
would even be remotely close of mit
romney saying to president obama listen

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.979
you're entitled to your own plane

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.240
and your own home but not your own fact
it fell flat kind of a non factor when

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.400
everything is required

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.370
we sunup

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.960
yeah there is only one singer and that
was directed jim lehrer ringo promise

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.530
and i have five seconds before your
directed which i don't think was his

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.340
best moment yeah
