Classical music over footage of scenes of nesting habitat for the marbled murrelet.

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:29.208
Hi, I'm Deanna Lynch. I'm a fish and wildlife biologist

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:35.155
with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. I'm 
 based in the Washington state field office.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:38.174
And I wanted to provide you with some information about a threatened species

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:41.239
we have here in the Pacific Northwest called the marbled murrelet.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.030
The marbled murrelet occurs offshore from central California

00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:48.393
in the Monterey Bay area all along with western United States coast 

00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:51.598
through British Columbia and into the Aleutian Islands of  Alaska.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.794
But the listed populations occurs in Washington, Oregon and California.

00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:00.792
The marbled murrelet is a diving seabird.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.505
It spends most of its time at the ocean but it nests inland 

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.958
in forested  habitat. It's about the size of a robin.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.375
It's a brown, mottled coloration during breeding season.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:15.976
And then during the winter season, it's more of a distinct black and white.

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:19.648
This coloration makes it easier for them to avoid predators.

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.127
And then during the breeding season being in that brown, mottled color

00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:26.500
helps them blend into the forested environment.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
The other interesting thing about murrelets and is somewhat repetitive of other seabirds 

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:34.708
is that they aren't really very good at moving on land.

00:01:34.018 --> 00:01:36.708
Their body is designed to be swimming underwater.

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:39.667
Couple of interesting things to point out: 

00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:41.670
is that they have webbed feet, and it makes made 
 for swimming really well--they use these as a rudder--

00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:51.500
and they swim with their wings. And these are set back 
 really far on their body as you can see

00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:55.220
which also makes it difficult for them to walk on land.

00:01:55.217 --> 00:02:01.160
When they occur on the ocean, they are 
 generally within about 3 miles of shore,

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.300
but it varies very dependent upon where they're at within their range,

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:07.730
and in some places within their range they are much closer to shore.

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:11.590
They are primarily out there to forage. They spend time there resting.

00:02:11.587 --> 00:02:14.880
That's where they mate, and all of their foraging occurs at sea.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:19.060
During the breeding season is when they come inland to nest

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:23.800
It's usually old growth, mature forested habitat--conifer trees.

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:27.310
And they don't really build a nest so they 
 are unique among seabirds in that respect.

00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:34.510
Within those trees they will nest on branches or large limbs 
 that usually have moss or a covering on that.

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:39.520
And will have a cover above the nest 
 to provide it from aerial predator view.

00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:44.720
Usually these stands are large -- their preference would be 500 acres or more.

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:47.600
They only lay one egg.

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:49.270
So they don't have a large clutch.

00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:53.080
It's one single egg that the adults will incubate for about 30 days.

00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:55.790
They do it for about 24 hours.

00:02:56.402 --> 00:03:00.120
The female will be on the nest for about 
 24 hours incubating and then they trade off.

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:02.120
The male will incubate for 24 hours while the 
 female goes back out to sea to forage.

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:06.920
Once the chick has hatched, and come out of the egg,

00:03:06.917 --> 00:03:08.940
they don't attend that chick any more.

00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:11.040
other than when they bring forage in.

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:14.790
So they go back out to sea, the adults, and they will catch fish.

00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:19.640
And they will usually bring one single fish, fly it 
 back inland, and feed it to the chick.

00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:26.100
As the chick gets larger, they will bring in larger 
 fish, but it has to be a pretty small

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.390
bait fish like sandlance, or herring or anchovies.

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:34.090
Those are the types of fish that they are primarily feeding to their chick.

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:38.270
And then the chick fledges. And when the chick fledges,

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:41.330
it doesn't get anybody to help it to 
 make its way out to the ocean.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:45.470
Somehow, when they are out on the ocean, 
 the juveniles tend to find each other

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:49.460
and find the other adults. Most other seabirds are closer to the water.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.380
usually on big rock structures or cliffs, and they are more colonial. 

00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:58.580
Whereas murrelets tend to be in the forested area by themselves.

00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:03.370
The marbled murrelet is a mysterious bird--their whole 
 life is really designed to be cryptic.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:09.290
Their plumage, their winter versus breeding keeps them being detected by predators.

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:13.980
They also tend to fly inland during the dawn and 
 dusk hours when they are more hidden from predators.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.000
And, they also nest away from other murrelets.

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:19.880
So they aren't drawing in predators into their nest.

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:24.480
When they hear or detect a predator approaching them, they will freeze in place,

00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:27.360
and then they hunker down and become invisible.

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:30.580
in the nesting habitat. And when they are approached at sea,

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:36.180
they dive and they move away and they are really quick and evasive. 

00:04:36.178 --> 00:04:41.330
But all of these things make it so that people can't 
 find them, so they are really hard to find,

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:44.330
really hard to observe and learn about. So they are pretty mysterious still.

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.440
Thanks for taking the time to learn about the marbled murrelet.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.900
