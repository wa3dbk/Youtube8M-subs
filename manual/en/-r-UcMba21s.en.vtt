00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:25.030
I’ve obtained (and reviewed, for that matter)
many games on the XBox Live Arcade service,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.850
and haven’t thought twice about it.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.550
However, given the same sort of downloadable
content on my DSi, I’ve just... well, I’d

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.130
never given it a try.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.480
Maybe it’s because I felt less of a sense
of permanence?

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.910
Never mind that I own two GBASPs, an original
1st-gen DS, a DSiXL, and now a 3DS... that’s

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.270
a lot of hardware, compared to the 360.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.610
But, as I browsed around the DSi shop, something
caught my eye.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.490
The words said things like “RPG” and “brick”,
concepts with which I’m very familiar, but

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.580
to watch the footage of this monstrosity...
the only phrase that came to mind was “What

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.010
is this, I don’t even...”

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.869
This is Alphabounce, the DSiWare port of an
online Arkanoid-esque phenomenon.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.810
And I never thought I’d get to use those
words in a sentence, but there they are.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.909
The concept is as simple as it was back in
Breakout: bounce the ball at the blocks above.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.909
But where breakout had no real power-ups to
speak of, and Arkanoid had less than a dozen;

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.140
Alphabounce boasts an entire alphabet’s
worth of upgrades, downgrades, and sidegrades.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.500
E for Expansion and A for Attract, those’ll
be familiar to anyone.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.850
L for Laceration, tearing up any enemy craft
trying to impede your progress... cute.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.890
Q for Quasar, opening up a Galaxy Man-style
black hole in the middle of the field, annihilating

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.310
any blocks unfortunate enough to be nearby?

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.790
Umm... cor blimey.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.100
W for Whiskey, making the ball wobble erratically
as if it’s three sheets to the wind... now

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:23.420
we’re getting into the ridiculous... but
entertaining.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.780
Adding to the madness is a system of upgrades,
allowing you to customize your paddle (or

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.250
envelope, as it’s known in this galaxy)
with length extensions, stronger balls, and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.480
I’m going to abandon this now before it
starts sending me spam emails.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.760
You find new equipment by trekking through
the cosmos, completing a level full of bricks

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.099
in order to cross uncharted terrain.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.440
There’s a narrative behind all of this that
involves interstellar mining conglomerates

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.629
and a penal colony, and apparently the CEO’s
daughter has been locked up just because.

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.819
This guy sent his own daughter to prison with
no trial or jury, and is making her mine resources

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.250
in deep space, just because she’s a bit
rebellious?

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.820
Kids, when your parents are giving you flak,
just remember it could be much worse.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.890
But let’s get to the crux of this experiment:
paddle control on the DS.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.980
Yeah, I know, there was actually an Arkanoid
DS released with a dial attachment that fit

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.610
into the GBA slot... but that functionality
has been depreciated, unfortunately.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.680
(Yet another reason I’m never getting rid
of my first-gen DS.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.739
That and transferring Pokemon from 3rd gen.)

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.040
In its place, we get a stylus control that
feels so natural anyone but anyone will immediately

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.730
take to it.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.790
The soundtrack is a blippy little bit of techno
with the occasional hint of 2A03 instrumentation

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.030
just so it can give tribute to its roots.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.150
I can respect that.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.599
More importantly, though, it presents itself
as Breakout for the new era, with a massive

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.430
level of replayability in a time when free
browser games and five-dollar downloads are

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.040
becoming more and more powerful.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.740
H is for hat, which is off to Mad Monkey studio
for bringing Arkanoid into the 166th century.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:21.549
We’ve long had our astronaut, now we have
a reason for having him.
