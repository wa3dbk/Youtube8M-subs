MAN: Today we're going to make a baby plasma cutter. These are

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.570 position:95%
the tools that we'll need for this. Are some alligator clips.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.800 position:94%
A piece of tin foil which will be what we're going to cut. A

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.300 position:97%
piece of lead, 0.5 usually seems to work the best and four 9volt

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.400 position:91%
batteries. So in order to construct this, what we'll do is

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.800 position:91%
we'll put the tin foil, spread it across like what we have

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.100 position:95%
right here is a basket and we'll use a rubber band to hold it

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.530 position:94%
down. I'll hook up the 9volt batteries to one end will go to

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.930 position:98%
the tin foil and the other end will go to the piece of lead. So

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.500 position:86%
the science behind this experiment is you will have the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.330 position:92%
positive lead on the piece of lead and the negative lead on

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.630 position:98%
the tin foil and when you bring the piece of lead very close to

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.670 position:94%
the surface of the tin foil here, right as it touches you'll

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.000 position:92%
get a veryâ€¦so this is the piece of lead and this is the tin

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.230 position:95%
foil, you'll get a very small point of contact. And that will

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.830 position:92%
allow the current to flow and since it's a very small area,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.130 position:92%
which the current is flowing through, it will get extremely

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.470 position:98%
hot and that will vaporize the carbon atoms within the piece of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.970 position:94%
lead and it will actually turn them, it will ionize them and

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.400 position:95%
vaporize them and that will turn it into, there'll be a small

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.270 position:94%
ball of plasma, right at that connection. And that will then

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.170 position:97%
vaporize the aluminum foil. And in this reaction, both the piece

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.300 position:83%
of lead and the aluminum foil will be consumed. So to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.370 position:92%
construct this, you get your piece of tin foil and you want

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.370 position:89%
to set it over like a basket or just some hollow surface.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.270 position:72%
Close it down over the edges there, we can use

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.770 position:72%
this rubber band in order to hold it in place.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.270
So the tin foil is somewhat tight.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.970 position:98%
Now what we want to do is hook up our 9volt batteries in series

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.470 position:69%
and they'll just plug right into each other,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.670 position:59%
like this, so that one end is negative

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.100
and one end is positive.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.670 position:72%
We'll hook up one of the ends to the tin foil,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:54.600 position:75%
the other lead will go to the lead, pencil lead.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.900 position:64%
And there we have our baby plasma cutter.
