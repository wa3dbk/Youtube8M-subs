00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.030
Hey, everybody.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.740
Janin here from "Game/Show".

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.720
So a bunch of you probably
caught the news this week.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.940
And for fans of the
"Halo" franchise,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.820
it might be a tough
pill to swallow.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.970
"Halo 5" will mark
the end of an era

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.260
because it'll be the first
halo game that will not

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.770
feature split screen
multi-player co-op, which

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.580
is kind of a big deal.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.640
So what do I think?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.929
Well, personally, I'm
kind of saddened by it

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.470
because some of the
best times I ever

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.970
had with video games in
this time, these times,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.532
particularly in
times in college,

00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:37.240
getting together with
a bunch of friends,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.550
gathering all together,
and then playing "Halo".

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.894
On the other hand, I haven't
done that in many moons.

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:43.310
It turns out as
you get older, you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.419
don't have an infinite supply
of friends just within earshot

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:48.210
at all hours of the
night that you can just

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.949
call in for a new match.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.740
So I was really interested
in this question

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.550
about what the removal of local
multi-player co-op kind of

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.360
means for "Halo" and
what it means for us.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.410
So one big thing is that
like all great things,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.860
like all great works,
"Halo" has to change.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.560
I like to think about what
"Halo" was in the past

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.290
and also about what it is today.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.060
When we shot our
"Halo" episode, which

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.480
I'll link to in the
description-- it's awesome.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.870
I'm kind of biased, but oh well.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.220
We spoke to Hardy Lebell who
was the multi-player designer

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.470
on the original "Halo" series.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.490
And one of the insights
that he made was,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.190
and this may be huge
impression on us,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.570
is that when Lebell was
designing the original "Halo"

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.960
multi-player, he thought
of it as a party game.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.450
It was more akin to something
like "Mario Party" or "Cards

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.770
Against Humanity" than it
was to "Doom" or "Quake."

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.700
It was designed for
lighthearted fun

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.860
with friends around the sofa.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770
There's another really
revealing take away

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.070
also-- he and this other
guy, they basically

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.550
made the entire multi-player
mode all by themselves.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.820
Now, since those humble
days with the two of them,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.450
"Halo" has increased
in complexity

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.590
by a staggering degree.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.550
It's made by a huge team at 343.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.170
And when you're bouncing a big
game like this like "Halo 5,"

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.800
data is everything.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.850
In fact, there's a fascinating
cover story a couple years ago

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.651
on "Halo 3."

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.400
I'm now linked to a
description that looks

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.570
like the user research lab.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.550
And I believe that polygon
did an update of the story

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.005
maybe a couple
years ago as well.

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:11.380
But this is really important
because the size of the team

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.400
does affect ultimately
how the game is made.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.470
Well, we talked to Chris
King for the episode.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.530
He's the guy who's in charge of
balancing weapons these days.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.420
He said that they're
constantly monitoring

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.480
things like the number
of kills, assists,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.980
the effectiveness
of different maps,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.040
the skill level of the
players, all in relation

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.750
of one gun versus the other.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.280
This is stuff that Lebell
did not have access

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.070
to when he was designing
the original "Halo"

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.150
over a decade ago.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.530
Here's the other cool
thing that King told us.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.990
He said they have the ability
to flip a switch and record

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.520
every time someone dies.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.170
So this gives them data on a
lot of these minute details

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.810
such as the distance
between players,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.310
on the weapon each
player was using,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.285
the length of time
between their last death,

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:49.160
what killed the other
person, whether they're

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.842
aiming using the new smart
link system, and so on.

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:53.550
And this is really
important because they

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.960
use all this
information in aggregate

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.310
to make the game
balanced and fair.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.450
And here's the crux
of the argument.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.535
You need people
to do this online.

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:06.635
If they're playing on a machine
with friends head to head

00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:08.260
but it's not connected
to the internet,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.000
then 343 doesn't
get the information

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.540
that they need to make the
game more balanced over time.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.117
You see a very similar
sort of approach for MOBAs

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:17.200
like "League of Legends"
or "Heroes of the Storm".

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.020
From a designer's
point of view, it's

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.040
in the best interest
for everyone

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.720
be playing the game
on their own screens

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.620
online because it gives
them the ability to study

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.953
and ultimately change and
balance what they're creating.

00:03:26.953 --> 00:03:30.680
But this design decision,
it's not without effect.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.860
There's a broader cultural
trend here in the US

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.750
and elsewhere that we're
becoming physically

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.020
disconnected from one another.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.790
And this removal
of multi-player,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.190
local multi-player, from
"Halo" is just another step

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.500
towards that future.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.850
Robert Putnam traces this idea.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.890
He wrote this book
over 10 years ago

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.950
where he lamented the
decline in social capital.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.199
And he made this argument
that Americans in particular

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.920
have been detached from
the activities in society

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.740
that we used to highly value
such as voting, participating

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.240
in civic organizations,
volunteering

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.590
in the community, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.290
And his book is called
"Bowling Alone-- the Collapse

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.090
and Revival of
American Community."

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.055
And he illustrates this
problem with bowling.

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:05.430
The number of
people who bowl has

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.605
increased but the number
of people in leagues

00:04:07.605 --> 00:04:08.960
has actually dwindled.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.860
And it means that these
people who are bowling alone,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.180
as it were, don't the
same satisfaction,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.470
same kind of social
interaction as they

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.940
might if they were in a league.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.590
Now, look-- obviously, these
types of experiences are-- it's

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.359
not a total one to
one sort of analogy.

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:25.900
Like, when people
are playing online,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.690
they are playing
with other people.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.590
But, you know, it's
not quite the same

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.122
as having someone
right next to you

00:04:31.122 --> 00:04:32.580
on the couch that
you can poke them

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.910
when you do something amazing
or have a chit chat with them

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.850
or just share a beer.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.460
These kind of like social
fabric types of interactions

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.840
the games are often
very good at enabling

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.050
and games have been that way
since the days of arcade.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.792
So "Halo" is just an example
of how technology can continue

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:48.000
to lead us in that direction.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.810
And with virtual reality on
the future, as Putnam predicts,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.780
the trend of culture
isolation could ostensibly

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.780
expand further.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.450
Anyway, I'd love to
know what you think,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.620
whether this big change
in the "Halo" franchise

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.536
will affect the way you
think about the series

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:03.880
and affect the way that
you play with each other.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.640
I'll see you next week
