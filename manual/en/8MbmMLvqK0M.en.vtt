Hi, my name is 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.010
Colleen Schaan and I'm a Copic Regional

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.010
Certification Instructor and co-

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.020
author of the Copic Coloring Guide.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.040
In this video, I would like to

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.060
explain to you a little bit about the copic

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.080
numbering system, or what I like to 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.100
call the secret code.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.130
The copic numbering system is made up 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.180
of three parts. Let's take a 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.210
closer look.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.240
The first part of the code 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.290
is the letter. The letter 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.340
stands for what color family the marker

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.350
is from. For example,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.360
this marker is R; it's 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.380
from the red color family. This

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400
marker is B and it's from the blue color

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420
family. Now sometimes

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.460
there's more than just one letter.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.510
For example here I've got YR

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.560
and this is from the yellow red

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.600
family. The second

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.640
part of the copic numbering system

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.680
is the saturation. Saturation 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.720
basically tells you how vibrant a marker

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.760
is. Let's take a look.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.790
Saturation is

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.840
represented by that first number.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.920
All of our numbers go from 0

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.990
to 9. The lower the number 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.070
the higher the saturation

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.080
or the more vibrant that marker's going to be.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.090
The higher that first number,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.120
the lower the saturation 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.160
or the less vibrant the marker will be.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.200
Let's take a look at some 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.240
examples.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.290
I have two red markers 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.330
here; the saturation is different 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.380
on both markers. For example, on 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.430
this marker the saturation is a 2

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.470
so it's almost fully saturated. 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.520
So it's going to be very vibrant and 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.550
bright. This marker has

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.580
a saturation of 8 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
so it's going to be much less vibrant.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.670
The last part of the copic numbering system

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.750
is the shade, and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.770
that's represented by that last number.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.870
Again, all of our numbers go from

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.910
0 to 9 with 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.950
shade the lower that number

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.000
the lighter the shade.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.050
The higher that number the darker the 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.110
shade. For example, 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.180
I have two

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.240
blue markers; 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.280
this marker has a 1 for the shade

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.330
it's a very low number so it's going to be 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.360
a very light blue.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.370
This marker has a 9 for the shade

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.390
so it's a much higher number so it's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.410
going to be a much darker shade.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.420
Now there's always exceptions to the rules

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.470
and the copic numbering system is no different.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.490
Sometimes you have a marker 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.540
that has multiple zeros;

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.560
basically that tells you the shade.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580
The more zeros, the lighter that marker

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.630
is. Now that you understand

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.660
how to read the copic numbering system,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.710
let's put it together to help

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.770
you pick good blending groups.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.820
There are just a few basic rules

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.880
for putting it together to pick

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.940
markers that will blend well together 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
The basic rules are: Always 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.980
pick markers from the same

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
color family so they have the same letter.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020
Pick markers from 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040
the same saturation so they have 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.070
the same first number.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.130
And then pick two or three 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.140
markers with two or three digits

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
difference in the last number.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180
So you'll have a light, a medium

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.210
and a dark marker

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.230
in the same saturation same 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.270
family. If you do that you're going 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.310
to have markers that blend really well 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.410
together. For more information about

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.540
the copic numbering system and how to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.560
pick good blending groups you can refer

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.570

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.600
