00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.389
Hi I'm Mat from eSpares.

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.200
In this video I'll be showing how to
change the door seal on this Hoover

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.600
OPH716D washing machine.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.619
Now on this machine it's not possible to
remove the front

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.930
panel to access the door seal and
replace it so what I'm going to be doing

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.690
is simply going in through the door porthole.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.420
Now if necessary if you need more space to work

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.280
it's possible to put the machine carefully onto its back which allows the drum to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.680
fall away from the front machine giving me more area to work

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.260
And you can also if necessary

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.929
remove the door via these two hinge screws here.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.960
But I'm going to be doing in just from the front of the machine.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.780
Safety first always unplug the appliance
before carrying out any work

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.760
And the first thing I'm going to start by doing

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.899
is to take the top off via these
three screws at the back.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.120
The door seal on this model

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.940
has very unsightly mould and bacteria inside it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.720
It also has some discoloration from the Sun

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.740
If your door seal isn't as unsightly

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.800
as this one it is possible to remove and
clean the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.270
mould and bacteria way and also prevent it from building up

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.030
you can see me doing that in another
eSpares  video

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.780
But as this one is in such a poor state I'm going to be replacing it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.600
The first thing I need to do

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.660
is to remove the outer retaining band

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.660
from the outside of the door seal, using a flat head screwdriver.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.020
I then need to push the door seal inside the machine

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.500
 so I can access the inner retaining band

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.240
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.979
simply done just pull the seal of the lip

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.290
and fold inside the drum.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.180
Now on some models it's possible to
simply

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.569
unscrew the retaining band but this one
I'm going to use the end of a socket

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.349
to hold the nut into position 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.011
while I unscrew it with it Phllips head screwdriver

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.319
With the retaining band now loose I can
simply

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.750
work the seal away from the drum.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.200
You can then grab your brand new seal.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.520
 Now on some door seals it may be necessary to lubricate

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.530
 the lip with a little washing up liquid,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.240
but this one's actually come pre
lubricated.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.500
Push it inside the machine and then

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.260
using the marker this goes to the top

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.420
and the drain hole there goes at the
bottom.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.900
To make sure the door seal is in the
right position. 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.640
You can then work the lip around the rim

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.640
of the drum itself.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.739
With the door seal in place

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.299
you need to pop it inside the drum again

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.160
And then refit your inner retaining band.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.660
If the screw isn't in in the right position

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.690
you can easily move it by holding on to
the seal

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.930
before tightening it up.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.380
With the inner retaining band in place

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.840
now all I need to do is fit the seal

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.469
onto the out tub lip the machine

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:35.380
 and replace the outer retaining band.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.830
With the door seal in  place now I just need to fit

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.930
the outer retaining band,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.500
And this just connects together

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.000
with these two sets of teeth

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:01.010
helping it to remain nice and tight.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.700
So there we have it one new door seal fitted to this Hoover washing machine.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.270
Now it's a good idea to run a test cycle
just to ensure that is fitted correctly.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.340
Door seals and thousands of other spares and accessories

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.370
For all  makes and manufactures of washing machine are available on the eSpares website.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.490
Thanks for watching
