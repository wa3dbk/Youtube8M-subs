00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Hi, I'm Michael Castley from Triple S

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.500
and I'm here to introduce our Tailormade cabinets.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.000
The first cabinet I'd like to show you is our Elements Modular range.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This range is a permanent setup.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.500
It has no wheels, for stability,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.000
it's firm on the ground and it doesn't wobble.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The basic setup is a drawer unit, a sewing table, and a storage unit.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The drawer unit comes with four fantastic removable trays.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Also, down the side, you got storage for mats, rulers, magazines and so forth.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.000
The sewing table comes with a large platform.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:56.000
It's 58.5 by 29 centimetres. This will fit most sewing machines, quilting machines, and embroidery machines.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Also, has a great manual lift system for two types of sewing,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.800
free arm sewing, and flatbed sewing with the purchase of an acrylic insert.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
It has an adjustable chain here so you can adjust the height to suit your machine.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.900
Also, we have the storage unit.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.800
The storage unit is nice and deep

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.900
you can store your overlocker,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.500
you can store your fabric, un-finished work, and so forth.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.000
As you can see,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.500
with the two units either side, it gives you great working bench space.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.000
These cabinets are only available in white.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.400
Being a modular unit,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.000
this gives you the opportunity to set up your ideal sewing room.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.000
As you can see, we've added an extra table here

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.500
for your overlocker, embroidery machine

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.500
or quilting machine.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.000
Also, the four drawer unit for extra storage.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.000
If you have three machines, you could purchase three tables.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.000
Because all these units here are sold individually,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.000
so you can set up the room to your liking.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Also, you can have a left hand setup, or a right hand setup.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.500
It's very compact, able to swivel from here to there easily

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.000
so everything is within hands reach.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
These units come flat-packed, so that they're easy for transport.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And the Elements range is in-store right now.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Within our Tailormade range, we have another five beautiful cabinets and a storage unit.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The difference between these units and our Elements range,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.500
is that they are fully assembled and they come in three colours,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
white, teak, and beech.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We have our Quilter's Vision.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is our largest unit, everything you need in the one cabinet.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We also have our Quilter's Dream, which is our second largest cabinet.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.000
Then we have the Eclipse. The Eclipse is our most popular selling cabinet,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.000
and has great storage for threads and notions and tools.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.000
It comes with a cabinet that stores your overlocker,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.000
and also have some hidden drawers. A fantastic unit.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.000
We also have two cutting tables, one at a height of 87 centimetres

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.000
the other height at ninety-five centimetres.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Then, we have our wonderful little compact Gemini sewing cabinet.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.500
I've got one here to show you now, this is our little Gemini and as you can see, it is very compact.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.500
Until you open it up and I'll show you now.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It's very easy to open up, the wheels roll very easily

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.500
and also, they're lockable so you can lock the cabinet in position.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And at the back here, you have a little extension table at the back like so.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.900
What a smart looking little cabinet. Also you can see we have our sewing machine already stored in the cabinet.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.500
With a nifty little air lift.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.500
I'll show you how this works. You push it down like so and it comes up to the first position.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
This position is designed for flatbed sewing, with the purchase of an acrylic insert.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.900
And it is adjustable at the back for your machine so you can make sure it's at the right flat height.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Push it down once again and then it comes all the way up for your free hand sewing position.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.500
Also you can see it comes with some great little storage units.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You've got here, you've got a little storage unit that carries all your threads

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.500
little spots here for scissors and more threads.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.500
Over here we've got another storage cabinet and I can carry them out and put them on the side

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.000
while you're working, and when you're finished you can pack everything away and you can put it back like so.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We have a brochure that you can have a look, which gives you all the information on all our cabinets.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.000
Our Quilter's Dream, our Quilter's Vision, our Eclipse,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.200
our cutting tables and a little storage unit that we have also in there as well.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.000
All available in the three colours I mentioned.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.400
Also, you can visit our website

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.900

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Or you can call me here at Triple S on 9672 3888.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Thank you.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Here is our Koala sewing chair.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.500
This chair is an extremely comfortable chair to be sitting on while you're doing your sewing.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It has double thickness foam here for comfort for those long days when you're sitting at your machine.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.000
Great for comfort

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.500
Also, fully adjustable back here

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.000
What you do, your lever, lift it up you can put the chair in any position you feel comfortable with.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.000
We suggest bringing the back far forward so it gives you that support while you're sewing.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Also, if the lumbar support isn't in the right position

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.000
great lumbar support here but if it's not in the right position

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.000
you can move it up like so

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.000
into position where you think it needs to go

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.000
to get that support.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.000
There we go, sitting right there on my lumbar and it feels great.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.500
Also, the chair goes all the way up so you can sit at the cutting table

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
you have somewhere to put your feet like so.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.500
Very versatile chair.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.100
Put it down again.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.000
The chair comes in four great colours and you get two colours in the base to choose from

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.500
and you can choose what colour base you want with what colour chair you like.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.000
This is a great chair to be sitting on to be sewing in,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.000
highly recommended for sewing, Koala chair, please look out for them in stores.
