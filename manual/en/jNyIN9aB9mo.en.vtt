00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.670
Hey guys, I'm David
with DanceOn.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.940
And I'm bringing you you're
weekly recap of So You Think

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.420
You Can Dance, season nine.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.890
This week we're at the
top eight dancers.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.660
We have different All
Stars partnered

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.420
with different dancers.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.680
It's mixed up a little bit.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.640
And we have solos introduced,
so it'll be exciting.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.940
I actually won't be covering
solos in my recap.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.140
They were all really amazing,
but I don't think that any of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.540
them really stood out and told
me anything that I didn't

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.250
already know about the dancer.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.190
They were all equally amazing,
but I already knew all these

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.280
dancers were amazing.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.150
The solos didn't bring any
real new information.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.850
So I'm just going to focus on
the partnering routines for

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.580
this recap.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.980
The opening group piece
was awesome.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.930
I actually thought it was
a Sonya Tayeh piece, but

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.790
apparently it's Peter
Chu, a new

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.730
choreographer for the show.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.400
I noticed that they focused
on Chehon a lot in it.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.840
The camera followed
him around.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.410
And it's sort of unfair to the
other dancers that they put

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.200
him in the spotlight.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.060
And I notice that they actually
do that in a lot of

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.990
the group routines.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.150
My two favorite pieces
of the week were

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.380
both of the hip hops.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.420
I loved Will and Lauren's
hip hop.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.945
I really just think that Will is
great at conveying emotion.

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:56.470
He was so specific in this.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.920
It really, really moved me.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.190
And for a hip hop piece to move
me is really special.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.170
So I think that he did
a good job with that.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.740
I also thought the choreography
for this piece

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.489
was really great,
really creative,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.700
and I loved the concept.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.110
The other hip hop with Witney
and Twitch was so awesome.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.660
And Witney like totally
brought it.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.140
She was really getting into it,
so much that I actually

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.040
thought that she reminded me
of Janelle, who dances with

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.720
Dejan Tubic now.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.800
I was a little confused about
Chehon and Anya's tango.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.980
The judges stood for it, and
they all praised it as the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.620
favorite number of
the entire night.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.650
And I watched it twice through
after I had listened to the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.830
judges, and there was just
a disconnect for me.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.510
I didn't really feel the
chemistry between them.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.540
I didn't think that Chehon
connected with Anya.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.330
And I love Chehon.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.950
I'm always rooting for him.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.160
So it was weird that I didn't
enjoy it as much

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.990
as the judges did.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.970
Cole and Allison's Sonya
Tayeh piece was great.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.560
No surprise that Cole was evil
again, because I guess that's

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.240
the role that they
always cast him.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.660
But he was very impressive.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.420
Allison is just such
a great partner.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510
She was fantastic
in this piece.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.700
I love the suspended lifts, the
strength that she has to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.980
have to be able to
hold her body up.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.670
Even the little lift where she
jumps in a ball and he holds

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.950
her, I thought those were
all very cool to watch.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.860
There was a moment where Cole
walks across the stage, and he

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.130
was convulsing a little bit.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.010
And each movement was
very specific and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.980
very sharp from him.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.190
He always executes
it very clearly.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.310
So I thought this was a great
piece for the both of them.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.230
Eliana and Ryan's quickstep
totally just blew me away.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.240
I don't know how Eliana makes
it look so easy, but it just

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.460
came so naturally to her.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.570
I don't understand.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.370
She can really do anything.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.620
It was just a joy to watch.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.480
I really don't have
any criticism.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.980
Alex and Lindsay's jazz
routine was fine.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.260
I wasn't blown away by it.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.050
Alex is amazing.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.600
Lindsay was fine.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.740
I was just thinking while I
was watching it that, in

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.750
comparison with all these other
girls who completely

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.910
blow me away, Lindsay just sort
of fell to the bottom.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.840
I did think that the part of
the choreography where they

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.020
were repeating, there was a
cannon, I thought that was

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.340
really cool.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.930
And I thought they both executed
that really well.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.980
Cyrus and Melanie's
jazz was, eh.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.400
I mean, it was great to see
Melanie dance again, because

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.090
she's amazing and I've missed
her and I love her.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.770
But Cyrus just-- he really--

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.020
I feel bad.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.580
There was a jump in second,
and he just didn't even--

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.110
his legs were like there,
and his knees were bent.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.490
It was just really awkward.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.300
I know that he has charisma,
but come on.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.650
It's time for him to go.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.930
Lastly, Tiffany and Ade's dance
to "The Power of Love"

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.440
by Celine Dion-- one of
my favorite songs--

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.130
it was great.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.990
It was just lifts and legs.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.110
And Tiffany is so bendy
and flexible.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.250
And Ade was such a good
partner for her.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.400
And just the complete contrast
of their body types and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.550
everything, it was really,
really interesting to watch.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.590
And I was very entranced
by it.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.200
Lindsay got sent home, which I
thought was the right choice,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.370
obviously, from this recap and
many recaps before this.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.610
I really do think that Witney
is the more interesting

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.870
ballroom dancer of
the two of them.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.170
She might not have as good
technique in ballroom,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.390
specifically, with her
legs and her arms.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.450
They're not as sharp
as Lindsay's.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.010
But she has way more charisma,
and she's much better, I

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.710
think, at other styles.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.990
Will also got sent home.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.190
And I would have preferred him
to stay on for at least

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.030
another week.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.940
I really enjoyed watching
him grow.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.360
See, Will is a great example
of someone who has charisma

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.589
and doesn't have as good
technique as the rest of them

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.070
but still has a foundation.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.279
And you can root for him,
whereas Cyrus just has too

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.390
little technique for it
to even make sense.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.500
So I really would have
preferred that Cyrus

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.120
went home this week.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.960
But I'm sure that Will's going
to be a star, as long as he

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.980
puts himself out there.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.320
He has a personality.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.610
And he's a great dancer
and a great performer.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.870
And I hope that I see him again
in the near future.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.350
Anyway, that's it
for this week.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.632
I'm excited to see how our top
six perform next week.

00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:42.020
And until then I'll see
you guys later.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.950
Thank you so much
for watching.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.850
Bye.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.390
