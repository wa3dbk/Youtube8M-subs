00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.110
Hey everybody, it’s Rob from Man Sewing.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.880
Today I have a totally tubular Quick Tip for
you.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.030
That’s right, I’m going to show you the
way or one of the ways I’ve started turning

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.500
my tubes from right sides together back to
right sides out.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.359
So what we are going to need today is a ball
of twine or a ball of string.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.990
One fat safety pin.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.630
Now the size of the safety pin is actually
proportional to the width of the strip so

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.430
I’ve got a four inch strip here so I could
use a big safety pin and a big ball of twine.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.030
If you’re doing like a two inch tube that’s
going to be turned, you could go a little

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.590
bit more dainty we’ll call it.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.280
I have the full 45” of my fabric here, right?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.899
So the first key is I’m going to take my
twine, and I’m going to tie a knot onto

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:51.899
my safety pin.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.970
And I’m going to make my knot come down
here a little bit.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.550
And let me close this so I don’t get jabbed
and bleed all over the set here.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.300
So a little twist and a knot.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.820
And I definitely want to make sure this is
secure.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.920
This is not a place where we use a safety
pin we don’t trust.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.470
We want this safety pin to hang on because
we’re going to actually pull this safety

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.500
pin right sides out.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.080
I’m going to wind off a ton of my cord but
I’m not going to cut it because I’m going

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.940
to wind it back up when I’m all done here.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.470
Then what we do is we take our big safety
pin, and at the top edge I’m going to weave

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.420
it through a couple of layers of fabric.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.490
And close that safety pin just like that.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.230
And then that is going to be stitched into
my tube as I sew it right sides together.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.780
I’m going to bring this twine over and set
on the floor and feed off a bunch more.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.580
And away we go.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.310
Quarter inch seam allowance because that’s
generally what we’re doing this kind of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.470
stuff for.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.460
And now as I’m sewing my tube, I’m also
have that cording between my finger and my

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.820
thumb of my left hand.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:12.610
And I’m making sure I don’t stitch onto
the cord itself or onto the twine itself.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.849
And I am finished.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.930
Now the next phase of this, bring my twine
back to my table with me here.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.370
Is I’m going to start to slowly scoot the
fabric up the twine, just so that I have a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.909
little bit of it already pre-gathered here.

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.540
Now I’m going to make sure that that safety
pin dives into the tube and starts to take

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.540
the rest of it with it.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.599
So I’m pinching the safety pin with my left
hand, grabbing with my fingernails of my right

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:52.959
hand and starting to encourage that safety
pin to head on down.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.769
You really don’t want to pull the safety
pin off.

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.510
I’ve done it a couple of times in my life.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.170
So I’m just going to be nice and gentle
as I pull this.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.530
Now once I have a hold of this end of course,
like that, comes all the way out.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.590
So that is the easiest way I have ever found
to turn a tube.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.499
Wasn’t that a flash?

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:16.680
Whoa!

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.769
That doesn’t happen everyday!

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:30.909
We’ll see you next time at Man Sewing.
