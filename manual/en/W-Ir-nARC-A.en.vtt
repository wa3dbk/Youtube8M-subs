The Skin is our largest organ so I think it’s
crazy that we unknowingly subject it to foreign

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:21.629
chemicals. I recently started making my own
body wash using all natural ingredients so

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:26.468
I know exactly what goes into it, but it’s
also really fun because I get to switch up

00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:31.278
the smells using essential oils. Subscribe
and like if you want to learn how to make

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:33.268
your own natural body wash.

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:39.468
So Here’s how I make it: I’m taking ⅓
cup of raw honey and mixing it in a measuring

00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:46.628
cup with ⅓ cup of melted coconut oil and
15-20 drops of essential oil, depending on

00:00:46.628 --> 00:00:51.768
how strong you want it to smell. I’m using
sweet orange oil because i Love citrusy smells

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:57.418
and it pairs really well with honey and coconut.
I recommend Rose or Lavender for a more luxurious

00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:03.007
smell. For the Honey make sure that the label
says “raw,” “unpasteurized,” or “unfiltered”.

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:08.598
Raw honey will gently remove dirt and impurities
without stripping the skin of natural oils.

00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:13.508
The coconut oil acts as Skin softener and
has moisturizing effects that will help heal

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:19.368
dry skin. Be sure to use extra virgin, organic
oil. Make sure that the label doesn’t say

00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:25.167
“hydrogenated, refined, or bleached” in
any way. Next I’m slowly adding in ¾ cup

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:31.088
of castile soap. I recommend the Dr. Bronner's
Unscented Baby-Mild Castile Liquid Soap because

00:01:31.088 --> 00:01:36.218
it contains no fragrance and is and has olive
oil. Castile soap will give this body wash

00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:41.718
that sudsiness. It’s a natural soap that’s
made with vegetable oils. Now gently stir

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:50.968
everything with a spoon and be careful not
to whip too much air into it.

00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:55.887
Finally I’m just going to pour the mixture
into my glass soap dispenser and it’s ready

00:01:55.887 --> 00:02:13.137
for my next wash. Give this Natural Body Wash
a try and let me know what fragrance you’d

00:02:13.137 --> 00:02:24.928
choose. I’ll see you on the next Natural
Beauty. Bye!
