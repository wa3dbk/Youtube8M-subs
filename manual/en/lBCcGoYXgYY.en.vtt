00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Limited ticket sales

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.960
for the National Kapa Kaka
Secondary Competition in Whangarei

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.280
has cut the number of supporters
who planned to attend the event.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.920
But our cameras and reporter
Rapaera Tawhai were there

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.280
at the powhiri.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.120
A warm welcome
from the people of Ngapuhi.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.280
This is a very special
occasion for us Maori -

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.000
especially for us from the North.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.320
Every two years,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.280
14 regions come together to
battle it out for these trophies.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.880
There were a lot of complaints
over the limited tickets sold,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.480
but there is still a lot to do.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.440
We need to get this venue ready
for tomorrow's first session,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680
starting at 9am.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.480
They also celebrate the Maori
Language Week, starting today.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:34.520
We have informed our MCs
about this week.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.000
Throughout the week,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.120
the 44 schools behind
me will take the stage.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.920
There were supposed to be 48,
but four schools

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.320
from the South Island
could not make it.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.440
This is the biggest the competition
has been since its inception.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.320
Rapaera Tawhai, Te Karere.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.920
Rapaera will be in Whangarei
for the rest of the week,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.280
reporting on the Secondary
Kapa Haka Nationals.
