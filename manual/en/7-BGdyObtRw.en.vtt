00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:21.000
Today I will show you...
how to feed a small youngster,

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:27.000
so you donÂ´t loose it by a transport,
until the parents feed them again.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:33.000
Or if it is necessary, 
until they are old enough to eat alone.

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:53.000
As you can see, this is a tiny young pigeon, 
which is not yet drop off.

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:58.000
That we dont lose it during the transport,
I will show you how we feed it.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:15.000
It is important that the neck is straight, 
then you have to open to the beak for feeding,
the feeding only takes a few seconds.

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:53.000
Eat and drink until the evening.
