The Children of My Land and I


00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:18.116
Film by: 
Group of Marefat Middle School girls

00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:32.372
The roads of our city are full of children who play with stones and sticks.


00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:42.678
When I enter the gates of my school, I see my schoolmates who have come to learn, with great enthusiasm.


00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:48.102
"If anyone responds with the wrong answer, they get a minus point."


00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:49.815
"What does this word mean?" 


00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.145
"This letter means 'Nama'."


00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:52.163
"Good job!"


00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:54.041
"Give her a plus."


00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.093
"Merciful?"


00:00:55.113 --> 00:00:56.093
"Mehraban"


00:00:57.706 --> 00:01:01.536
This is our classroom where we study in it everyday. 


00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:09.470
When they finish the school day, a great number of these students go to workshops and stores


00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.750
In order to learn to work and earn money to help support their families.


00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:29.206
The night that the war began, we headed to Kabul and couldn't bring any of our clothing.


00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.521
Some people could not even get their shoes on and left their homes barefoot.


00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:37.263
Some of my classmates went to foreign countries and they worked outside.


00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.865
They have more to be worried about because they cannot study.


00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:44.855
Instead, they must work to support the rest of their family and parents at home.


00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:49.425
We were lucky in our homeland. We are not like that here because there isn't any good work.

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:54.785
I cannot earn enough money to help support my family. 


00:01:58.461 --> 00:01:59.851
"How much is this?"

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:00.528
"Hello"


00:02:00.528 --> 00:02:01.076
"Hello"

00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:02.794
"how much does it cost?"

00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:07.444
Ruhallah is one of the children who came to Kabul during the war.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.748
This is one of the camps for war refugees.


00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:29.204
Wali is a 13 year old boy who lives in this camp with the rest of his family.

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:33.364
Outside of studying, he is learning how to sew. 


00:02:51.023 --> 00:02:54.583
On TV, I always watch the news about war and conflict.


00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:59.801
I hope that one day our country will become peaceful.

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:06.711
So that the remaining seventy percent of girls and fifty percent of boys who do not currently go to school can also study like me.


00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:48.981
My friends and I have started an active group at school to discuss these different issues.


00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:53.544
"I think we should talk about the situation of the Afghan people…"


00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:57.024
"Yes… and also we should talk about the children..."


00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:06.159
"For example: those who are in good situations and those who are in bad situations."


00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.333
"For instance, boys from Helmand who have relocated here and are displaced from their homes..."


00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.795
"And then we can talk about kids who are in good situations. "


00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:24.709
"Those Afghan boys who have migrated, their displacement is very hard for their parents."

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:30.849
"I feel bad for migrant boys because they cannot study very well."


00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.440
"Our feelings are the same towards our own siblings and migrants brother and sisters."


00:04:38.368 --> 00:04:44.778
"They also work and study which shows their strength and self-sufficiency."


00:04:45.242 --> 00:04:50.842
"they have seen violence, so they should be depressed. But no!"

00:04:50.913 --> 00:04:59.453
"They are always positive and instead they work hard to rebuild their country and to make a bright future for themselves."


00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:10.671
We want to make a country with a future where nothing could harm it's children.
