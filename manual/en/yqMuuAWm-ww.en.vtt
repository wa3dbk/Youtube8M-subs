Hey everybody, this is Mark with
iappletech128 and today we’re going

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.250
to be reviewing the KnowRoaming
sticker and service. If you’ve ever traveled

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.321
abroad&nbsp;and used your phone, you’ll know
that it’s hard to find some carrier to use

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.790
your
phone with. You have to first find a good

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.320
carrier quickly, and then, depending on the
language in that country,&nbsp;try and tell

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.470
that person that you want
to get a SIM card. None of us like it and

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.449
that’s where KnowRoaming comes in.
This little sticker connects to your

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.279
SIM card and automatically switches
you to a local carrier once you arrive

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.020
in a different country. You just
add credit to your account within

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.240
the app, which means no more need
to find a grocery store that sells

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.700
prepaid phone credits. As you may
know, I go to Mexico every year

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.280
and using my phone there is a
pain. Luckily I speak Spanish fluently,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.520
but if you don’t, then trying to add credit
to your account could be painful.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.080
Here’s how it use to do it in
Mexico. First, I had to get a SIM

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.460
card, which is another story. Then
whenever I want to add more credit&nbsp;

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.630
to my account I just find a local OXXO,
a Mexican 7-Eleven. When they

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.560
say&nbsp;¿En qué le puedo servir? I just
respond with Más salad, pro favor.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.270
They’ll ask for your phone number and
how much you want to add and then

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.159
you’re all set. That&nbsp;can be a pain and
the ability to do all of this right

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.270
from the app with KnowRoaming&nbsp;is great. Before
you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.829
install the sticker you first want
to be warned that you will need an

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.890
unlocked device. This is basically a
second SIM card that you’re installing

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.049
and&nbsp;will need an unlocked device that supports
a carrier other than your’s. In the box

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.569
you will find everything you need, including
the push plug, SIM eject tool, and the sticker

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.399
in it’s application tray. KnowRoaming
works on most SIM cards, including nano,

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.780
micro, and mini SIM. For a nano you just
need&nbsp;to drop in the SIM card. For micro you

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.969
need to remove the light blue adapter.
For mini you need to remove the dark blue

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.170
adapter. To start,&nbsp;pull off the A tab on
the top

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.170
and&nbsp;using the SIM eject tool,
remove your SIM card. Drop in the card

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.539
and using the push plug press it tight
together for about 20 seconds. You might

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.529
also want to push around the edges to make
sure everything is stuck together because

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:08.289
when I pulled the B tab the sticker came off.
After that everything is ready to go.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.120
Pop in the SIM card and open the KnowRoaming
app. Just fill out the basic information,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.849
add credit,
and you’re good to go. It will also ask

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.689
if
you would like to subscribe&nbsp;to ReachMe. That

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.400
is a paid service that allows you to receive
calls

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.590
on your home SIM from numbers that you
purchased for other countries.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.941
During setup you’ll need to
know your sticker’s serial number. That

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.260
and more
information can be found within the phone

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.200
settings
in the settings apps. Scroll down to SIM

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.549
Applications and from there you can find
things like manually switching to KnowRoaming

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.370
by country, enabling or disabling auto switch,
which detects where you are located, viewing

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.470
your serial number, returning to your main
SIM,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.140
and more. Service overall was&nbsp;pretty good.
I had

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.340
good coverage and the speed was decent for
website loading. For some, data

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.500
may not work. You first have to
enable Data Roaming within your

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.760
cellular settings and everything will
work properly.&nbsp;You only get 3G data. There

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.920
is no LTE, but KnowRoaming says that
they’re working on it. Pricing per MB,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.110
minute, and text message does vary
based on your location, but in the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.860
U.S it’s $0.10 per MB. It&nbsp;also
costs $0.11 for every text message

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.310
and $0.09 per minute. Whenever you
use those services it just pulls from

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.069
the pot of money that you deposited
in your account. When switching back to

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.969
T-Mobile I did have a few problems. Many
times when loading a page on LTE

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.630
it would say that I had no internet service.
My only options were to reboot my

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.700
phone or wait until all of the services
kicked in, which took a fair amount of time.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.560
However, only once did a reboot work.
There was nothing I could do.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.739
If fact, every day when I turn my
phone on I have this problem.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.430
Overall, this is must have for anyone
who travels abroad. You can take care of

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.969
all of the tracking and payments right
in the app so it doesn’t matter what

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:54.409
the main language is where you're
at. It’s super easy to use and love it.

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.540
The only complaint I have is that
when switching back to your

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.430
home network there are some issues.
Also, there is&nbsp;the text at the top of your

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.890
screen&nbsp;that says Home, letting you know
when you’re on your home

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.209
or KnowRoaming SIM. It takes
up screen space and can be

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.080
annoying for some. The way
that I&nbsp;found to get rid of it was

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.909
to reboot my phone and it was
gone until I did anything with

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.690
KnowRoaming, such as activating it.
Again, I love this and will use it every

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.621
time I go to Mexico and highly
recommend it. But that’s all

00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.039
for this video. Thanks so much
for watching everybody. This

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.491
is Mark and I will see you
in the next one.
