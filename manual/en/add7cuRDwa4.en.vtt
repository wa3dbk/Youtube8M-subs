00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.610
It has been well over a decade since the original
Audi TT revolutionized the sports coupe convertible

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.990
market with concept art looks and plenty of
positives in it's arsenal.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.600
But while the first generation car left lasting
impression it was a little disappointing to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.360
drive and didn't prove particularly reliable.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.320
So Audi set out to right those wrongs with
this, the second generation TT.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.720
It remains one of the best selling sub thirty
thousand pounds sport cars on the market going

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.250
up against the Mercedes SLK, the BMW one series
coupe and Volkswagen Scirocco.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.710
Entry level model starts from 27000 pounds,
but the variety of engines and specifications

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.379
pushes our [xx] prices up to almost 50.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.690
The porpoise curves of the 1999 car has been
trimmed and toned into this more rugged design

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.329
with distinctive lines over the bonnet and
along the profile with the car.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.220
It's still clearly TT, but a more purposeful
looking base than it was before.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:15.600
There are three petroleum engines to choose
from, there is a one point eight, two litter

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.840
and two and a half litter average performance
expression and diesel.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.460
All models come with traction and stability
control.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.780
So, even front wheel drive versions offer
plenty of controlled driving thrills.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.009
You can choose from either a 6 speed manual
gear box or a six speed semi-automatic gear

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.009
box.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.000
We've got the [xx] semi-automatic gear box
in this car.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.860
It couples well with all the engine is bright.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.829
Its a well proven automatic system however
those looking for full sports car experience

00:01:47.829 --> 00:02:04.250
got a slicked manual gearbox If you looking
to pinch the pennies anyone would go far with

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.720
the TT and it is inferable with the spat amount
of equipment expanded.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.670
Take the example we've got here, it's well
equipped but it all comes at a prize.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.829
I've got the spec sheet here, so let's see
how much it costs.

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.360
Metallic paint, 410 pounds.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:27.250
Light and rain sensor package, 400 60 pounds,
magnetic right suspension - 1175 pounds, electric

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.900
front seats -740 pounds heating front seat
a hundred and fifty five pounds, leather seats

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.570
five hundred and sixty pounds, interior light
package a hundred and twenty five pounds,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.290
navigation and entertainment system one thousand
five hundred and twenty five pounds, automatic

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.959
S-tronic gearbox one thousand 480 pounds;
cruise control, 220 pounds; Bose surround

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.480
sound, 485 pounds; bringing the grand total
to 7,535 pounds.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.180
I mean, this is an almost 40 grand car.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.670
The combination of this sloping roof line
and low sport suspension means that you almost

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.780
have to replicate an accordion, just to get
seated.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.650
Once inside the TT, there is plenty of head
room for average-sized adults.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.329
There is an accommodating amount of shoulder
and elbow room as well.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.310
The sport seats we have here, grip your body
but still remain comfortable.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.760
However, bear mind, if you get the standard
seats, they aren't adjustable, which could

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.200
be a bit of an issue if you are a shorty like
me.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.490
The seats in the rear are pretty useless for
passengers.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.050
If you are an adult under five foot, then
you'll just about cope.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.199
Fitting a child seat would be a problem, due
to the lack of space and almost certainly

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.360
block the rear screen.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.660
So, if you're willing to overlook Those puny
rear seats, the super mini-size boot, and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.260
the lack of standard equipment, you'll struggle
to find a better sports car for the same price.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.440
The TT offers a truly sporting drive, with
a thoroughly brilliant range of powerful and

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.910
economical engines, and of course, those head
turning looks.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.850
