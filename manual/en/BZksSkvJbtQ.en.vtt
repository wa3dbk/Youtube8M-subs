00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:08.108
Expend or die.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.527
Get big or get out.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.283
I have a nice size farm.
Family home for four generations.

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.448
I am number one in seven counties,
including Boone, Decatur...

00:00:19.698 --> 00:00:22.539
- Dad's got Decatur. Took it last week.
- "Took" is a strong word.

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:28.336
I know your dad own two hundred acres.
I can take it of your hands.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.963
Get out of here.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.299
I can stand you kind of people.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.335
But I don't want to have to come back
to Iowa. Where do we sign?

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.266
I'm gonna give you your own stake
in the family farm.

00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:44.352
I'm not staying here dad.
I'm racing cars.

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:53.403
Why does he consistently
disrespect me?

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:56.156
If I like what I see today,
we'll give you one and only one shot.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.951
That foot is made of bliss.
It's gonna get you to NASCAR.

00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:04.581
You're not gonna make it
in the big leagues. Take the land!

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.458
It's in your blood.

00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:11.338
Don't you loose
what my daddy started.

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:13.803
I know you've been sleeping with her.
I love you,

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:16.343
and you make me feel like and idiot
for everyday.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.847
That was really impressive
on the track today.

00:01:21.964 --> 00:01:23.579
- I'm Meredith.
- I'm his girlfriend.

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:31.066
Henry Whipple? We've been
investigating you. We got a tip.

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.420
- Who gave you this tip?
- We need to visit your field.

00:01:35.278 --> 00:01:37.614
- Who could have done this?
- You didn't knock, did you?

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:38.907
Tell me who it was!

00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:40.617
You ruined me.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.801
- If they find out...
- ... we'll loose everything.

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:45.622
I don't know what to do.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.416
You're in trouble aren't you?

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.544
Call off the agents. Call 'em off!

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:05.665
Am I a happy man?

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:10.564
How could I not be?

00:02:13.184 --> 00:02:17.019
