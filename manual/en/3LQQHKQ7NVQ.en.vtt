Hi. I'm Elena. 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.020
Have you ever gone to make a muffin recipe or any other recipe calling for buttermilk only to find out you don't have enough?

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.479
The other thing with buttermilk is that it often comes in quart containers. 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:15.459
If you don't need that much, it often just sits in the refrigerator and goes to waste. 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:22.459
To get around that, what you can do is make a simple buttermilk substitute at home, using milk and lemon juice. White vinegar would also work in this recipe.

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:29.640
You can use fresh lemon juice or you can use a bottled variety. I prefer fresh because it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.350
always much more crisp, and it has a much more tart flavor. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.490
So you're going to squeeze the lemon juice into a separate container. 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.490
For one cup of buttermilk you will only need one tablespoon of lemon juice. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.820
So one tablespoon of lemon juice will go into the measuring cup for one cup of the milk. 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.540
I use skim milk because that's what we use in my house, 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.549
but if you use 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.930
whole milk, 2%, regular milk, that's fine

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.390
So you have your one tablespoon of lemon juice in the measuring cup, 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.540
and you're going to fill up with milk 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.320
until the one cup 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.320
mark on your measuring cup.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.900
okay

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.900
When you're measuring, you always look at eye level to make sure the liquid is perfectly even with the line. We're good.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.850
Now you're going to let this stand for five minutes, then we'll come back and see what this is going to look like. It will have curdled, which is what the buttermilk

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.360
is, it's essentially curdled milk.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.930
Ok, I'll be back in five minutes. 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.570
Ok, so 5 minutes have passed, and we have buttermilk! It was much easier than running to the supermarket, and much quicker too.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.570
So out buttermilk is ready. We let it stand for five minutes. That was our combination of one cup of any type of milk and one tablespoon lemon juice or white vinegar. 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.240
We can just take a look at this buttermilk. It's now nice and thick, we can 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.180
mix it up a little bit.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.260
You see that the density has increased; it's much thicker and it has the curdles in it that it didn't have before. 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.370
You see once again it has curdles, 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.200
It's got some thickness to it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.339
This is perfect for any recipe that may call for buttermilk

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:17.309
Fried chicken, muffins, any recipe that you make with buttermilk.
