Before we get started knitting the brim, I'm
just going to talk about different brims that

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.530
can be on the bottom of your hat. So, you
can have a knit one, perl one. Again, we do

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.160
these because they're more elastic. So, this
is knit one, perl one, and I'm going to show

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.110
you how to do that. Then, there can be knit
two, perl two which these are the same number

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.010
of stitches cast on. You can see that's even
tighter than the first. So, if you stretch

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.110
that out, you see it's knit two, perl two,
knit two, perl two, but when it lies flat,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.440
it's tighter than that, and then this is a
rolled rim. So, this is where I knit a row,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.440
perl a row which is stockinette and stockinette
left to its own devices is just going to curl

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.309
up like that. So, with a hat, you can do a
rolled rim where you just keep knitting and

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.589
knitting. You can do knit two, perl two. You
can do knit one, perl one. You can do any

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.510
combination you like. So, with the ribbing,
what you're going to do; is you're going to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.031
knit one stitch, then you have to bring your
yarn in front and perl a stitch and then your

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:12.960
yarn goes in back. Knit a stitch, yarn goes
in front, perl a stitch and if I kept on that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.530
way, you can see the very beginnings of it;
knit perl, knit perl. The knit if flat and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.530
the perl has a little bump on it like it's
wearing a scarf. So, that would end up growing

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.960
up to be like this. If I were to do knit two,
perl two, it would be knit two and it's always

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.930
a little bit tight on this first row easing
those stitches in, and then it would be perl

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.010
two, and again, knit two and the rib won't
start to pull together for a few rows, and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.049
you would continue and do that across the
row. Okay, but we're not going to do all of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.929
these different rib treatments on one hat.
I just wanted to give an example. So, here

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.249
you can see, you've got two knit stitches,
two flat stitches next to each other. Then,

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.270
two perls; you see that bump against the needle;
two knits, two perls and after a few rows,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.360
that would become like this-this version right
here.
