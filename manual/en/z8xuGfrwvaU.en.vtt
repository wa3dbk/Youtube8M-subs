00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.840
Okay!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.500
So all I'm saying is..

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.260
You don't actually have any ice attacks that hurt me!

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.540
Yes I do!

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.620
Name ONE!

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.340
My ice slide!

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.020
Okay

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.180
That's just YOU sliding on the ice to hurt me...

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.220
The ice doesn't actually hurt me.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.640
But you said ice attacks!!

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.540
And I slide on the ice to hurt you...

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.100
Which is exactly what you said!

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.000
It's STILL an ice attack!

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.980
NOT REALLY!

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.820
I mean you don't use the ice as a solid object to hurt me with for some reason!

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.940
But that's not what you said!

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.900
You just hold me still long enough to where you can hit me!

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.760
Are you gonna get the door, or not?!

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.140
I'M GETTING THE DOOR

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.360
Jesus of God Almighty!

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.420
I swear to God if it's another Mormon I'm gonna kill em!

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.380
I thought I told you people!!

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.180
Trick or Treat!

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.180
OH MY GOD

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.240
It's an imp midget!!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.680
Sub-Zero!

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.060
Get away from the window!!

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.180
There are imp midgets surrounding the house!

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.680
What the hell's wrong with you?!

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.920
I'm sorry!

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.160
Imp "little people" are surrounding the house..

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.720
Did you forget what today was again??

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800
..What if I did?!

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.940
It's Halloween!

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.040
You know..? With Skeletons..

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.780
Black Cats

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.420
Pumpkins!

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.220
I kicked a kid in the face again didn't I?!

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.080
Yeah and if you gave them candy you wouldn't need to.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.820
Why would I give them candy?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.060
Because they'll ring your doorbell until you do...

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.720
It's REALLY annoying..

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.220
So what you're saying is..

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.920
..to repel children..

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.280
Use Candy!

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.860
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.580
I gotta try that right now!

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.080
What..?

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.760
What just happened..?!

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.620
ALRIGHT

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.860
Trick or Treat!!

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.240
What the crap?!

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.000
I mean..

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.080
What are you supposed to be little girl?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.340
I'm a BOY!

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.920
What a strange depiction of a BOY you have on there.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.960
I'm a MONKEY!

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.760
OOO OOO AAH AAH AAH

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.000
Right..

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.000
Well here's some candy..

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.120
Well, what a..

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120
Trick or Treat..

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.660
How old are you..?

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.580
Eleven..

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.700
Eleven..?

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.300
That's AMAZING!!

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.240
You are HUGE!!!

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.520
You ever thought about getting into Kombat?!

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.000
Yeah.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.820
Well how big are you gonna be in a year?!

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.420
You're gonna be like 500 pounds!

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.440
Well I am taking Karate classes..

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.220
Well that's a start!

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.660
Lets see what you know!

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.400
FIGHT

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.260
Toasty!

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.240
Whoops!

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.100
So what'd you learn about Halloween this year?

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.160
You gotta hit the kid hard enough..

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.700
To where he doesn't remember what happened!

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.160
I don't think that that-

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.500
What were we doing?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.840
Why am I in the living room..?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.560
Just like that.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.680
Where are you going?!

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.760
You got it!

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.340
I have a headache all of the sudden..
