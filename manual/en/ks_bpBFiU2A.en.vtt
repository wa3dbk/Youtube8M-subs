Hi and you're watching Sign of the Week and this week 
 I am going to teach you how to ask somebody

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:10.042
if they have plans tomorrow, or what they are doing tomorrow

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:14.083
In case you want to hang out or find out 
 what they are doing or something.  So,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
how you sign what are you doing tomorrow, now

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in American Sign Language it's topic/comment right?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
unlike English where it's comment/topic

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so sign language the topic of this is tomorrow

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958
so you sign tomorrow first, this is tomorrow

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500
which is an A hand and you do it on your cheek

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.750
tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Now

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:41.083
now in sign language, time is where you are standing

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500
is the present.  The future is in front of you

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:50.625
and the past is behind you right? So that

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.167
Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.333
makes sense.  So for tomorrow you are going into the future

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:03.417
so tomorrow, and in American Sign Language, for the 
 topic of the sentence you raise your eyebrows

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.667
to give you another clue that that is the topic of the sentence.

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:11.542
So tomorrow right you raise your eyebrows when you sign it

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.458
and this is the sign it's like do

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:20.083
it's like D-O do

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:23.417
so you do do.  So tomorrow

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.833
what are you doing.  And you raise your eyebrows

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958
for the tomorrow and you lower your eyebrows for the "what are you doing"

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:37.042
that are who what where when how why which

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.125
because it's a WH question right?  All WH questions

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.830
get lowered eyebrows

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:43.710
ok? So you're kind of gonna get an eyebrow work out with this

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:47.790
cause you do                   
                what are you doing tomorrow?

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:01.920
and for this you can do two times I usually do three times

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:03.040
doesn't really matter

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:05.040
just as long as you do it at 
 least 2 times I guess.  So,

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:11.790
That's how you ask somebody what they are doing tomorrow.

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.960
Alright, practice and I will see you next week.
