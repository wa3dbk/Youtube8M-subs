00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.789
As far as 'extreme' sports go, motocross manages
to simultaneously combine something familiar

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.449
and already dangerous (motorcycling) and give
it a rough, dirty and at times, spectacular

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.710
edge to its antics. No wonder we've already
seen developers try to capture the spirit

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.600
of skill and insanity that comes with using
a motocross bike, but if one game truly stands

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.490
out of late it's Trials HD on the 360. Similar
concepts have made their way on to the App

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.370
Store in the past (Moto X Mayhem), but Xtreme
Wheels by Bravo Games Studio cuts straight

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.030
to the chase by pulling what can only be described
as a 'Gameloft'.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.730
In each of the 20 industrial-themed levels
you'll have to keep your stunt-driver alive

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.460
as he attempts to navigate his way across
terrain that's far from traditional - I think

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.550
it's safe to say that explosive barrels are
generally not included in most motocross stunt

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.620
competitions. While the game is presented
in 3D, you only have to control your biker

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.219
in two dimensions with buttons to accelerate,
brake and touch/slide/tilt controls for changing

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.329
the balance of the bike. At first it's easy
to get carried away as you jab the accelerator

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.670
in an attempt to clock the fastest times possible,
but once the tutorial levels are over the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.860
game takes a serious shift in gears.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.560
Trophies are awarded for your final times,
though treating tracks like a race will see

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.650
you reloading at checkpoints over and over,
killing any opportunity you may have had at

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.860
even a silver cup. Precision, balance and
careful maneuvering are needed to overcome

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.250
the dangerous series of ramps, gaps and rough
terrain in each level, which is further complicated

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.920
by the rider having glass bones that cause
him to pass out at the slightest brush with

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.950
anything that isn't a motocross bike. This
leads to some very frustrating moments as

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.509
an otherwise perfect run is scuttled by a
low-speed tap to the back of the head as you

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.900
roll over a ledge, though more frustrating
than this are the handful of checkpoints that

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.189
place you in almost impossible positions,
requiring a full restart to correct.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.400
While graphics aren't everything, there's
no getting around the fact that Xtreme Wheels

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.409
is a rather gorgeous game, complete with detailed
environments and shaders that make the game

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.720
really pop on fourth gen devices. Sadly there
are some performance problems on the 3GS (2nd

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.360
gen and lower are not supported), which severely
limits the accessibility of the game until

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.290
updates resolve these issues.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.189
Xtreme Wheels may be little more than a challenging
physics-flaunting time-trial title, but it

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.269
pulls things off with a flair and style that's
not the standard for iOS games (though not

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.590
unfamiliar on the 360). If you enjoyed Trials
HD and you're itching for some challenging

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.579
stunt-driving, give Xtreme Wheels a look.
