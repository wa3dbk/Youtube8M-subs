This is a video on how to install an adapter in a Euro-profile 
 mortise lock so it can be used with an American cylinder. 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:16.635
A Euro-profile multipoint or mortise lock has an opening like this for 
 the cylinder. The euro-profile cylinder fits perfectly in the hole.

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:24.765
We're going to install an adapter to fit the hole and engage the lock. 
 But it will allow us to use an american cylinder, like this. 

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:31.242
The first thing you need to do is unscrew 
 the cylinder screw and set it aside.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:39.478
Then, unscrew the machine screw on the adapter—you'll need 
 an 8/32 hex wrench to do this.

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:53.671
At this point, you can take the adapter apart—it comes apart in three 
 pieces: the cam, the thin cover plate and the thicker housing.

00:00:55.071 --> 00:01:02.043
Take the thin cover plate and set the cam assembly so the cam, the part 
 that sticks out, is facing down. Set it in the cylinder hole. 

00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:05.221
The cover plate has a lip that sits outside the lock. 

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:12.222
Once the cam assembly is in, use a flat-tipped screwdriver to turn the 
 cam assembly so the cam is facing up in the lock. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.572
From the other side of the lock, insert the housing.

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.943
From the cover plate side, loosely install the machine screw.

00:01:35.347 --> 00:01:42.690
Install the cylinder screw through the faceplate of the lock. Once 
 you've installed the cylinder screw, tighten the machine screw. 

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:53.310
The lock is now ready for installation.
