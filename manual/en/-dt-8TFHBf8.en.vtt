Insta'd!

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:08.940
So you probably heard recently that Instagram
came out with official profiles on websites.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.120
This is a big development especially for brands
who are on the network and trying to get people

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.080
to follow them over there. It's a lot easier
to do that now with web presence versus strictly

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.890
mobile.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.140
Also, Instagram added the ability to have
an official Instagram badge on your website

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.820
that will link to your web profile. This makes
it a lot easier for your site visitors to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.199
see that you're there and easily be able
to click over and follow.

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.539
So today we're talking about how to get
that official Instagram badge so that you

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.749
can get a jump on having even more people
follow your photos.

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:50.749
First, in your browser head to Instagram.com
and then scroll down to "Your Account"

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:52.709
where you'll be able to log in.

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:57.499
Once you've reached your profile, you will
see a section that says "Badges". Click

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.609
that link.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.159
Instagram does a nice job of laying out how
to go about the process as well here but basically

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.810
you just have to click the icon that you would
like to see on your website and then copy

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.979
the code that appears beneath it.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.689
Now you're gonna go to the backend of your
website, wherever it is that you usually add

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.950
items to your sidebar or wherever your social
links are. For Wordpress this is in the "Widgets"

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.259
section.

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.729
We're gonna choose a text widget, which
is how you properly insert HTML code and that

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.429
is where you're gonna drag it over to where
you want it and paste the code.

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.009
Save that widget and then refresh and you
now have an official Instagram button on your

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:37.850
website.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.929
