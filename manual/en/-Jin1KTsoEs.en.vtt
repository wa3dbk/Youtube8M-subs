00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:06.408
(playful music)

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:39.779
- Hey everyone, how's it going?

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:43.262
So welcome back to another
one of my DIY videos.

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:44.864
In today's video I'm going to show you

00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:47.000
how to make halter tops.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.669
I was inspired from a
very very very hot day

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:52.457
I felt gross, I felt yucky

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:54.374
and I just wanted to rip my shirt off

00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:56.316
but that would be very inappropriate.

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:59.527
So I thought about
making my own halter top

00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:01.222
and then this idea came to mind.

00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:05.425
It was just a very very super easy idea

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:07.166
and I thought about showing you guys

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.022
how to make a sew and a no sew method.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:12.878
So anybody out there who wants to design

00:01:12.878 --> 00:01:14.202
and make their own tops

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:16.059
this is perfect for you guys.

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.195
And I had fun with my designs.

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:21.092
I added some pom poms
and also some feathers.

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:22.352
You can switch up the material

00:01:22.352 --> 00:01:24.488
and make it into a party top.

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:25.997
Alright, so before we get started

00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:28.644
if you ladies are wondering
what I wore underneath

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:30.873
or if I wore anything underneath

00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:32.591
I didn't, no just kidding.

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:35.122
I did and I wore this.

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:37.537
You can actually find this on eBay

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:39.905
and also pasties that I recommend

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:41.461
for any of you ladies out there

00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.340
that want to cover up your goods.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.080
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.512
Alright guys, so let's get
started with materials.

00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:52.137
You are going to need some fabric

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:56.990
and I will be using this
piece that is 21 x 21 inches.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.846
Next I will be using some suede cord

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:02.539
and you can use ribbon too if you like.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.465
For designs I will be
using some pom pom trims

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:09.349
and also some wooden beads and feathers.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.913
You should have fun
with the design process

00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:13.585
and use whatever you like.

00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:14.955
Be creative with this.

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:17.370
All of my tutorials are designed for you

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.552
to personalize and customize it.

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:20.806
If you are not sewing

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.407
then this is a great
permanent fabric glue to use.

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:26.402
I found this from my local
Jo-Ann's Fabric Store.

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:30.651
Next if you have a sewing
machine then take that out.

00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:34.548
Okay, so to start this
tutorial you are going to need

00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:38.309
a cut piece of fabric
that is 21 x 21 inches.

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:39.749
The way I figured out my measurement

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.164
was that I folded my fabric into half

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:43.882
and then I took out a top

00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:45.855
that was not too loose or too tight

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.365
and that fits me well enough.

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:51.312
Then I just placed it on top
of the folded fabric like so.

00:02:51.312 --> 00:02:54.702
From there I was able to determine
how wide I need my fabric

00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:57.442
and so this is what I came up with.

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:01.291
So this right here is an
example on what I did.

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:03.595
And after I figured out my measurements

00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:06.474
I have it folded again, I lay my top out

00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:10.092
with my sharpie I took that
and trace along the arm hole

00:03:10.092 --> 00:03:13.273
and neckline to give myself
some sort of reference.

00:03:13.273 --> 00:03:14.527
Once you're done tracing

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.316
you should have something like this.

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:20.889
So once you finish tracing out
the arm hole and the neckline

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.251
take out some pins and pin
the fabric together like so.

00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:27.712
Okay, so after you finish pinning

00:03:27.712 --> 00:03:30.731
what you're going to do next
is cut about half an inch

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:32.913
away from the trace line.

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:35.908
I forgot to cut half an
inch away from the edge

00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:38.114
of the tracing line, but I highly suggest

00:03:38.114 --> 00:03:39.461
for you to do so.

00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:41.388
So make sure you give half an inch

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.055
between the tracing line
that you just drew out

00:03:44.055 --> 00:03:47.114
and from where you will be cutting.

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:52.134
Right here what I'm doing is
cutting out little triangles.

00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:54.244
Just little tiny small triangles

00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.426
that are less than a half inch

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:59.282
so that way I can fold
down the curved line.

00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:03.472
So as you see I am only doing
this along the curved line

00:04:04.532 --> 00:04:06.612
Now it's time to press down the raw edges.

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:10.025
So along every cut line that you just made

00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:12.765
what you're going to do is
fold it down half an inch

00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:15.574
into the wrong side, just like so

00:04:15.574 --> 00:04:18.500
and press it with a hot iron.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.427
So as you can see, after snipping off

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.633
the little triangles along the curved line

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:25.233
it makes it a lot easier
to fold down the fabric

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:26.580
and the press it down.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.597
Okay, so after pressing
in all the raw edges

00:04:30.597 --> 00:04:33.012
what you're going to
do now is take the glue

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:36.100
and apply a nice line of glue under

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.443
where you pressed in
that half inch of fabric.

00:04:39.443 --> 00:04:41.556
This way your fabric won't fray apart

00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:45.312
and all the edges will look
clean and professional.

00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:47.361
What I would recommend for you to do

00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:49.102
is leave the corner sides,

00:04:49.102 --> 00:04:50.681
you know the two sides where you will be

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.003
tying a string together in the back.

00:04:53.003 --> 00:04:54.814
Leave those corners unglued.

00:04:54.814 --> 00:04:57.786
That would be the only area
you do not need to glue.

00:04:57.786 --> 00:04:59.992
If you have a sewing machine
and would like to use that

00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:01.873
then please do take that out

00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:04.984
and basically all you have
to do is sew where I glued.

00:05:04.984 --> 00:05:06.536
It's that easy.

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:08.413
As for the neckline, what I'm going to do

00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:12.987
is fold it inward about one
inch to one and a half inches.

00:05:12.987 --> 00:05:15.286
Fold that in and then press it down

00:05:15.286 --> 00:05:18.629
and once you have that pressed
you can take a string out

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.157
that can be between 45 to 50 inches long.

00:05:23.157 --> 00:05:27.662
I cut mine 45 inches long
and I'm using a suede cord

00:05:27.662 --> 00:05:29.682
but you can also use a ribbon,

00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:32.445
whatever you have or
whatever you prefer to use.

00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:35.899
Now with fabric glue,
glue the opening together.

00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:38.296
To add a personal touch, what I'm doing is

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.827
adding on some pom pom trimmings

00:05:40.827 --> 00:05:42.499
to the bottom of this top.

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:45.726
This is super cute, I found
this from Jo-Ann's Fabric Store

00:05:45.726 --> 00:05:47.787
and I just love how it turned out.

00:05:50.248 --> 00:05:53.145
(playful music)

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:59.582
Okay, so let's work on the
ties for the back of the top.

00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:02.797
So I cut out a set of 14 inches

00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:05.932
long strings for each top

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:09.461
and what I'm going to do is
glue it into the corners.

00:06:09.461 --> 00:06:12.433
Remember that corner I told
you to not glue together?

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:15.684
Well this is it, the two
corners on the side of the top.

00:06:15.684 --> 00:06:18.702
So what you're going to do
is take an end of your string

00:06:18.702 --> 00:06:22.092
and glue it between the fabrics like so.

00:06:22.092 --> 00:06:24.530
Now this glue is very strong and permanent

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.550
but if you feel like
you need extra security

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.338
and you don't have a sewing machine

00:06:28.338 --> 00:06:31.937
then you can use a needle and thread

00:06:31.937 --> 00:06:34.538
and just sew it together
to give you extra security.

00:06:35.368 --> 00:06:36.990
If you do have a sewing machine

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.202
then just put it between the fabric

00:06:38.202 --> 00:06:40.757
and sew it back and
forth a couple of times.

00:06:40.757 --> 00:06:42.544
So that is pretty much it.

00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:45.609
All you have to do now is
just decorate your string.

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:47.978
What I usually like to
do is add on some beads

00:06:47.978 --> 00:06:50.996
and then I would tie a
loose little knot at the end

00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:52.645
tuck my feather end

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:56.731
add in or dab in a little bit
of the permanent fabric glue

00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:57.985
and then tighten the knot

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:00.627
and it should hold the feather in place.

00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:08.526
Alrighty guys, that is it for today.

00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:09.780
I hope you enjoyed this video

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.543
if you do, don't forget
to give it a thumbs up

00:07:12.543 --> 00:07:14.517
I would greatly appreciate it.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.396
And also I made a couple
extra of these halter tops

00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:19.021
so if you would like to win one

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:21.483
I am giving them away on Twitter.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:24.246
Other than that, I make
new videos every week

00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:26.103
