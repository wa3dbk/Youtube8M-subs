00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.236
(classical music)

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.873
- [Voiceover] We're in the
Mauritshuis in the Hague,

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:09.776
and we're looking at probably
their most famous painting.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.778
This is Vermeer's "Girl
with a Pearl Earring."

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.380
- [Voiceover] Well, I
would say not just their

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.316
most well-known painting, but maybe

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:17.752
one of the most well-known
paintings generally.

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:19.920
- But only recently.
- [Voiceover] True.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.455
- [Voiceover] It's a
painting that really seems

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.557
to have ascended in the late 20th century,

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:26.126
and it's interesting how
our society picks out

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.762
certain paintings for fame
and that people really

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.832
fall in love with, and
perhaps it's because

00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:33.100
this was the centerpiece of a film,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.235
this was the centerpiece of a novel,

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.438
and perhaps because we know
so little about the painting.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.073
- [Voiceover] And it's
interesting that this is

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.642
sometimes referred to
as the Dutch Mona Lisa.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.712
In both cases, we have
bust-length portraits of women

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.981
in rather indeterminate backgrounds.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.083
Now, we should be careful here, because

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.486
this may look like a portrait to us,

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.054
but, in fact, it's not a portrait.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.623
The Mona Lisa is, though, for a

00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:57.291
long time her identity wasn't known.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.859
Now, we are pretty confident we know

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:59.994
who the Mona Lisa was.

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:02.257
But, in this case, this is not a portrait.

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:04.297
- [Voiceover] This is
known as a tronie, that is,

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.133
a representation of a character,

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.502
of a particular type of person.

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:10.270
The way that we have, for instance,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.506
in modern American situation comedies,

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.441
you have the villain, you have the hero,

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.294
you have a certain type of person.

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:20.080
- [Voiceover] And we think
this is a exotic type,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.382
because of her turban and her clothing

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.894
seems foreign, and also that rather

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:26.119
over-sized pearl earring.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.822
- [Voiceover] And the way
that we see her from the side,

00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:29.790
but she turns towards us, and so

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.424
there's something
momentary, there's something

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.262
very alluring, that we're
not addressing her directly.

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:35.996
- [Voiceover] And it's a
lot like the Mona Lisa.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:38.632
In both cases, we have
gazes that seem enigmatic.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:41.201
What are they thinking? Who are they?

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.336
What is our relationship to her?

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.838
They're both paintings that really

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.674
open up possibilities for interpretation

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.943
with no one correct answer.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.578
- [Voiceover] So much so
that somebody was able

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.280
to produce an entire novel based on

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.683
this single painting that
we know so little about.

00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:57.984
What we do know about
this painting, though,

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.487
is that it's technique is
really quite extraordinary.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.689
The subtlety of light is stunning,

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.825
in the way in which the
reflectivity of the pearl

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.227
is cast against the darkness of her neck.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.263
- [Voiceover] The softness
of her features and also

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:12.032
the harmonies of those blues and golds.

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:14.301
- [Voiceover] Now, we know that
Vermeer worked very slowly.

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.769
Some art historians have suggested that

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.872
he only produced perhaps two
or three paintings a year.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:22.175
And that his technique
was really painstaking.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.810
And we can see that in the care in which

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.180
he's creating form out of light.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.848
- [Voiceover] But it's
so momentary, just like

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:29.983
we look at Dutch landscapes and we have

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.918
a sense of the passage of time

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.187
as the clouds move across the landscape.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.889
Here we have that same sense of a figure

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.092
who's just turned her head and is about

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:40.528
to speak with us or is about to engage us,

00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:42.062
but we don't know what about.

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:44.064
- [Voiceover] And that our
eyes are just in the process

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:46.967
of focusing on her as she meets our gaze.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.936
And so we are complicit in this moment.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.639
And I think the subtlety of color

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.842
and the subtlety of
light, the intimacy here,

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:56.009
all of that, allows us to register

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.879
this very personal moment, and perhaps

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.783
this is why this painting is so beloved.

00:03:00.783 --> 00:03:04.517
