00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.000
Hi. It’s Mr. Andersen. And this is AP Physics
essentials video 111. It is on interference

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.430
patterns which will always occur if we have
a number, 2 or more, wave fronts that are

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.939
interacting. An this French astronomer, Jean-Baptiste
Le Bouquin is showing how interference patterns

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.079
could be formed in a pool. He is moving his
hands back and forth and you are getting these

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.489
interference pattern in front and behind him.
To kind of show you what those look like,

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.320
image in these are his two hands that are
shaking. They are creating these wave fronts.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.989
And what will happen is as those wave fronts
interact you will have these troughs, in other

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.140
words areas where waves are destructive interference.
In other words they are canceling each other

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.300
out. In other words the waves a literally
going away. And they you will have these areas

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.309
where you have these mountains of waves where
they are being increased. And so we get these

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.320
interference patterns that are important in
not only sound waves, water waves but especially

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.129
light waves. And so wave diffraction remember
occurs if we ever have waves hitting a gap,

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.950
where that gap is around the size of the wavelength.
You get this diffraction pattern. We learned

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.510
about that in the last video. But let’s
say you have two slits that are about the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.800
size of the wavelength, what you get are these
double diffraction patterns. And you will

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.660
build these interference patterns where they
come together. And so a great example of this

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.880
that you could see in the science lab would
be the monochromatic double slit. So when

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.050
you are shining light through these two slits,
you will actually get these bands of light.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.170
Sometimes it is bright and sometimes it is
canceling itself out. And so remember wave

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.790
interference occurs if we ever have two waves,
in this case, that are matching each other

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.150
as far as their phase goes. They are in phase
with each other. What will happen is this

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.450
one is going up. This one is going up. And
so the constructive interference will be going

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.210
really high up. And so you have these waves,
that when they hit each other they make much

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.030
larger waves. We are adding those waves together.
But we could also have waves that are out

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.560
phase. And what happens is they completely
cancel each other out. And so an interference

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.660
pattern is caused by that. So you could see
these areas right here are going to be where

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.890
we have that destructive interference. And
then we are going to have constructive interference

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.010
in the middle. And so this is the double slit
experiment. What we have is a PHET simulation.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.060
We have a sheet in the back that is shining
the light. And then we are going to measure

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.630
the amount of light that is coming. So we
are generating a certain type of light. Now

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.920
you can see as the wave fronts hit the back
it is kind of varying. But we have on that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.090
screen in the back, it would be pretty much
uniform. Now if we add one slit what happens

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.970
is what you might think happens. We have diffraction
going on. And so near the center on that sheet

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.450
in the back we are seeing really bright light.
And then as we move out from that it is kind

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.880
of dropping off. Which makes sense, we are
getting this mountain peak. But watch what

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.740
happens when we add two slits now. As we add
two slits that is not just one mountain. What

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.250
we get are these areas where you have constructive
interference, so we have a huge amount of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.760
light. But then, I mean this is interesting.
Right here, this is directly across from that

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.030
one slit, it is completely devoid of light.
And so that shows us these interference patterns.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.300
And so did you learn to qualitatively apply
the wave model to describe these interference patterns?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:30.200
I hope so. And I hope that was helpful.
