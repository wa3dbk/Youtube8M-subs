00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.720
So, now we're going to go over some basics
of the harness and how to put it on. This

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.670
is your basic sit harness. It's made out of
nylon like most of the ropes used in rock

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.500
climbing. It's got some basic parts here.
It's got the leg loops which go around your

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.100
legs, the waist belt which is going to go
around your base, your waist. Some other points

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.730
to be aware of is the belay loop. This is
kind of a power point. This is your attachment

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.359
to everything you're going to be attached
to. Then, it's got these gear loops which

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.950
we use for attaching any gear that you're
going to use later on when you're climbing.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.739
Now, the way this is designed is so that when
you fall the rope is going to get you here

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.660
and the leg loops are going to catch your
legs so that the fall is as comfortable as

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.291
it can be. They used to use just things called
swami belts which is basically tying the rope

00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:52.399
around your waist. You can imagine if you
fell and it was only tied around your waist

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.570
how uncomfortable and even dangerous that
could be. Now we're going to put on the harness.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.920
So, you can see it naturally falls into, you
can imagine how that's going to go on, the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.190
leg loops and the waist belt. So you're pretty
much going to hold it out. Step one leg through.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:17.000
It's kind of like putting on underwear. You
just pull it up. Make sure every thing's comfortable.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.960
Then, you're going to want to tighten this
waist belt as tight as it comfortably can

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:35.400
be. And on this design, these clasps right
here make the process of double backing irrelevant.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.190
What you would do on an old fashioned harness
is when it was through this, you would actually

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.500
take your nylon loop and put it back through
so that it looks like that. And that's when

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.800
it was safe. But, on most modern harnesses
they've got these auto double backers. So

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.140
it, just the belt goes through once, comes
through and it's automatically fastened. It's

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.360
not going to go anywhere. You want to tighten
up over the hips. So, if you were going to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.050
go upside down, you're not going to come out
of it. The same thing with the leg loops.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.170
The tighter those are the more comfortable
it's going to be to hang in your harness.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.140
Which is important if you fall off or if you
want to repel down.
