Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns dot com.
My brother just came back from Sedona, Arizona.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.270
He got enamored by kaleidoscopes that he saw
there.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.390
Now, I've had a couple of kaleidoscope kits
on hand, for a long time but I haven't gotten

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.970
around to it. Here they are -- I finally got
around to it. These are mini kaleidoscopes.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.270
I'd love to have you see inside but the aperture
is a little bit small. Hold them up and you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.260
twist them, and see the colors change -- beautiful
patterns -- fascinating to watch.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.649
Let's make a mini kaleidoscope.
The instructions for this mini kaleidoscope

00:00:50.649 --> 00:01:00.060
kit specify a 2" square blank that is 2 3/8"
long. Actually, anything over about 1" would

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.380
do. I'm comfortable with my kaleidoscopes
finishing out at about 1 ½" in diameter.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.660
I glued up some walnut and padauk for these
blanks.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.230
With the blank ready the first step is to
drill the center hole with a 13/16" forstner

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:25.620
bit. Why 13/16? Maybe to sell more bits. I
drilled mine on the lathe. I put a small scrap

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.970
of wood behind the blank to avoid drilling
into my chuck when the bit broke thru the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.349
other end.
Then trim the blank to 2 ¼" in length and

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:43.500
mount to a pen mandrel with "special" mini
kaleidoscope bushings. I have a set of bushings

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.179
but if I had to do it over again, I'd turn
mine from scrap wood -- no need for these

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.209
unless you're making a lot of mini kaleidoscopes.
The mini kaleidoscope is shorter than a standard

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:00.670
pen; so a spacer is required to fill in the
slack space on the mandrel. Please make your

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.750
own wood spacer -- best while you make your
bushings.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.440
With such a short piece of wood, there's not
a lot of room for decoration. On this walnut,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.170
I'll put a bead on each end. It's time for
a little bead practice anyway. The padauk

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.879
will be plain to let the wood speak for itself.
This project is probably an excellent candidate

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.650
for a multi-wood glue up. Other than the beads,
I'm aiming for an egg shape with the large

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:48.900
end being opposite the eye piece. My personal
preference.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.730
Then I'll sand up thru 400 grit and finish
with beeswax and mineral oil. I chose this

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.430
finish over shellac because it will be handled
a lot and I can easily renew the finish.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.349
The challenge is in the assembly. The instructions
are fairly detailed -- so I tried my best

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.450
to actually read and follow them.
First are the mirrors. These are front surface

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.620
mirrors. They are small and hard to hold.
I did better with my second set so that's

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.530
the one I'm showing. I'm using the tube as
a holder to assemble the mirrors. Then, sliding

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.629
them out a little to wrap a little bit of
tape. The idea is to not let them rattle inside

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.980
the metal tube. Next I blackened the cut ends
of the glass per the instructions..

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.620
Next the eyepiece. The convex side of the
lens goes into the eyepiece. But on such a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.420
small piece, which is the convex side? Then
a retaining ring to hold the lens in place.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:57.749
On my two kits, the retaining ring was too
small. I had to stretch it open for it to

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:03.189
function properly.
Then the little gems into the other end. The

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.950
instructions say to not overfill. My first
kaleidoscope is a bit too full, the gems do

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:23.400
not move as much.
Finally, insert the end pieces into the turning

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.889
and screw it all together. Not too difficult,
actually. But here's my biggest tip. Don't

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.780
do the assembly in the shop -- it's impossible
to eliminate all the dust. I'll be taking

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.750
mine apart again to give them a good cleaning.
Maybe I can find a class 10 clean room.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.550
Voila, now I have a couple of mini kaleidoscopes.
They really are a simple and easy project.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.830
It takes more time to get the kits and wood
than to actually turn the body. The 2" blank

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.740
is overkill unless you really want a fat kaleidoscope.
