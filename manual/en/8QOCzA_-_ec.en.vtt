How to eat Sushi

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:05.700
Hello and welcome to Videojug.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.490
We're going to show you the correct way to
eat sushi.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.639
If you're new to Japanese food, don't be intimidated
. There are few dos and don't s but as for

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.870
our food it's there to be enjoyed.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.060
Sushi is called cooked rice flavored with
vinegar, shaped into bite sized pieces and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.269
then topped with raw or cooked fish, all formed
into a roll with fish, egg and vegetables

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.050
and wrapped in seaweed.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.570
Step 1 : What to expect

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.910
Your place that it should include
a napkin

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.730
a plate
a small block called the hashi oki on to which

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.980
you'll rest your chopsticks
and a small shallow dish, this is for pouring

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.160
soy sauce into.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.530
Step 2 : Drinks

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.399
You may begin the meal with warm saki, this
is an alcoholic drink made from fermented

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.399
rice.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.000
It is then customary to move on to either
green tea or during the meal.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.920
Green tea should be served in a small handleless
cup like this.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.701
If you're female, it is good manners to hold
the cup with one hand and use the other hand

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.890
to support the bottom.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.040
Step 3 : Chopsticks

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.200
Although it is easier to eat larger pieces
of sushi with your figures, you should also

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.560
use a chopsticks for some pieces and for sashimi
, the thin slice is a fish which often start

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.560
the meal.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.950
You most likely be using disposable wooden
chopsticks.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.970
Handy hint

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.799
Wouldn't chopsticks often have a few loose
splinters of wood which make them uncomfortable

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.210
to hold.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.770
These can be removed by rubbing these sticks
together.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.310
Do not let you host see this, as it implies
that they're cheap.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.149
When selecting a piece of sushi from a serving
dish, use a wider end of the stick, not the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.990
end you put in your mouth.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.920
Never pass food to another person from your
chopsticks to their's . This is a mix part

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.939
of a Japanese funeral ritual and therefore
it is considered extremely rude.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.380
When you're not using your chopsticks , rest
them in a hashi oki or across your plate but

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.010
do not leave them in edge of your plate.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.540
Step 4 : Soy sauce

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.080
Pour little of soy sauce into your dish, don't
put in too much , this is considered greedy

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.319
and wasteful.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.920
You can take more if you need it.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.739
Step 5 : Wasabi

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.459
This is the extremely hot green paste that
accompanies most sushi . Take a small amount

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.430
with your chopsticks and carefully stir into
your soy sauce.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.010
Again don't get too heavy handed as it will
override the subtle flavors of sushi and could

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.209
offend the shaft.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.849
Step 6 : Eating the sushi

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.459
You should began with sashimi, slices of raw
fish.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.129
Handle these with your chopsticks and take
time to settle the flavor.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.569
Then move on to rice based sushi, which you
can eat with your hands or chopsticks, whichever

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.810
you prefer.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.770
Pick the piece up and dip it in fish side
down of the sou sauce.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.269
Do not dunk the rice onto the sauce , this
will make it too soggy and difficult to eat.

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.470
Place the sushi in your mouth, fish side down
too as it's the flavor of the fish not the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.410
rice that's important here.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.599
Ideally , you should eat the piece in one
go or two at a push.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.580
Try not to take a bit and return it to your
plate.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.290
Step 7 : Pickled ginger

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.189
These are the pale pinkish slices often served
with sushi.

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.620
The idea here is to eat a slice in between
pieces to clean the palate.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.750
Use chopsticks for this, not your hands.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.730
Step 8 : Clear your plate

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.560
As much as possible, try not to leave any
food on your plate, it is considered specially

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.620
rude to leave rice.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.959
Done
