00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:05.494
The President:
Hello, everybody!

00:00:05.494 --> 00:00:06.761
Audience:
Hello!

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:10.594
The President:
Well, it is great
to be here at THEARC with the

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:14.127
Boys &amp; Girls Club of
Greater Washington.

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:17.961
Give it up for the World
Champion Los Angeles Lakers.

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:24.328
(applause)

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:28.094
I want to congratulate everybody on the team,

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:31.594
everybody who works for
the organization, and all the

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.161
fans who cheer them
on year after year.

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:37.928
We've also got, by the way, one
of California's great members of

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:41.394
Congress in the house --
Grace Napolitano is here.

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:42.227
Hello, Grace.

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:46.094
(applause)

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:49.661
Now, I have to say that there
is a longstanding tradition of

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.828
welcoming championship sports
teams to the White House.

00:00:53.828 --> 00:00:59.861
But here's the thing: These guys
have been there so often; they

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:03.561
were just there last year
because they won the title.

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:07.428
And Kobe and Derek have been
there so many times now, they

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:09.795
could lead tours themselves.

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:11.194
The same is true
for Coach Jackson.

00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:14.127
So I thought we'd change
things up a little bit.

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:19.895
We teamed up with NBA Cares to
come here to THEARC and spend a

00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:23.528
little time with the
unbelievable young people who

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:26.027
are here, as well as
the terrific staff.

00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:29.695
And I was just walking around
watching these players work with

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:32.461
students -- assembling care
packages for our wounded

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:36.261
warriors, putting together some
toiletry kits for the homeless

00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:38.227
here in Washington, D. C.,

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:42.961
and trying to keep up with the
kids on the "Big Brain Academy

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:45.928
Challenge," which I didn't even
try because it was moving way

00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:48.161
too fast for me.

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:52.994
But that's the beauty of service -- anybody can do it.

00:01:52.994 --> 00:01:56.561
The Lakers have a proud
tradition of performing

00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.728
community service in the L. A.

00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:00.561
community, and I'm glad that
they took the time to help us

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:05.194
during the holiday season
here in Washington, D. C.

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:08.628
We celebrate that spirit of
service off the court -- because

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.127
it's very hard to do what these
guys do on the court, but

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:15.895
everybody can serve
off the court.

00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:19.094
Now, on the court, there aren't
too many folks who can do what

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:21.428
the Los Angeles Lakers do.

00:02:21.428 --> 00:02:24.594
This year, they won their second
title in a row, and their

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:27.494
sixteenth championship overall.

00:02:27.494 --> 00:02:29.994
That's one behind the
Boston Celtics for

00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:32.494
the most of all-time.

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:36.994
The Boston Celtics, of course,
they beat in this year's finals.

00:02:36.994 --> 00:02:40.628
I want to congratulate Coach
Phil Jackson on earning his

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.661
eleventh NBA championship ring.

00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.728
It was his fifth championship
with the Lakers -- which I

00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:50.027
should point out is still one
behind the six he won

00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:51.161
with the Chicago Bulls.

00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:53.161
Mr. Bryant:
-- not for long.

00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:56.127
The President:
Kobe said,
not for long, though.

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:57.027
(laughter)

00:02:57.027 --> 00:03:00.027
We are still grateful
for you, Coach, in Chicago.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:04.328
And it has been a long drought
since Phil left Chicago,

00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:07.961
although I have to say they
witnessed in person on Friday

00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:10.494
that my Bulls are showing
some signs of life.

00:03:10.494 --> 00:03:14.528
(laughter)

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:18.261
I want to congratulate Kobe
Bryant -- the NBA Finals MVP for

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:19.227
the second year in a row.

00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:24.394
(applause)

00:03:24.394 --> 00:03:27.994
Kobe was there when
we organized a little pickup

00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:32.061
game for my 49th birthday.

00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:34.561
Pau Gasol and some other NBA
players participated;

00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:36.294
Derek was there.

00:03:36.294 --> 00:03:40.861
Kobe was sidelined because he
had just gotten some treatment

00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:42.461
on his knee.

00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:46.528
I was not yet sidelined
with my busted lip.

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:50.194
But nobody was taking it easy on
me because Pau was on my team,

00:03:50.194 --> 00:03:54.928
so I kept on just
passing to him.

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:58.695
And now I got to see how
everybody else on the Lakers

00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:01.761
gets so many open looks, if
you've got Pau Gasol

00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:03.027
in the middle.

00:04:03.027 --> 00:04:06.061
So I just want to congratulate all the L. A. Lakers

00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:11.361
for being one of the
outstanding sports franchises

00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:14.127
in our country and
in our history.

00:04:14.127 --> 00:04:17.994
I wish all of you guys great
luck for the rest of the season.

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:21.394
But especially I just want to
thank you for being so generous

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.994
with your time with these kids.

00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:29.227
These young people
here are working hard.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.161
They're doing well in school.

00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:33.994
They were really helping me out
as I was going through that line

00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:38.094
packing those care boxes,
making sure I didn't screw up.

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:40.127
We are incredibly proud of them.

00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:44.227
But every once in a while they
need a little encouragement and

00:04:44.227 --> 00:04:47.528
they need to know that no
dream is beyond their reach.

00:04:47.528 --> 00:04:52.361
And so when they see people like
the Los Angeles Lakers who are

00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.594
willing to spend time with them,
that sends a message to them

00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:57.728
that they're special.

00:04:57.728 --> 00:05:00.494
You guys can't give a
better gift than that during

00:05:00.494 --> 00:05:01.394
the holiday season.

00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:02.661
So thank you very much.

00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:03.594
We're really proud of you.

00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:04.528
Congratulations.

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:11.094
(applause)

00:05:11.094 --> 00:06:58.194
(The President shaking hands
and taking pictures)

00:06:58.194 --> 00:07:01.828
(applause)
