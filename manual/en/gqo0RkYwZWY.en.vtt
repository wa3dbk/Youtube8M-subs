00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.780
[Janine Antoni: Collaborating with Stephen
Petronio]

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.020
[Stephen Petronio Company]

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.940
[PETRONIO] I worked very hard to develop

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.379
a very succinct and idiosyncratic

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.129
and highly-nuanced language--

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.560
and I'm in my mid-fifties--

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.500
[Stephen Petronio, Choreographer]

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.340
and it took a long time to establish that.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.489
Now that I have,

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.789
I'm kind of like, "Now what?"

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.010
The stereotype of dance is that

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.230
if we exist in this ethereal plane,

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.920
our work does disappear as we do it,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.250
and that's the best part of it:

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.110
the moment is precious because it goes away.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.220
You just get a glimpse of a movement,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.190
and you have to chase it

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.920
or try to hold it in your memory, but...

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.400
["Lick and Lather", Janine Antoni]

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.660
a sculpture, you can look at from all sides

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.880
for as long as you want

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.470
to stay in the room with it.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.300
So, I got very jealous with that.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.140
I'm absolutely obsessed and in love

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960
with the visual world.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.550
I knew of Janine's work

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.090
before I knew Janine.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.509
I've worked with people like

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.399
Cindy Sherman

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.479
and Anish Kapoor--

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.839
["Loving Care", Janine Antoni]

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.259
visual artists who I would share the space
with,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.690
but they had their territory

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.610
and I had mine.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.770
Well, with Janine I felt that,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.500
because she was a performer as well,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.700
that she would invade me in a way,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.340
and I very much wanted to be invaded.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.800
[ANTONI] I was asked by the choreographer,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.720
Stephen Petronio,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.110
to do the visuals for

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.000
a piece he was working on called

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.349
"Like Lazarus Did".

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.500
He was interested in notions

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.879
of transcendence and elevation.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.729
["Like Lazarus Did", The Joyce Theater, NYC]

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.420
I spent a lot of time watching him

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.030
choreograph the piece,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.530
and spent time with the dancers.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.700
One thing that is very evident in his work

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.390
is that it has this kind of

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.140
exuberance and complexity.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.100
So when I looked at the work,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.980
I said, what I would like to do is

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.880
to offer him stillness.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.530
And rather than make a set for the dance,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.980
I would perform as well.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.220
For two hours during the performance

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.730
I lay completely still.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.060
[PETRONIO] She was meditating, really,

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.320
on her body,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.920
as the audience was looking

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.570
at our body.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.260
She was absolutely still

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.240
in a meditation

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.910
on her form

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.830
and her own death

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.670
against the chaotic look of the stage.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.560
[ANTONI] Stephen's cousin was having a baby,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.400
and she kept sending him sonograms.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.680
And he looked at these images

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.150
and used them as

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.450
positions to choreograph one of his dancers,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.010
Nick Sciscione,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.490
for the last dance of

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.550
"Like Lazarus Did".

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.580
When he was making that dance,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.530
I said, "Stephen, we should do it in honey,"

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.790
"because honey looks like amniotic fluid."

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.790
And then, of course,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.770
it was impossible to do on a stage.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.069
We were very interested in making a video

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.089
where one could not feel gravity.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.800
["Honey Baby"]

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.160
Having had a child,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.080
it's miraculous that a body

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.430
can grow another body--

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.880
that one body grows

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.280
from the nutrients of another body.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.860
[PETRONIO] So there is kind of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.310
a womb-like viscus body

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.500
moving through viscus liquid

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.599
at a very slow

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.339
and infinitesimal level.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.349
Just the smallest movement of the finger--

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.819
and the spread of the toes

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.530
and the arch of the head--

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.370
took me, you know...

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.190
a place that I would never go on stage.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.960
There was a kind of intimacy

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.560
that I long for on stage,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.940
but I couldn't have on stage,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.490
so "Honey Baby" led me to that,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.150
and the camera led me to that.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.380
Janine didn't invite me

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.610
to make a dance for her sculpture;

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.889
she invited me to collaborate with her

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.489
as a visual artist.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.680
Janine and I were both

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.340
pushing Nick around verbally

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.460
in that process.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.700
So she was getting in my face

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.580
movement-wise,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.660
and I was getting in her face

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.420
sculpture-wise.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.920
People find it very hard to understand that

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.790
we did this together,

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.080
because they want to think of me

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.880
as the choreographer

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.780
and her as the sculptor.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.780
But we really tried to erase that line.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.720
We continue to try to erase that line,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.190
and we're working together on future projects

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.250
to do that.
