   (uplifting music)

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.245 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - We've got 2,000
  acres of crops here.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:15.582
It's my father, Jim, and myself

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.817 line:0%
  that do the farming.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.820 line:0%
Corn, bean, and wheat rotation,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.957 align:start position:0% line:0%
  and then every acre is
  no-tilled and cover-cropped.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:29.195 align:start position:0%
 We're usin' mostly annual rye
 grass on what we're doin'.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.197
   We've got some cereal rye.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.233 align:start size:88% position:13%
  We've got crimson
  clover in just about

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.201
everything we're doin'.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.370 align:start size:88% position:13%
   We've got some
   rapeseed, turnips,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.874 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and radishes in
  some of it as well.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.976 size:88% position:44%
   Tryin' a lot of
   different things.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.345
  But the main mix on
  like, this field,

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.815 align:start position:0%
   is rye grass, crimson
   clover that we had today.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.851 align:start position:0%
   This one's going to
   soybeans, so we've got in

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.454 align:start size:88% position:13%
   a quart and a half
   of glyphosate.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.723
   We've got a quart of 2,4-D

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:00.293 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then we've got
canopy in here as well,

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.596 align:start position:0%
   residual that we put
   down with our bean acres.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.401
We've got all our corn
acres burnt off already,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:12.072 align:start position:0%
  and those were just straight
  quart of glyphosate,

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.907 size:88% position:44%
   quart and a half
   of the rye grass,

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:17.844
   it was real big, and then
   a quart of 2,4-D in there.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.879
 (guitar music)

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.649 align:start position:0%
  I go around all winter long,
  and throughout the year,

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.951
and speak to different
groups about, you know,

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.554 align:start size:88% position:13%
what we're seein' on our
farm with cover crops

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.456
  and promotin' that.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:30.824
You know, tellin' them why they

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.560 align:start size:88% position:13%
  should be usin'
  'em, and, you know,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.995
  the yield advantage,
  and the soil health,

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.465
  and the things with
  erosion and stuff

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.800
 that were goin' on that aren't

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.603
 now that we have cover crops.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:47.941
 So it's gainin', and a
 lot more people is...

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.344 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
One guy gets cover
crops, and the neighbor

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.947 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
watches 'em, and they
start usin' cover crops,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.316 line:0%
  and you can see the
  circles grow out.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.750
   There's some areas
   that are gettin'

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.786
  quite a few acres of
  cover crops in 'em.
