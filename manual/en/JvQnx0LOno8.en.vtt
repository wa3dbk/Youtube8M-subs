00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:07.090
Today's video is about the benefits of composting.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.850
I talked before about how one of my main goals
is growing food - nutrient-dense food.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.480
And I also want to get flowers growing in
here and I want trees and shrubs and I really

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.210
want to get a bunch of diversity, but one
thing I really want to make sure I have is

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.210
food.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.409
The food that’s coming out of our industrial,
conventional agriculture is getting to be

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:34.160
very poor quality, 60-70% lower in nutrients
than it was before this whole green revolution

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.500
started in the last century.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.329
So, I want to grow food that has a lot more
nutrients in it than that.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.980
During that time we’ve increased pesticide
use by 1000% and that we’re still getting

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.750
crop loss from insects alone, crop loss has
doubled.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.199
So the pesticides aren’t working every well
and they’re contributing to this loss of

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.769
nutrients in our foods.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.969
If you’ve read my blog you know that I don’t
really like to spend to much time complaining

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:02.969
about it.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.080
I certainly have spent time about being down
about it, especially when I was first learning

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.080
about all this stuff.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.410
But then I started to realize that we can
make a difference starting in our own organic

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.410
gardens.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.710
We can grow nutrient-dense food, we can restore
the topsoil that’s been degraded, we can

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.180
clean out the water in our area, capture rain
water from the roof and we can really create

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.320
these inspirational gardens that are beautiful
and provide us with really healthy food if

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.770
we learn how to really get in there and build
up the soil and all that stuff.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.140
That’s one of my main goals and compost
is just one of the most important tools to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.140
make that happen.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.180
There are really two sort of organic matter
tools that I focus on in my vegetable garden

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.610
and the first one is compost.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.430
Obviously I can’t show you how to make compost
today, that’s going to take a month or two.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.650
I get into that into detail in the Academy.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.800
What I want to talk about today is that often
when I’m in a new place when I’m starting

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.230
a new organic garden, I’m just going to
have to buy compost.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.240
What I’ll do here is maybe zoom in on this
compost here and show you a little bit about

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.780
how to buy it and how to use it, because that’s
going to be an important thing, especially

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.810
when you’re just getting started when you
haven’t made your own compost yet.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.980
So, when you buy compost, you want it to be
nice and dark like this.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.070
You want it to be, you don’t want to be
able to discern the raw materials too much,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.000
and here I just have to do this so I can see.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.950
You know, a little bit of woody material is
okay, this happens to be kind of a rough compost.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.320
The reason I’m okay with it is because I
know the guy who makes it.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.580
I know the materials that go in it and I’m
happy with it.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.150
So I don’t mind it being a little rougher.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.480
I could screen it out if I wanted to.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.440
But when you want compost, when you’re looking
for it, you want it to smell good.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.420
You want it to smell really nice like a forest
floor, like really rich.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.910
You want it to be dark, fluffy, moist and
you don’t want it to have garbage in it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.910
or anything like that.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.750
You don’t want it to have been made with
any sewage sludge - that’s definitely a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.750
no-no.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.350
And, it should just smell and feel good and
you know, ideally you would kind of ask what

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.180
goes in it and you don’t want to have toxic
waste or any kind of weird stuff that often

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.630
gets into compost piles.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.520
So, just go for that really nice dark stuff
that hasn’t been made with paper mill waste

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.390
or sewage sludge or any of that kind of stuff.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.840
Then when it comes time to use it, one thing
that I like to do even if I don’t need it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840
yet.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.910
I bring the compost onto my property as long
as I, a month or two or three, then it will

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.650
cure a little more than perhaps it did at
the composting facility.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.959
I like to have that curing time.

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.250
So then what I’m going to do is you’ll
see that when I prepare the soil, I’m going

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.160
to take at least a couple of inches, a couple
inches of this, put it on my soil and incorporate

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.730
it in there with the rototiller or with the
pitch fork or somehow.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.709
I don’t like to do too much tilling of my
soil in the long run.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.900
When I’m making a new bed, especially one
that slow in organic matter, I want to incorporate

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.739
that compost in there as deep as I can really.

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.400
And I know that’s actually going to hurt
the soil a little bit when I’m tilling or

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.100
when I’m digging like that, but I need to
get that organic matter in there in the beginning.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.419
So, I will show you how to that when I get
doing it.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.830
And I’ll talk about the other organic matter
material when I’ve installed some stuff.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.039
So, compost, really useful to learn how to
make it but until then it’s useful to know

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.370
how to buy it.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.809
You definitely want to use that.

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:39.780
I guess I kind of skipped an important step
there, because some people don’t know exactly

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.680
the benefits of composting.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.240
Maybe I’ll put the camera back up here and
talk about that because that would be a good

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.249
thing to talk about, wouldn’t it?

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:02.830
So, what compost is, is its organic matter
that has been broken down by microorganisms

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.419
largely, they do the work of breaking down
the organic matter and that can be manure,

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:16.220
it can be grass clippings, leaves, straw,
any kind of, anything that was once alive.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.349
What happens then, is the reason we use it,
there are kind of three main reasons.

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:21.569
1.

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.550
We want the organic matter because we want
some of that to turn into humus in the soil

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.490
and that does a lot of things.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:34.560
It holds water and holds nutrients and allows
for air in the soil and it just does a lot

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.830
of good stuff for us.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.830
2.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.800
Also, it’s going to have nutrients in it
because when the microorganisms broke down

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.280
these foods scraps, manures, leaves, all that
stuff has nutrients in it and so it can’t

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.850
be technically called a fertilizer but you
can kind of think of it like that.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.589
It’s a broad spectrum organic fertilizer
that has a lot of different nutrients in there.

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:56.080
Especially if it was made with a lots of different
sources of organic material.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080
3.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.659
But then the third reason is, people are starting
to talk about it more but to me it’s the

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:07.659
most important or certainly up there, is the
microorganisms are still in here and we need

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.490
them in our soil because they do so much.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.159
I’ll even make another video on them because
they’re just so important.

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.800
So, were inoculating our organic garden with
these beneficial bacteria and fungi and protozoa

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.450
and even little animals, even little worms,
insects, we want all of them in our vegetable

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.319
garden because they do everything to make
the soil healthy and alive.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:33.930
So maybe I’ll talk about that more when
I talk about microorganisms but that’s why

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.529
we want to use compost in the soil, so I hope
you will get into composting and using it

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:47.130
as soon as you can.
