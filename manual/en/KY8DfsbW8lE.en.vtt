00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.100
We're in Las Vegas at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.520
which is an oval-shaped track where car races are held 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.280
and Americans drive in circles and turn in only one direction.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.540
Left. 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.580
But we've come here to drive a car which can also turn right. 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.880
A car which is a novelty in its segment: the BMW M235i. It's taking the place of the 1 Series coupe, 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.740
is a bit longer than its predecessor and has bigger wheelbase. 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.940
Today, we'll drive a 2 coupe with the most powerful engine - the M235i. 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.880
It's a 6 cylinder turbocharged engine with an output of 326hp. 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.540
The size of the new 2 coupe is very similar to one of our favourite BMWs in history - the E46.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.700
With this engine, you could suspect it takes after the famous M3.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.980
We're about to find out.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.520
You're probably wondering why a German company decided to show its car in the States,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.560
 so far from its fatherland.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:37.380
 It turns out that the Germans expect around 1/3 of all 2 series to be sold in the States, 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.780
which is why this market is prioritized.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.640
A car with the most powerful 326 hp turbocharged engine. 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.580
Just a few years ago, BMW engineers probably would have laughed hearing

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.680
they'd produce only turbocharged engines, 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.720
but today it turns out that all 2s have turbocharged motors.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.440
You can't order a 2 without a turbocharger, which, some will feel, discredits the brand.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:19.340
But remember that in the 60s BMW used a turbocharger in a similar car - the 2002ti,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.380
whose position in the production hierarchy was similar. 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.780
At the time it was one of, if not, the first turbocharged cars in Europe.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.620
So we're going back to the roots. 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.020
And we're going back in style.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.100
I must admit that the handling in this car is really good. 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.280
It has a quick steering ratio.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.580
At first, I tried to move my hands on the wheel but 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.840
the active steering system allows you to keep your hands in one position.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.660
The front-end is rather light, no impression of sudden understeer.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.860
The engine is completely at ease revving up to 6,500 rpm.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:15.200
Braking - the 235i version has special reinforced brakes because it's much more powerful than 4-cylinder cars.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.940
Let's see if we can slide it a little bit.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500
Sure we can. 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.840
The car has only an electronic diff but if you pay extra you can order a mechanical one.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.120
And that's the beauty of this model. 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:55.480
You can order a solution, which allows you to drift any time you like plus it improves the traction of the car. 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.460
I'm really surprised because I remember the M135i, which was a very heavy car,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.660
not particularly pleasant to drive. 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.900
Whereas here it turns out you can make a car which can be much more pleasant, effortless to drive. 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.840
The brakes don't fail, letting you apply as much braking force as you need. 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.280
I don't know how many laps I can do here. 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.900
The Germans keep saying "no drifting, no drifting" but hey, we have a rear-wheel-drive Beemer here.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.660
You could just as well go to Rome and not meet the Holy Father.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.020
4 laps is not enough to tell more about this car.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.700
It sure gives you loads of fun, which is something BMW has lost in recent years.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.460
It started to produce big, comfortable, bulky cars. 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.660
Yes, many people like them but purists, who are keen on sporty ride, have been missing something since.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.200
But this rear-wheel-drive 235i is making a good impression.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.540
 I'd love to drive it all day on some track 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:33.580
which has a little more bends and is a bit longer than the one in Las Vegas. 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.640
But being hungry for more makes you want to come back to a car 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.140
and check out how it would behave in different conditions.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.900
I think it's a good recommendation for the Beemer

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:56.880
 - the 235i makes you want to try it once again in different circumstances and places. 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.060
It intrigues and delivers on the promises made by BMW engineers.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.360
 It gives a lot of fun, there's a lot of interaction with the car.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.100
And it's fast, real fast. 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:25.460
The mix of 326 hp supported by a turbocharger and 450Nm of torque is a promise of great performance.
