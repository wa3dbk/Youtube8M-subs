Hi everyone, in this video I'm going to be
answering one of Britain's biggest beauty

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.170
questions: how to get flawless foundation
and make sure any greasy skin is combated.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.019
So the first thing I'm going to use is my
Olay Total Effects Day Moisturiser. I want

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.650
to create a really matte look for the fall
and this is going to help me. It gets rid

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.289
of any grease, it feels so soft when it goes
on my skin and it's giving me that moisture

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.489
that I need as well when it starts to get
a little bit colder. Next up I'm going to

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.540
use my primer; this is my Becca Poreless Priming
Perfector. It's so important to use a primer

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.920
to get rid of any of that shine and to make sure
that your makeup is going to set when you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.810
put it on. Ok so the main event, my foundation.
I'm going to use my Max Factor All Day Flawless

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.870
3-in-1 foundation. This is actually in Warm
Almond. This is a primer, concealer and a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.690
foundation in one. Amazing! Especially if
you feel like a little bit lazy like me on

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.060
some days. This is definitely a medium to
heavy coverage. The great thing that I love

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.370
about this that I think makes it different
is the fact that it's not thick; it's actually

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.420
pretty thin when you put it on, I hate cakey
foundations when I want a flawless finish.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.100
I love it and you are not going to break out
in shine. To make sure that you don't get

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.850
shiny as well I'm going to use my Max Factor
Creme Puff Press Powder. This is in natural,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.469
I'm pretty fair so I want something quite
light. The smell of this is so good! It feels

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.679
so soft when it goes on my skin, it's not
chalky and it's just going to keep my foundation

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.060
in place and make sure that I don't break
out. Next I'm going to use my Delilah bronzer;

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.810
this is my sunset light to medium. The great
thing about this is it's matte so there's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
no shine whatsoever in this and I'm going
to use this Delilah Clementine blush as well,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.130
again it's matte. I love the pigmentation
in this and it's just going to make sure that

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.869
it looks flawless without that kind of shininess.
Ok, onto lips, I want to make sure my lips

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.840
look good. I'm using my Max Factor Colour
Elixir Lip Liner; this is in Pink Petal. This

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.869
is so easy to apply, it literally glides on.
If you're a beginner and you don't want a

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.920
really bright lip liner then this is absolutely
perfect to try. To fill in the colour I'm

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.499
going to use my Charlotte Tilbury Hepburn
Honey lipstick. This is so nice, first of

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.569
all I love this brown colour for the fall
but it's matt and that's so important for

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.800
me because it's going to make sure I don't
look kind of greasy. Ok so for the eyes again

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.480
I'm going to turn to Charlotte Tilbury, this
is actually the Dolce Vita eyeshadow set.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.300
I love this; I use the lighter colour just
to kind of colour the lids and the pigmentation

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.770
on this is absolutely beautiful. Then I'm
going to use the darker colour just on the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.190
outside and then I'm going to use these colour
chameleons, these are again by Charlotte Tilbury.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.300
They are beautiful; the first one is in dark
purple and the second one that I'm going to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.190
put on in is in champagne diamonds. These
glide on so easily, they are so pretty for

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.820
the fall, they sparkle a little bit but again
it's going to keep things quite nice and matte,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.960
really natural looking, a little bit kind
of smokey eye but so so easy and quick to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.010
do as well because it's a pencil. The creme
de la creme, my new best friend, the Max Factor

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.670
Masterpiece Transform mascara, this is actually
in black brown, which I am obsessed with for

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.230
the fall I love the idea of having a brown
mascara; this gives so much definition, the

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.170
wand is amazing. The staying power on this
is absolutely incredible, you guys have to

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.270
try this, the volume is so nice I can just
build this up and build this up and it just

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.080
gives such a flawless look. Ok now to sort
this mess of a hair out, I'm going to use

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.300
my Pantene Pro-V dry shampoo; this is in instant
refresh. This is probably hands-down one of

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.870
my favourite dry shampoos I own. The smell
is incredible if you like the smell of Pantene

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.790
products you will love this and secondly it
feels like you have nothing in your hair which

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.120
is a real pet bug for me for dry shampoo.
Then I'm going to take my Wella Silvikrin

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.230
Style &amp; Protect Heat Spray, this is going
to make sure my hair is nice and protected

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.460
when I put hot irons on it, it leaves it feeling
so silky as well. I am so excited to tell

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.580
you guys about these; these are the Braun
Satin Hair 7 Hair Straighteners. Oh my goodness,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.580
these are the best hair straighteners I have
ever tried! They come with this technology

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.740
where basically you can actually programme
in your hair, so the length, the thickness,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.960
whether it's coloured and it actually decides
what temperature it's going to put it at and

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.440
make sure that it's at the best temperature
for your hair. And if you go too fast it gives

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.960
you a frowny face and it kind of detects all
of the moisture in your hair as well. This

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.020
is incredible, my hair has never looked this
straight and silky, I am obsessed with these!

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.239
And this is the finished look guys, it's so
easy to do, it's going to make sure your foundation

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.980
looks flawless and this is going to last most
of the day without you breaking out in shine.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.020
I've got my New Look dress on, which I loved
for the fall with all the pretty flowers on

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.030
it. Make sure you go and subscribe to Beauty
