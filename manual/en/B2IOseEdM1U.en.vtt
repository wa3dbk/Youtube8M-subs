bjbj &gt;&gt; RYAN: What's up fellows? It's a great
day for working out. Don't mind me just chomping

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.160
on some beef jerky here. You caught me in
the middle of my snack to answer you all's

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.869
questions on another episode of Mind Food
Monday. And I'll just start off not a question

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.230
but if you are looking for a good snack beef
jerky is a great one as far as high protein.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.820
They do tend to have a lot of sodium in them
so if you have high blood pressure it may

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.460
not be the best thing for you, but if not
just drink a lot of water. And they're a great

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:49.690
protein source I use Jack Links. So lot's
of protein you can see 15 grams and 3 grams

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.811
of carbs, low carbs which is what we like.
So enough about me let's dive into some of

00:00:54.811 --> 00:01:03.250
your questions for this week. Up first we
have Ato Zizzy Zeva. He says "Dude, I want

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.880
you to upload more. Maybe have theme days
for two or three days of the week, kind of

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.710
like Q&amp;A, just some ideas I thought of. I
do all this stuff anyways." Yeah those are

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.330
some good suggestions man I appreciate it
and I do have been trying to think of some

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.900
other ways that I can make videos that you
guys find entertaining and helpful. So I'm

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.320
going to this week put out a kind of survey
video to get some input and feedback from

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.990
everybody an kind of collaborate all those
ideas and then that way we have some really

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.390
cool things to look forward to in the coming
months. So great question and you will be

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.940
the winner for this week I'll go over that
later. All right next up getting g a little

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.540
crazy here, doing two birds with one stone.
So we've got W. Vasquez 619 and Bivevaper

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.590
both want to know I'm extremely toned and
defined but looking to put on more mass and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.710
I want to know how to put on mass without
losing my abs. So the question here putting

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.549
on mass clean as possible, and the answer
is it all comes down to monitoring your calories.

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.830
You want to add bare minimum amount 100, 200
a day to see how your body responds. I'm going

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.160
to throw a caveat out there and let you know
this is a lot harder, not in the sense that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.120
oh you can't do it because it's harder, but
when you're making that fine tune of an adjustment

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.310
it can take a lot longer to notice the results
and you can lose motivation from that, you

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.120
can feel like you're not getting progress,
and at the end of the day burn yourself out.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.500
So just be aware of that if you're going to
go down that road. It doesn't mean you can't

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.640
do it but I want you to know that ahead of
time. So to answer your question again it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.900
is add calories, minimal amount 100, 200 a
day starting there, and see how your body

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.630
responds. All right and last but certainly
not least we have Joe Boza he wants to know

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.390
"Hey Ryan, I'm a 16-year-old guy in the process
of bulking but have a really fast metabolism.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.660
I take a weight gainer and I'm seeing progress.
I understand you had difficulties putting

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.520
mass on. I'm a teenager and I was hoping you
would give me some tips or advice on what

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.020
worked for you." All right well I will tell
you what worked for me Joe Boza and when I

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.460
was a teen I ate a lot of peanut butter sandwiches,
those were the best with some milk, and I

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.510
still do eat those. So hopefully you're not
allergic to peanuts but that is a great nutritionally

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.069
dense, protein dense, carb dense, all that
muscle building stuff right in there chug

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.400
those like there's no tomorrow routine and
you will start seeing the muscle pack on.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.610
All right guys that'll do it for another episode
