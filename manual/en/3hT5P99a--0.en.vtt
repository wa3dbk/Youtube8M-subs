00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.370
Riding Transit Link, the public dial-a-ride
transit service in the Twin Cities metro area

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.029
is easy, convenient, and affordable.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.710
All you need is a few helpful tips to use
the system.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
Plus, drivers and reservation staff are eager to
help you reach your destination.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.590
You can always ask them to clarify any questions
you have.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.700
Our goal:

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.390
for you to enjoy your ride and have confidence
to use Transit Link.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.469
I do have a license and a car, but I just prefer
this method

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.250
because it's cheaper for me

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.250
and it's more convenient for a lot of other
people, I guess. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.300
The first step to riding Transit
Link is to schedule your ride.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.500
When you call Transit Link, choose the number
for the county you are traveling in.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.470
Once you choose your county, your call will be
forwarded to reservation staff. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.680
They will ask you for three important pieces
of information:

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.230
Where you are coming from.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.330
Where you're going.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.230
And the time you'd like to be picked up.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.320
Staff will need the actual address,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.240
but it's also helpful to let them know more
common references,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.520
such as a specific grocery store or a medical
clinic.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.750
If you have an appointment to get to

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.290
let the reservation staff know.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.990
Ask the reservation people questions.
Then a lot of times the reservation people will
put it on our manifest.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.340
And it helps us out,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.210
and it helps the customer out.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.220
It's really a great help 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.920
to have where they're going

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.130
put on there

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.180
instead of just an address.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.520
Reservation staff will look at the schedule
for the timeframe you've requested and see if

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.270
there is a ride available for you.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.219
If there is a ride available,

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.620
the operator will let you know the
time you'll be picked up

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.959
and the details on your return trip if you need one.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.450
All rides are put through a trip planner, 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.570
so a lot goes into a into figuring out each ride, 
trying to find a solution.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.180
Rides are scheduled as they are available.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.999
If schedule is full during the timeframe
you've requested,

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.309
there may not be a ride available,

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:28.449
but staff will continue looking for a spot
in the schedule to accommodate your ride, 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.869
and if they find one, they'll contact you.

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:36.989
The driver will pick you up at the curb within
thirty minutes of your pickup time.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.119
For example, 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.999
if you are scheduled to ride at 1 p.m.,

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.429
the bus has until 1:30 to pick you up.

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.769
Be ready to go.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.629
The driver will only wait 3 minutes once
they arrive.

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.290
Make sure you're waiting at the door of your
home

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.819
or building.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.139
If you're nervous about missing the bus

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.419
tell the reservation staff to alert the bus driver
that it may take you some time 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.889
to get from the door to the bus.

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.489
That way the driver will be looking for
you.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.649
Call in and get all the info. Customer service  

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.199
is always willing to sit on the phone with you
for as long as it takes.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.719
And you can always, if you see one of us
sitting here or dropping someone off, 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.089
come and ask a question. 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:20.489
We'll be happy to help you out.

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.409
Buses are comfortable with heat in the winter and
air conditioning in the summer.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.839
Each bus is completely accessible, with lifts.

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.839
Buses can accommodate at least two chairs.

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:37.129
It's important to let reservation staff know
if you are using a mobility device or bringing

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.950
someone with you for help.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.419
They're equipped, and we keep them nice.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.050
I think they're surprised by how nice
the ride is.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.779
You know, it's not just a ride here and there.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.089
I'm going to talk to you, you know, 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:51.009
and I know other drivers are going to talk to you,
and say "How are you doing?"

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.509
I think they're surprised that it
turns out to be a fun experience.

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:58.509
It's not just a bus ride. 
It's a fun experience.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.449
Drivers will help you carry packages to your
door.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.529
Typically that amounts to about four shopping-
sized bags.

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.249
Bring exact change to pay your fare.

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.049
Drivers will not make change.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.469
You may also buy a book of 10 coupons worth
$2.25 each to

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.079
use on Transit Link buses. 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.690
I would consider it a heck
of a deal for any type of transportation.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.110
When you consider, like the cost of insurance
for a vehicle, driving it back and forth,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.250
the gasoline, parking and everything else, this
is a great deal.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.180
At your destination the bus will pull up and
let you off at the curb.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.910
If you have a return trip,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.909
be ready at the pickup time and remember to
bring exact fare.

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.779
On some trips you may need to transfer from
Transit Link to a regular transit route.

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.379
You will be brought to a large transit hub,

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.780
such as a transit center or park-and-ride.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.669
These facilities are generally well-lit,

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.189
have a shelter and are served by frequent bus routes.

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.479
Reservation staff will work to coordinate
the timing of the transfer

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.979
so you don't have to wait too long.

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.389
You will get a transfer from the driver to
use as fare on the next leg of your trip.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.109
As always if you have a question about your
transfer, 

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:19.909
ask reservation staff or the driver.

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.270
They're happy to help.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.740
The drivers are our front-line ambassadors, and they're
the ones that know this service.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.990
And they're the ones that can really tell
you how things do work, and they should be

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.900
able to answer most people's questions.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.239
Thousands of people use the Transit Link
system each year.

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:41.580
It's part of the region's overall transit
system and provides an important link 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.969
to get people where they need and want to go.

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.230
Freedom.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.230
Independence.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.319
Camaraderie.

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.459
Community.

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:56.459
Find them on Transit Link.
