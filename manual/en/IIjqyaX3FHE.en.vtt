the Jurassic world movie

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.500
and this is Osama and they have %ah

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.060
one airplane one helicopter

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.109
and the other one is a Hummer while

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.710
says match box developed these bold and
rugged vehicles especially for jurassic

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.469
world

00:00:37.469 --> 00:02:00.390
Wallace open this up and have some fun

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.530
okay let's take a look at some of these
this is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.910
looks like a transport rock Scott
jurassic world

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.980
on the side is guiding diciendo miss rex

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.550
big tires who is a cool looking truck
its

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.870
carrying a motorcycle on the front a bit
I'm

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.360
topper this got a lot of different light
gauge tolls would stop

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.720
and this get the same locals on the back
here inside it looks like there's seats

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.920
on both sides

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.200
so this must be a military transport
vehicle

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.000
okay and then we have homer

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.850
this one says jurassic world here

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.510
in as a picture of a dinosaur says am
for

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.850
up there the front it's like the classic
armor this is the military type armor

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.570
so these must all be military vehicles
for like after dinosaurs escape

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.490
de gaulle and either collect them or
destroy them

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.780
not up here you have all kinds at law

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.770
military equipment here

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.739
that the home the scaring okay then we
get the Jeep

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.260
the doors don't open it does say

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.090
jurassic world it shows a picture the
dinosaur and says

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.070
am 5 over there so I don't think this
was a

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.510
military won by a lot of the other ones
they look military so same here on the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.459
other side

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.550
there's the front and then the tops
really cool

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.850
this shows a lot of luggage it's
carrying

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.880
which that's awesome

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.460
I her little matchbox vehicle than here
you got a helicopter

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.280
are this must be the he looks almost
like the original on

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.470
this says Isla new bar

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.740
chance for and Essar rotors that
actually spin

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.650
so that looks cool the rotor spins and
the tail rotor spends

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.980
it's got three tires for landing

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.500
the front and it looks really cool and
the other side is pretty much the same

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.410
as the new barnes says

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.060
molecular transport wall

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.140
is awesome matchbox

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.020
vehicles Glenn here you got the coolest
one

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.700
I think these are us praise these are
the ones that have the tilting wings

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.990
see when they they can take off
vertically like a helicopter

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.520
rotors actually do spin once they're in
the air

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.780
then they put put the wings down forward

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.950
and they fly at the speed of an airplane

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.780
so here you've got the maneuverability
the helicopter to come straight up

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.650
want its forward you have the speed oven
airplane

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.970
let's take a closer look this missus

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.590

is cool

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.270
