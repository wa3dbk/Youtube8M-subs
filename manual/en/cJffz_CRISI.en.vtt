00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.340
"Vegetables Rate by Nitrate"

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.300
“Therefore,” the researchers conclude,
“we advocate consumption of a diet high

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.340
in nitrate (a natural strategy) to treat
hypertension (high blood pressure),

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.280
pre-hypertension, and to protect
individuals at risk of adverse

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.000
vascular events [like heart attacks].”

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.180
So, if you want to try this at home,
either to boost your athletic

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.280
performance, or protect yourself
from cardiovascular disease, which

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.520
foods are the best sources?

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.600
What do you think?

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.020
Is it beans; bulb vegetables (like
garlic and onions); fruiting vegetables

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.360
(like eggplant, squash, tomatoes),
green leafies; mushrooms; root vegetables

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.060
(like carrots, beets, potatoes); or stem
vegetables (like asparagus and celery)?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.760
Well, in milligrams per 100 gram
serving: Greens win the day!

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.660
Here are the top ten
widely available sources.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.080
And with all this talk about beet juice,
you’d think beets might be #1,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.100
but they just barely
made the top ten list.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.000
Swiss chard has more; next comes oak
leaf lettuce; then beet greens; basil;

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.980
spring greens, like mesclun mix;
butter leaf lettuce; cilantro;

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.160
rhubarb; and arugula (also
known as rocket lettuce).

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.260
Now, beet juice would actually be here,
but we always want to choose whole foods

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.540
to maximize the nutrition.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.900
As you can see, there was
actually one stem vegetable,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.160
and it came in #2, even—rhubarb!

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.960
But eight out of the top ten are
green leafies, with the winner

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.500
by a large margin being arugula!

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.700
18 times more nitrate than kale!

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.480
I may have a new favorite vegetable.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.460
Ten years ago, a pair of twin Harvard
studies found the more fruits

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.780
and vegetables you eat, the lower
your risk of heart disease.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.460
The most powerful protector —
green leafy vegetables.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.800
And now, perhaps, we know why.
