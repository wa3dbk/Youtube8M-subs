00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.740
Hi this is Steve from DrumDial. This is our
official Digital DrumDial Calibration video.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.780
To power up, briefly press the "ON / OFF"
button.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.619
Eights will display.
When the zero appears, the tuner is ready for calibration.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.160
Press and hold the "CAL" button for 3
seconds to calibrate the DrumDial.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.509
Press the "ON / OFF" button for one second to go into sleep mode.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.449
If you press and hold the "ON / OFF" button
for 3 seconds the tuner will turn completely off

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.449
and then will need to be re-calibrated
when turned back on.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.960
Don't turn the tuner completely off, unless
you won't be using it for a few days. 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.960
It's easier to leave it in sleep mode than to turn it completely off.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.579
Find the battery compartment on the side of
the tuner head.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.289
Using a small flat head screw driver, open
the battery compartment and remove the entire battery holder.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.420
Remove the old 2032 button type battery and
replace it with a new one.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.759
Note the positive side of the battery.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.149
Place the positive side down into the battery
holder.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.920
Replace the holder back into the compartment
with the shiny negative side of the battery

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.350
facing to the back of the tuner, while the
black part faces to the front of the tuner.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.350
Press the battery holder back into place and re-calibrate.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.840
Here's a final demonstration of sleep mode,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.260
power off mode,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.510
power on

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.480
and re-calibration.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.470
Your tuner will go into sleep mode automatically
after 5 minutes of non use.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.290
We hope you found this video to be helpful.
Thanks from Drumdial.
