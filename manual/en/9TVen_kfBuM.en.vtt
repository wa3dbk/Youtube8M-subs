00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.990
Hey, look at this! It's a monster, from Gateway.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.320
It's one of the Gateway FX series towers, and this thing is pretty serious.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.930
It's come to play, and it's come to play hard. It's definitely a solid, solid machine,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.570
especially if you're looking for something that is going to be able to run your games,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.300
be really, really fast, and you want to be able to  do it without having to build it yourself

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200
or upgrade something, this is one to have a look at.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.960
It comes with an Intel Core 2 Quad 2.5 gigahertz--

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.780
that's the Q9300 processor... it's also got four gigabytes of DDR2 memory

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.700
right in the box. Comes preloaded with Vista Ultimate,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.770
it's got two 500-gigabyte hard drives, so it's got a full terabyte of storage

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.700
inside of this monster case. It's got two gigabit ethernet ports built in,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.750
it's got-- look at this; take a look up here,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.940
two optical drives, this one right here is actually

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.150
a combination Blu-ray drive and HD DVD drive.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.560
So if you've still got some of your  HD DVD discs lying around,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.720
you made the wrong choice. If you went all betamax

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.800
and you ended up with your HD DVDs, this will still be able to play those,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.890
as well as play your Blu-ray movies too. And it also will read DVDs,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.510
and then this drive right here  is your DVD-RW drive,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.990
which is going to do all of your CD and DVD burning,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.600
and it also has the LabelFlash technology built in so you can burn all of your images

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.610
and all of your texts and all that stuff onto your DVDs as well.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.570
So this thing comes right out of the box absolutely, you know,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.540
ready to go, in terms of playing all your movies and burning all your DVDs.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.630
It comes with a SoundBlaster X-Fi Extreme Gamer Sound Card in it, as well,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.740
so you're not using the onboard sound, you're not using the RealTek

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.830
or the HD audio on-board sound on this thing, it actually has a very, very nice

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.370
SoundBlaster X-Fi card built into it, it's got an NVidia GeForce 9800 GT

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.700
built in as well, and that one has 512 megabytes,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.900
one of the factory-overclocked cards, and it also has a beefy 700-watt power supply

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.900
all in this machine. So it's a serious machine,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.410
I mean, this thing is going to be able to play your games,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.160
it's going to be able to do anything, and it can do it all fast.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.460
Let me show you what we've got going on in the front here,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.260
we already saw our lovely optical drives here, but on the front we also have a USB port

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.790
and look at this, your card readers are right up here as well,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.280
you've got CompactFlash, you've got all of your SD, MMC, all of the smaller format cards

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.850
are all here as well, and also down here you've got two firewire ports right here,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.140
two more USB ports, and your headphone and your microphone

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.900
all easily accessible to you  on the front of the case.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.440
Now on the back here-- this a heavy machine...

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.910
...there we go, as you can see, attention-- please do not use the built-in audio here

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.800
because it does have that X-Fi audio  built into it, so, again, you know,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.470
if you get one of these, don't plug it in here.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.880
That's what that stickers for, so that you don't plug it in here.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.580
There's your Dual Gigabit Ethernet Ports right there, you got four more USBs,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.360
a firewire here, and your mouse and your keyboard PS/2 ports as well,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.500
down here you've got two DVI and S-video for your video here,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.940
and then of course this is your very, very lovely X-Fi card down here,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.100
so you can get all of that really, really high definition audio

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.420
out of this thing, it sounds amazing.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.830
If you've ever actually used one of the X-Fi cards instead of the built-in audio,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.910
you've recognized it-- they sound absolutely awesome.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.500
So much better than the built-in audio. So, it's also really nice and easy 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.690
to get into this case, just one single latch,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.410
one single thumb screw and you're in, really just pop this off and you're in,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.750
it's that simple. They do some very nice cable management

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.600
inside this computer, so, you know, it's not a mess of cables.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.710
Everything's nicely wrapped, everything's nicely routed around the case,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.500
sure you've seen custom jobs that are a little bit better than this,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.800
but typically, you know, you don't see a PC out of a factory

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.680
that's this well designed and this well laid out, like this one.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.880
Down here are your two SATA hard drives, dual 500-gigabyte drives here,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.730
so you do have a total of one-terabyte of storage on this computer.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.390
So you've got tons and tons of storage here.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.400
Over here is your 9800 GT card, that one has 512 megabytes of memory.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.480
The computer also comes with an SLI bridge, so you can add another one

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.200
should you deem that neccessary, and of course your X-Fi card is down here as well.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.360
As you can see up here, all of your memory slots are full

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.980
in this computer, you have four one-gig DIMMs right up here.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.260
All your SATAs are right over here... This computer also has a molex power adapter

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.660
right on the motherboard in case you need it. So it's all laid out very, very nicely,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.920
it's all very, very clean, and it's very easy to upgrade, 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.790
it's got a really, really great board in there and it's going to be just a--

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.300
it's a real enthusiast machine. I mean, if you don't want to build one,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.130
this would be a good one to have a look at. It's pretty serious. I wouldn't mess with it.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.200
It'd probably beat me down. Easily. And quickly. And swiftly.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.330
This one also comes with a keyboard and mouse, which is very nice of them to throw that in there,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.600
don't you think? You've got all your media controls

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.290
located on the top of the keyboard, you have a very nice padded wrist...thing

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.460
on it too, and your optical mouse is included as well, just for good measure,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.410
because, you know, computers don't really work that well without one of the these.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.510
So, they throw it in there, because you really kind of need one.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.400
But yeah, this thing's serious, Core 2 Quad, 2.5 gigahertz,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.200
the Q9300, four gigabytes of RAM, dual 500-gigabyte hard drives built in there,

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.220
the 9800 GT card, and the power supply-- 700-watts on the power supply,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.340
so there's plenty of juice pumping through this thing as well.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.810
So, very upgradeable, but right out of the box this thing is a monster,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.210
and is going to be able to do all of your games, and be able to run all of your

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.490
high-intensity applications, pretty much whatever you through at this thing

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.310
it's going to be able to handle. This is pretty top-of-the-line, so go check it out.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:43.780
It's the Gateway FX542X. Good luck. For more information on the Gateway FX series
