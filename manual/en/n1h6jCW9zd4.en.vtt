Hey everybody!  This is Randy Santel, "Atlas" with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions

00:00:09.054 --> 00:00:11.694
and proud owner of FoodChallenges.com

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.700
I'm stoked today!  I'm still on my quest for 200.  I'm going for win #192 tonight.  I'm in West Village

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.433
of Manhattan of New York City.  I'm at A Salt &amp; Battery, taking on their Fat Bastard Challenge!

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:30.434
It is not healthy that's for sure!  We've got one pound of fried cod

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:40.014
1.5 lbs of chips, and 8 oz peas, and two tarter sauce sides, and then I have to finish the soda.

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:44.740
I had a choice of diet or regular, and since I'm on a diet (obviously) I went with the diet coke

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.613
and a little water to help me.  I've got 20 minutes to finish this food challenge.

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:55.733
If I do I'll get it free and a shirt.  If I finish it in 30 minutes or less I get a shirt but I still

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.680
have to pay for the meal.  The record up on their Wall of Fame

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.360
is 10:59.  We're about to crush that, so lets get it started!

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.560
This isn't a big restaurant, so that's why it's setup like this!

00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:31.814
I'm going to do the fish first, then the chips, then the peas and everything else.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.113
One, two, three!

00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:29.813
I really don't want to eat this later so I'm just going to eat it now!

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.340
Don't do this at home!

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.820
Under 5 minutes!  Smoked the record! Cut it in over half!

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.366
Got the meal free, a sweet t-shirt, Ill be on the top of their Wall of Fame!

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:04.188
Most importantly win #192!  Thanks for watching!
