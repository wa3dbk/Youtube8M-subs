00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.860
This video shows how to diagnose a 30.01.40
and a 99.04.20 error.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.410
These errors are caused by power fluctuations
that result in the formatter and scanner mechanism

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.759
being out of sync.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.050
The device shown is the Digital Sender Flow 8500fn1.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.800
These steps might vary depending on your model.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.500
If the control panel is displaying a 30.01.40
or a 99.04.20 error message,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.010
use the following steps to determine if replacing
the ICB will resolve the issue.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.100
First, press the power button to turn the device off.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.580
With the shutdown option selected, select
OK on the control panel.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.030
The device is powered off when the power button
light is blinking.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.399
The power button light on the Scanjet Enterprise

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.130
and the Digital Sender Flow 8500 is different
from other FutureSmart devices.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.510
A blinking power button light on the 8500
indicates that the power is off.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.130
After the device powers off, wait several seconds.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.250
Then locate the ADF light on the side of the
ADF input tray.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.380
Load a piece of paper into the ADF input tray.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.500
If the ADF light turns on when paper is loaded,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.320
the scanner mechanism is on and the formatter
and scanner are out of sync.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.480
Repeat this process several times to confirm that

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.439
the ADF light turns on when the device is powered off.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.850
If the ADF light continues to turn on,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.950
the error can be cleared by disconnecting
the power cord for 30 seconds.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.870
Replacing the ICB will address the vulnerability
to power fluctuations,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.040
thereby preventing future occurrences of this error.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.060
If the ADF light does not turn on when you load paper,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.080
the error is not due to power fluctuations

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.500
and will not be resolved by replacing the ICB.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.700
A replacement scanner assembly might resolve the issue.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.080
