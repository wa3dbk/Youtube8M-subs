00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:04.137
What's up, motherfucker?
(talks like a German)

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:05.100
How you doing, "boludo"?
(talks like a Argentinean)

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.901
Well, here retaining blood,

00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.801
while Yellow is trying to create
new diarrheas.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:10.701
You come?

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:11.712
Now I can't ...

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:13.834
I am trying to don't
wake up from the coma.

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:14.615
True...

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:18.434
Anyway it's normal this
man is in coma...

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:19.634
...and with diarrhea...

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:20.587
Beware!

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:21.655
A megavitamin!

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:22.701
Oh, shit!

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:23.757
What can we do ?

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:25.192
If we move?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.593
We can't!

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:27.528
Oh, no!

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:28.161
He touched me!

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.429
"¡La concha de la Lora!"

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.000
Ha!

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.968
¡Al menos, yo me libro de esta!
(talks like a French)

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.434
Oh, sacré bleu!

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:34.868
Another megavitamin!

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.103
Quiet pive...

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:39.072
Because this body is in easy
mode, doesn't mean that...

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.067
*SCREAM*

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.074
Have you seen him?

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.934
He died next to me!

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:43.968
*SCREAM*

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:44.500
What horror...

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:45.200
What horror ...!

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:46.280
WHAT HORROR!!

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:47.300
Let it, man...

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.448
What are we going to do...

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:53.153
Next time we reincarnated in a
"less violent" puzzle videogame...

00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:54.067
Well, I do not know...

00:00:54.067 --> 00:00:56.467
I wouldn't to be a piece of
Tetris...

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:57.467
If I 'm honest...

00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:00.067
And what about a one piece
of Columns?

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:02.696
Yes, the destination can be
same horrible...

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:05.065
But at least, we will be fucking
jewels!

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:06.767
But we died too!

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.500
I said FU-KING-JE-WELS!

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:10.667
Well...

00:01:10.968 --> 00:01:12.306
My time has come...

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:13.868
Nice to meet you, man...

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:15.834
Well, destiny...

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.511
We have a meeting.

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:18.834
*SIGH*

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.480
My mother always said...

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:21.601
When you're older,

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.951
you must study "brain tumorology"
carrer.

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:26.053
That is a work of truth.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:27.367
But no...

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:31.901
Like a fool I'm study
the diarrhea carrer for
this...

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.428
What reason did my mother...

00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:38.434
Oh, mon Dieu!

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:39.466
It's a miracle!

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.334
Thanks for this second chance, life!

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.601
My goal starting today will not only diarrheas!

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:48.709
I going to create the best
disease in the world!

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:49.601
Oh yeah!

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:51.033
I'm the fucking master!

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:55.901
Your first day of practice!

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:56.334
You go...

00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:59.119
And you drop that megavitamin
bottle im that man!?

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:00.988
Hey Mario...

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.091
When, where and why did you

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:04.801
Ah...

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:05.234
Okay...

00:02:05.234 --> 00:02:06.093
I didn't say anything!

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.061
Let's heal another patient...
