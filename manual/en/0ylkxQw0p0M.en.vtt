Now, I have my bridal veil. There's a lot
of leaves on this. I'm not going to be too

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.120
afraid just to dig in. I'm going to start
with some scissors. I'm going to start by

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.450
just taking some off. I suggest doing this
outside if possible because I'm going to make

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:34.660
a mess. I'm just going to take off some of
the bottom. As you can see, the inside, there's

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:50.720
no light in there, there's no air. This guy
needs a haircut.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:59.880
See if I can even find the pot. It's up there.
The harder I cut it back, the longer it's

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:09.369
going to take to grow back. We're going to
take some off the bottom and take some off

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.530
the top as well. If you don't take it off
the top, you're going to end up with a hole

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.110
on top.
I'm not going to do the whole plant right

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:37.429
now. So we
got one. One started. This is going to come

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:44.590
back gangbusters. I can probably take some
more out from the inside where it's not really

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:58.799
growing. Look. This is just yuck. There we
go. We have one down.
