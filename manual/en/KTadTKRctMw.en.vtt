00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:01.569
- Hey, guys!

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:03.581
Today is our second episode in our

00:00:03.581 --> 00:00:05.758
"When Homemade is Worth It" series.

00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:08.520
And today we are tackling pasta sauces.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.470
Pasta sauces are one of those things

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.949
that are so much better when
you make them from scratch.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.229
They're so easy to do.

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.204
They're more affordable.

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:16.403
And I'm telling you, you'll never

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:17.967
go back to that stuff in a jar.

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:19.599
Today I'm going to show you three

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.646
of my favorite, all time
homemade pasta sauces.

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.741
First up, let's start with a classic,

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:26.346
a pomodoro sauce.

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:28.845
Now, pomodoro is essentially just tomato,

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:30.877
garlic, a little bit of olive oil,

00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:32.421
and of course, fresh basil.

00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:34.400
It doesn't get any easier than this.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.130
It's also a really
inexpensive idea for dinner.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.724
So if you're looking for a cheap eat,

00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:40.085
this one is for you.

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.257
So we're first going to boil our pasta.

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:44.066
Now, I really love to serve this sauce

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.528
with an angel hair pasta

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:47.337
because it cooks up so quickly

00:00:47.337 --> 00:00:49.003
and it also looks really elegant

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.075
if you want to serve
this for a dinner party.

00:00:51.428 --> 00:00:52.412
While your pasta is boiling,

00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:53.875
you can prep your tomatoes.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:56.232
So we're going to use
Roma tomatoes for this.

00:00:56.232 --> 00:00:58.341
I think that they tend to work the best.

00:00:58.341 --> 00:00:59.946
We're just going to slice them in half

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.910
and then give them a quick dice

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.247
so that they're nice, bite-sized pieces.

00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:07.007
Then in a large skillet
you're going to heat

00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:08.127
some olive oil,

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.183
throw the tomatoes in,

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.129
and start to give them a nice saute.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.881
You're basically looking
for those tomatoes

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.991
to start to break down and
create a little bit of a juice.

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:20.158
At this point you want to throw in

00:01:20.158 --> 00:01:22.789
one clove of minced garlic.

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:23.986
Now, if you have a garlic press,

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:25.124
I highly recommend it

00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:28.049
because you'll get a really
nice even mince that way.

00:01:28.975 --> 00:01:30.583
Go ahead and let that simmer.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:32.432
And at this point if
you want your tomatoes

00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:34.281
to be a little bit saucier,

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.292
you can either add a splash of white wine,

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:38.384
a squeeze of lemon juice,

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:39.922
or a little bit of water.

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.242
Go ahead and just let that simmer down.

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:44.455
And you'll see a beautiful
sauce will develop.

00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:47.628
You can season it with a little
salt and pepper to taste.

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:49.563
You may want to add a little bit more salt

00:01:49.563 --> 00:01:51.372
than you normally would to food

00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:53.545
because the thing to
know about pasta sauce

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:55.699
is that when the sauce hits that pasta,

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.956
that pasta is going to
soak up all that sauce

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:59.543
and also all of that salt.

00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:00.661
So you may just want to take it

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:02.611
a little bit further
than you normally would

00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:04.780
just to make sure it's well flavored.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.137
And at that point you're
going to add the fresh basil,

00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:11.547
give that a stir,

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:14.197
and presto, your sauce is done.

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:15.964
At this point I like to take the pasta

00:02:15.964 --> 00:02:17.833
and add it to my sauce,

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:19.032
give it a good stir,

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:21.165
making sure that all
of that sauce and pasta

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:22.663
is well incorporated.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.448
And then you can serve.

00:02:25.448 --> 00:02:27.480
I love to serve pasta
with some kitchen tongs

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.187
because I find that it's a really easy way

00:02:29.187 --> 00:02:31.747
to grip the pasta, twist, and turn it

00:02:31.747 --> 00:02:33.570
into a nice, pretty nest.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.684
Then you can garnish with
a little fresh Parmesan,

00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:40.697
a sprig of basil, and there you have it,

00:02:40.697 --> 00:02:42.424
a delicious, easy pasta sauce

00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:44.207
that came together in minutes.

00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:45.970
Now we're going to go from something light

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.900
to something heavy and decadent.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.444
Sometimes you are just in the mood

00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:52.045
for something really
naughty, and this is it.

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:53.536
Pasta Alfredo.

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:55.333
It doesn't get much better than this.

00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:59.183
Now, Alfredo sauce is really
best paired with fettuccine.

00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:00.788
I think it's a classic combination

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:02.210
that you can't go wrong.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.745
So go ahead and get
your fettuccine boiling.

00:03:04.746 --> 00:03:06.632
Then we're going to prepare our sauce.

00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:08.412
We're going to take out a large skillet.

00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:11.306
We're going to add four
tablespoons of butter.

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.825
Let that melt down.

00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:15.435
And then you're going to add

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:17.665
a cup and 1/2 of heavy cream.

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:18.333
I know.

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.020
This is why it's naughty. (chuckles)

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.747
But this is also why it's really good.

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:23.922
I have tried it with
milk and half and half,

00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:25.261
and it's just not the same.

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:28.475
So you got to kind of use
the full fat heavy cream.

00:03:29.061 --> 00:03:31.702
Once your sauce is nice
and simmering and bubbling,

00:03:31.702 --> 00:03:33.734
you can add a clove of garlic.

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:37.100
So the garlic is basically going
to steep in that warm cream

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.055
and it's going to create a
beautiful infused garlic flavor

00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:41.403
throughout our sauce.

00:03:42.018 --> 00:03:44.492
Then we're going to add
1/2 a teaspoon of salt,

00:03:45.237 --> 00:03:47.559
a little bit of freshly cracked pepper,

00:03:48.614 --> 00:03:50.099
and then you're going
to let the sauce simmer

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.919
just until it starts
to bubble and thicken.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.895
Once it reaches that stage,

00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:56.419
you can go ahead and add a cup

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.933
of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:01.904
Then because this sauce
is so rich and decadent,

00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:04.199
I do like to add some vegetables in there.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.491
So I really like to add 1/3
of a cup of frozen peas.

00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:08.649
They'll cook up in a minute.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.275
All you have to do is
add them to the sauce

00:04:10.275 --> 00:04:11.935
and give them a quick stir.

00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:14.709
Then when your fettuccine is done,

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.616
you can add it to your pasta sauce,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.067
give it a good stir,

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:19.631
making sure that all of that sauce

00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:22.125
and the peas are incorporating
with the fettuccine.

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:24.914
Go ahead and take those kitchen tongs

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:27.204
and serve it into your shallow bowl,

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:28.604
give it a twist,

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:30.068
and then you're going to garnish

00:04:30.068 --> 00:04:32.746
with a little bit more
freshly cracked pepper,

00:04:33.828 --> 00:04:36.322
and some roughly chopped parsley.

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:38.115
And there you have it,

00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:39.902
pasta sauce number two down,

00:04:39.902 --> 00:04:41.568
fettuccine Alfredo,

00:04:41.568 --> 00:04:44.001
a classic that I know you
guys are going to love.

00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:46.508
Now moving on to one
of my favorite sauces,

00:04:46.508 --> 00:04:48.114
pesto sauce.

00:04:48.114 --> 00:04:50.855
Pesto is a great sauce
to know and have on hand,

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:53.132
especially as we're headed
into the summer months

00:04:53.132 --> 00:04:54.899
and basil is in season.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.626
The other reason why I like pesto sauce

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:59.471
is that it's equally
good served hot or cold.

00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:01.868
It makes for a perfect
salad to bring to a picnic

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.802
or a great weeknight meal as well.

00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:05.413
Now, when it comes to pesto sauce,

00:05:05.413 --> 00:05:08.155
I really love to serve it with
that little corkscrew pasta

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:09.720
because I find that it really does get

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.976
into all the nooks and
crannies of the pasta

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:14.124
and holds the sauce really well.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.566
So to get started, in a food processor

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.208
we're going to add two cups of basil,

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.482
a clove of garlic,

00:05:22.564 --> 00:05:24.631
three tablespoons of pine nuts,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.393
a 1/2 a teaspoon of salt,

00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:30.981
and 1/4 teaspoon of
freshly cracked pepper.

00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:32.156
Go ahead and give that a whirl.

00:05:32.156 --> 00:05:34.393
And then you want to scrape
down the bowl periodically

00:05:34.393 --> 00:05:36.139
just to make sure that all that basil

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.704
is becoming finely minced

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.731
and incorporating with the pine nuts.

00:05:40.488 --> 00:05:41.849
Then with the machine running,

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.718
you're going to slowly
add 1/4 cup of olive oil.

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:46.911
And you'll see a beautiful
sauce will develop.

00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:48.435
Then you're going to stop your machine,

00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:50.931
transfer your pesto sauce into a bowl,

00:05:51.378 --> 00:05:53.911
and then add your grated Parmesan cheese.

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:56.212
Now, when heating pesto sauce,

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:57.065
you'll want to be careful

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.676
because you don't want to burn the cheese.

00:05:58.676 --> 00:05:59.794
And sometimes what'll happen

00:05:59.794 --> 00:06:01.723
is the sauce will
actually separate on you.

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.268
So the better thing to do, I think,

00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:04.853
is to take the cold pesto sauce

00:06:04.853 --> 00:06:06.925
and mix it with the warm pasta.

00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:08.469
And chances are the heat from the pasta

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:09.768
will actually heat the sauce.

00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:10.965
And you'll be good to go.

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:13.721
Go ahead and serve your pasta in a bowl,

00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:16.577
top with a little more
grated Parmesan cheese,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.709
garnish with a little sprig of basil,

00:06:18.986 --> 00:06:20.266
and there you have it.

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:22.631
Pasta pesto sauce is ready to go.

00:06:22.631 --> 00:06:25.438
I love this recipe because it
has all the flavors of summer.

00:06:25.438 --> 00:06:27.105
It's a great filling dish

00:06:27.105 --> 00:06:29.319
that makes for a perfect
dinner party entree

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.919
or again a cold lunch the next day.

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:35.964
So there you have it, my
three favorite pasta sauces.

00:06:35.964 --> 00:06:37.936
I hope you guys give these ones a try.

00:06:37.936 --> 00:06:39.338
Let me know what you think.

00:06:39.338 --> 00:06:41.878
They are all classics that
you cannot go wrong with.

00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:44.518
And I tell you, once you make
your own homemade pasta sauce,

00:06:44.518 --> 00:06:46.612
you're never going to go
back to that stuff in a jar.

00:06:46.612 --> 00:06:48.806
If you'd like the full printed
recipe to these dishes,

00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:50.187
you can head over to my website,

00:06:50.187 --> 00:06:51.874

or you can find the full recipe

00:06:53.255 --> 00:06:55.264
in the video description here below.

00:06:55.264 --> 00:06:55.793
All right, you guys.

00:06:55.793 --> 00:06:57.499
I'll see you next time, bye!

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:58.495
(upbeat music)

00:06:58.495 --> 00:07:00.120
♫ Make it ooze with the unthinkable

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.007
♫ Don't stop till you come first

00:07:02.007 --> 00:07:03.856
♫ Life so unpredictable

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:05.826
♫ Take control of what you're worth

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:07.716
♫ Wasting time's forgivable

00:07:07.716 --> 00:07:09.686
♫ But nobody wants to grow old

00:07:09.686 --> 00:07:11.475
♫ It's time for the original

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:13.588
♫ To come and break the mold

00:07:13.588 --> 00:07:17.387
♫ Take it easy

00:07:17.387 --> 00:07:21.125
♫ Just one step at a time

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.986
♫ And baby you'll be fine ♫
