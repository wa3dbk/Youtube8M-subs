00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.440
A wood router, is a necessary shop tool, but
they can be awkward to work with when you

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.719
have to freehand your projects. There's a
better way, and it doesn't have to be expensive.

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.039
In this project, we're turning any ordinary
table, into a multipurpose work bench, with

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.359
a built-in, flush mount router station.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.690
For this project, we're gonna need a wood
router. I found this one, on my local classifieds.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.640
And we're gonna need a square foot of plexiglass
or acrylic like this. This piece is 1/4" thick,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.530
it's crystal clear, and only cost $5.00 from
a local plastics company. Let's get started

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.500
by choosing a good spot on the table, then
tracing the edges of the square with a pencil,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.950
or a pen. You can see I've put a 1/2" straight
bit into the chuck of this router, and now

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.510
if we measure from the edge of the blade,
to the side of the sub-base, the distance

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.130
is 2-5/8". I used that measurement to cut
a piece of wood that matches perfectly flush

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.630
with the side. Ok, now we can go ahead and
use our piece of wood as a measuring tool,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.670
to draw a border around the outside of the
square. Next, we'll need to draw an inner

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.140
square, about 1-1/4" smaller than the first
one. I decided to angle the corners, for aesthetics,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.300
and support, and now all the markings and
measurements look like this.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120
Alright, it's time to cut ourselves a hole.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.080
Let's start by using a large drill bit to
make holes on the inner sides of the angled

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.030
lines. This way, we can insert the jigsaw
blade and begin cutting right away. The goal

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.439
here is to cut each line as straight as possible,
and when we make it back to the starting point,

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.490
the center piece should fall right out. Now
we still need this plastic plate, to sink

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.880
down flush with the top of the table. And
we'll be able to do that with the help of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.590
8 concrete paving stones. The concrete squares
need to line up perfectly with the outside

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.290
edges of the outer square, and when they're
all aligned, it's time for the action.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.640
Let's use the plastic plate, to gauge the cutting
depth. And we can do that by adjusting the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.180
height of the sub-base, until the tip of the
bit, is flush with the top of the plate. Now

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.700
when we turn on the router, and rest the base
flat on the table, it should be cutting down

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.850
to the exact depth of the plastic mounting
plate. You can see that as we move along in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.549
a clockwise direction, the concrete blocks
prevent the side of the router from going

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.080
out of bounds. This helps keep the cuts clean
and straight, and in-line with the markings

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.330
we made around the plate. Now that we've cut
the outer boundary, we can freehand the router

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.930
back and forth, until the inner bits are profiled
down as well, then finish up, by sanding the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.620
new surface smooth. Now if you look at the
corners, you might notice they're a bit rounded,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.090
so let's just grind a little bit of plastic
off the corners of the plate, to match the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.780
curves. And now you can see that now the plate
will drop straight in, and sit flush with

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.000
the top of the table.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.739
Ok, it's time to mount the plate, to the router
base.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.940
There are 3 screws holding the base plate
on, and when those are removed, it comes off

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.840
very easily. If we center it on our square,
we can use it as a template, to mark the position

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.940
of the screw holes, then drill them out with
a 7/32" drill bit. Now I tried taking a little

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.849
off the top with a 3/8" bit, and ended up
with a countersink effect. You can see that

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.959
when the screws are set back in, they sit
flush with the top, but don't catch on anything

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.239
sliding over them. The next step is to drill
a hole in the center with a 1-1/2" Forstner

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.440
bit, then make two more holes, in line with
the center using a 7/8" bit. These two holes

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.080
will give us handles to remove, and replace
the router at will. Let's go ahead and remove

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.099
the protective paper now, then line the plate
up on the router where the sub-base used to

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.410
sit. The original screws can be returned,
to secure the new plate in place, and you

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.840
can see the plastic is more than strong enough
to support the weight of the router. I added

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.659
a couple of beams underneath to re-enforce
the table top, and prevent it from sagging

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.209
over time. For a nice finishing touch, let's
try cutting a piece of black construction

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.670
paper, to make a decorative lining for our
new router station. At this point, our router

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.170
table is completely finished, and ready for
operation. For our first project, why don't

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.860
we try routing the edges of our new table
with this 3/4" beading bit. You'll notice

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.620
that even with the custom mounting plate,
the router is still completely portable, for

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.879
any projects you need to router by hand. The
extra surface area of the plate, actually

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.730
keeps the unit more stable, and helps ensure
the cut lines are as straight as they can

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.920
be. Now just for fun, I gave my table a paint
job so when the router sets in place, the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.650
whole thing has got a clean professional look
to it. I also rigged up a switch box for electrical

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.299
power, that will give us the option of turning
on a backlight, and starting up the router

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.799
from a safer distance. Now, one of the things
I like best about this design, is that the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.080
bit can be fully retracted when we don't need
it. This means we still have full access to

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.389
the entire work table. And that can be very
helpful for projects like the rocket rifle

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.449
that we made in a previous project. And because
the system is so easy to remove and replace,

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.669
changing out router bits is simple as well.
Well now you know, how to add a professional

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.270
looking, flush mount router station, to any
work table. So go ahead and make a picture

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.159
frame, put finishing touches on experimental
projects, or makes some puzzles for entertaining

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:51.270
friends, because now you can. That's it for
now. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.290
