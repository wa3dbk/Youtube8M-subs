Hi this is Mike Peaslee from Soundiron with a deeper look at what's inside the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.640
symphony series brass ensemble

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.470
by Soundiron and Native Instruments. This is a full thirty-two piece, four section

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.580
Divisi ensemble for film soundtrack
production and symphony scoring.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.120
But we built it to be easy to use for

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.050
anyone with the desire to make awesome
orchestral music from beginner to pro

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.630
Just To give you a quick overview of some the basic nuts-and-bolts behind symphony series

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.440
brass ensemble

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.699
I'm gonna take you through the main ensemble preset. It offers a streamlined and

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.910
simplified set of articulations and
controls for easy and fast scoring when you

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.059
just need the basics

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.199
now let's play to the core sounds you
find in just this preset

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.969
we've got sustain, staccato, and several
expressions to work with in the articulation

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.149
slots pop-up menu

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.879
you can assign up to eight slots for instant playback. Click edit to customize

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.449
each lot with keyswitch assignment,
midi automation, slot volume, and velocity

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.170
layering options in the articulation slot
Setup window

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.190
Here are the sustains. You can swell from
piano to forte using the dynamics knob

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.740
You can also use two styles of scripted poly-phonic legato (flip and slur)

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.689
with interval response control. You'll find natural true-legato in the individual

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:14.320
section

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.070
legato presets. We'll get into legato in a
later video but it's pretty damn awesome

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.240
and easy to get the hang of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.660
And now staccatos. You can see the current round robin step as you play and check out the repeater system

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.069
it lets you automatically trigger multi
tongue attacks for added punch

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.319
And now the decrescendos

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.390
these hit hard and then fade out slowly

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.340
Here are the Sforzandos, great for fanfare
and big strikes

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.580
Here are crescendos. These build up from soft pianissimo to a big release

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.320
And now the swells

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.040
great for making pads and building
tension

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.560
Finally

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.970
these are fortissimo blasts. We usually
call these marcatos at the studio

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.440
there somewhere between long staccato and short sustain perfect for emphasizing

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.740
really big dramatic moments

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.700
And check out the repeater system
again

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.610
it lets you automatically trigger 
the multi-tongue attacks for added punch

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.820
with your expressions as well

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.240
and this is just a taste of the library

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.070
a huge number other chromatic articulations are found throughout the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.960
individual section preset folders

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.449
along with tons of special effects to
add spice. Check out more of our videos  to hear

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.539
and see more of what this massive library
can do

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.339
including tutorials and walk-throughs.
We'll be releasing more videos as we go along

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.490
so stay tuned and if there's anything we
missed let us know

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.050
we'll make a video. Thanks, this is Mike
from Soundiron.
