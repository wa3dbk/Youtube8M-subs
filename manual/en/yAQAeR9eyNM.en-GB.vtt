00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.490
Hey, Food Tube. It's me Hannah Hart, host
of the most excellent cooking programme online;

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.400
My Drunk Kitchen.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.029
I'm in Jamie Oliver's kitchen
because he invited me to his Christmas party

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.130
and the key to getting through any Christmas
party is to drink profusely at the start of

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.000
it.
Mulled wine.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.200
Ahh. Oh no!

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.810
Ah god, Jamie's cake. Umm, this is how you
make friends everything is good. Okay, so

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.870
I took a picture of it before, does this look
about the same?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.160
Oh no.
So now that you've ruined Christmas and potentially

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.699
the Christmas party and arguably your blossoming
friendship with one Jamie Oliver. It's time

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.500
to try and save the day. So, how do we make a Christmas cake?

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.960
Step one, find some conveniently placed brandied

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.960
fruit, add some more Brandy as a coping mechanism.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.100
Mmm. Maybe add some to the fruit.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.860
Mmmm.
The next step is to add some butter and some

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.750
flour? Sugar? Brown sugar, why are you in
this jar? I'm pre measured, pre measured,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.390
pre measured yeaaah!
Boop boop.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.939
Here's a handy, dandy one handed egg cracking
trick.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.750
Wow! The trick is I tricked you into watching,
and believing.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.700
Oh no, appetising. No it's time to add treacle.
Looks like vegemite, tastes like

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.789
regret. Ohh.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.900
Just a little drizzle. Eurgh. Beating it.
Remember it takes an hour to bake this cake

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.630
and Jamie's going to be here as far as I know
any second. So don't dilly dally, add your

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.630
dry ingredients.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.800
It's got a dry finish.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.000
Flour.
Mixed spices. Oh, sift.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.660
Baking powder.
Eurgh.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.820
Putitin. Did I say put it in or put it tin.
You'll never know.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.050
Lay it flat using the tools god gave you.
Or as I call them, hands.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.780
Ey, you're doing great, or terribly. I mean
really it's all about perspective. Now put

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.510
it in the oven for an hour at 350 or 180 I
don't know countries are weird. How do you

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.860
know this isn't just going to catch fire?
More drinks! Mmm.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.000
Jamie Oliver's Food Tube, forgot.
Presents? Probably for me.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.050
It's! Oh, convenient Jamie's new book, the
first edition was called Shave With Jamie

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.690
and was all about "manscaping".
What else is Jamie Oliver going to give away

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.610
to the staff of Jamie Oliver's Jamie Oliver
company. Oh, imagine that!

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.650
Save with Jamie.
Just wait for his pregnancy edition, Crave

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.320
with Jamie about how to satisfy a woman's
needs in her third trimester.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.730
Bing, time's up.
This look delicious.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.700
Cake! Ta da! Good as new! Icing!

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.350
Ohh, oh. Why use water when you can have wine?

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.710
I think Jesus said that, happy Christmas.
Where's more wine?

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.710
Mmm. Take your cake, put it near your face.
Take your icing

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.950
and then really rethink your

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.230
plan. Add more icing sugar using what I call
hand sifting.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.230
This looks basically, whoa! Lesson learned!
Great, crack on. Ahh!

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.480
Oh, what? A battery? Is this mace?
Oh yeah, cool message from Food Tube, totally

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.810
subliminal but pretty surely stating that
I'm totally screwed!

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.350
Hello?
Who are you?

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.519
Who are you?
I'm Jamie Oliver.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.250
No you're not.
Are you okay?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.669
I feel really good. Um I'm sorry can I ask
who you? Are you here to clean?

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.520
Look at me In the eyes. That's it. walk to
me.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.919
I never realised your eyes were so blue.
Okay.

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.250
We've got a problem. I'm going to give you
a hangover cure. If you're the cure, I'll
