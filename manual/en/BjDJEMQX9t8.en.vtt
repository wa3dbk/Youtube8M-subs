00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.880
I can't imagine my garden without grey foliage
plants.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.460
Some of them even bloom.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.660
And with lavender, you can cut the blooms,
dry them and use them as a fire starter for

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.210
your fire places.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:23.370
You know, when you think about gardening,
you think about gray really as a color.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.850
So many other colors to think about when it
comes to flowers.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.570
There's something about gray foliage that
is so beautiful with flowers.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.290
Just look at this bed, for stance.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.900
Here it is, in the spring, and I've got this
Artemisia Powis Castle back here.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.391
And just look at this Lamb's Ear.

00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:42.870
This is called Helen Von Stein.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.260
It's the big eared Lamb's Ear.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.280
Now, this Lamb's Ear will actually produce
a flower.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.280
It's not very showy.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.020
I tend to grow it strictly for its gorgeous
foliage.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.760
But then there are gray foliage plants that
bloom.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.140
Like this one, called Yellow FlambÃ©.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.760
It's actually a Chrysocephalum, which is sort
of a big name for a plant that has a lot of

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760
merit.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.540
Just look at all the flower power this little
guy has.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.390
And this plant will bloom from now until the
first frost.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.729
It's really great.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.080
And what I found with these gray foliage plants,
including the lavender that I'm planting in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.290
this container, is they really need sharp
drainage.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.590
They don't like wet feet.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.270
So you want to make sure that you have a lot
of sand worked into the soil and it doesn't

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.510
hold too much moisture.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.390
The other thing is most of them really like
full sun.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.750
So you want at least 6 hours of sunlight for
these type of plants for them to perform really

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.750
well.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.490
Now, this particular type of lavender is one
called Provence.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.190
And one of the reasons I love it is it's one
of the lavenders that actually does well for

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.210
me here.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.530
And what I've learned is this reason it does
well is that I always plant it in containers,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.090
and I make sure there's plenty of sand.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.030
Just look at all the sand that's in the soil
that these were grown in.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.509
Now, in just a few months these plants will
fill out this entire container, and they'll

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.409
begin to bloom these gorgeous lavender colored
bloom.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.450
But I wish you could smell this foliage.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.450
The foliage itself is so fragrant and makes
it worth growing.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.790
I won't place this particular container in
a saucer--which is something that I usually

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.310
encourage people to do to keep the soil consistently
moist--because these plants don't like too

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.360
much around their roots, just like I said
about these guys over here.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.520
You know, grey is just such a wonderful, harmonizing
color.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.340
It makes everything feel more tranquil.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.640
I have gray gravel here, and even the teak
has weathered to a beautiful sort of gray

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640
patina.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.769
So, when you have so much gray around, and
then you have blooms like this, it allows

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.650
the blooms to really step out and show off.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.200
