Hey Vsauce I'm Jake and I just created a
band called Vsauce Nebula and the Hyper Manifold

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.830
or Wedding Taco of the Traditional Bean. I
haven't decided yet but you can make your

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.830
own with Band Name Maker.com and here are
14 more things you can do online now guys,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.970
DONGs.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.610
This image of London is the largest panoramic
photo ever taken. It is comprised of 48,640

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.530
individual images to create one gigantic 320
gigapixel photo. If you were to print it,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.530
it would be over 321 by 78 feet in size. Because
of it's resolution you can zoom in an incredible

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.420
amount and virtually explore London.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.890
Or you could explore over 100,000 stars, an
amazing and beautiful journey traveling light

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.190
years through the known universe. You can
learn about distant stars and see just how

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.670
small we are in comparison to everything else.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.110
It really gives you a different perspective.
In this flash platformer that Vsaucer Nicholas

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.000
showed me, you are a dog that has to follow
your master through different challenges.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.130
Changing your perspective will turn spikes
into coins and birds into blocks to land on.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.320
Create your own game with sploder that Tommy
Sheets sent in. Choose what kind of game you

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.260
want to make and then add in all the assets
that you want. You can share your finished

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.409
product and also play games that other users
have made.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.020
If your game doesn't work out then here's
a sad violin...dot com.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.250
Just don't cry for too long because They
Will Eat You, a zombie game that has you trekking

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.700
through the woods, avoiding the undead for
as long as you can.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.830
Escape death by going to space in NASA: Prospect.
In this fantastic interactive story, you and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.119
your robot companion progress through our
solar system, collecting the remnants of humankind,

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.060
unraveling a really interesting story, all
to an awesome soundtrack.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.060
But you could be like All Hail RETCON and
wait 400 Years, a flash game where you only

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:14.939
have 400 years to stop a disaster. If you
need to cross a body of water, you have to

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.540
wait for winter for it freezes over. If you
need to climb to a different platform, plant

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.329
a tree and wait for it to grow. You have to
be strategic with your time since it goes

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.290
by so quickly.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.739
Or use your time machine...Jukebox Time Machine.
Play some tunes from the 1940s and look at

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.059
bomb sight.org which maps out all the bombs
dropped on London during the bomb blitz in

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.569
World War 2....which was a lot.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.569
For something more uplifting there is peoplemov.in
which shows you the world's migration patterns.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.090
This interactive infographic gives a really
cool snapshot of where people emigrate from

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.510
and immigrate to.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.329
Instead of tracking the migration patterns
of humans, use Ocearch Global Shark Tracker.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.840
You can even read the bios of these aquatic
death machines so they can lull you into a sense

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.129
of comfort before devouring you. I'm watching
you, Miguel.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:22.129
If you want a different experience try Atum,
a game within a game. Items in the "real"

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.480
world are used to interact with the game world
that you are playing. Use a lighter to illuminate

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.480
sections of the game world or cigarette smoke
to block the view of security cameras.

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.419
Go to the nicest place on the internet for
a virtual hug from a stranger and subscribe

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.480
to Vsauce3 for more DONGs.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.959
Links to everything can be found in the description
below.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.090
I'm Jake and, as always, thanks for watching.
