even wonder how she was still quickly
such parents okay so now the big

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.040
question that's being asked is why is
that racist and i'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.330
say

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.049
and they're not remotely deepened close
it would be a racist if uh...

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:51.569
at t any only belonged to other
african-american women are black women

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:52.170
but

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.440
like impressionist caucasian and she has
amounts of rack an amount that seat

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.329
being given to prevention

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.760
uh... impersonation like that they would
be deeply review

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.049
and also too

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.709
this is the biggest manufactured
congress here all time biggest in terms

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:13.070
of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
totally made up mike added erase this
would act

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.200
okay so but that this really wasn't of
body in a lot of people find out what it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.060
takes a look

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.010
towards that they were the rates

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.830
crew so you can ever present and she
come out

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.570
in black face and on the same thing

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.250
object that would an image

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.140
but i think that's however there are act

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.770
can i turn to our after miramax for to
see we had a pardon

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.429
of the some kind of like

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.040
exhibition on the stand for

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.859
live cd

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.840
or where it came from apparently she's
done something similar before in the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.050
past uh... and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.570
i'd just want to let me personally i
wouldn't want to draw attention to my

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.210
uh... my lady bets you know has like

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.380
let's not do that if she's comfortable
with it then that's fine and you know

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.680
what i think she is drawing attention to
the fact that serena williams is a brick

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.920
house uh... she's my to my tech

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.829
no

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.059
they

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.629
per

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.990
it should not be part of the questions
that someone not that's a you know

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.049
stream into defense to because i think
she gets a lot of

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.329
chris is in the early because of this
observing him enter in real concedes

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.999
because it because he wins

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.720
analy policy in india demand references
utilities so

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.279
that be a good daycare so it's

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.900
let's be honest yet is whether of blue
that's but there's always considered to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.769
be an african-american

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.859
feature really going to have a big
trouble use words like that and

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.599
this is out the truth i think it was a
huge air any came in with the riddler

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.059
which you refer would you be upset like

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:55.849
they carefully that sister attacked the
serum tabloids said the black guys

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.329
cannot be delivered

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.089
were combined with yourself did you guys
being so mean

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.879
bahut

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.640
president think that blog let them get
ridiculed for this

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.150
their natural features i think it comes
from jealousy to be completely honest

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.990
with you because that there's nothing
sexier than a curvaceous one one minute

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.350
that's the whole reason my compassion is
on the map because of our prayers

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.560
so that you could look at it we have not
been the case noted like i'm so over the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.489
milan right so a looked at me

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.689
this is advertiser body type this really
although you know obviously a lot of

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.159
people prefer that

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.060
so i think the public there to me so
it's not like it's clearly negative

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.780
but i'd what i'm sensing from our
progress from india is that he's not

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.239
necessarily develop arms so easily

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.149
there are a lot better than some say
impending death of their friends

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:47.439
wherever i mean the slides

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.409
bus you know if it wasn't until an
agreement

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.819
this is something that he didn't know
them you may be upset but

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.639
time to send this to get to the moon

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.469
because there's that the background of
people given for that

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:59.929
issues conceded

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.549
enemy attack that's the only thing that
they are mexican american correspondent

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.869
overruled

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.550
no i'm not i don't know your unit

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.019
of things that

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.239
so overruling after responded not racist

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.249
with that

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.449
dot

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.370
have a discussion about it being after
ten chile offensive to serena runs that

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.629
something i don't know what serena
williams is uh... uh... take is on this

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.949
if she feels insulted them not you know
i would pull our aside carolina side of

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.990
the like what this is important
beginning this

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.550
from her lack of response to this i
kinda get this and the fact that their

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.020
friends i kinda get the sense that it
suggest it's just kind of misery funny

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.070
that they've been at look if somebody
came in here to pursue me

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.729
and from like like that

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.870
fluid that should be with his big
government of but take the act

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.569
head are my dear friend and i don't
think i would but i could see that

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.090
but it doesn't make them integer

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.179
so

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:58.039
and uh... pardon
