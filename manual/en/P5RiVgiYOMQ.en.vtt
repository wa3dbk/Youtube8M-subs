Before you get started, one of the other most
important things is to have all the right

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.890
supplies. The cool thing about home schooling
or tutoring is the supplies are almost just

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.480
pennies, they are so cheap. For everything
you see here which amounts to, if you get

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.510
it on sale, under ten dollars. If it's not
on sale, it's still under twenty easily. Just

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.640
for that amount, I can educate a child faster
and better than almost any public or traditional

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.140
private school and it's just so easy. Here
are the lists that I would say you need, starting

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.429
with the binder, get yourself a nice three
ring binder, get yourself some folders that

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.890
have holes so they can clip into the binder
and that will be your worksheet station, where

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.519
you can keep your worksheets. Get yourself
some three ring regular notebooks, like five

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.600
or six of them. Get them on sale, I got these
for a quarter. And skinny markers. I like

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.910
skinny markers because when you use sharpies
to do things, sometimes it bleeds through

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.170
and just regular pens, pencils. Children usually
are taught to use pencil until they reach

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.880
a certain age and that's always good. Make
sure you have a sharpener. Stapler, if you

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.820
want to make little booklets for them, three
by five cards, we're going to use a lot of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.490
three by five cards, nice to have a box to
keep them in. This is like a ninety nine cent

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:32.670
box. Rubber bands just to keep separate your
different three by five card stacks of different

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.450
types of learning materials. And if you can
get handwriting paper, that's really important

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.480
to work on their handwriting. If you can't
find it in the store or it's too expensive,you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.960
can use your computer. Just use the underline
and the dash line and play around with the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.050
sizes until you find that you can make your
own handwriting paper on your computer and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.640
just print it out real lightly because it
saves ink and you don't really want it to

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.979
be dark and there you go.
