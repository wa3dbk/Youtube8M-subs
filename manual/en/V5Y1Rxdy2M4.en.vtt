Alright today on Repairs101 I�m going to
show you how I made this stabilizer for getting

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:15.930
better quality video imagery out of my iPhone�s
camera.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.330
So I collected some stuff together including
a ten dollar tripod and one of those universal

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:31.370
smart-phone holder bracket tripod mount things.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:44.040
I 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.430
used my brace and bit to bore out a three
quarter inch hole and then I tapered down

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:11.360
a one inch dowel to fit it.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.030
Being careful not to split the end-grain I
cut some threads into the hole and then I

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:30.770
hung my counterweight.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:50.590
So the next thing I needed was a platform
to connect the shaft with the camera mount.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.990
And, you know, that�s really about all there
was to it.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.110
I just put it together after that.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.760
I glued it.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.540
I screwed it.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:30.049
I wiped it down with a damp rag.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.269
Careful you don�t force the dowel in too
tight or you�ll end up splitting the end-grain.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.060
It might take you a couple of tries to figure
out how much weight you need to balance it

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.019
perfectly and you�ll want to experiment
with different ways of holding it, but used

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:57.110
correctly it will smooth out some otherwise
shaky video.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.909
