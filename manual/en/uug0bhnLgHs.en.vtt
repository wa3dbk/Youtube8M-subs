00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.580
Hey guys, today we're going to make some lemonade that's not your average lemonade

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.040
with cucumber, mint, and ginger.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.110
Welcome to xoxo cooks, the weekly cooking show

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.220
where we make recipes that make you feel great.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.890
So it's summertime for a few more weeks, 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.290
and what better drink to make for summer than 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.640
LEMONADE!

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.140
If you need some extra money, 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.540
after you make this, you can sell it on the side of the road

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.680
outside of your house

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.700
And if you make a profit,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.789
I hope that you'll share 5% with me
for giving you the idea.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.269
Ok, let's try this. 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.269
The technique I've mentioned before with ginger is that

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.760
you can peel it with a spoon.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.560
Now we'll just do some slices

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.250
let's just do about that much. 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.460
Simple syrup is equal parts water and sugar

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.390
So I have one cup of water, 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.180
one cup of white sugar, 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.320
and put that over a medium heat until it starts to simmer.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.720
stir it around so the sugar dissolves. 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.239
and actually, 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.139
we're gonna add the ginger right into
this.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.880
A little bit of lemon zest

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.880
We have simmering!

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.190
So I'll turn this heat off now. 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.710
Pour it through a strainer.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.400
And that gets out the ginger and the lemon zest.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.460
Slice up the cucumber really thinly.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.279
Strain out the mint leaves. 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.180
We have five lemons, 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.740
Including the one that I zested.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.920
One thing that's interesting about this kind of a juicer

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.320
I learned recently, 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.760
you would think that you would line up
so this goes on the juicy part,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.900
but you actually put it in upside down.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.010
And if you accidentally get seeds in there, 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.430
scoop those out, too.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.210
Oh, but the seeds are smaller than the holes in this thing.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.400
okay

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.620
Add three cups of water, and one cup of ice.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.320
That'll start to cool it down.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.670
And finally, put in your cucumber slices. 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.720
Ok, lemonade, and now I have my tasting assistant here

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.860
That's good.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.680
We did it!

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.120
CR: You did it!

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.700
Oh yeah, that's true, we didn't do it.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.120
WE did it. 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.820
But we didn't do it.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.480
If you like this video, please give it a thumbs up, 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.200
and we look forward to seeing you next week.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.200
Thanks for watching, bye!

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.140
I like it a lot.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300
Are you having a good time?

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.640
What do you think is the best part of doing this?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.820
It's fun.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.820
It's just something to do.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.029
Are the people nice to you?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.980
Think you'll ever do this again?

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.700
Andrew: Tomorrow we're open, too!

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.700
Adrienne: No, not tomorrow.
