00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.660
So what was all the chaos and exitement over
at this past ANA World Fair Of Money ? Stay

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:13.410
tuned and find out!

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:27.509
Good Morning!

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.399
I'm Taryn Walker and Welcome to Bullion Breakfast.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.180
The month of August proved quite eventful
at the ANA's World Fair of Money in Chicago

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.750
especially with the presence of the US Mint's
Reverse Proof Gold Buffalo.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.010
Leaving quite an impression on attendees,
the US Mint was pleasantly surprised when

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.410
their original quantity of 1,000 coins allocated
for the show fell short of demand, forcing

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.660
a rushed delivery of an additional 1000 coins.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.470
Eager collectors, over eager dealers and aggressive
tactics seemed to occupy the US Mint's table,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.560
especially with US Mint Director, Richard
Peterson, signing COAs.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.220
Due to the high demand of the coin, the US
Mint also had to lower the limit of 5 coins

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.270
per person to only 3.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.420
Can you imagine the chaos?

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.070
After standing in line for hours, customers
were then approached by coin dealers waiting

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.970
at the end of the line, offering $200 above
purchase price to get their hands on any available

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.510
Reverse Proof Buffaloes.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.640
Why the fuss?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.731
Well to start this Reverse Proof Buffalo is
the first of its kind, a new design by the

00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:39.130
US Mint to celebrate the 100th Anniversary
of James Earle Fraser's 1913 design.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.630
The polished finish of the raised portrait
to the frosted look of the coin's field, also

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.630
helps.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.820
And of course, the fact that the US Mint produced
less than 50, 000 coins, with a short four

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.061
week ordering window, gave credence to the
actions displayed at the 2013 World Fair of

00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:58.090
Money.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.760
Gainesville Coins is excited to offer the
limited release available for immediate purchase

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.840
