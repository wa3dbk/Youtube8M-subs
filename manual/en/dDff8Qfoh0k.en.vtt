Hello food lovers over there!

00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:08.988
I'm here with Valentina, my god daughter.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.660
She is my guest today, she is eight years old.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.440
This week in Argentina we celebrate Children's Day so we'll be cooking togather.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.780
We are going to prepare a Brussel Sprout, Tomato &amp; Cheese Omelette.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.240
You're gonna love it!

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.360
Let's get started. Here I have some previously boiled Brussel sprouts,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.960
I'm sure you've never tried them but you'll say you don't like them.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.960
So, you will help me cut some of them in half.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:50.100
Probably, if we give brussels sprouts to a child just like this they wouldn't like them so, we will add some flavours to them by taking them to a pan with some butter.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840
Perfect, good job!

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.660
Fire, a tablespoon of butter.

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:02.528
Let's take the butter to the whole pan.

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:06.120
Once the pan is hot, let's take our sprouts.

00:01:13.312 --> 00:01:15.312
We got a stair for Valu, it was getting a bit complicated.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.740
So now, let's add some pepper.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.568
And some sea salt.

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.948
Really, they look good?

00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:25.194
Let's turn them to the other side.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.460
This is what we are looking for, some butter flavours in them, then we will add them to our omelette.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.808
Let's take them to a dish.

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:40.236
Look! How's that?

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:42.096
Valentina: It's good.

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:43.296
Great!

00:01:43.296 --> 00:01:44.968
Now, let's go on with the eggs, three eggs.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.356
Haha love that technique!

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:54.628
Now, I told you this omelette had tomato...

00:01:54.628 --> 00:01:58.868
so let's go with five cherry tomatoes.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.076
Cut them in half.

00:02:01.912 --> 00:02:03.912
Good, let's give some love to our eggs.

00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:04.976
Wisk them.

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:07.866
Perfect, let's add the tomatoes...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.600
and now, our sprouts. Valentina: All of them?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.180
Feli: No, just some of them.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.180
Now lets add the cheese, you can use the cheese you like, in this case we are using mozzarella cheese.

00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:23.536
Break it with your hands.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.900
Let's go now with some cream cheese, you can use cream but this is lighter.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.880
And a little bit of...Valentina: Mustard.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:46.120
Feli: Great, Valentina, let's make this dance a little bit! And I will add some pepper and salt.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.920
Fire. Butter.

00:02:51.876 --> 00:02:53.876
Let's take our mixture to the pan.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.060
Our eggs, tomato, cheese and the main guest which is?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.680
Valentina: "Brisuelas Sprouts".

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.740
Feli: Okay yes, "Brisuela sprout" it's the cousin of "Brussels sprouts".

00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:10.864
You know what, the first time I saw someone cooking an omelette...

00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:15.200
and I was taught how to do it, that was the time when I said: "I want to be a cook".

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:17.208
Maybe this does not happens to you.

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:19.265
Valentina: Emm, maybe it does.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:20.620
Feli: Maybe yes.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.800
Let's turn this around, well, let's give it the omelette shape.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.440
This looks divine. Let's leave it to finish cooking.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.520
Okay, let's remove it from the fire. Amazing, from now on, everyday omelette!

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.140
Well, Valentina is telling me she has the perfect way to decorate this omelette.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.480
Valentina: Well, let's cut a cherry tomato into half and use it to make the eyes...

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.420
and here we can put some parsley to make a moustache.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.620
Then another tomato to make the nose. And there it is!

00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:00.844
Feli: I love it!

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:05.820
Let's try it now, eat a brussel sprout!

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.100
Is it good?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.460
Valentina: Yes.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.340
Feli: Perfect! So we have our Child's Day Menu!

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.560
My name is Felicitas Pizarro. Today I have cooked with...Valentina.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.080
Happy Children's Day, cook at home, make some omelettes!

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.400
Enjoy!! Bye!
