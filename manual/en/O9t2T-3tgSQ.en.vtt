Before we go any further talking about how
to mix a clay to use in pottery, I want to

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.960
talk about safety as it relates to that process.
Now the biggest health hazard in any ceramic

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:20.539
studio environment is dust. Clay materials
are basically dust. It's everywhere. When

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.019
it's in a wet form, and it's bound up with
water, it's not a problem, but when it dries

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.079
out, drops on the floor and gets crushed up,
becomes airborne again by sweeping or just

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.190
walking around. Breathing that dust can seriously
damage your lungs over time. Now, when we're

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.600
mixing the clay, this is even more important
because we're dealing with the raw powdered

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.809
materials. Some of these materials are so
finely powdered they're roughly three microns,

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.640
no one third of a micron in size. Now that's
so small that you can't possibly see it, and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.260
it's small enough that if it were to be closed
in a room with no air currents it could potentially

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.100
stay airborne for up to three days, which
means that it's all around you, and as you're

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.630
breathing that material in it can become embedded
in your lungs and over a long period of time

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.009
cause a degenerative disease called silicosis,
which is roughly like getting emphysema. It

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.230
builds scar tissue inside your lungs that
never goes away. So, what's really important

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.220
to be conscious of how much dust you're creating
and how must dust you're breathing in. And

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.719
we can minimize that with the use of respirators.
Now, there's two different kinds of respirators.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:41.950
This is the big boy here. This is a full rubber
face mask respirator with chemical cartridges.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.810
It's a filter. This one, these are designed
to filter organic vapors so they will take

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.880
out really fine particles from the air and
prevent them from entering your lungs. They're

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.460
a little heavy, a little bulky, and a little
uncomfortable to wear, but that's not an excuse

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.090
to not do it. So, what you might opt for instead,
which is almost as effective and much more

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.120
comfortable are these disposable respirators.
Now, these are not the little paper dust masks

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.319
that you see in a doctor's office for instance
or something like that. These are thick material,

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.681
and they have they're specifically designed
for certain amount of filtration and the small,

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:30.200
thin, flimsy paper dust masks are just not
good enough to do the trick. In fact, they're

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.750
worst than not wearing a respirator at all
because they low you into a false sense of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.959
security. This is an actual respirator, and
it needs to say Nyosh N ninety-five, or P

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.470
ninety-five, or R ninety-five. That's the
degree of filtration that the respirator provides

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.540
to you. You can buy these at any home improvement
store for about two dollars a piece, and they're

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.000
disposable, and they're pretty comfortable
to wear. This one even has a little exhalation

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.460
valve in the front so that it's more comfortable
to breath through. But really important to

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.120
be conscious of this when you're mixing clay
to use for pottery.
