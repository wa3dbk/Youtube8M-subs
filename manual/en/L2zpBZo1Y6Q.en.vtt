00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.150
My goal in this Crochet for Knitters series
hasn’t been necessarily to turn you in to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.890
a full-on crocheter, but to show you the most
techniques that you can use with crochet,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.450
in your knitting.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.830
And over the next few weeks we’re going
to go over a few crocheted edgings.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.810
My favorite crocheted edgings.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.690
And if you learn nothing else in this series,
this is maybe the most useful thing you can

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.160
learn in crochet to make your knitting even
better.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.350
Because adding a decorative crochet edge to
your knitting is much easier, much faster,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.260
much easier to rip out if you make a mistake
than it would be to add a knitted edge, or

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.450
a knitted bind-off all the way around.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.860
Um, the first one I’m going to show you
today is a scalloped edge.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.490
In my experience, this is maybe the most traditional
of the decorative crocheted edgings.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.510
Let’s go ahead and take a look.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.070
I have this little sample done up here, and
this is, um, this knitted stitch here in the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.060
middle is what I call long moss stitch.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.620
And I’ll give you instructions for this
in the video description below.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.280
It’s just very simple.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.730
And this is the scalloped edging that we have
in the darker color.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.440
This is all it is, little bumps around, and
then I’ve added a few more stitches when

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.520
you get to a corner.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.970
I’m showing you this on a flat piece, but
you can really think about adding this to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.120
anything.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.250
Like the neckline of a V neck sweater, or
even the cuffs of sweaters or the bottom of

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.730
a baby dress or something.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.180
But there’s the scalloped edge.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.890
Let me go ahead and switch to my bulky sample.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.860
I have the same stitch here, and I’m going
to show you how to work this now.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.270
And this is a one, two, three, four, five
– I think it’s a five stitch repeat.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.570
We’re going to start here in the bind off
row.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.720
And I’m just going to pick a spot here to
start.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.310
And we’re going to talk about spacing.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.000
You stab your crochet hook under both legs
of the bind off row here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.440
Make a loop and pull that through.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.560
And I’m going to start with a single crochet
stitch, if I can find my working yarn.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.249
And if you need a review of the single crochet
stitch, I’ll give you a link right here.

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:26.540
Actually, I’m going to chain one this time,
which is going to count as a single crochet.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.269
Then I’m going to look at the Vs that I
have here and skip two of them.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.999
And I’m going to stab in to the third one.

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.810
So there’s one, two, stab into the third
one.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.150
And I yarned over because I’m working a
double crochet.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.790
If you need a review of the double crochet,
I’ll give you a link right here.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.290
So there’s one double crochet stitch.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.730
To make the scallop, I want to work five double
crochets into this same loop.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:06.700
So yarn over, stab into that same spot for
the second one, same spot for the third one,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.500
same spot for the fourth one, and the fifth.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.139
And I just dropped everything there!

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.170
This bulky sample, of course, it’s very
easy to pick the stitches back up again.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.969
Okay so you can see that I have this curved
scallop going here.

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:33.430
I’m going to skip the next V, skip the next
V, and then single crochet into the third

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.879
one.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.090
And that’s the scallop!

00:03:41.090 --> 00:04:09.170
To continue, I skip two, work 5 double crochets
in the third.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.190
Skip two, and single crochet into the third.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.500
Now, let’s talk a little bit about gauge.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.949
The instructions that I give you for this
are for using the same weight of yarn that

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.570
you used in your knitted piece, and a hook
size that matches the needles that you used.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.260
And the way you can figure that out is you
can take your needle gauge and find the needle

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.070
size that you used, and find a crochet hook
that fits in that same hole.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.390
If you are using a lighter weight yarn or
a heavier weight yarn for the decorative edge,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.130
then you’re going to need to change up your
gauge a little bit.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.600
But it’s so easy to do.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.480
Here I skipped two stitches before the double
crochet.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.230
You might find with a heavier yarn that you
need to skip three.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.290
Or with a lighter weight yarn that you need
to skip one.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.940
It’s easy to figure out.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.540
If you see that your fabric is stretching
a little bit, you need to include some more

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.910
stitches, or if you see that your edge is
kind of ruffling a little bit, you need to

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.630
skip more stitches.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.900
And you can always just work up a little bit,
and see how it’s lying, if it’s not flat,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.230
you can just do this, and try a little bit
more of it again.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.500
That’s so nice about crochet.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.230
Because you’re just left with one loop to
pick up when you’re done.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.220
Um, the other thing is as you’re working
across this, you may not have the exact number

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.840
of stitches you need to get across.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.650
So you just fudge it.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.750
You figure it out, if you need to skip an
extra one, or skip an extra few over the next

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.390
few scallops, so that when you get to the
edge, you’ll work a scallop here in the

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.390
edge.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.090
Whoops, that’s the wrong side.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.340
Like I have here.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.860
And I found that working eight scallops in
the corner makes for a nice corner turn.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.430
I also want to show you how this looks from
the back.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.110
It’s also pretty from the back.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.670
A little flatter looking, but still pretty.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.240
And that’s it, a simple scalloped edge.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.710
I’m working on next week’s video right
now, and you’re not going to want to miss

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.710
it.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.960
You should probably subscribe to make sure
that you don’t!
