00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.480
Good day, and here we have FEAR 2.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.320
This is an example of how not to do a sequel.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.020
Basically, this is inferior in every single
solitary way to FEAR 1.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.320
The atmosphere isn't as good, the action is
a lot more basic.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.970
See, in this game, the enemy AI basically
has no intelligence whatsoever.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.400
They no longer go to cover, they no longer
have a lot of hit points... they basically

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.040
just die if you look at them wrong.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.730
Now in this game you play as Becket, a generic
soldier who, when the game starts up, does

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.750
NOT have the ability to go into bullet time
mode.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.270
But of course, after the first level you get
bullet time mode and that's when the game

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.110
gets a lot easier, even though the game was
considerably easy to begin with.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.900
This is an example of a consolized and actionized
sequel.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.180
Basically, any pretensions to horror are gone
now.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.130
Sure, Becket does have his own freak out moments
but they're not really scary at all, mainly

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.040
because in the actual game all you're doing
is mowing down waves and waves of ineffectual

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.040
enemies.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.520
And I mean they are horribly ineffectual - there
are some enemies with exploding tanks on their

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.520
backs!

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149
Why would you walk around with that if it's
just going to explode if you shoot it!

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.700
And they don't even have flamethrowers!

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.240
I guess they're oxygen tanks, maybe, but then
why do some troops have oxygen tanks and others

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:47.799
don't?!

00:01:47.799 --> 00:02:03.159
The story for the game, while not making sense
in the first game and its expansions, makes

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.290
even less sense now.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.040
Apparently there is a PMC that companies can
call down on rogue members or just mmebers

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.930
they don't like and they'll go kill them.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.640
Also apparently there's a PMC that can be
called down to attack and destroy property

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.300
on American soil.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.010
How does this make sense?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.360
Okay, why would the US military allow a PMC
to attack a company's scientific buildings,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.130
kill all within and then just leave.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.900
Why would you allow this to happen?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.910
Also where do they get all the equipment for
these people?

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.910
Where do they get all the people, that's the
question.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.650
Because there is a HUGE number of mercs in
this city that's been destroyed since the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.650
first game.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.830
Where did they come from?

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.110
How did this massive mobilization occur?

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.900
Why would the government allow such a massive
mobilization of men and equipment to be moved

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.300
into an American city?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.150
It makes no sense!

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.350
Now graphically the game looks amazing, blah
blah blah, great graphics, but by the time

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.880
this came out graphics didn't even really
matter.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.020
Sound design is also fairly decent, if a bit
generic - the various freak out moments have

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.320
pretty good sound design but it's definitely
not quite as scary as the first games.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.550
And that's your lot, ladies and gentlemen.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.160
This is just a basic FPS where you shoot hordes
of ineffectual enemies.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.560
It's generic, it's boring after awhile, and
it definitely is not "FEAR" in any way, shape

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560
or form.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:40.260
And so, this is Jon, signing off.
