Quita Culpepper: Well if you've been looking for
a product to get rid of body fat while tightening

00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:06.602
the skin, you may want to listen to this.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:10.189
Tyler Sieswerda: Sounds good to me. All New at 6.
KVU's Jim Bergamo here to show us the new

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:15.552
technology that promises to do just that without
any of the pain or downtime. Jim...

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:19.408
Jim Bergamo: How you doing there Quita, Tyler.
Well doctors will tell you liposuction is the most

00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:25.476
common fat-reducing procedure, but it requires
a significant amount of downtime. Up until now,

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:31.175
non-invasive treatments eliminate the downtime
but can be painful due to laser burns.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:35.868
The new Venus Freeze promises to deliver
the results without the pain.

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:41.532
Aethetician: It will be about 20 minutes
on one side, 20 minutes on the other.

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:46.989
Jim: 40-year-old Bridget Brady is a surgeon,
an avid exercise enthusiast and a mother of two.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.218
But she says her most recent pregnancy left
her wanting something, her pre-baby body image.

00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:57.243
Bridget: No matter how much I diet or exercise,
there are a couple areas of my body that I just

00:00:57.538 --> 00:01:00.783
would like to be a little tighter and have
a little fat reduced on.

00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:03.335
I have just a little loose areas
that I'd like to work on.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.410
Jim: Despite her want to lose that body fat,
Brady wasn't about to rush into

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:08.868
just any procedure or treatment.

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:14.328
Bridget: Well there are other minimally-invasive
techniques, but I've heard from many people

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:19.764
they are very painful and they take a lot of time.
And those are things I just wasn't interested in.

00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:23.150
Jim: Then Brady heard about new technology
called the Venus Freeze.

00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:28.519
Dr. Jennifer Walden: It uses radio frequency
or sound waves to melt fat and tighten the skin.

00:01:28.773 --> 00:01:33.144
But what makes this different I think is that
it's painless. It's actually pleasant.

00:01:33.403 --> 00:01:37.332
Jim: The Venus Freeze uses a magnetic pulse
component that induces the release of

00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:42.084
growth factors required for the sprouting of new
blood vessels and the rapid growth of skin cells.

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:48.949
An RF component induces collagen and elastin
production by creating controlled damage and

00:01:49.447 --> 00:01:54.345
triggering the skin's healing process.
The intended result is more vital, toned

00:01:54.612 --> 00:01:58.607
and healthy-looking skin with improved
elasticity and texture.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:02.661
Dr. Walden: It involves a modest fat reduction
and skin tightening over a period of time.

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:07.263
It's not instant as in one treatment,
but it does deliver results,

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.065
and we have clinical studies to back that up.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.328
Jim: The Venus Freeze is FDA-approved. And after
four treatments, it's also Brady-approved.

00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:19.542
Bridget: Already I can notice some tightening
and I feel actually better in those areas,

00:02:19.903 --> 00:02:22.895
so I'm already noticing a difference
that I'm happy with.

00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:26.966
Jim: Venus Freeze stomach treatments take
about 40 minutes. Facial and neck treatments

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.515
usually last 20 minutes.

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:34.238
Tyler: Now Dr. Walden says because it takes
a series of treatments to see the results,

00:02:34.564 --> 00:02:40.387
she encourages patients to come back by selling
Venus Freeze in packages. Six face or neck

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:45.413
treatments costs about $600. Eight stomach
treatments run $800. If you'd like more

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:49.435
information, we've set up a link at the end
of this story on KVU.com.
