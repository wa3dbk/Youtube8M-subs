Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now we
are going to take the pot and pour the apple

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.740
juice and the oil and we are going to bring
it and warm it up. If you have margarine,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.350
you are going to do it with the margarine
but you don't have to wait for to it to melt.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.990
It just needs to warm up to get a warm degree.
It does not have to boil and then you move

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.579
it from the fire. So we are going to take
it and place it on the fire. Now after the

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:47.070
apple juice and the oil are warmed up, I'm
going to pour the sugar in it. Mix it up.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:07.160
Mix it up nicely and I'm going to pour the
flour into the other bowl with the yeast and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:16.110
the vanilla sugar, the salt around it. The
salt should not touch the yeast because it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:29.410
might cause it not to rise right. More brown
sugar here. Now I'm going to pour this mixture

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.260
that is not hot. It should not be too hot.
If it gets too hot, it is going to kill the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:03:04.870
yeast so it is warm but it is not

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:56.159
to
hot. We

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:17.500
are going to
mix

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:46.550
it with the flour. We are going to add the
egg to it now when it is still not mixed up

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.710
all the way. Mix the egg to it and I'm going
to mix it by hand.
