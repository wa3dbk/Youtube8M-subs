00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:13.813
Before you perform 
the manual cell count,

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.053
you need to wash 
your hemocytometer.

00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:19.896
It needs to be thoroughly clean.

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:23.809
And the first step is get your

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:27.783
reagents and dilutions ready.

00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:33.437
So, you’ll need to 
put on some gloves for that.

00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:36.090
And the first solution is some
dilute bleach

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.743
to disinfect our hemocytometers

00:00:38.743 --> 00:00:41.398
when we’re completed with our counts.

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:44.016
To do that just take your beaker.

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:48.381
I’ve labeled it "Dilute Bleach."

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.158
Just cover the bottom 
of the beaker with bleach,

00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:54.775
just enough to cover the bottom.

00:00:54.775 --> 00:01:01.699
Then we're going to fill up about 
¾ of the way with tap water.

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.732
We’ll be using this later 
after we’ve completed the counts.

00:01:08.732 --> 00:01:11.809
This is the hemocytometer detergent,

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:13.871
that needs to be about half full.

00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:16.236
And this is dilute detergent that we use

00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:20.896
for cleaning the hemocytometers.

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:28.283
And then you’ll need a beaker

00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:33.673
about ¾ full of deionized water.

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:37.200
Now you need to take your gloves off.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.842
Most gloves will leave a sticky film 
on your hemocytometer

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:43.898
and a layer on top of your liquids,

00:01:43.898 --> 00:01:48.294
so you want to 
take them off at this point.

00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:51.225
Take off the cover 
of the Petri dish.

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:52.792
And here is the hemocytometer.

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:57.121
I check it very carefully 
to see if there's any film,

00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.648
residue or debris on it.

00:02:00.648 --> 00:02:03.647
And even if I don’t see any, 
I still wash it,

00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:05.405
because there's often material

00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:07.455
on there that you can’t see
that will throw off

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:10.352
your platelet counts quite a bit.

00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:14.314
So, the first step is to 
swish it in the detergent, like this

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:17.147
and then you can scrub it 
with your finger, like this.

00:02:17.147 --> 00:02:18.780
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.815
And I do that, oh three or 
four times actually.

00:02:22.815 --> 00:02:26.516
The more time you spend
cleaning your hemocytometer,

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:29.064
the better.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:34.624
If it’s not perfectly clean 
it'll really throw off your counts.

00:02:34.624 --> 00:02:36.215
Then the last time you scrub it,

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:38.854
don’t touch the surface again.

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:41.094
Because your fingers 
have oil droplets on it

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.707
and they’ll look just like platelets

00:02:42.707 --> 00:02:44.326
it will throw off your counts.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:47.564
So, then you rinse it off in 
the detergent.

00:02:47.564 --> 00:02:52.813
Then you’re going to 
rinse it off in tap water.

00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:55.766
I use warm tap water,

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:59.304
it cuts the detergent a little better.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:05.229
And then rinse it in deionized water,
just like this.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.111
Then you shake off the excess water.

00:03:07.111 --> 00:03:08.789
Make sure you hold it securely

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.790
so it doesn’t drop and break.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.562
Then with a lint-free Kimwipe,

00:03:13.562 --> 00:03:15.895
It needs to be the Kimwipes

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.228
that do not have kaolin in them

00:03:18.228 --> 00:03:20.563
so you don’t scratch 
the hemocytometer.

00:03:20.563 --> 00:03:24.231
You want to just gently wipe it dry.

00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:26.676
Don’t do this.

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:29.171
Just gently wipe it dry,

00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:34.127
just like this.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.394
Then we'll wash the cover slip 
the same way.

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:47.964
So you want to look at
your hemocytometer cover slip,

00:03:47.964 --> 00:03:50.817
and check for any debris or film on it.

00:03:50.817 --> 00:03:54.609
Generally the places that will have 
the most debris on it

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.707
will be these corners here 
and these edges.

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.446
That's where material is most likely 
to dry on the cover slip.

00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:06.231
So even If I don’t see
any material on it

00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:10.480
I will still go through
the washing procedure,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.545
and you will swish it 
in the hemocytometer detergent.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:20.186
You can scrub it between your thumb
and forefinger like this.

00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:24.943
Pay particular attention 
to those corners

00:04:24.943 --> 00:04:29.700
and edges that I showed you.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.457
And I do that three times or 
sometimes four times,

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:40.873
depending on how dirty 
it looked to begin with.

00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:43.353
Even if I've cleaned it 
the night before,

00:04:43.353 --> 00:04:47.458
I still clean it again in 
the morning.

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:50.094
It’s just so critical to
the success of your counts

00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:53.070
to have it really really clean.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.040
And then you always hold it

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.303
from these sides, 
just like this.

00:04:58.303 --> 00:05:01.430
And after you've scrubbed it 
the last time,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.157
you don’t touch the surface again.

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:06.399
Because you want to avoid oil droplets 
from your fingers.

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:17.673
Now we’re going to rinse it 
in warm tap water.

00:05:17.673 --> 00:05:22.341
Rinse it thoroughly in tap water.

00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:23.787
Shake off the excess water.

00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:27.978
And then rinse it 
in deionized water here

00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:30.768
and shake off the excess here.

00:05:30.768 --> 00:05:36.361
Now we're going to take another
lint-free Kimwipe

00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:38.359
and we’re just going
to gently dry it

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:42.159
in kind of a circular motion,
like this.

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:50.670
And as it gets wet, 
will move it over to a dry area.

00:05:55.493 --> 00:06:02.699
And when we finished, 
we'll check it for cleanliness.

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.523
When you hold it up to the light,

00:06:04.523 --> 00:06:06.388
it should be perfectly clear 
like a window.

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:10.348
And you might even hold it up 
against something black

00:06:10.363 --> 00:06:16.748
and should be like a flawless 
mirror-like surface on there.

00:06:16.748 --> 00:06:19.246
Set it on top
of my hemocytometer here.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:23.056
Then we need to prepare 
a moisture chamber.

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:27.164
You can use 
a cut piece of filter paper

00:06:27.164 --> 00:06:29.279
or use one of these blood blocks

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.332
like this, that I’ve cut into a circle.

00:06:33.332 --> 00:06:36.416
And you want to just barely moisten it.

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:38.636
You don’t want it sopping wet

00:06:38.636 --> 00:06:41.518
or you’ll get condensation

00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:44.970
under your cover slip, 
and that’s not good.

00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:50.377
This looks just about right.

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:58.386
You can also add water
with a transfer pipette if you’d like.

00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:02.247
Then we’re going to put these two
capillary tubes in there

00:07:02.247 --> 00:07:05.221
just to lift up the hemocytometer.

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:08.910
Makes it a little easier 
to lift it out.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:14.102
And then we’ll cover it 
to keep dust out of it.

00:07:14.118 --> 00:07:15.758
Now we have completed

00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:17.966
the washing of the hemocytometer.
