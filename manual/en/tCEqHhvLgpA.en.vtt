Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel!

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.250
Today, i'm going to be reviewing the Sephora
it palette.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.531
So, the first thing I want to say about this
palette was, It was I believe $37 or $38 and

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.241
Sephora has their own line of makeup in the
store.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:29.880
They have their own big display; but most
of the time, I walk past it - just because

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.370
I felt like.... maybe a lot of other people
kind of feel the same way too, the quality

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.400
might not be as good as the other brands in
the store.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.230
I was actually looking for a Matte black eye
shadow.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.730
Something super black that can go onto my
eyes.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.829
So, the palette I ended up picking up, was
called the It palette (Smokey) It comes in

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.960
a case like this.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.660
I kept this for the video so you knew exactly
what it looked like if you wanted to go and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.670
get this palette.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.310
(That's what it looks like) It comes with
an eyeliner and a dual ended brush so a Flat

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.090
slanted brush and then it also comes with
a .... All over shadow brush.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.009
When you take the palette out of that case,
it comes in this type of snake skin?

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.790
Yeah, I'm going to go with snake skin.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.750
That's what it looks like and its pretty cushion-like,
so your eyeshadows aren't going to break,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.760
and the closure is magnetic, so you don't
have to worry about your eyeshadows falling

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.820
out, or you palette opening up and breaking
eyeshadows.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.549
It comes with 12 shadows.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.390
Now, these shadows are shimmery except for
the matte black one.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.240
They have a white shadow, two silver shadows
- one is a little bit lighter then the other

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.240
one.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.689
Um, they have a darker gray color.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.270
They have a nice pretty dark gray color.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.120
And then, they have the matte black.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.280
It has a nice taupe pink color, a green, um,
A nice purple one which I'm really loving.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.022
It also has a darker purple which is Gorgeous!

00:01:54.022 --> 00:02:00.570
It has like, chunky glitters in it, but when
It goes on it just sparkles from your eye.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.960
It's just really amazing.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.270
And then this beautiful blue color!

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.960
Its like a navy blue color.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.490
I posted a photo on my Instagram, so if you
aren't following me, on Instagram or twitter,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.120
you can follow me @Alohaimlei.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.560
You can see those photos!

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.251
It also has like a, shimmery black color,
but it has metallics of silver in it.

00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:22.790
It comes with an eyeliner crayon and the brush
which sit right in here.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.660
So you pretty much have something that you
can take with you; anywhere and you don't

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.250
have to worry about bringing an extra eyeliner,
extra brush.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.340
The color payoffs are really awesome, with
&amp; without primer.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.440
I tend to use primers no matter what, just
because my eyelids are a little bit oily.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.120
If you are looking for a palette that has
a lot of Metallics and you love shimmer, this

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.319
palette is definitely going to be for you!
