00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:18.410
[music intro]

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:45.179
What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere , athleanx.com!

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.449
I gotta start off with remediate a mistake.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.911
Last week I came out at the end of my workout
and I showed you the new bands that we have

00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:54.899
the ATHLEAN ELAST-X Bands.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.640
They weren't ready yet, they were ready but
the website wasn't.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.839
But that has now been taken care of.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.040
ATHLEAN ELAST-X Bands, we have the black one
here and the red band, basically the thicker

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.040
band.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.430
You've seen me do a bunch of stuff on these
videos with these bands and now you can get

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.430
them yourself.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.650
So what I figures was, I wanna show you something
really cool here, a different use of the bands,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.360
something we haven't done yet.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.920
We've always use it to assist our own body
weight and how to do something easier, like

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.530
one arm pull up, one arm pushups, even if
we can't do pull-ups, you know two arm pull

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.530
up.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.720
But now I'll show you something different.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.241
I took two of the black bands here and if
you look at the set up, I basically went through

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:44.060
a squat rack, I put down an Olympic bar, there
is actually 205 pounds down here, there is

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.640
a 35 on the inside, there is a 45 on the outside
and I put the band around the bar, so now

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.671
we've got them on both sides, one band down
here in the middle of the squat rack, one

00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:56.290
band over here at this side.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.540
What is gonna do is, it's gonna allow me to
do what is possibly one of the greatest exercise

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.410
you could possibly do, the bent over row.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.060
The bent over row is some of the difficult
exercise because it will compromise, bad form

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.870
will compromise how much you can lift and
also set you up for an injury.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.730
And we know that low backs are, you know,
commonly injured due to bad posture.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.620
So, let's say I was down here.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:30.140
The hardest part of the bent over row is this
part, getting it off the ground.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.730
What these bands will do is actually assist
me at the hardest part of the motion which

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.390
is down here to get it going.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.030
Once I pass through this neutral position
here I'll be able to still squeeze it up but

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.100
not no more help from the bands and that's
fine because we wanna be able to have that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.710
key contraction at the top without the assistance
of the bands.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.091
So, it sort of works out as our best friend
in this situation.

00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:53.650
It really is easy to set up.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.650
So let me show you a couple of reps here.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.240
Ok, you wanna sit your low back up, with a
slight arch and hold on to it, you're gonna

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.950
get down to the bar you're not gonna bend
like this, I hate that when I see that.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.920
Straight down, we'll lift it up with a little
bit of help with the bar and we're gonna do

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.500
our bent over row.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.830
So just about shoulder width apart, up to
here, lift and down.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.040
[exercising]

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:43.270
And again, a little balance in the bottom,
obviously not enough for just make the thing

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.541
come back up, but enough to give me just that
little bit of assistance to get it up from

00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:53.900
the bottom of the rep and help me squeeze
in that little bit more effort and get better

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900
results.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.490
So, if you haven't already guys, put the bands
aside, ATHLEAN-X it's a Training System in

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.400
90 days designed to get you in that athletic
and fit body, ripped, looking better.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.790
You can get that at athleanx.com.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.459
And If you wanna increase the variety of your
workouts even beyond what ATHLEAN-X does start

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.620
add these bands training in to what you're
doing.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.990
So, again we have the thinner band here for
assistance to exercises like these.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.940
We've got the thicker red one from when I'm
doing, warm-up pull up assistance, regular

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.830
pull up assistance, fire up scrambles like
we did on MMA Workout.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.620
So, guys we'll be back here again next week
with another one great video.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.211
Keep the comments coming, it's always good,
it's how I get my ideas for the videos to

00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:42.211
come back for you guys.

00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:42.849
Thanks a lot!
