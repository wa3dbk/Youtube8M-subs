00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.340
Once again we join Michael and Sue Drew

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.059
as they built their BuildBlock ICF

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.130
starter castle in southeastern Michigan.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.680
This dream castle is built to last for

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.779
generations through careful design using

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.240
BuildBlock ICFs. Today we learn why they

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.660
chose ICFs and what they would have done differently.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.990
Drew: Okay well um it's sort of a big house

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.029
but it's really only a four bedroom

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.390
house. We call it a modest four-bedroom

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.390
starter castle. One of the things that I

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.149
kind of regret is not taking the ICF up

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.369
into the gables. We basically stopped at  the top.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.100
I guess the reason I didn't do it was I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.530
was a little bit nervous about how the

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.719
process would work and thought that it

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.730
would be okay to just frame it but you

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.829
know, after it's all said and done

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.030
i wish i would've just gone with

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.500
concrete all the way to the roof. So, you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.360
know, the the framing it's never

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.220
as good, it's never as tight, it's never

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.450
as strong as ICF. It just isn't you know?We'll go up there and look. We can

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.200
kick on it a little. But yeah, that's the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.390
one thing I regret is not doing the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.100
gables in ICF. It wouldn't have been that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.510
much more money and they would have been

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.439
just infinitely stronger and better. So

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.259
we're up in the attic on the west end of

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.960
the house at the gable, and this is just

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.049
you know an example of where i wish i

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.790
would have used ICF instead of framing. I

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.829
mean you know it's a truss it's OSB.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.659
If it would've been ICF there'd be no

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.220
question that it would last

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.330
forever. You know, its OSB. (laughs)

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.010
It's brick on the outside but still... I don't know.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.390
It just doesn't have that, just doesn't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.100
give me that sense of security that the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.650
ICF does you know? None of the walls

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.150
downstairs you can hit them with a tree

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.490
and nothing's gonna happen anything is

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.630
ever going to happen it's probably going

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.830
to be right here.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.870
So here's a couple of examples of why I

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.700
second-guess myself with respect to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.340
doing ICF in the gables. It probably

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.660
doesn't make any difference with the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.700
brick veneer on the outside, but if you

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.280
look over there, you can see the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.930
framing didn't quite line up with the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.390
masonry so there's quite a large gap

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.940
on that side. And there's a smaller gap

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.990
you can see some light coming through

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.050
over there. If it had been ICF we would have

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.820
just stack the block, poured it, the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.140
cement would have flowed right up against the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.640
masonry, would have been doweled into it.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.590
It would be, you know, without any sort

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.060
of crack at all but you know, we'll foam

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.500
it up. The elevator will service each

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.600
level of the home from the attic to the basement.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.080
My collection of lifting straps.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.960
Ooo talk about dark.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.280
Although we have some flood lights down

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.140
here. I've got some halogens I can turn on.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.800
So it got so cold this winter that

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.650
this beam, which is 90 some odd feet

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.810
along... shrank. And you can see exactly

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.910
where it shrank and how much which is

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.670
pretty impressive. So you see that little

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.390
tab of mortar? How it's pulled away from the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.880
from the other piece of mortar? That's

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.680
how much that being shrank. Now the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.390
interesting thing is it pulled away, but

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.430
it didn't go back. And when it pulled

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.910
away it's spalled off this chip off

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.310
this block. And you can actually see

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.260
right here there's a little line where

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.970
it was, you know, used to be back in the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.700
cement because they're all cemented into place.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.430
It did not pull out from the other end.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.160
It only pulled out from this end. But the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.770
mystery is why it didn't go back. I did

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.340
the math using the expansion coefficient

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.160
of steel and it moved about exactly what

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.330
it was supposed to move. It was supposed to move

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.640
just under three quarters of an inch. And

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.810
that's what it did.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.980
ICF to me means permanence. It's like an

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.840
it's an act of permanence in a

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.680
disposable society. And that's what this

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.210
building is all about. Everything in this

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.800
building is designed to last a hundred

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.160
and fifty, two hundred years. And framing

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.770
a standard stick-built building wouldn't

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.690
last that long because it is really

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.430
permanent it's you're building something

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.560
that's going to last for generations not

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.540
for 20-30 years. You know? It's not

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.460
going to get eaten by termites. It's not

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.400
gonna get blown down by the wind. It's

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.960
gonna be here. Gonna be here longer than

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.660
you and I are going to be here. So it's in it's you know it's it's an investment that really really last.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.129
That's why I used it.
