00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:08.009
American University in Cairo (AUC) 
New Cairo 11 September 2011

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.705
AUC students protest increase in fees

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:14.046
It's about time the revolution made 
it way to the university campus..

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:17.007
..in objection to the violations being 
committed by the administration..

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.726
..against the university 
students and employees

00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:25.743
Here, we announce our open-ended strike 
until the following demands are met:

00:00:25.743 --> 00:00:33.148
1) Cancelling the 9 percent increase in 
tuition fees for the 2011/2012 academic year

00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:36.972
2) Setting a roof on tuition fees 
for returning students

00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:44.684
3) Taking into account the general principles 
of workers' and human rights at the AUC

00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:48.485
Come down! Come down!

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:54.965
Don't you dare say this is nonsense…
when we are paying in the thousands

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.526
Abdullah Ashraf, Student, AUC

00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.232
I am a student here 
and my family has set itself..

00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:00.747
..on paying a certain amount 
in tuition fees each semester

00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:01.915
Why has it increased? 

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:04.043
The increase should only apply on new students

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:06.331
Ashraf al-Feqi
Vice president for student affairs, AUC

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.639
By the way, in 2008/2009, 
the returning students..

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.884
..paid a 10 percent increase in tuition fees..

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.172
..and the new students paid a 12 percent increase

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.117
The 9 percent is a large increase; 

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:20.157
..however, we explained the university’s financial situation to the students..

00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:22.125
..with complete transparency

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:25.437
We must explain the university's fiscal deficit..

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:28.528
.. and the ways in which  to correct this deficit

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:35.210
This is the result of their recklessness

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:37.113
Ahmed Alaa
Student Union President, AUC

00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:40.185
Today, students, workers and security personnel 
are all standing together

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:41.729
We have each other's backs

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.641
No one will leave till the demands are achieved

00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:46.969
The security personnel's salaries have been cut

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.567
The workers were given unfulfilled promises,

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.846
..and they have never taken notice 
of the student's opinions

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:54.130
You said you heard us, but you didn't

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.450
You said you would take action, 
but you haven't

00:01:57.921 --> 00:01:59.714
Ali Abdel Zaher, Gardener

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:01.778
Our salaries are not sufficient for our needs

00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:03.281
We only get paid LE1000
39
00:02:03,281 --&gt; 00:00:39,038
They do not reimburse us for housing, or overtime 
and we are not given Saturday's off

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.223
We also do not get LE200 
as a reimbursement for meals

00:02:11.223 --> 00:02:14.136
Whenever we talk about raises 
they say if you don't like it you can leave

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:17.239
4 or 5 months ago, the workers demanded 
a raise and meal reimbursements

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.365
The vice president for administrative affairs sat 
with them and they came to an agreement 

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:21.574
Mohamed Farouk, Security guard

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.614
[They promised us]  8 hour shifts, 
Friday's and Saturday's off..

00:02:24.614 --> 00:02:26.694
..and permanent positions after 6 months of employment

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:27.671
None of this happened

00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:30.063
We are now in our 7th month 
and we haven’t been appointed

00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:33.590
Last year, we gave all employees 
temporary contracts

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.661
This cost the university a lot of money,

00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:43.220
..as we appointed a large number of those 
with no contracts with temporary contracts

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.645
Wake up students and shout no! It is our right

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:53.538
This semester I paid LE81,000 in order to graduate

00:02:53.538 --> 00:03:01.576
If I am paying you LE81,000, you can't pay 
each security guard and worker a mere LE200?
