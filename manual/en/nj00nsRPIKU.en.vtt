00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Dr. Blake, you just gave me a pelvic exam.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.860
With 2 cameras in the room.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.280
How was that for you?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.860
The pelvic exam was pretty routine.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.200
That's about how they usually go.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.180
The cameras was a little different.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.860
Ok!

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.560
I'm not used to that.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.700
I have more questions for you. Are you ready?

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.200
Yeah.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.940
[whoosh, smack]

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.820
[clears throat softly]

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.960
What kind of doctor are you?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.880
I am a family medicine resident.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
Who can perform pelvic exams?

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.360
Just about any general practicioner.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.580
So a family doctor could, a nurse practitioner could, a licensed practicing nurse could.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.160
If you are having a baby and you go to the O.B. floor because you think you are in labor a nurse will do it.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.500
Gynecologist. So there's lots of people.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.000
What training do you go through in order to do a pelvic exam?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.820
Uh we do one.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.820
[laughs]

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.760
On a person?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.780
On a person.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.940
In med school we have what we call a "standardized patients" who are paid actors.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.780
And we had a paid actor come in and get multiple vaginal exams.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.680
What are all the reasons that someone should get a pelvic exam?

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.900
Pain, discharge, bleeding that's abnormal, pain with sex, and there's more, but just really broad.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.440
If you're having problems with your genitals you should get an exam.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.460
If you're having an IUD placed... Obviously you need one.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.560
If you're having an abortion you need one.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.040
If you're having a baby you need one.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.780
If you're having a PAP, and that's probably the most common one is the PAP.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.740
Some STD testing, depending on where you go.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.940
A lot of it now is becoming DNA based or RNA based

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.700
meaning all you need to do is pee.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.040
Back in the day, not so long ago, it used to be an exam with a swab.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.060
We don't do those here, we  just have them pee.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.600
Thank you!

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.140
So, I don't need to come in when I'm 18?

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.620
Not unless you really want to.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.880
I don't need to come in when I'm sexually active?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.620
Nope.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.360
Ok, at what age should I come in?

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.860
21.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.300
Because?

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.240
Because that's when we start PAP screening.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.780
Probably, a lot of your viewers' moms, back when they were becoming sexually active in their teens

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.420
it was every year.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.680
Maybe starting at 15-16.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.740
Now we know that cervical cancer doesn't really happen a lot in that age group.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.180
But we know that a lot of people that have HPV and have some cervical change just get rid of it.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.220
And so... why do a PAP smear if your body gets rid of it?

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.160
So we look for high risk strains and there's a few of those.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.660
Then as you get older and into your 30s if you still persistently have HPV we get a little bit more concerned.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.820
Because we're like, well gosh, you're not clearing it.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.040
So when the recommendation was to get a pelvic exam when you become sexually active, what does sexually active mean?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.680
So to me it means, basically, mucus membrane contact.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.220
Whether that's mouth, anus, penis, vagina.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.360
So contact in those can potentially transmit disease and that's what we are trying to prevent.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:04.480
One person wrote, and they said, "why are we calling it gynecology? Shouldn't it be called Cullpology? Referring to the cervix rather than the vagina."

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.300
Well gynocologists will tell you they do a lot more than just focus on the cervix.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.860
ok.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.080
It's about the entire uterus, the ovaries, all of the female reproductive hormones (which you don't necessarily think about)

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.680
but that involves the brain as well, pituitary, breasts obviously, so there's a lot more to it than just "the cervix".

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.720
Ok, so how do you make your services more Trans-inclusive?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.580
That is a good question and it just is really provider dependent.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.960
You know trans-medicine, generally speaking, isn't too difficult.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.320
It's fairly well laid out, how you approach it.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.520
It's just a matter of... has this provider had that training?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.840
Had that education?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.740
The place to start would be ask your provider, if you're considering going through transition.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.720
Ask your provider is this something they are comfortable with?

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.680
and they'll say, "yes", "no", "gosh, I don't know, nobody's ever asked me that before"

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.120
and if they're willing and say "hey yeah, I'll learn with you", "we'll work through this together", that's great.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.280
If not then you say "can you refer me to somebody else?" "do you know who else I can talk to?"

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.560
So this person asked: "Is there a version of you for my penis and my testes?"

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.180
And I think what they're referring to is, we have gynecology, what is on the bio sex male...

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.840
Urology.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.300
But any kind of general practitioner should be able to cover a broad range of both urologic and gynecologic issues.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.540
The training that they have in particular is surgical.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.420
A urologist?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.620
A urologist and a gynecologist.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.180
Are trained specifically to do surgeries on those types of anatomy?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.860
Correct.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.000
But in terms of the, what we call "primary care", you should be able to get that pretty much anywhere.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.940
What happens if there's something wrong?

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.260
So if after my pelvic exam, or during my pelvic exam [gestures that the doctor has found an irregularity].

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.080
What would happen?

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.500
It's pretty rare that you would actually see something very abnormal on the cervix itself,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.220
that's why we do PAPs. It's preventative.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.980
We see the abnormal cells before we see any cancer.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.600
The next step after that would be Colposcopy.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.300
Are you familiar with that at all?

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.480
Yeah, but they're not... [gesturing at us]

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.500
So cullposcopy is basically taking a magnifying device, again, with the speculum exam.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.000
And you paint some, essentially vinegar, what we call acetowhite on there

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.780
and look for changes, and if there's changes, often times you'd take a biopsy.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.160
Meaning you pull a little piece of tissue off and you send it to the lab and you see what's going on.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.460
That said, this is like the worst end, very uncommon.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.580
The most common thing is your PAP comes back and there's some abnormal cells that are mildly abnormal

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.460
and we say, "Lindsey, that you had some mildly abnormal cells, we'll check again in a year."

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.880
"What do I do if my doctor discounts my experience? As in tells me there's nothing wrong when clearly there is something wrong."

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:04.520
That's a tricky one because, you're sort of asking me to speculate on what somebody's interpretation of their symptoms is.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.360
Compared to their experience with, who in theory, is a trained health care professional.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.420
I would trust their judgement, but that said, people get second opinions all the time.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.720
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.960
Or third opinions.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.620
[agreement]

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.420
"How do I open up the conversation about birth control?"

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.880
We love to giv-... I love to give people birth control.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.500
Oh, that's so great.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.520
And I think most providers do.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.900
So I would just say, "I'm curious about birth control, options for me."

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.780
Yeah, "I'm interested."

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.520
"My friend," and this is usually what people say,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.920
whether the friend is real on not,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.720
"my friend has tried [blah, blah, blah] do you think that would be a good choice for me?"

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.180
And I'd say, "ok, tell me what you know about that."

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.660
Whether it's the pill, that's kinda the most common one

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.420
the other one that's really up and coming are the nexplanon which goes in the arm and then the IUDs

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.420
which go in the uterus

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.140
mostly because they're just there, you don't have to worry about taking a pill every day.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.320
Ok

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.020
We'll do whole episodes on them.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.780
Please do.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.940
Ok.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.780
We showed what my pelvic exam was like.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.680
Other components might be a breast exam, and again the bimanual exam as we call it.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.180
So if other things go on that seem questionable, who would I report my grievances to?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.500
Probably ask the provider, "Why did you do that? What are you doing?"

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.900
"Explain what you're looking for."

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.520
And you should feel empowered to do that.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.520
I like that.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:38.160
Complain to the clinic, they almost always have some kind of "Tell us how we did today" feedback form.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.460
Ask to speak to the clinic manager.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.960
Ok

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.960
So there's options.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.180
What do you want them to know [gesturing to us]

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.480
If you have a bad experience with somebody, then find somebody else.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.140
Don't be ashamed to ask the questions,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.320
don't feel awkward about birth control, don't feel awkward about a pelvic exam.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:02.220
Again, I don't mean for this to sound negative in any way, but for a lot of us it's just routine.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.220
It's just what we do.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.860
Thank you Dr. Blake for the pelvic exam and for hanging out with me and answering our questions.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.600
You're welcome. It was a lot of fun.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.520
Stay curious!
