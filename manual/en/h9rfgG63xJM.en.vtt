Hi. I'm Michelle and I'm here today on behalf
of Expert Village. We're gonna learn how to

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.020
knit a scarf for beginners. And while we're
doing that we'll also go over some basic tips

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.200
that you need to know to get started in knitting.
Once you've completed all the rows that you're

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.619
pattern calls for. Or, if you're making up
your own pattern and you feel like your scarf

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.359
is exactly the length that will be perfect
for you, now you're ready to cast off. Let's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.329
see how. Because this is a garter stitch pattern
and we're knitting every row. We're going

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:34.800
to cast off with knitting. Remember we always
want to cast off in pattern. I'm gonna knit

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.050
my first stitch just like I normally would.
And, I'm gonna knit my second stitch, just

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:56.690
like I normally would. Now, picking up the
first stitch I'm gonna slide the second stitch

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.851
so that it comes right underneath of it and
my first stitch is off. Now, I'm gonna go

00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:13.350
to the third stitch and knit it just like
I normally would. And then, grab that second

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:24.510
stitch and slide it over and now I've got
two stitches cast off. If you continue to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:33.280
do this what you're eventually gonna have
is a row like this of knit stitches that are

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.440
no longer attached to the knitting needle
but they're all attached to each other so

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.619
you wont have to worry about all your hard
work unraveling. This needle we'll just set

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:57.070
aside. With our last stitch remaining we'll
get our scissors. Remember, leave enough when

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:07.409
you cut it off so that you can weave the ends
in. We'll detach that and simply pull this

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.849
through the loop. And now you can see I have
illustrated how to make the worlds smallest

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:15.260
scarf.
