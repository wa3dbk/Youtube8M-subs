Hi everybody, I'm April Bloomfield. I am at
The Spotted Pig in NYC and today I'm gonna

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.090
do a Caponata which is basically an Italian
Eggplant Stew. We've got some sautéed eggplant

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.539
that I've lightly seasoned and drained in
a colander. It'll help take away the bitterness

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.199
and it'll actually concentrate the cells of
the eggplant so when you fry them in the oil

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.179
they won't absorb so much fat. So these are
nice and golden brown and they are really

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.040
kind of creamy inside, like this. You can
actually see that that's a perfectly cooked

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.660
eggplant. And then we've got a little base
of some celery, a little bit of onion, and

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.640
this has been cooked for about thirty minutes,
until they're nice and soft. A little tomato

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.690
sauce, again it's been cooked for about thirty
minutes. We've got some nice garlic going

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.079
on, we've got a little bit of chilli which
is great because it's gonna make it nice and

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.839
bright. A little bit of celery leaf that was
saved from the whole head of celery that we

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.750
used. Some parsley. We're gonna finish it
with some nice black and green olives, some

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.479
nice toasted pine nuts and a little bit of
caper. And I made this quick herb vinegar.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.649
It's basically a red wine vinegar with a little
tarragon, a little parsley and a little mint.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.979
So first of all we're gonna put some oil in
a pan. So you can just see it's starting to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.000
smoke so we're just gonna add that like this.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.079
We're just gonna add some chilli, we're just

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.680
gonna crush them a little bit in between our
fingers. Okay so these are ready now, they're

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.409
nice and golden brown. The garlic's toasty,
it smells really good. We're gonna get the

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.840
tomatoes and we'll probably go a quarter of
these tomatoes so we're just gonna sprinkle

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.840
them. It's probably about half a cup of tomatoes
for this amount, two pounds of eggplant.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.360
So we've got the fried eggplant, it's all kind
of room temperature right now, it's got good

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.720
colour. We're just gonna put it in very gently
into the bottom of the pan. We're gonna give

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.200
it a light stir.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.390
Smells good. I've got a few
of these salted capers. We're just gonna do

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.140
a little pinch. They add a nice saltiness
to it, little bit of herbaceousness which

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.210
is kinda cool. This is a green olive, this
is a Cerignola from Italy. This is gonna add

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.070
some salt and some umami. The little Niçoise
from France. We're just gonna break those

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.160
up really rustically. Give this a light stir
just to incorporate it all, kind of marry

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.280
it together. We're gonna add a little bit
more salt, not too much because we've got

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.590
the capers, we've got the olives. This is
the best bit, the herby vinegar. We're just

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.320
gonna do a couple of splashes. We've got so
much sweetness going on it there, from the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.090
onions and the celery and the eggplant, so
this is gonna cut all the way through that

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.500
and it's gonna make it nice and bright.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.840
Just got a bit of celery and parsley, just gonna

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.130
sprinkle this on top. Bit of pine nuts, been
lightly toasted. The pine nuts, they add a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.530
bit of texture, a little bit of nuttiness.
They kind of bring it all together. So that's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.230
it guys, that's my Caponata. If you have any
