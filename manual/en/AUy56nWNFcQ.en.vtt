00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:25.996
Finally we're driving the Fisker Karma.

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:30.665
I took quite a while because this car's
been announced quite some time ago.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:40.770
This is because Fisker is a new car manufacturer and therefore
needed time to prove to investors it's worth investing in them.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.649
They've delivered an impressive car.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.475
But not perfect.

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:51.416
And impressive, just look at it, it's
quite an appearance.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:58.573
This is what Hendrik Fisker, this car's 
creator and godfather, is good at.

00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:01.345
Building cars with brilliant streamlines.

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:08.552
But this does result in some setbacks for this car
and the whole concept it's based on.

00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:15.800
It's disrespectful but it's a ordinary plug-in hybrid that's
fuelefficient as long as you charge it.

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:21.326
But Fisker calls it a electric car with range extender.

00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:26.563
The concept is the same as the Opel Impera 7 relays voltage.

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:37.372
So basically it's only got electric drive but it's also equipped with
an combustion engine so you can keep driving when the batteries are flat.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:45.640
The total range of this car is 480 km (298 ml) I believe.

00:01:46.548 --> 00:01:48.641
Then the petrol tank is completely empty.

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:51.060
But that's not the reason this car's been made.

00:01:51.061 --> 00:02:00.564
The reason is that you can charge it with a plug and drive it
for a maximum of 80 km (50 ml) solemnly on electricity.

00:02:01.103 --> 00:02:04.442
In stealth mode it's very quiet.

00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:10.551
But it does produce a star wars like sound in
order to tell pedestrians this car is near.

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:14.125
And to see if it can drift we're simply going to try.

00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:32.914
With 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 6.3 seconds the Karma is pretty fast,
but this is in sport mode and not the electric stealth mode.

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:38.495
Then it takes almost 8 seconds and its top speed
is reduced to 153 km/h (95 mph).

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:41.605
In sport mode it can do 200 km/h (125 mph).

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:47.783
But the "Autobahn cruise rating" is a mere 6 because...

00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:55.584
... although the car reaches 120-130 km/h (75-80 mph) pretty quick,
it looks like it's reaching its limit when you go any faster.

00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:58.676
It isn't something it's good at.

00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:02.230
Something it is good at, is it consumption.

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:07.204
51 grams of CO2 emission and this for a car with
more than 400 bhp.

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:10.349
Obviously this means that you need to charge it every day.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.173
But it is fairly fuel efficient.

00:03:13.174 --> 00:03:16.627
I've previously mentioned the concept: batteries.

00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:21.709
It has 400 kg (880 lbs) of batteries, giving a total of 2400 kg (5200 lbs).

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.917
It's a large car, but in the USA it has been classified
as a sub-compact.

00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:29.165
Meaning, a small car.

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:32.342
In the car there isn't a lot of space.

00:03:32.343 --> 00:03:36.422
Although I'm touching the roof, it's quite
alright for the driver.

00:03:36.423 --> 00:03:38.502
But in the back there is little space.

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:42.103
The trunk is 180 litre (47,5 US gallon) which isn't very much.

00:03:42.104 --> 00:03:49.104
Fisker is coming with the Karma Surf, a station car
that has a little more space.

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:53.473
But when you're looking at the car you
expect it has more space than it actually does.

00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:00.225
But Fisker does command some respect.

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:05.843
Because they've started from scratch, they didn't
have anything but an idea.

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:11.072
In order to bring that idea on the road they've taken
quite some steps and have developed a fair amount themselves.

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:13.331
But they do need to take a few additional steps.

00:04:13.332 --> 00:04:21.309
For instance, there's a touch screen navi but it
isn't as smooth as the iPad yet.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.924
Also the finish and colour combinations...

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:31.032
... it's some kind of weird chocolate brown colour with
beige on the inside.

00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:34.234
Not really my cup of tea.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:36.548
But they're forgiven.

00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:42.087
This car's an icon, the new kid on the block
with new technology.

00:04:42.088 --> 00:04:46.373
The Karma is amazingly quiet when driving in stealth mode.

00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:49.171
And it's got 1300 Nm of torque...

00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:55.089
... so if you're not driving over the Dutch speed limit (120-130 km/h
or 75-80 mpg) it will accelerate without any effort.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.884
And than it's fast enough.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.069
That makes that you can forget all
those small irritations.
