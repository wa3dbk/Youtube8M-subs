00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:02.044
- [Skyy] Relax. Breathe deeply girls.

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:03.207
This is what we do.

00:00:03.207 --> 00:00:04.535
Jess, action!

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:07.291
- This episode is sponsored
by the app Hot or Not.

00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.088
- And today we're making
Smirnoff Preparadas.

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:12.450
- [Skyy] Green apple. Throw
some of those in your glass.

00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:14.633
- Yay.

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:17.541
(laughter)

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:19.327
- [Skyy] More damn it! You too Jess.

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:20.888
- What if I don't like apples?

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:23.139
- [Skyy] Well, too bad. Ain't
nobody care what you like.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:24.568
- [Skyy] Grapes.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.698
Pick em off and just drop em in.

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:30.805
It's like almost like a fruit salad.

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:31.935
What, y'all feedin' each other?

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:33.626
Oh, that's real hot. Go ahead. Go ahead.

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:36.052
You can slip a grape in
her mouth. Do it real slow.

00:00:37.652 --> 00:00:40.229
Oh yeah. Go ahead Jess.
Chew it slow. Oh my God.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:44.135
Oh shit. OK. Alright, I
love the way this is goin'.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:45.447
Pina!

00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:47.567
- Oh, I like this stuff.

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:49.110
- [Skyy] What, pineapple?

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.965
- Yeah.

00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:51.448
- [Skyy] OK.
- It makes my mouth hurt.

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:53.153
- [Skyy] OK. Pineapple
makes your mouth hurt?

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:53.975
- Mmhmm.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.097
- [Skyy] OK. Gummies!
Drop in some gummy bears.

00:00:57.712 --> 00:00:59.309
Don't drop in all of em.

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:02.458
Cool, OK, fine.

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:03.961
OK, fine, fine, fine.

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:05.061
Gummy worms!

00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:06.449
- Yes!

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:08.764
- OK.

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.671
- [Skyy] Hold on, leave
some. Don't use all.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.814
Leave a little bit.

00:01:13.383 --> 00:01:15.836
Here. Go ahead. Drop in some gummy worms.

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:17.969
Gummy mellos. These are round gummies.

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.146
You wanna drop some of those.
- Oh, these are so good.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:19.793
- [Skyy] You like em?

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:20.670
- Yeah.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.011
- They're like apricot, right?

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:23.816
- Mmhmm.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:25.913
- [Skyy] OK. Green apple vodka.

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:26.894
- How much?

00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:28.431
- [Skyy] Pour. I can
tell you when to stop.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.760
Excellent. OK.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.586
Now we can hit this with
a little bit of this

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:36.783
Mexican thingy, candy like thingy.

00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:38.285
It's called Chamoy.
- Have you had this before?

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:39.341
- [Skyy] No, I've never had it before.

00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:40.748
I have no idea what this drink taste like.

00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:41.341
- Tell me when to stop.

00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:42.875
- [Skyy] But it's super popular.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.467
Don't go heavy with it.
- Oh, it's so syrupy.

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:46.333
- [Skyy] OK, that's good. Go ahead, pour.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.032
Top that off.

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:49.512
- All of it?

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:50.179
- [Skyy] Yeah.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.247
- Yummy.
- [Skyy] Just fill that up.

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:52.183
OK. Right there.

00:01:52.183 --> 00:01:52.763
- Mmhmm.

00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:53.763
- [Skyy] It's like our
little garnish stick

00:01:53.763 --> 00:01:57.318
so you can put together a little garnish

00:01:57.318 --> 00:01:58.698
made up of the fruits.

00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:01.743
Jesus and you got this one
weird lookin' thing hangin' off.

00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:03.153
(laughter)

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:05.263
Look how disgusting yours looks man.

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:06.744
What the hell is that shit?

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:07.663
Ready?

00:02:09.922 --> 00:02:11.914
Why you lookin' at me like that?

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:13.727
- Gotta be prepared.

00:02:13.727 --> 00:02:14.897
- And there you have it!

00:02:15.404 --> 00:02:16.522
- God (laughter).

00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:17.376
- Shit.

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:18.801
- Smirnoff Preparadus!

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:24.608
OK. So try to stir it up a little bit,

00:02:24.608 --> 00:02:25.896
get everything mixed up.

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:27.298
Not like that Jess. Don't jerk it, OK?

00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:28.358
- Oh.
- Don't jerk it.

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:29.694
- And you're doin' it rough jerks anyway.

00:02:29.694 --> 00:02:30.984
That shit's painful.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.133
Try to get it mixed up, OK?

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:34.502
- Oh ya.

00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:35.937
- It's not gon' mix like that punk!

00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:37.773
- Oh well, I was doing that.
- You gotta dig in it.

00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:39.735
- OK, go ahead.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.176
- Woo, it's sweet! I like it.

00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:46.733
- You like it?

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:47.680
- Mmhmm.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.644
- Sour.

00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:49.895
- It's sour?
- Oh, I like sour.

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:51.346
- Yeah, but it's good.

00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:52.019
- Mmhmm.
- You like it?

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.297
- It taste like candy, like.

00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:54.900
- Well that's the whole thing and see,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.753
what you do is, as the night goes on,

00:02:56.753 --> 00:02:58.833
you keep refilling this and
so as everything in there

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.246
gets soaked and then you
begin to eat the fruits, OK?

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.321
- Oh and then you can eat it.

00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:01.984
- Yeah.

00:03:01.984 --> 00:03:04.031
It look like just something
that we randomly made up,

00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.095
but it is a very, very popular drink

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:08.492
in certain Latino communities, OK?

00:03:08.492 --> 00:03:09.870
That's what they, this their thing.

00:03:10.654 --> 00:03:12.473
OK, so how the app works, right?

00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:14.306
If I think you're hot
and you think I'm hot,

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:15.735
then we could talk.

00:03:16.503 --> 00:03:17.575
- Oh, she's cute.

00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:18.974
- [Skyy] Hold on, we gotta see more.

00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:21.673
- She looks a lot like Nikki.
- She OK, I mean.

00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:24.045
I like the piercings
and stuff, I'll go on.

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:27.252
Nice rack. No 'cause
you shouldn't be hidin'

00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:28.795
your face on a app like this, OK?

00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:29.774
- OK.

00:03:29.974 --> 00:03:30.614
- [Skyy] Alright. Go ahead.

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:31.979
- Woah!

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.560
- Nice rack. So, let's like that.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.934
- Woo! Some titties!

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:36.969
- [Skyy] That's like a wink, wink.

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.497
Let me go and look at the first photo.

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:40.793
- OK, OK. I'm gonna say yes or no?

00:03:40.793 --> 00:03:42.505
- [Skyy] Yes. I'll go yes.

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:43.829
I'll go yes.
- Yeah.

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.849
'cause she takin' it off, yes.
- She's hot.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.312
- [Skyy] Another, no! You in a corn field?

00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:49.288
What kinda wilderness you in?

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:50.889
Get your ass outta here with that shit.

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:51.954
Duck face. No.

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:53.469
I know many people look at this and go,

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:54.608
"That's a really shallow app."

00:03:54.608 --> 00:03:55.936
But it's fun.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.435
Do it with your friends.
Hate on some people, OK?

00:03:58.435 --> 00:03:59.902
Hate on some people!

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:07.318
- (moaning) Oh Bach!

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:08.918
Oh Bach!

00:04:08.918 --> 00:04:10.824
Oh no, nothing happened.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.472
That sounds familiar, OK.
