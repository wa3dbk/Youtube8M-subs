Hi! My name is Katie and I'm here on behalf
of expertvillage.com to show you how to grease

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.880
slides on a French horn. Now keeping your
slides greased is basic for maintenance and

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.910
it is very important because you need to be
able to move your slides first of all for

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.789
intonation so you could adjust them by pulling
them out or pushing them in and second of

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.930
all so you could take them all the way out
if you need to dump your spit. Now the best

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:44.579
way to do this I will show you so here is
the slide that have got taken out of that

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:53.299
horn. You to buy some kind of tuning slide
grease that you should be able to find at

00:00:53.299 --> 00:01:02.160
any basic music store. I usually use my fingers
so I can control as best as possible where

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.322
the grease is going but it is up to you if
you rather not. You want to apply it as you

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:16.740
are right here towards the end of the tubing,
you want to apply it all the way around the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:33.219
perimeter like so. Now once you have done
that you are going to put it into the horn.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:40.740
Now particularly when you are taking slides
out or putting them back in on this side of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.500
the horn with the keys, remember to press
down the key that corresponds to the tubing

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.050
where you are going to be putting the slide
in so the pressure does not build up. If you

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.479
are doing as I'm doing here you doing the
side underneath which is the B flat side of

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.710
the horn you would press on that key and the
thumb key. Okay so I have my first finger

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.420
pressed down, I have my thumb pressed down,
I'm going to push the slide all the way end.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.870
Now because I put the grease right at the
very end of the tubing as I pushed it in the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.560
entire tubes, the entire way to break tubes
without the grease. So now I pull on them

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.610
and I press in, out, in, and your repeat this
as often necessary until you find where it

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.880
starts moving much more smoothly as it did
before. Once you have done all of these steps

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.950
go ahead and put it back to the intonation
setting where you had it before and now that

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.200
slide is greased and you don't have to worry
about it.
