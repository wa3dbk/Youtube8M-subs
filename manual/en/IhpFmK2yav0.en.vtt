00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:06.591
- Well, you know, I'm from Montana,

00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:09.598
but my first career, actually,
was as a country singer

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:12.187
and I was singing all of
these romantic stories

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:14.822
about farmers and what
great lives they had,

00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:16.768
but as I was traveling around the country,

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:18.812
what I was hearing from
farmers is actually

00:00:18.812 --> 00:00:20.665
their lives weren't that great and it was

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:22.476
a really tough time to be a farmer.

00:00:22.476 --> 00:00:25.239
So I went to work for senator Jon Tester

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.083
who's a farmer and also
a senator for Montana

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:30.336
and he introduced me to
this group of farmers

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:33.180
who were doing organics
and it wasn't because

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.952
they were hippies, it was because it was

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:36.576
better for their livelihoods.

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:38.654
So I was really curious
about that and that

00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:40.487
lead to this research.

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.077
So for farmers in the American heartland,

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.605
they're stuck in a situation where they

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:47.617
mostly have to grow one crop.

00:00:47.617 --> 00:00:49.416
It's the only thing they can market

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.634
and this isn't good for the environment

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.014
because if you grow one
thing over and over,

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:56.209
that's going to attract
pests, it's going to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:59.132
generate disease, it
requires a lot of chemicals

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:01.137
to support that kind of a system.

00:01:01.137 --> 00:01:03.152
So what these farmers
started to do is rotate

00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:05.614
other crops into their major cash crop

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:07.413
so they had to find other markets,

00:01:07.413 --> 00:01:09.829
but they found that this was beneficial,

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.255
both for their livelihoods
and for their land.

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:15.577
What I thought was so interesting about

00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:17.958
what these farmers were
doing is that it was

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.859
multidimensional, they
were interested in food

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.224
that was healthy, food that would support

00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:26.580
their livelihoods, but
also entire farming systems

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.679
that would respond to the
challenges of climate change.

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.663
They have really volatile
weather and they also have

00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:36.042
dry weather, so they
may not get any moisture

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:39.037
in a given season, and these
farmers have figured out

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:43.688
how to farm productively,
even with that uncertainty.

00:01:43.688 --> 00:01:45.998
And the amazing thing about
lentils is that they can

00:01:45.998 --> 00:01:48.930
actually grow their own
fertilizer, so you don't

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.957
have to apply synthetic
nitrogen because lentils

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:54.372
can take it from the air
and work with bacteria

00:01:54.372 --> 00:01:56.357
to supply it to the soil.

00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:59.236
So this key nutrient comes
from the plant itself

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:02.069
rather than coming from chemicals.

00:02:03.137 --> 00:02:04.711
Well I think we're accustomed to thinking

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:07.021
that the most sustainable
food choices are local

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:09.676
food choices, and in a
lot of cases that's true,

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:13.019
it's good for us to have really
robust local food systems,

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.875
but one of the surprising
things I learned when I

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.646
was researching this book
is that transportation

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:21.537
to the final point of
sale only accounts for

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:25.299
four percent of the
emissions in the food system.

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.246
So what we really need to
tackle are these green house gas

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:33.542
heavy processes on the farm
and even before the farm

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:37.106
so things like nitrogen
fertilizer, and since lentils

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:40.647
make their own nitrogen with
bacteria, buying lentils

00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:43.081
from a producer who might
be hundreds of miles away

00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:46.506
from you is actually a more
sustainable choice than

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:48.688
conventionally fertilized produce or grain

00:02:48.688 --> 00:02:50.521
that's closer to home.

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.389
I think the next wave of the food movement

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.583
of organics is actually coming from the

00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:58.680
middle of the country,
from some surprising

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.185
spokespeople who might be republican,

00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:05.460
homeschoolers, church goers, who want to

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.043
sustain their land for
the next generation.

00:03:11.571 --> 00:03:14.028
Berkeley is such a hotbed of interest

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:16.315
in the food system and
I've been really lucky

00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:18.707
to work with a number of people who are at

00:03:18.707 --> 00:03:22.511
the top of their field working
on food systems issues.

00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:24.144
Michael Poland, who's a professor at the

00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:26.884
journalism school has
been a mentor for me.

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:29.101
A number of faculty
associated with the Berkeley

00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:32.085
food institute and the
department of geography

00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:34.508
where I got my PhD, and
they've all helped me

00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:38.079
think about how this
particular story about Montana,

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.040
where I'm from, fits into
the larger picture of how

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.040
we solve these big problems
in our food system.
