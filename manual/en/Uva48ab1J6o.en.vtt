Language warning.

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:09.799
Hello again!

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.059
Airbrushtutor here
I'm very excited today, because i'm bringing

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.490
you the line tutorial -
But before we get into that - some very good

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.490
news!

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.820
I've found that 40% of my viewers are 45 - 50
year old males!

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.980
So i can F$&amp;%*ing swear now! ha!

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.980
Sh%*.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.589
And when i say that i'm going to teach you
how to do lines,

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:30.589
No!

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.710
I don't mean those types of lines.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.940
you know who you are.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.190
before you can start doing lines, you're going
to need to make sure that you have watched

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
and perfected the first tutorial,
how to hold an airbrush

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.219
and the second tutorial
how to control an airbrush.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.609
this tutorial is a culmination of both of
those videos together.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.460
It's about staying stiff, moving back and
forward with your legs and nothing else.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.629
Not moving your wrists
Don't do this!

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.829
It's not about teaching the same way that
Mr. Miyagi taught the Karate kid,

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.780
I'm not teaching you karate!
this is airbrushing

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.770
I don't want to see you moving any of your
joints, do not move your shoulders and don't

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.340
move your wrists!

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.520
Robotic movements,
distancing - which i will go through

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.760
and keeping the same distance from the canvas
or artwork that you're doing.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.690
It's about doing robotic movements and staying
stiff.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.180
But at the same time relaxing!

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.250
Do that!

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.360
As beginners, let's make sure we're holding
our airbrush properly

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.560
and make sure when you do this line, that
you're double actioning.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.970
Double action, so we know we're doing it right.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.850
the process of doing a line correctly;
air down,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.880
pull back for paint..
and move with your body.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.020
Then repeat that process in reverse
stop moving with your body,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.480
Push forward to cut off paint..
and only then can you release the air.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.010
Make sure when you paint this line, that you're
distancing correctly.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.830
What is distancing?

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.800
Distancing is when you use the opposite hand
from the hand you airbrush with,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.650
to maintain a distance from your artwork.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.369
So for example I'm right handed,
I'll use my left hand for distancing.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.200
Holding the airbrush,
maintain a distance from the artwork.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.060
The reason for this is so that we get a nice
uniform line -

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.620
It shouldn't go from small, to big to small.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.750
That's not even a straight line.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.350
I'll distance with my left hand,
start moving,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.350
pull back for paint.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.510
Paints off,
stop moving,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.230
air off.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:41.310
Let's do it again and see if we can create
exactly the same line.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.400
Let's go in a little bit closer and see what
happens when we're about 5cm from the paper.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400
Ha!

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.360
The line gets smaller!

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.560
Let's see what happens when we go in at two
centimetres!

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.110
The lines are getting smaller!

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.920
So why don't try pulling back less on the
paint?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.360
Our lines are getting smaller again.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.740
but why are you teaching me this??

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.190
Just draw something!
the detailed areas of your artworks, such

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.480
as here in the eye,
mean that you have to move extremely close

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.740
to the artwork,
and it also means, that you have to pull back

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.870
very little for paint.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.000
Let's see what happens when we distance, 20cm
from the paper.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Ha!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The line's bigger!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.530
The further away you are from the artwork,
the thicker your lines are going to be.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.450
the more you pull back, the thicker your lines
are going to be.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.340
applying less paint at a closer distance,
will mean you get finer detailed lines.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:59.010
I want to get better,
How can i get better?

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.599
If you want to improve, then practise this
little exercise;

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.970
I want you to do two dots.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.560
Now i want you to practise doing a line that
starts on the very middle of one dot,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.630
and ends on the very middle of the next dot.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.621
Remember this;
Whenever you're doing a line - snap on, snap

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:22.680
off!

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:32.110
Is there any other sh%&amp; I need to remember
when doing lines?

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.880
something else that's important to remember
when doing lines,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.569
is to make sure that you look ahead of your
line.

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.309
Wherever you're going look ahead a little
bit.

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:46.069
A good driver will always look ahead,
you don't look directly what's in front of

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.169
you because..
you'll have a crash!

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.669
And let's continue.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.439
If i begin doing a line before i start moving,
watch what happens;

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:00.439
Blob!

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.050
It looks crap!

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.909
Make sure you're moving first.

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.750
Next exercise you can practise [with testicle
pop],

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.349
is doing two lines and starting and stopping,
snap on, snap off

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.789
at the end of each line.

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:14.789
Sh%&amp;!

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.039
I ran out of paint.

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.580
Snap on, snap off!

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.339
And that's how to do a line[burp] - correctly.

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:30.759
Practise this, perfect your lines,
next we'll learn about effects

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.960
