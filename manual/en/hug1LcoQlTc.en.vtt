00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.630
Hello, my name is Don Deubler. I am chairman
of the board and CEO of Deublin Company. My

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.679
father established the company in 1945, and
today I run it with the same customer focus.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.270
During the next few minutes, this video will
provide examples of our capabilities in the

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.420
markets we serve. I trust you will find it
informative. Please contact us to see how

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.420
we can provide engineered solutions for your
challenging applications.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.300
Whenever water, steam, oil, coolant, lubricants
or other media have to be transmitted into

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.219
or through rotting machine parts like rollers,
shafts, or spindles, rotating unions are employed.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.420
Most of these rotating unions have one thing
in common: they are manufactured by Deublin

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.420
Company, the world leader. Deublin unions
are used in machine tools, steel machinery,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.090
paper and corrugating equipment, rubber and
plastics manufacturing, wind energy, printing

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.270
equipment, forging in many other industries
and applications. Deublin World Headquarters

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.460
are located in Waukegan, Illinois, close to
Chicago, along with manufacturing facilities

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.460
in Hofheim-Wallau, Germany, Montevegio, Italy,
and Dalian, China. Deublin products are available

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.259
globally through a network of wholly owned
subsidiaries and authorized distributers.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.479
Since our founding in 1945, Deublin has grown
from a small garage shop to manufacturing

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.479
operations, sales offices, and distribution
facilities in 17 countries on 4 continents.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.230
With world-renowned engineering, Deublin continues
to set the industry standard with over 3,000

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.230
product models and a growing list of breakthrough
innovations. Like the patented AutoSense,

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.670
rotating unions that handle coolant. MQL,
or dry air, automatically sensing media and

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.319
changing seal operation in response. Or multi-passage
unions with 2 to 12 ports for different media.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.099
For such high reliability applications such
as steel, semi-conductor, plastics, and rubber,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.550
even flight simulators. Recently, Deublin
introduced Slip Rings, for both power and

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:21.090
signal transmission. Deublin's Slip Rings
are used in such applications such as wind

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.090
energy, semi-conductor, plastics, converting,
and more.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.220
How does Deublin continue to innovate? By
working directly with end users and designers

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.830
of machinery throughout the world. Deublin
engineers, sales and customer service staff

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.830
work closely with customers to solve problems
and improve productivity the world over. At

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.269
this, Deublin invests worldwide, in a unique
and close distribution network. Our sales

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.090
engineers respond quickly to provide support
and assistance to customers. Deublin manufacturing

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.370
is state of the art, employing modern CNC
machining centers, and adhering to the latest

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.370
quality standards. Deublin is ISO 90001 certified.
Quality encompasses our entire company. Our

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.840
standards are world-class, the result of an
integrated quality system that consists of

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.840
preventative and analytical systems. Customized,
relevant, and process-oriented. Sophisticated

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.699
measurement and testing technology together
with distinctive quality consciousness, secured

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:56.699
Deublin products its place in the market.
Deublin manufacturing is world class. We call

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.910
it Deublin Performance Systems, or DPS. DPS
stands for a holistic approach to prepare

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.120
the company for the tasks of the future. Today,
all employees in all areas are working ambitiously

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.710
on continuous improvement of all processes.
Top priority is increase in customer satisfaction.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.910
When a customer places an order for rotating
unions, they are pulled from the line side

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.780
inventory. This triggers replenishment unions
that are then built in the value stream. DPS

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.780
ensures that 90% of union orders are shipped
to our customers the next business day.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.960
Despite long service life, all rotating unions
are subject to wear. But no matter, replacement

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.210
parts are always readily available since Deublin
is represented in all the major industrial

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.210
centers across the globe. Most Deublin rotating
unions are repairable. And so here again,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.580
as in many other areas, we contribute substantially
to protect the environment. Deublin is ISO

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.880
14001 certified. Deublin factory-repaired
rotating unions are returned to the customer

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:34.039
with a new union warranty.
In 4 continents around the world, at 17 wholly-owned

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:45.690
subsidiaries, and in over 120 authorized distributor
locations, dedicated Deublin employees make

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:52.699
that our customers get technical support,
supply, and service at site. Since March 2009,

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:02.180
Deublin is certified as an Authorized Economic
Operator, AEO. This proves that our supply

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:09.180
chain is secure and custom is reliable. Deublin
is committed to setting the standard for engineering,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:19.330

equipment requirements worldwide. For more
