Jane Houston Jones: What's Up for October. Juno's Earth flyby, International Observe the Moon Night

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and how to view the moon's far side.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hello and welcome. I'm Jane Houston Jones from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Sound effect.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Jones: On October 9 at 3:21 p.m. Eastern time, or 19:21 Universal Coordinated Time,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
NASA's Juno spacecraft performs a close flyby of Earth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
At closest approach, Juno will come to within 347 miles or 559 kilometers of our planet's surface.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This flyby will provide a gravity assist to the spacecraft, allowing it to pick up the extra speed it needs

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in order to get to its destination: the giant planet Jupiter.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Sound effect.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Jones: October 12 is International Observe the Moon Night, and the moon will be visible before sunset.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's a night dedicated to encouraging people to look up and take notice of our nearest neighbor.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
As the moon sets in the west at midnight, Jupiter is just rising in the East.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
On the 25th you'll find Jupiter above the moon.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Most people think we see the same 50 per cent of the lunar surface every month.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But a gentle wobble of the moon in the Earth's sky lets us peek at

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
an additional 9 per cent of the moon's surface.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This wobble, or libration, lets us occasionally see a bit around the east and west limb of the moon

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and over the north and south poles.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This phenomenon becomes apparent when viewing Mare Frigoris in the north

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and Mare Crisium on the moon's east limb over time.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Catch a glimpse of the far side's Mare Orientale on the western limb near the first of the month.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's the youngest impact crater on the moon.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Mare Marginis, Smithii and Australe are all visible after dark on the 11th through the 13th.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Try spotting them through any size telescope during International Observe the Moon Night.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You can read about all of NASA's missions, including lunar missions and Juno,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
That's all for this month. I'm Jane Houston Jones.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
