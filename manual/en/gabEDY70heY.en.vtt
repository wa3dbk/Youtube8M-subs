00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.100
This is "It's my Life 365" and Today we're
headed to Budapest.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.540
Budapest.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.579
I'm travel writer photographer Brendan van
Son, and this is my daily adventure.

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.650
Welcome to "It's my Life 365".

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.820
So we're just leaving Bratislava now and we're
rolling with Eurail, first class as usual.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.090
The train ride's about two and a half hours
to get to Budapest.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.539
Budapest is a city I've been looking forward
to for ever.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.210
So I'm really stoked about this.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:36.360
Let's ride the rails.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.860
Let's get to Budapest.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:54.559
It's still raining here in Budapest, so we're
going to do another rainy day thing here,

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.420
and check out the thermal hot spring, thermal
pools, I think they're called Széchenyi or

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.680
Széchenyi or Chefchaouen, which is a Moroccan
city apparently.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.010
And, yeah, we're going to head in there and
warm up a little bit.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.050
We're inside the pools now.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.900
It's an absolutely cool place.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.160
If you ever come here, you get a private cabin
to change in, your own lock, so you're all

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.480
locked up, you get all your gear locked up.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.530
We didn't bring our cameras because we didn't
know that and I'm really wishing we did because

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.130
this place is phenomenal and would make for
awesome photos, especially in this light that

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.130
we have right now.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.370
I have the GoPro, so I'm going to have to
make due with that.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:54.000
Cool place, though.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.530
So we're done at the baths.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.530
They were awesome.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.470
I imagine that place is insanely busy during
the summer months but right now, in the fall,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.470
we were pretty calm in there actually.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.750
It was a great time.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.170
I think it would be perfect in the middle
of winter, or on a cold rainy day like today.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.170
Perfect time.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.760
Let's get out of here.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.390
So the weather is actually getting a little
bit better here in Budapest, but today we're

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.900
going to get a little bit adventurous, and
apparently there's some caves here in Budapest

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.990
that we can crawl around through.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.380
So, I'm not exactly sure what to expect.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.490
A friend of mine told me that it's below the
city or underneath the city.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.520
So it'll be completely interesting, I think.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.200
I'll get a little bit of Adventure here in
Budapest.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:17.590
Let's go check out these caves.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:29.959
So the rains have completely stopped here
in Budapest and the weather is beautiful.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.920
We're down on the riverfront now and we're
going to do some photography.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:45.000
And yeah, absolutely phenomenal light tonight,
so I think it'll be good.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.270
So that's it for me here in Budapest.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.960
It's been absolutely phenomenal.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.190
I'm off to Zagreb now on the train, which
is waiting behind me, so I should get going.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.129
This has been "It's my Life 365" having an
amazing time in Budapest, one of my favourite

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.500
cities, hope Zagreb is cool too, I'll see
you there.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.740
Peace!
