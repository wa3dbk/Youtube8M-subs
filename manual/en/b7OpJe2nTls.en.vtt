00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.194
Okay guys. So we're starting with a very quick knife defense scenario.

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:11.646
Gio and Mark are over here. One of them has knife, I don't know which one.

00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:14.242
Their goal is going to be to pull up the knife and stab me any

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:19.475
point they want. My goal is to what? To basically obviously, don't get stabbed.

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:22.899
Being able to pick out who I think has a knife based

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.067
on positioning, body language, anything I can pick up on who I

00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:31.429
think he has a knife. And how should I position myself? Now, what

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.825
I'm really looking at is the first initial strike. Me being able

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:39.146
to pick up who I think has a knife and position myself in the best

00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:42.268
position to be able to intercept that knife as quickly as possible.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.083
Go guys.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:45.851
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:47.213
&gt;&gt; Look at this punk.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:54.662
Look at him... Hey I think I remember this guy, come over here you...

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:59.850
&gt;&gt; What's going on? Break!

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:06.483
Now, this was a really tough one because the first thing I saw was Marco's

00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:11.104
fingers. Marco said "hey man" and he showed me his fingers, I assumed

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:14.710
he didn't have the knife but I said to myself maybe he does have

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.425
a knife and he's just doing this.
 Kinda like saying I'm all good.

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:21.879
But then Gio had his hand half in his pocket half open just holding

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.283
the knife this way. So right away I picked up their hands and as

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:29.039
they came towards me he did this and Marco at one point goes "hey"

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.659
and he put his hand behind his pocket. So, I'm thinking...

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.628
He's got the knife but before I can see his hand and pick it out.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:40.480
All I see Gio is coming in straight with a stab. And again this is where

00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:44.065
reality based self-defense comes in. Come over here Gio. I trap the knife.

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:49.287
As the knife came in I trapped it this way, right. Now guys I don't teach

00:01:49.288 --> 00:01:53.362
people to trap the knife this way but this is what happened.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.575
This is the range I was in. He came in charging and as he came and I

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:59.007
just stopped. 
Boom! Trapped the knife. This is how I trapped it.

00:01:59.008 --> 00:01:59.850
It's a fight!

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:03.439
This is the way I ended up. At the moment, I'd love to tell you,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.026
oh well, you did it all wrong, you should have came in this way.

00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:08.320
This was a real scenario. I didn't know which one had the knife.

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:11.013
I didn't know which one was going to attack me. I didn't know how,

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:14.437
or when. It just happened that way. And this is what fights are

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:17.845
going to look like. And I just managed to say this was the fastest way.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.359
Because he came in so close, and I didn't have enough time to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.022
bring my hands up the way I'm supposed to because it just happened

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:26.237
so fast. I trapped it there that would have been, boom! It would have been

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:29.877
a fight and Marco came around, I tried to use him as a shield.

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:31.949
That's what fights look like guys. And that's the way you're supposed

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.441
to train for self-defense, with your training partner. There's no point of you saying,

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:38.885
come at me with the knife this way. Yeah okay, I know you have

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:42.330
a knife but right now looking at four hands, guys who are moving

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.740
their hands, they both have their hands in their pocket.

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:46.799
Marco's tricking me showing his hands and pretending he's got a knife.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.000
This is real stuff

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.306
that could happen in the street. So using your awareness is the key.

00:02:52.307 --> 00:02:55.828
It's the first way to be able to pick up that attack as quickly

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:56.556
as possible.

00:02:56.557 --> 00:03:05.000
