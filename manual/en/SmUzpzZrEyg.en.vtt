00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.560
[Intro music]

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.800
Cobalt, cerulean, turquoise, teal!

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.280
We've all seen lakes, or at least pictures of lakes,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.360
best described by these shades of blue.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.700
If I say green, you may think of a lake full of algae;

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.930
and if I say brown, perhaps you'd think of some murky, gross-lookin', stained pond.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.320
But I doubt that you would associate pink with a body of water!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740
That is, unless you've recently flown over the Southern coast of Western Australia

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.320
and happened to look out the window at the right moment and thought:

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.880
"What the heck is that?"

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.660
"That" would be Lake Hillier.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.060
Situated on Middle Island,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.540
the largest of 105 islands in the Recherche Archipelago,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.000
Lake Hillier is tiny in size; only about 600 by 250 meters,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.380
but it is grand in spirit - because Lake Hillier... is pink.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.320
Like-- like really pink! Bubblegum Pepto-Bismol strawberry shake pink!

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.200
Like eccentric billionaire, just had twin baby girls and wants the world to know pink.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.720
The color is not a trick of the light, the water retains its hue

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.200
when removed from the lake and put into a container -

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.540
for say, a cheap but cool Valentine's Day gift for your boo.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.940
And interestingly, scientists aren't totally sure why Lake Hillier is so rosy

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.560
But it's probably because it's about ten times saltier than the ocean

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.200
and thus the lake is chocked full of salt loving micro algae known as Dunaliella Salina,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.400
one of the few organisms that has adapted to life in such incredibly salinous water.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.800
And these little guys produce Carotenoids:

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.780
pigment compounds that absorb sunlight;

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.660
like beta-Carotene, the same stuff found in carrots and purple cabbage -

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.960
which range in color from yellow to red.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.600
This algae may be the leading candidate as the cause of the pinkness

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.020
because there is another very similar pink lake in Senegal:

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.120
Lake Retba, and it too is home to D. Salina.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.800
A color of the lake is most intense during the dry season - when water levels drop,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.610
and the salt content rises - and intense sunlight causes the algae to flourish.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.560
But there may also be another culprit - Halobacteria,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.309
which despite their name are not even bacteria,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.200
but salt obsessed members of the domain Archaea.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.240
See, if the coloured Carotenoids and algae like D. Salin-a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.160
(Or possibly Sa-lina, I may have been saying it wrong this whole time)

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.760
But they're found only in the chloroplasts,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.280
which the algae use to photosynthesize. But the halophilic Archaea

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.160
keep their pigments dispersed throughout the whole-cell,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.720
like blushing schoolgirls, making them more readily visible.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.780
These halophilic microbes are true extremophiles,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.840
and can hibernate in salt crusts for thousands, perhaps millions of years!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.080
They are some of the oldest living organisms on Earth, and some scientists believe

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.580
that if we someday find life on Mars, they may resemble these guys.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.640
They also may be one of the reasons why that

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.240
fancy salt you bought at the organic food store is pink.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.800
Even if we don't dnow the exact reason why Lake Hillier is so flamboyantly fabulous,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.290
we do know that it is perfectly safe to swim in, making it the ultimate Barbie vacation destination

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.080
