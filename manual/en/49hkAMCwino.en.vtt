Brothers and Sisters of Food Tube.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.750
Food Busker back in the house and this week I'm gonna show you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.630
the most amazing three recipes using
cauliflower. Cauliflower.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.870
I'm now right. Ya Mum overcooked it. It's naff. It's crap.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.120
No. The first one. A cauliflower steak. It's meaty

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.560
tasty, and gnarly. The second one is
cauliflower rice.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.010
if you want to cut down the carbs the
perfect replacement dish for rice.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.050
Amazing. And then the third one. You want pancakes

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.750
I'll give your pancakes. Cauliflower pancakes, and some lovely bacon.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.490
Roll credits. First up, the cauliflower steak.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.480
Slice a steak out from the middle. You want it about a centimeter and a half

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.010
thick, and you want to remove all the
leaves. The core

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.370
is absolutely fine because it's gonna be
the meatiest part

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.590
of the cauliflower steak. Pan on. Two tablespoons of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.870
olive oil. Gonna bring that up to a high
temperature, and then we're going to put the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.410
steak in.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.700
Why? Because I want to get that nice
caramelization on there.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.240
Cos that's what gives this the flavour.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.579
Right, this little bad boy is now caramelized on both sides. So into the oven

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.339
on a medium heat for 15 minutes.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.530
Cauliflower steak, done. Roasting off some red onions,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.240
a red chili and some garlic. Cut through that. Put some parsley and some capers through.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.180
Finished off with some olive oil it's
getting on the side. Absolutely

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.700
flippin' delicious. It's a fraction of the
price of a regular steak. Guys this is

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.530
meaty,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.520
it's tasty, but it's flippin' meat free. It's one of your five a day,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.320
and it's a far more sustainable way to have a steak. Next recipe,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.180
cauliflower rice. With the remaining
cauliflower

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.090
cut out the core. It's just a little bit too tough. Roughly chop the cauliflower. Put it through the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.590
blitzer.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.070
And blitz it through.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.490
It gets there quite quickly, so be careful not to overdo it. The consistency you're looking at is this.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.520
Pan on. 2 tablespoons of olive oil.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.039
Put it in and then you're going to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.849
lightly fry and steam the rice. Because
I'm cooking on the street I haven't got the

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.190
luxury of having a lid to finish the last stage of it.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.890
So, bit of tin foil. Whack it on, and then I'm going to turn it off

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.430
and let it steam for five to six minutes.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.160
That's done. Now we'll put the garnishes through it. A teaspoon of Grand Cumin.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.540
That's gonna give the cauliflower rice a real pungent kick.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.220
Delicious. Stir that in. We'll get some sweetcorn.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.230
On the cob, that I barbecued earlier.
Drop that in. 2 teaspoons

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.589
of pomegranate seeds, and then lets get some flat leaf parsley in there.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.069
Right that is beautiful. If you watching
your carb intake this is a lot lower

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.340
than regular white rice. A good pinch of salt. Right, this rice is ready. Lets serve

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.450
up and then garnish.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.739
Walnuts

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.920
and flaked almonds and then a few
pomegranate to finish.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.540
That's my rice done. Now cauliflower pancakes.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.960
I saved some of my cooked cauliflower
rice earlier.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.299
I want 200 grams of that into the blitzer.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.560
Eight tablespoons of almond flour or

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.060
ground almonds. Same thing. Four eggs
broken in.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.010
4 tablespoons of oat milk. You can use
coconut milk, almond milk,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.739
whatever you want. I want to use it keep
it dairy-free. Pinch of salt.

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.659
Blitz.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.700
Okay, so now what we've got is a lovely batter. It's got some bubbles in it. It's got some air to it.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.140
Pan on, and then about a tablespoon

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.950
of veg oil. I'm going to make small american-style pancakes, perfect for brunch.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.930
So that's our cauliflower pancakes. Perfect with crispy bacon.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.410
And a perfect replacement for gluten-free.
Cauliflower pancakes, done.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.040
So there's three ways to take your
cauliflower to the next level.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.540
Now tell me cauliflower is boring. I've got my cauliflower rice,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.930
quick, fast and mega tasty. And then you've got my cauliflower pancakes. These are so tasty.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.540
And then you've got my hero cauliflower steak. Its gnarly, and

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.210
caramelized on the outside and really fills
you up. Now if you wanna see some

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.900
other cool dishes from me, then come over to my channel. And guys,

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.710
