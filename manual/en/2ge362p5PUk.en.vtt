Hi guys welcome to my first tutorial. I will show you 
 how to build a 360Â° helmet cam for your GoPro.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.760
This is what you need:

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:29.965
A wheel with a swivel joint and a screw with two dices

00:00:29.987 --> 00:00:33.987
A drill bit of the same size of the screw

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:38.952
Three screws:  two with the same length and one a bit 
 more long with the same thickness of the GoPro screw ..

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Some thickness and some nuts..

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:46.332
A drill bit with the same thickness of the GoPro screw ..

00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:50.287
Two GoPro's frames like these..

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.220
and a Gopro platelet.

00:00:55.523 --> 00:01:02.523
An angular with the same length of the Gopro's platelet ..

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We need only a little piece of that, about 5 centimeters.

00:01:08.454 --> 00:01:14.454
And a tube, long like you want. This one is an 
 aluminium  tube 2 meters long and very light .

00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:27.951
First of all we have to separate the wheel from the swivel joint..

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
with a hacksaw or a flexible.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.090
Now we have to take the tube and make a sign in the middle..

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:47.520
and the two extremes where we are going to fix the two GoPro's frame.

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:55.100
Make more attention you can to prevent any kind 
 of problem during the fastening of the screws.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.570
and now we are going to drill..

00:02:08.384 --> 00:02:15.380
Now we have to take the angular to 
 build the frame of the mount.. 

00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:28.470
mark a little piece of the angular , about 
 5 centimeters, and going to cut it.. 

00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:34.890
Now we have to make two different holes:

00:02:36.183 --> 00:02:43.180
the first one with the drill bit with 
 the same thickness of the joint's screw..

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:52.860
and the second one in correspondence of the hole of the plate.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:58.340
Don't do the two holes far from each other..

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.300
in this way the main frame will be more solid

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now we can assemble the mainframe:

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.500
1 take two thicknesses and put it in the 
 part of the plate that we don't use,

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:19.690
2 put the angular in the other part of 
 the plate, in correspondence of the hole

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:27.490
Now we can take the junction and fix it with the angular..

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:34.510
Leave a nut on the screw and if you need also a thickness..

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.800
to don't allow the screw to hit the plate.

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:50.350
Now we have only to fix the two gopro 
 frames and the main frame with the tube!

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:11.160
During the video, I didn't tell you no one objective size because 
 all depends , apart for the thickness of the screws,

00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:30.480
from the material that you buy for build it, like 
 the lenght of the screws, of the tube, etc

00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:36.360
I'm sorry for the subtitles, probably unclear

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:02.510
after the montage you can try it and the effect is similar to this..

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:15.340
I haven't  been a chance yet to 
 try it in a situation more interesting..

00:05:15.954 --> 00:05:20.950
but if you liked the video  "like it" or write a comment.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:35.650

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:43.300
A big greeting and see you at the next video!!! :)
