00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.448
(lively music)

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:07.324
- Hey friends.
- Hey everyone.

00:00:07.324 --> 00:00:09.483
- Thank you so much for
tuning in and Cook With April

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:12.602
on Tasty Tuesday with my family,

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.760
this is Liam, you guys know him,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.088
and that's Justin.
- Hey guys.

00:00:17.088 --> 00:00:20.251
- So we're going to show you
guys how to make egg salad.

00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:23.004
I have been obsessed with
it ever since Justin's mom

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:24.747
made it for us and I just love it,

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:26.918
so this is kind of like my twist on it,

00:00:26.918 --> 00:00:28.404
I've changed it up a little bit.

00:00:28.404 --> 00:00:32.129
So in a large pot I place
water and a dozen eggs,

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.651
and I'm going to boil that.

00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:36.471
Before I boil I add a
sprinkle of baking soda.

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.177
This will allow your eggs to peel easily.

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:41.911
After boiling, you're gonna
remove it from the heat

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:45.382
and let it sit in a covered
pan for 10 to 15 minutes

00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:47.223
to cook a little bit more,

00:00:47.223 --> 00:00:49.626
and then I'm going to
place it in an ice bath

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.877
simply because it will allow the eggs

00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:53.632
from not cooking anymore,

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.005
and also, it's easier to
peel when it's not hot.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.762
So as you can see, adding
the baking soda to the eggs

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:02.519
made it so easy to peel the shells.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.255
And that is how you
make an easy boiled egg.

00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:07.375
Super simple and so easy to peel.

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:09.104
And now to the egg salad.

00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:12.273
I added mayonnaise and
the eggs in a large bowl,

00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:15.418
and then I added Dijon
mustard, and you guys,

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:17.664
it's all about the taste
not the measurements.

00:01:17.664 --> 00:01:19.471
I did put measurements in the info box,

00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:20.767
but go by your taste.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:23.228
if you think it needs more salt, add salt.

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:25.595
If you think it needs more mayo, add mayo,

00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:28.985
and there I went ahead
and added some paprika.

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:32.095
And I used a fork and a
knife to mash the eggs

00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:34.354
and the mayo and the
Dijon mustard together.

00:01:34.354 --> 00:01:36.144
And I love cayenne pepper.

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:40.397
I think it adds such amazing
spice and kick to it,

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:42.736
so I added that, and some salt and pepper.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.547
and I'm mixing all of that together,

00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:48.496
and I love green onions, so
I added some green onions.

00:01:48.496 --> 00:01:49.981
If you don't like it as much as I do,

00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:52.163
you definitely don't have to put as much.

00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:54.472
And that's your egg salad.

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:56.145
You can make a sandwich like I did,

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:58.350
two pieces of sourdough and some lettuce.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.858
Or you can just enjoy it as is.

00:02:00.858 --> 00:02:04.316
It's time to taste the
yummy nummy egg salad.

00:02:04.316 --> 00:02:05.552
- Yes, I'm so excited.

00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:06.761
- Just to let you guys know,

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:08.573
I've made this about maybe 10 times.

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:09.327
- Seriously.

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:11.138
- So, Justin knows what it tastes like,

00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:12.898
but you guys, I mean, but you can share

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:15.628
what you like or dislike
about it, okie dokie?

00:02:15.628 --> 00:02:18.007
- Absolutely, so we're just
doing a pretty simple sandwich

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:19.369
right here with some lettuce on it.

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.949
- Yeah.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.877
- Not too much else, and
this is some sourdough bread.

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:24.954
- Mmm, Liam's like," Ooh, Daddy,

00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:26.360
"One day I'll get to eat it."

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.204
- Mom, if you're watching this,
please don't be mad at me.

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:32.073
But, I really like how you do
the spicy kick in it honey.

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:32.850
- Oh , thanks.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.519
- Honestly, I feel like it
adds such a dimension to it.

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.691
It is so unbelievably good.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.032
Honestly, like until
when my mom came over,

00:02:40.032 --> 00:02:41.902
we had my mom over when Liam was born and

00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:43.479
she helped make a bunch
of meals and stuff.

00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:45.663
And she made egg salad and it totally --

00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:46.348
- It was good.

00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:48.514
- It was so delicious and it
reminded me of my childhood,

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:50.484
and so we've been having
it so much lately.

00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:51.884
- Yeah, once a week.

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:53.854
- Once a week, it's perfect for leftovers

00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:55.079
for lunch or something.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.402
- And we're doing this for dinner tonight,

00:02:56.402 --> 00:02:58.597
so it's really delicious, thank you.

00:02:58.597 --> 00:02:59.459
- And it's a good picnic food.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.548
We actually brought it
for a picnic one day.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.243
Yeah, so we hope you guys enjoy.

00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:05.785
You can have it just
simply as an egg salad

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.597
or a sandwich like we like.

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:11.053
We'll see you guys soon
and please subscribe, bye.

00:03:11.053 --> 00:03:15.112
(lively music)

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:18.155
- Hi, friends.
- Hey, everyone.

00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:20.126
- Thank you so much for

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:22.610
on Tasty Tuesday, and the new addition

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.694
to Cook With April would be Liam.

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:25.659
(Justin laughs)
