00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.510
we talked recently about David Barton
who's this american

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.129
evangelical Christian minister and
conservative activist the last time we

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.730
talked about it was a few weeks ago

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.179
we played a clip of him saying that a
theocracy

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.580
does not exist if there are elections in
other words if you have a

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.150
any any country where there are
elections no matter how

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.130
fraudulent or stage they are it is not a
theocracy of course he seemed to be

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.859
forgetting about places like Iran and
Saudi Arabia

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.410
and attic in etcetera anyway now he's
back in this is video from a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.800
a little class that he did where he
explained how

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.899
the Bible actually is part of the
Constitution

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.719
through the 7th amendment the Seventh
Amendment says

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.110
in suits at common law where the value
in controversy shall exceed twenty

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.850
dollars

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.199
the right of trial by jury shall be
preserved and no fact tried by a jury

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.300
Shelby otherwise reexamined in any court

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.760
the United States then according to the
rules above the common law so what he

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.870
argues is that the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.710
that common law includes biblical law

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.909
its total idiocy here's a little clip
with him explaining

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.740
that involves but never hear about 7
percent were hardcore abolitionist

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.530
and I seventy percent said abolish the
laws of nature house labor

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.920
you can't point to any spaces and ensure
acid doesn't exist same time with

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.630
abortion

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.990
out here we believe in evolution
creation there's no species and there's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.520
a built-in John Stillwell

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.759
Palace all process delivery or created
21

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.409
the same thing with homosexuality well i
the cable after two or three species out

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.180
ten million how to easily

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.009
there is always an aberration there's
nothing matches a as a guest blog major

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.100
that's what the american law books call
homosexuality a crime against nature

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.200
where you at all this out here that are
the laws of nature

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.530
yeah this is where you get the laws
Rangers got this summer I'm is a

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.670
you not getting as let me know but let
me tell you right up front

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.759
you don't put it off let me tell you you
don't murder

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.780
let me tell you don't steal see the laws
of nature and the Los Angeles got those

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.390
listed prices got together

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.649
and Lawson Nigella Lawson nature's God
that's what this

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.080
rebound bond scriptures now became
seldom Emma the Constitution

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.580
if he had a hard time following that I
don't blame you and for a guy who claims

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.770
to know so much about nature

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.590
he seems to be ignoring completely the
fact that

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.790
only humans worship gods that only
humans

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.090
have homophobia is any of that natural

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.069
if it's unique to humans it seems the
run counter to sum up his argument about

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.810
nature

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.230
isn't the concept upheld counter
teenager why would you torture your

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.030
children

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.800
in olive eternity with natural about
that I don't think that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.860
typeof argument would release way a guy
like David Barton

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.319
now yeah at the pope recently even to it
said that how is basically a literary

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.760
device

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.780
I but you know

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.110
I here you have people that are just
taking things way too literally

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.129
the people in the room going mmm who he
Hannah

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.459
and idiot always sounds like a genius

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.909
to a group of idiots and that's exactly
what's going on here the seventh

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:09.500
amendment

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.140
insurers the right to a jury trial in
certain civil cases

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.280
and it prevents courts from overturning
a jury's finding a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.569
back it doesn't say that the Bible

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.670
is part of the Constitution it fits the
there's

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.840
this guy fills the room with people and
they think Obama some kind of incredible

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.799
genius in

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.680
thinker it doesn't make any sense
