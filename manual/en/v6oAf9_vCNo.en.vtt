Hey everyone this is chad from gadgetguruhd.com
and in this video we’ll be doing an unboxing

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:25.269
and overview of the brand new mid 2014 15
inch retina macbook pro. I actually have both

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.319
the thirteen and fifteen inch so be sure to
check out my video on the fifteen inch model

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:34.460
and also my comparison between the two which
will be linked in the description.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.370
Aesthetically speaking this 2014 macbook pro
is exactly the same as the previous gen. The

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.920
real difference lies within the internals.
But before we get into the specs let’s do

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.840
this unboxing.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
First we’ll go ahead and set aside the macbook
pro, and next we’ll find the designed by

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.910
apple in california box which holds a quick
start guide, the macbook pro important info

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.410
guide, some apple stickers, and a nice little
cleaning cloth.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.190
Here we’ll find ourselves the power cord
and power brick for charging up the computer,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.000
and that’s it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.220
The 15 inch macbook pro just looks absolitely
stunning. It’s actually only 1.8 cms thick

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.450
and weighs just under 4 and a half pounds.
On the left side we have the MagSafe 2 power

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.450
port, Two Thunderbolt 2 ports , a USB 3.0
port, a hedaphone jack, and dual mics.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.020
Towards the right you’ll find the second
of two usb ports, an hdmi port, and a sd card

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.219
slot.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.250
This specific macbook pro i’ve unboxed is
the base configutation fifteen inch model.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.950
Now in years past the base model just wouldn’t
be powerful enough to handle any intense editing

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.490
or real work. But this year Apple has bumped
the specs of the MacBook pros across the board.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.490
The base model goes up from 2GHz to 2.2GHz
and the higher end model moves up to 2.5GHz

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.719
from 2.3GHz. And both of these rock the same
i7 Haswell processors from last year.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:02:00.719
When it comes to storage nothing has changed.
You can do a custom order and get both the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.659
base and higher end model with up to 1tb of
storage but they come standard with 256 and

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.229
512gbs of flash storage.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.340
Another major change is with the ram. These
new 15 inch macbook pros now come standard

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.420
with 16GBs of ram which is absolutely huge
for those that need a portable laptop to edit

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.950
on the go. I see a lot of content creators
purchasing these updated macbook pros in the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.360
future.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.540
So far I’ve been really impressed. This
thing has been stunningly fast and I’m really

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.560
excited to edit this video on it. If there’s
