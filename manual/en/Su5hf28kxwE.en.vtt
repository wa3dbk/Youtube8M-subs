00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.959
Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.519
Lately I’ve been playing the game Harvest
Moon: A Tale of Two Towns on my 3DS, I love it.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.859
I love being in the little town of Blue Bell,
because I’m with all my little animals.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.399
Anyways, I’m excited because I just unlocked
the recipe for Tiramisu!

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.640
I finally got my cacao plant, my coffee plant,
I got my cows, my

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.340
chickens and I was able to make Tiramisu!

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
Part of my family is Italian, we have many
tiramisu recipes and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.000
I have never made one before on

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.080
Nerdy Nummies, so today I’m gonna share
one of my family recipes with you guys, this

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.120
one is the easiest because you make it with
pre-made ladyfingers.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.560
So today, we’re gonna be making Harvest
Moon Tiramisu! Let’s get started!

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.460
The things you will need, will be: One package
of Lady Fingers, and for those of you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.339
who don’t know, Ladyfingers are Italian
Biscuits, they’re sponge biscuits!

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.149
Four cups of Espresso Blend Coffee, six Eggs,
16 ounces of Mascarpone Cheese,

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.929
one cup of heavy whipping cream, six tablespoons
of sugar 1/4 cup of Marsala wine,

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.310
this is optional, you don’t need to add
this step if you'd like to make it

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.119
non-alcoholic. And 1/2 cup of cocoa powder.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.200
You will also need three mixing bowls, I’ve
got one large and two medium a little

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.600
sifter, a mixer and a tray.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.580
Now let’s put it all together!

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.960
The first thing that you’re gonna do is
take your medium sized bowl and you’re gonna

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.920
pour your heavy cream, bew!

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.039
Then we’re gonna whip it up on a medium
speed until it turns into whipped cream!

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.649
Once your cream is whipped, like this, oh!

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.329
We’re gonna set it off to the side and we’re
gonna go get 2 more bowls.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.960
In your bowls, we are gonna crack our eggs,
we are gonna be placing the egg yolks

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.209
into our big bowl and the egg whites into
our medium bowl.

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.899
Now we’re gonna meringue our egg whites,
and how you do that is you’re gonna take your

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.290
beater and mix this mixture on a medium high
speed until it stiffens.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.450
And boom! That is a meringue!

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.040
You really gotta mix it, I mixed it for about
5 minutes, for it to look like this.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.860
Isn’t that neat! You start with egg whites
and end up with meringue!

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.220
Now, we’ve got our big bowl of egg yolks,
we are gonna pour in all of our sugar,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.950
bewp! And we’re gonna mix it up for 3 minutes
to make a zabaglione.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.610
Now that we’ve got our egg yolk and sugar mixed
up, we’re gonna add our cheese!

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.170
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.949
Oh! I just want to eat it right now!!!

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.329
Oh no, no, no, no!

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.360
That was a close call!

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.860
Now you’re gonna take your mixture and we’re
gonna mix together until everything

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.000
is well combined.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.019
All of our mixtures are ready, and now we’re
gonna fold them together.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.129
We are gonna fold our white meringue into
our cheese yolk mixture.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.030
A fold is where you scoop down, and then you
fold it up and around!

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.450
Last mixture that we’re gonna fold in is
our whipped cream that we made earlier.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.530
So you’re just gonna take your spatula again
and fold ‘em in!

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.540
Now for my favorite part, we are gonna dip
our little ladyfingers.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.950
So I put a bunch of little ladyfingers on
a plate over here, and here is the wine.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.430
So this part is totally optional, so you don’t
need to do it, but I’m gonna

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.980
pour a little bit of wine into my coffee,
boop!

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.740
What you’re gonna do is you’re gonna take
a ladyfinger, dip into your coffee

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.480
mixture, and then place it into the pan.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.829
And how you’re gonna place it will be like
this, two next to each other.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.890
And you’re gonna go all the way down, covering
the whole bottom of the pan.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.849
A quick tip that I have is like to dip them
horizontal, and you want to move

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.709
quickly because this is a sponge dessert,
it will absorb, and you don’t

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.349
want it to absorb too much liquid. So ready?
Here we go!

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.160
Dip, dip!

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.689
And put it right in the pan.

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.980
We’ve got our first layer of ladyfingers
in the pan, and now we are gonna add

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.930
1/2 of our cream mixture, on top, we’re
just gonna spread it on evenly,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.310
and then we’re gonna add 1/2 of our cocoa
mixture, just sift it on a light layer.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.640
Oh this is a little messy!

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.370
I make it rain, I make it rain, I make it
rain!

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.520
Now we are gonna repeat everything again.
We are gonna add our second layer of

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.680
ladyfingers, the second half of the cream
mixture, and,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.940
sprinkle the second half of the cocoa on top.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.880
Now that we’ve got our Tiramisu dessert
all assembled, we are gonna let it chill

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.180
in the refrigerator for about 4 hours, to
let it set.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.220
Or if you would like to nom, nom, nom, nom,
nom on this sooner!

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.680
You can pop this in the freezer for about
1 hour.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.100
Ta-da! Here is the Tiramisu that we made today,
inspired by the game that I’ve been

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.660
playing, Harvest Moon: The Tale of Two Towns!

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.490
I just got so excited when I unlocked this
new recipe, and, I had to make it for

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.460

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.479
