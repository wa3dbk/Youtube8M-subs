00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
Hello my dear brother and sisters, in this presentation

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.000
I am going to show you one of the unique and fastest method of multiplication

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:11.774
and this multiplication will be any 2 digit number by 9

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:12.407
ok ?

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:14.975
so you know 

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:17.740
you will hardly take 2 seconds to multiply by this way

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.700
let's say you gave me any number

00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:21.173
let's say 59 times 9 

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:26.033
so 59 times 9 = 531

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.820
let's say you gave me a number , 37 times 9 = 333
