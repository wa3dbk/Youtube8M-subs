Hi guys how are ya?

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.880
Today I am gonna be doing a bit of a girly video

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.400
I have found a lovely fashion website and I would like to show you what I got from there

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.280
It is called CNDirect

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.280
I got loads of nice things and I am gonna show ya

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:28.240
And I have put the links for all the items and the main website in the description below :)

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:30.139
So let's go~

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:34.880
It's also worth noting that I bought all the clothes I am going to show you today for under $20 (not including shipping)

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.520
It was not expensive at all

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.760
And the quality is good so I had to share these with you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.520
So the first thing I got is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560
these shoes~

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.025
I think they are so so cute

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:50.637
these are my style

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.041
comfy but cute

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:56.401
and look how cute they even have a rose

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:58.760
they are comfy to wear in summer

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.437
and the sole is quite soft

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:05.877
so I think your feet will be comfortable

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.000
and they were soon cheap so I would definitely recommend them

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.080
and a few weeks ago I went to Croatia

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:21.017
and I took this all the way to Croatia

00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:23.680
and it was so nice to use

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.680
and it was really comfy and easy on the back

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.160
and the fact that it was so cheap made it even better

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:44.320
and it is a lot bigger inside, so I fit all my travel essentials in there

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.160
And how cute is the pattern

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.960
and its so soft

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.680
I used this everyday for a week in Croatia and it did the job perfectly

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.919
I also got this jacket

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.880
I actually got this because I really needed a jacket

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.920
just a simple black jacket

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.640
so it is comfy and it goes with almost anything

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.200
and it suits the cold British weather

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.160
for both summer and winter

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:34.640
and I like the grey part as well as the zipper, it gives it style

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.320
this is an iPhone 6 case

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.340
and it is soo cute

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.460
and the colours go well together

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.109
you can put your cards in

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.709
important things

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.628
and even your BF's picture

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.800
if you do not have a BF then perhaps a photo of G-dragon ;)

00:02:59.057 --> 00:03:02.457
or Song Joongki

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:13.791
and if you have this you don't need to carry around your purse as all the important stuff fits in here

00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:18.111
it is so light

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.320
this is my favourite out of all the things I bought

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.680
it is very very cute and summery

00:03:30.685 --> 00:03:35.565
the colours are bright and I really like this pattern

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:42.000
and these little holes mean you can look sexy

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.520
and it exposes a lot of your back

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.353
so I like it

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960
my BF doesn't kkkkkkk

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.800
I think when it comes to school, this is a really comfortable jacket to wear

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.600
and the bag and the phone case together are very useful as they can carry all of your school essentials

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.440
I love this dress but maybe it is a little too short and tight for school haha

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.960
so I don't recommend it as a school dress

00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:20.055
but it is so summery

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:22.760
and I think it would suit all body types

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.505
and it looks to cute with the shoes

00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:33.385
and the nice thing about these shoes is that you can do your nails all pretty

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.480
So thank you all for watching

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.600
and I love you all

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.080
see ya next time :)
