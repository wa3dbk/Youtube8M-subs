00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.800
So we just arrived in Las Vegas for
Black Hat Def Con,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.640
the world's largest hacker conventions.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.950
But my buddy Brett Novak is in town, so
before we do that we're gonna meet up

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.009
with him in his friends to go check out
St Thomas, Nevada.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.389
It's this town that was submerged by
Lake Mead after they build the dam.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.199
But because the drought has been so bad, the lakes have been rapidly receding

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.159
and now you can actually walk out into this old town.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.540
We just got here at St. Thomas, you can
sort of see,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.420
you can sort of see the foundation and stuff down there.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.700
Hopefully, we can get in and out before we get drenched, and our camera gets destroyed.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.680
You guys take the long way, I'm taking the
shortcut.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.480
Shortcut was a bad idea.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.600
Last time it was visible that I recall

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
it was just like to top of some of them sticking out.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.560
That's so cool.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.190
Oh dude, look at this!

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.110
We could totally hide there.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.360
Oh my god, this is so cool!

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.750
I think we're in trouble.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.880
There's more. Let's go to the other one.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.040
That's cool. It looks like this is an archway

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.759
and it just fell over. Whoa, it fell over!

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.760
There's a bunch o artifacts and stuff
laid out.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.590
What is this thing?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.200
This was a town set up by Mormons in the 1800s.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.710
And they built some homes. They lived here.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.750
However after a survey was done, they changed the border of Nevada,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.510
and the state of Nevada went to the
Mormons

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.320
and told them, "you owe us back taxes,"

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.440
and they said, "no we don't" and so they left.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.440
after they left other people came in

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.640
and the last residents were here
around 1938.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.240
When the dam was built, this all flooded
from Lake Mead's water rising

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.069
and so this has been submerged for 80 years or so.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.810
Because the drought, it's now exposed

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.110
and we're able to walk around and check
out this old ghost town.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.870
I think we're okay I think we're dodging
this.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.039
We're not in the slot canyon or anything.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.519
So we're gonna live. Hopefully.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.870
Wow, I saw that. That was cool.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.000
Lightening? Lightening. Sweet.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.560
What is...

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.870
Dude, this is like an engine block. Yeah.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.280
Whoa! Crazy.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.280
It's raining on us now.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.510
and we're still going to try to make to this last foundation before it gets too bad.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.670
This is, this is my new house.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.350
Legit property here in Vegas, just
outside the city.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.520
So let me show you the game room.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.870
This is cool.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.959
This is cool because this
is the first time in a really long time

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.839
people are able to see this ghost town.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.280
At  any time we do have a really good year,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.000
which would be really nice for rainfall

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.410
in Northern California, the Rockies,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.900
this could very well (and it will) be one
of the last times

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.980
people can see it for a while.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.360
You know, there might be a year who knows how long

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.150
but eventually this is going to go back under water.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.200
and everything you guys just saw
no one is going to walk past for a long time,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.080
at least until the next drought.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.150
Hey thanks for watching everybody.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.030
Make sure to follow me on Twitter at @timcast

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.760
and don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.120
For the next week or so, I'm going to be
down here in Las Vegas

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.460
covering the biggest hacker conventions in the world.
So stay tuned.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.690
Thanks again for watching and I'll see
you all next time.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.360
According to a study by the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.280
world military expenditures though still
relatively high,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.680
have dropped by 1.7 percent over the
past four
