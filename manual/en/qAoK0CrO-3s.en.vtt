Hi. I'm Noopur and on behalf of Expert Village,
I'm going to talk about skin and healthcare

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.090
by natural and traditional ways. In this clip
I'm going to talk about how to take care of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:43.079
your hands and feet. For this we need ground
flour, tomarik, cold milk, and some curd.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.219
Now we got to make a mixture of all these
ingredients. Take two, three teaspoon of ground

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:04.989
flour,

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:30.130
a teaspoon of tamerik, add some cold milk
to it, and two teaspoon of curd. Mix it well

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:50.509
so that a thick past is form and then apply
it on the hands and the feet. This also helps

00:01:50.509 --> 00:02:15.459
in removing tan. So these are the ways that
you can take of your hands and feet at home.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:15.960
Thank you.
