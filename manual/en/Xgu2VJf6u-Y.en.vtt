“An extraordinary event happened this morning on the beach of Capo Peloro”

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
“An unidentified object..”

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.000
“A Car flied across the Straits of Messina, landing on the beach of Pilone, if you are in the area you must go there to check it out"

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.000
"And now our reporter…"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"Now we approach the area and
check out what happened”"

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.000
“We have always loved MINI cars. We prepare them, we modify them, we drive them".

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
“ We have a collection”

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.000
“In 1971, they even drafted a law to award a company in charge of building it“

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.000
“Anyways we don’t need a bridge to cross the Strait anymore.” “We have this”

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.700
“Excuse me Sir, have you seen anything?” “I have seen NOTHING, I have seen nothing, just leave me alone, stop recoding me”

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.700
“I still remember the feeling when we first tested the car”

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.500
“And we understood then, that we could actually make it”

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
“the first time my brother and Mimmo told me their idea, I thought, they are crazy”

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
“but if we consider that a Cessna takes off at a speed of 100 kmph”

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.000
“and weights 100 kilos less than a MINI that weights 1.2 ton. It actually can fly”

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000
“Now if we consider that this car can develop an instant acceleration from 0 to 200 kmph  in less than 25 seconds. It also needs really small wings”

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.000
“Where was it coming from?” “ From Calabria, flying like that and then landing on the beach”

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:12.500
“The car has optimized  air intakes and reduced stopping distance thanks to a new braking system that makes landing easy”

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
“in the 1960 with the rally of Monte Carlo.” “A real role model for any MINI maker.”

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
“In other words we launched it at maximum speed like a bullet and then, we made it fly”

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
“Tests, racing trials and there we are, we flew it across the Strait of Messina:”

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.500
“Good job, how did you get the idea?” “This car is a bullet”

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
