Hey guys, this is Austin. So how fast can
a computer be? Not too long ago all a computer

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.940
really needed to do was a little web browsing
and text editing but today computers are absolutely

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.240
everywhere from watches to massively powerful
workstations. The speed of a computer is typically

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.590
measured in gigahertz, how many billions of
cycles a processor can run per second. Here

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.700
I have one of the more powerful CPUs available
right now, an Intel Core i7-4770K. By default

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.790
it runs at 3.5 gigahertz which is a very healthy
speed but compared to the AMD FX-9590 which

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.560
can be run at up to 5 gigahertz there doesn’t
seem to be too much competition on paper.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.410
However not all gigahertz are created equally.
As far back as ten years ago processors like

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.100
the Pentium 4 were capable of speeds approaching
4 gigahertz but put it alongside a modern

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.500
Core i7 and there’s a massive difference.
At a certain point chipmakers started hitting

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.160
a wall where they couldn’t just keep throwing
more and more power at a CPU to make it run

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.540
faster. To get around this, we now have processors
with multiple CPU cores. Having one powerful

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.620
core is good but having two, four or even
eight on a single chip allows a computer to

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.020
work on lots of things at once. This has worked
well over the last decade, allowing computers

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.780
to get faster and faster by adding more cores
however this too has a limit. Over the last

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.450
fifty years processors have gotten more and
more complex going from two thousand transistors

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.280
in 1971 to over two billion in modern designs.
This constant improvement allows engineers

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.090
to do one of two things, either take their
current designs and make them smaller and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.119
therefore cheaper or keep the chips the same
size and add things such as more CPU cores.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
The latest Intel Broadwell technology is based
on the 14 nanometer process which is seven

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
thousand times smaller than the width of a
human hair. CPUs are going to continue to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.729
get faster and add more cores for the foreseeable
future however the pace has slowed down as

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.970
it gets more and more difficult to cram more
transistors onto a single chip. Another important

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.390
part of a computer are the graphics, known
as a GPU. This is what displays video and

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.250
typically has been in the form of a graphics
card like this however companies like AMD

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.110
have fit powerful GPUs into the same chip
as the processor to create an APU. Where a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.980
CPU has a few very powerful cores a GPU has
hundreds if not thousands of much smaller

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.419
cores which is ideal for things like gaming
and dealing with video. Where things get really

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:19.079
exciting is when you look at quantum computers.
A normal CPU today has two states, zero and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.180
one. On the other hand a quantum computer
can work with massive amounts of numbers at

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.139
once, allowing it to solve problems that would
take a normal computer millions of years in

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.939
a matter of seconds. A company called D-Wave
builds what are arguably the first real quantum

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.600
computers and organizations like Google and
Lockheed Martin are already using D-Wave systems

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.290
to create algorithms to recognize images and
test flight control systems. Just like the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.700
giant room sized computers of the 1950s quantum
computers are in very early stages, requiring

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.049
a massive box filled with shielding and cooling
to keep things stable. Regardless of which

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.129
technology comes out ahead it’s not hard
to imagine a future where a device the size

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.870
of a smartphone becomes the most powerful
computer in the world. The human brain had

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.710
a good run.
