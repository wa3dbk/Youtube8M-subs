DONNIE (OFFSCREEN):
My name is Donnie.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.960
And you suck at Photoshop.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.610
But right now I couldn't give
two Arby's French Dips about

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.980
that because I'm going
on vacation.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.760
So suck that.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.580
I'm going to be doing
the next few

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.634
tutorials from work because--

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:23.430
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): We're
trying to have a team

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.180
meeting here, if
you don't mind?

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.960
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Please keep it down.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.876
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, thanks.

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:29.530
DONNIE (OFFSCREEN): I'm doing
the next few tutorials from

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.880
work until my advisers can tell
me when I can get back

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.410
into my house.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.300
So let's start talking-- let's
start talking about vacation.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.540
So what I did is I wanted to
envision what the perfect

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.620
vacation might be.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.240
So let's just say-- and I
emailed some images to myself.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:57.720
So let's just say that you
recently came into about $760.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.129
And you accidentally Pricelined
a three connection

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.840
flight to a discount
beach in Mexico.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.000
But that's OK, because the hotel
that you're staying in

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.530
is having--

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.110
hosting half dollar nipple
night all week long.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.410
And also you have a friend who
thinks he has a friend who

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.456
knows a waitress there.

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:25.120
So--

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.760
so this is what you're going to
be doing on your vacation.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.590
And let's say you're coming
back from a--

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.180
the--

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.920
a night at all you can drink
Colombian bun runners, and you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.960
grabbed a bag of sopapillas,
and your heading

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.070
back to your hotel.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.270
Except your-- you can't get
the key to your roo--

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.230
your community room
until ocho.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.840
So you need to take a-- you need
to crash on the beach.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.410
But look at the beach.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.820
It's really awesome.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.870
But there's no.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.740
What if we had a hammock here?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.880
So let's go--

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.940
I sent myself a hammock image
that I found on the web.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.380
And we'll bring this in.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.520
So let's just paste the
hammock in here.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.300
Now, if you look, we've got--

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.630
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): If you
could please keep it down.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.070
DONNIE (OFFSCREEN): We've got a
complex object here that we

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.130
need to knock the
background out.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.130
But it's got a lot of detail.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.650
So what are we gonna do?

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.165
Well--

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:28.440
oh no, you--

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.970
you were reaching for the Magic
Wand tool, weren't you?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.150
Yeah, you know, we need to have
a little talk about that.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.000
I got some calls and some emails
this past week from

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.600
some-- from some moms who were
upset that I had used the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.500
internet to make their sons feel
like they weren't allowed

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.820
to use the Magic Wand tool.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.730
And that they got their
feelings hurt.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.680
And those little guys
just wanted to use

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.920
their Magic Wand tool.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.910
Well, I--

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.400
you know what?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.700
Actually, if you want
to use your Magic

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.480
Wand, that is awesome.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.220
And you could go grab a juice
box and a fruit roll up.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.020
And we'll be back to check
you out in six hours.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.930
In the meantime, I'm going to
switch these two layers off in

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.910
the background.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.750
And I'm going to go up to
Select, Color Range.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.810
I'm going to eyedrop off of
the white background.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.520
And I'm going to get the
fuzziness up pretty high,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.510
around 190, Set, OK.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.320
Select Inverse, Cut, delete
all of that garbage.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.980
And now look what we've done.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.110
Oh, we've got the hammock
right there.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.160
And we didn't use the
Magic Wand tool.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.670
Oh, little buddy, you--

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.590
just a couple of clicks
and it was done.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.945
[BEEP]

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.616
MALE SPEAKER 2 (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, I'm going to

00:03:38.616 --> 00:03:40.000
tell him right now.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.280

qualitative analysis,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.090
whatever the hell it is.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.782
I need you to go on that.

00:04:01.782 --> 00:04:05.350
Now I know you have your--

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.740

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.510
whatever you had planned.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.060
But, uh, well, I need
you to cancel that.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.240
And I need to you
book a flight.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.260
You and I are going
to Bulletsville.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.184
We're going to leave

00:04:17.184 --> 00:04:18.980
And we're going to take a--

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.948
