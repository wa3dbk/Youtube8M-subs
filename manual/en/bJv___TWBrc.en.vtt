00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.929
I feel like taking my pack off for awhile.
Would you like to see what's inside it? I'll

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:23.070
show you. First of all, this pack is a little
bigger than the average day pack. Call this

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:37.030
a day and a half pack.
And, of course, one of the main things in

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.390
the pack is my water. And like I say, I like
a hydration bladder. Sometimes I also carry

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.969
water bottles. Because when you stop to eat
lunch, it's kind of nice to have the, be able

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.409
to take a water bottle out. I have another
layer with me. This is my fleece. If it were

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:05.830
colder weather, I'd have even a little more.
And this is my first aid kit. I like to put

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.380
a first aid kit in a series of ziplocs. Because
you can see through them, you can organize

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.890
them a little bit, and this is something people
sometimes forget to put in a first aid kit.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.290
And that's an empty ziploc. Because if you
do put a band aid on somebody, it's, you got

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.340
to have a place to put the garbage. Oh, this
one has a few little medicinal things, like

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.040
ibuprofon. I have a little sugar in here in
case of a blood sugar problem. This one is

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.670
my, this one I use a lot. This is for feet.
So I've got moleskin, scissors, tweezers,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.159
that sort of things. So that's if you get
a cactus spine, or you have blisters, that's

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.030
the bag I pull for that. This is my basic
band aid bag.
