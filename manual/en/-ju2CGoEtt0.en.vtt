00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.919
Zumo 590 - readability in sunlight

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:21.039
Very often I stress the core of the matter

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.499
in motorcycle navigation. There may be so many option in such a device

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.939
... the core of the matter is navigation. And to be able to navigate

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.239
you need to be able to read the screen properly

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.070
so that readability of the screen is just very important and furthermore ...

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.649
... Since on the motorcycle we simply prefer to ride with beautiful weather and ..

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.319
we are completely open with sun from all sides on the device ..

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.359
makes that readability in sunlight ..

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.150
of fundamental importance for proper motorcycle navigation

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.650
... That's the big difference with a smartphone because ...

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.830
the smartphone can not be read in bright sunlight. Readability with

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.359
The zumo 660, 350 and 550

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.720
as well as with the tomtom Rider

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.480
is quite ok but we also saw gradually that it could be better.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.430
if you look at for example the Garmin Montana ..

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.890
which reflects a bit more but nevertheless really better readability

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.160
I once made a video while riding ..

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.850
which is quite difficult...

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.860
especially if you want to compare. four units together So I.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.649
had to improvise a bit

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.849
Moreover, I emphasize that this is for the spring-sun, and that is

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.619
different from the summer sun. And completely different from the

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.730
summer sun in Spain ...

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.760
Let alone the low autumn sun. For that we need

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.160
some patience..

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.260
But good. With those caveats I have the devices placed next to each other ..

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.710
to compare in practise. Let's go see what that ...

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.390
is the result of that.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.159
look here they are in a row. And in particular I would like to show

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.250
... Where the sun now stands. That is, as it were, obliquely from above

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.020
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.760
from this position

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.490
looking at the screens ... here the 350, the 660, the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.580
590 and the TomTom Rider ... you will see that they are actually all quite ok

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.660
the readability is similar

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.620
However, when I virtually watch from the bike-sadle

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.130
it is very different and you really see that only the 590 is easy to read

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.209
 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.180
Of course that's not what you normally would do

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.139
and also the view-angles influences general readability

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.819
but take it from me: in this case it's really about the direction of the

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.199
sunshine

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:29.139
and then you really see a difference

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.109
Look ... the 590 remains well intact ..

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.309
Now again right from the top, you will see that even the 350, left,

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:37.779
is a bit better than the rest ...

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:43.599
but actually they are all pretty good to read

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.549
we go back to a look from this angle

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.719
yes, things change dramatically and you see that only 590

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.899
remains. At TomTom we see nothing on the 660 yet very little

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:57.349
at 350, although a bit but not much while here we are just fine

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.979
to navigate

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:59.940
but ... once more..

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.370
that's not the way you normally drive on the bike .... Then you do not put your head ..

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.910
on the saddle. This is more a real life setting. The unit upright and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.610
in this case the sunlight from behind. And then you see that 590 is doing just fine

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.600
but the 350 performs at least as good and maybe even better ..

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.400
brighter ..

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.230
and a somewhat richer contrast.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.909
Both.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.279
are in themselves ok. And even compare to the TomTom Rider... well

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.779
it even seems that that rider is a little easier to read

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.590
It alos seems to have less glare but that might be influenced

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.069
by my own location

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.699
fact is ... both are just easy to read

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.079
But that is quite different if we pick up our bike and

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.499
and turn it so that the sunlight comes from behind the driver. Look...

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:46.999
On the right the Zumo 660 and you will see at once a huge ..

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:51.389
difference. The sunlight now comes from behind,

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:57.179
slant from above. And then you see that 590 is immensely better readable

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:58.919
compared to the 660

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.159
these are really differences

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.540
that matter in practice. This is with the 660. Are we going to

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.740
compared to the younger

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.690
Zumo 350, and we put it next to it you will see that although 350

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.180
is slightly easier to read than the 660. The contrast, the green you now

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.389
can see the map...

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.159
but if you compare

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.219
the bright background of the 590

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.879
really stands out

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.110
and performs much better

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.240
the essence of the matter lies in the 590 being far better in dealing with

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.110
the transflection of the screen. In other words, that the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.499
the sunlight is used for lighting.

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:42.000
Here I even turned off the backlight of the 590

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.290
and still I can read the screen properly. But then

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.360
the sun really must shine in. Look, if I go to the ...

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.650
unit-settings

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.650
then you will see if you really pay attention ... when I touch here on the screen

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.530
the brightness is set to zerop percent. When I tap on it, I can take him back to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.289
100% using the slider. Thenit is a bit brighter but in this position the difference

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.920
is not all that huge..

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.970
let's bring back the sunlight..

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.300
and we are back to what we saw before

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.419
Finally we

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.990
compare the device with the major competitor, the tomtom rider

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.430
with wide screen

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.250
very obvious ... And also notice that this solars cover on the Rider

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.509
Is total nonsens. That is not at all

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.050
the sun-angle that causes problems. I really need to be straight

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.430
in pront of the screen to be able to see anything at all...

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.850
but it's very clear..

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.850
the 590 performs much much better here

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.250
Anyway, as said, readability in sunlight is simply ...

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.090
extremely important for motorcycle navigation

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.840
and that aspect is significantly better with the 590 than all competitors

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.020
in the market. And it is indeed the most expensive unit

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.340
it costs 200 euros more than, say, the zumo 390

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.730
but this aspect alone, regardless of all other things, for me personally

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.050
is absolute reason to opt for that 590

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.610
Thanks for your attention!
