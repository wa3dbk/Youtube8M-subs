00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
And so it came to pass that I had to say more goodbyes. On the penultimate night of Vassar college senior week

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.589
we burnt things. Together at midnight old essays went on the fire

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.599
drafts of theses, emails to professors and strangely a sofa.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.760
Fire is transfixing

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.180
and we are obsessed with it. The Japanese myths of the Kojiki paint fire as destructive, it kills as an army.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.020
In the texts of the Rigveda fire is sacrificial, young and immortal.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.099
The word itself

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.148
bonfire comes from banefire, a medieval term for the burning of the bones of slaughtered animals. The Gaelics

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.369
associated burning with cleansing and I think to a very large extent that's what we were all trying to do that night

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.079
To have some kind of physical representation of the ridding of self from anxiety

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.889
And the stress that can kind of consume you at the end of the year

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.029
In every conversation I had that night someone would mention the rapture that had supposedly happened earlier that week

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.569
Somewhere in the back of my mind I couldn't help but think that this very pagan, human and earthly act of the bonfire

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.900
Wasn't in some way hell on earth. The floor was literally on fire. We are so intent on destroying things

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.029
We are so obsessed with it

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.109
No matter what it does to the air around us, no matter what it does to the air we breathe

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.360
We just get into these states of mind sometimes where it's like we just want to destroy everything, we just want it to end

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.229
We just want it to turn into ash

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.499
Time and time again, we just aim for this

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.560
really and truly impossible finality

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.040
and without you know wanting to sound too preaching pretentious about it I mean that's what that really showed me how impossible

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.289
that was. Even just looking at the things that we were putting on this fire

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.349
the trees and the paper and the plastic and rubber and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.879
sofas. They're all connected, their materials are connected, they come from the same place, they going to the same place

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.188
and they won't stop there. Not to be the etymology nerd or anything but rapture itself also means

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:50.909
ecstasy

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.008
And I can't help but think there was something really

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.329
Ecstatic about the way in which we went about this. As though for a couple of hours

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.709
we allowed ourselves to entertain the illusion that we were in control of the end of things

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.969
Whereas in reality we were kind of facing the complete opposite.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.738
And that's a lack of control in the end of things whether or not we were looking forward to the next stage, which I think

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.389
everyone was. In attempting to make it so that we have the power to make something cease to exist

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.559
we were in fact reenacting an age-old ritual that night. In that fire the tree burned as a quiet reminder of our debility. We play the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.759
role of the destroyer only to mask our physical instability, our anxiety.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.429
Incidentally by burning to rid ourselves from that anxiety

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.859
I think we actually end up making that anxiety about our physical instability more obvious to everyone
