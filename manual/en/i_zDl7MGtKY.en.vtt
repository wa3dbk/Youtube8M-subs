00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.150
We thought maybe we could dress up like your
sisters for a day, or just mermaids.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.549
Maybe that would make you fee better?

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:10.549

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:12.869
Oh my!

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.639
Are these mermaid tails always this hard to
get off Ariel?

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.500
Oh no I gave them magic mermaid fins?!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Oh no!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.110
Okay guys, I know youre nervous about going
under the sea.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:30.990
But believe me guys it is not scary because
you have your fins and you can just float

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.990
so easily.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.519
So dont even worry youre going to do so amazing.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:42.870
Ok I am a little nervous but, I know that
we can do this.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.039
Yeh I like swimming too.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.530
On three Im gonna have you jump in the water
ok?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.780
Okay! one, two, three!

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:55.979

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:58.979
Okay so now its time to find my father Triton.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:59.979
And when we find him, he will be able to get
rid of your magical fins.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:00.979
Yay! thats wonderful!

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:01.979
So girls I hear theres a situation here.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.870
Youve got some magical tails!

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.510
Which little troublemaker caused that?

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.230
Hmm let me think....

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.800

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.820
Can you do it please?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.820
Yes Mr Triton please.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.850
As much as fun as we have had swimming, and
just admiring these beautiful tails, we have

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.850
a lot to do.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.850

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.580
I have alot of meals Ive cooked, and I need
to freeze them for the summer, so.... please

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.580

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.100
Ok girls hahah I jest..

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.630

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.850
So Ive got some flotsom and jotsom around
here so.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.770
Alright lets see what Ive got here.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.820

Ive got stuff galore in here.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.300
And the final touch, just a little bit of
trident pizazz.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.020
Okay so the very last thing were gonna do
is were gonna let this potion cool here, its

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.159

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.460
You can go wait in the living room if you

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640
Hahaha!

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.030
Ive been waiting for an opportunity to get
that Ariel back for pranking me last year.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.810
Just a little bit of temporary silly potion
should get these girls back.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.040
And prove once and for all that you cant prank
the best pranker.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.872
HAHAHHAHA Alright, its looks like your drinks
are nice and cool now.

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:27.872
As soon as you drink them those tails will
be gone!

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:29.110
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.760
Yes Ariel, its been fun but weve got some
stuff to do.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.950
And you cant really have tails when youre
busy girls.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:45.050
And this juice smells really good I cant wait
to drink it!

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.860
Smells delicious!

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.860
Yay!

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.980

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.980
Thank you!

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.200
All back to normal, yay!

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.380
Okay girls hold onto my tail and Ill bring
you up to the surface super super fast!

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.600
Well that sure was an adventure wasnt it?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600
So much fun!

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.670

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.670

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.130
That certainly the most fun I have had in
a really long time.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.890
Time to get ready for that wedding I have
to go to, I mean I dont know what Im going

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.890
to wear.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.720
Um okay, well wait a minute.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.200
What is going on in the ear area of your head?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200
What do you mean?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.120
Wait whats wrong with your ear?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120
My ears?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.400
Oh, Oh oh no!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.870
I bet it is that Ursula trying to get us back
again.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.870
Unbelievable!

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.870
Oh no!

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.750
I guess til next time were gonna have to get
something really good for her.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.750
Shes such a trickster.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.750
We have to call Ariel.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.880
We have things to do, and we dont have time
to make another juice potion.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.250
Guess were gonna have to.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.250
Uh-oh.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.250
I guess this might be my fault again?

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.740
I dont mean to cause trouble, but I do like
pranks, and I do like having fun.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.740
Ill be able to get them sorted out before
their party.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.349
