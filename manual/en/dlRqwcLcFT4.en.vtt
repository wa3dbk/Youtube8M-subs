Today were going to review the Thule Pack
and Pedal Handlebar Bag, part number th100012.

The handlebar bag is designed to attach to
the Thule pack and pedal handlebar mount.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.759
It uses a quick release system so you can
quickly attach the bag and quickly remove

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.669
it.

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.419
On one side of the bag is a storage pocket;
on the other side is a pocket that contains

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.039
the shoulder strap.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.180
The shoulder strap can be pulled out and attached
to the bag and the bag can quickly be carried.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:01:31.819
