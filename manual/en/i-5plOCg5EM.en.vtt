00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.320
Hi everyone, it's Jerry. This is game 8 from
the 2012 FIDE World Chess Championship match,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.759
or what might be better recognized as the
"Shortest Game in World Chess Championship

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:25.570
History". Viswanathan Anand has the white
pieces in this game, and is trailing three

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.200
points to Boris Gelfand's four. Let's have
a look and see how things play out. Anand

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.050
opening up with d4, Gelfand responding knight
f6. After c4 and g6, we saw the same story

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.070
going on in games one and three of this match,
where in game one Anand replied knight c3

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.510
at this point, and in game three we saw f3.
f3 is once again the case only now in this

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.680
game 8. In response to that in the game three
Gelfand played d5, but we're having something

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.109
much different. And that's often denoted by
having a different pawn advance. In this case

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:09.040
we're seeing now c5, striking at this d4 point
immediately, and heading for a Benoni type

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.030
of structure. White responding now d5, gaining
some space...taking away that natural...that

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.900
classical c6 square from that queen knight.
Black playing d6 allowing that bishop to see,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.900
and ruling out any possibilities for a cramping
d6 advance by white. Gaining some space now

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.790
in the center is Anand with e4. More development
on the black side, fianchettoing the bishop.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.950
Knight on g to e2, looking to eventually bring
the king knight over to the c3 square, and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.759
eventually this knight would like to make
use of the d2 square. This is another option

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.570
to reorganize the pieces. It could be a bit
uncomfortable to get this king knight and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.770
king bishop out, seeing how this f3 pawn is
in the way of the knight f3 move. So black

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.090
castles, knight-e to c3, and now this bishop
is ready to come out. And now knight to h5,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.970
looking to open up the position potentially
with f5, or even an e5 advance throwing a

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.610
big question to the white side...do you capture
right away, or do you just allow it to remain

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.610
closed? And then an f5 move is coming up very
soon. And we would have at that point then

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.730
a position very reminiscent to a King's Indian.
But it's not so easy for white to make progress

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.860
on the queenside, and that's what typically
would happen if we're working with the King's

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.850
Indian. Black will be looking to play on the
kingside, and white will be looking on the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.030
queenside. But with this pawn on c5, it's
very difficult to break at. It's very difficult

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.030
to get play, or generate play on the queenside.
So following up we have bishop g5, anticipating

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.800
this e5 advance, placing this pawn in a pin.
There will be no e5. Instead bishop f6 to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.780
neutralize this bishop's influence on the
position. And after the bishops come off,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.610
we have this pawn recapturing...doubled pawns.
But it's only temporary. Soon enough we'll

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.610
see f5, striking at this e4 pawn. Queen to
d2 observes these dark squares...h6. Primarily

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.840
the f4 square move...it rules out any knight
f4 moves right away. And now we're having

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.620
f5. One thing that's worthwhile to note is
if g4 is played and knight to f4, it seems

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.690
very cozy right here. But after queen d2,
the knight is clearly running short on squares.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.140
And so a move like g5 now becomes a necessity.
But keep in mind that this is not the advance

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.230
black wants to get in. It's the f5 advance.
But that's completely ruled out. And because

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.840
f5 cannot be played, this bishop is essentially
biting on a rock. So this not the direction

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.850
black wants to go in. Yes it have a nicely
placed knight on f4, but beyond that it's

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.980
not good. In fact you could view it as this
g5 pawn as just acting as a hook for an eventual

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.430
h4 move. And with the exchange of those pawns,
the h-file is going to open up, and shortly

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.750
thereafter we'll have a case of opposite sides
castling, and this black king being in serious

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.430
trouble. So in other words, not the way to
go. Should the move g4 be played, the knight

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.350
would not do well to play to f4 but rather
basically fianchetto itself, and then look

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.350
for an f5 advance. This is the main idea...try
and get in f5. So we don't g4, instead it's

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.090
just queen to d2. And now with f5 striking
at e4, we have the exchange going on. Bishop

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.090
recaptures, and now g4 coming with a fork
which is, ya know, you could get out of that.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.090
Black goes about it by first giving a check.
And we don't have a block. We just have Anand

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.000
now running over to the queenside. And black
now avoiding the loss of material with just

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.760
a pawn takes either one of those minor pieces...first
grabbing that knight on b1, and Anand recaptures.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.760
Now this right here...this check by the rook
is maybe just a misstep right here because

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.740
there is the possibility for first queen check
on h4, and then after the king moves, bishop

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.660
takes, rook takes, and now react with let's
say a knight g7 move. And this queen is very

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.370
well placed to prevent any h4, h5 stuff, and
the opening up of the h-file. So that was

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.810
definitely a possibility for black at this
point right here. But instead what we do have

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.400
is the immediate rook check in response to
g4. King to d1, bishop takes knight, rook

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.400
takes bishop, and now a miscalculation by
black. Queen to f6 simply did not see far

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.500
enough. It is threatening queen takes pawn
with a fork right here, but white allows it.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.450
Pawn takes knight, queen takes pawn...we have
a fork. After king c2, queen takes rook...black

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:05.450
is up material. But after the key move queen
to f2, black resigns in just seventeen moves.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.389
The queen is very close to just being dead
after a bishop move she's clearly running

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:19.389
out of squares. We have e4, f3...all of these
squares that I'm highlighting right here are

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.880
all covered. And as soon as this bishop moves,
all of these squares are going to be covered,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.740
and the queen is dead. If there's any type
of resistance in this position, it's to sacrifice

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.180
this knight on b8. There is the possibility
for knight c6. And if you move the bishop

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.620
right away...well there's going to be a knight
check followed by, let's say, a queen to f3

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:46.620
and the queen is rescued. But what would occur
if knight c6 were even played...it basically

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:53.920
just came down to after queen f2, black ends
up resigning right here. And it's basically

00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:01.310
a position to resign no matter what because
after pawn takes knight, there's queen takes

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:08.310
pawn, and this knight right here...let's just
say a rook move to the e5 square. A knight

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:14.220
right here is well worth a rook. It's invaluable.
A knight generally worth three points right

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.990
here, but by not being able to be dislodged
from d5...again it's invaluable. Very very

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:26.050
powerful piece on that hole in the black position
on d5. This a hopeless position regardless

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:32.180
of knight c6 being played at this moment right
here. But as it stands in this game, after

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.100
just seventeen moves Gelfand is forced into
resignation, and this match at this point

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:44.100
right here is now locked at four points each.
And we will see what happens in game 9. So

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.270
that's all for this video. As always, I hope
you got something out of it. Take care, bye.
