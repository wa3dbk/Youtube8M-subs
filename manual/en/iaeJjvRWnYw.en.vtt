00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.990
- The Gameboy library is loaded with

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
titles that are easy to dismiss as

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.920
downgrades from their console counterparts.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.870
At a glance it's tough to tell the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.030
difference between a totally skippable

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.060
port versus a full-fledged portable

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.980
entry that can stand on its own

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.180
alongside bigger siblings.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.869
^ But it's thanks to games like these that the

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.990
^ Game Boy has made a bit of a comeback

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.289
^ for me lately.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.019
Games I've ignored but have

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.270
finally started getting around to giving

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.099
a fair shot.

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.989
So I recently decided to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.120
play through the real third game in the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.174
Contra series, initiate Operation C.

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:52.120
(Intro music)

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.959
When it comes to running and gunning and

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.150
blowing up aliens Contra is simply the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.680
best in the business.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.470
For my money Contra has got to be the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.340
most fun 2D shooter series out there.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.100
^ The first two games Contra, and Super Contra,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.820
^ were adapted to the NES from the arcade,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.070
^ bringing extra levels and more finely

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.729
^ tuned gameplay to the home console.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.229
^ Operation C released for the

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.409
^ GameBoy in 1991 became not only the first

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.350
^ portable Contra but also the first

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.110
Contra to be originally designed for

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.100
consumer system.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.090
One of the things that I enjoy most

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.400
about the Contra series is the sense

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.650
that I've really gotten to know the game

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.720
through the course of multiple attempts

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.540
at finishing it.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.540
Honestly I think it's

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.850
kind of ridiculous that the original

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.670
Contra appears on so many most difficult

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.750
game of all time lists.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410
In the grand scheme of things

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.130
even among NES games it's really not one

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.110
of the most difficult games out there,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.150
and I'm not even particularly good at them,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.140
but yes Contra games are hard and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.500
Operation C is no different.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.560
You're going to start

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.830
from the beginning a lot of times.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.519
At a glance it's clear that

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.990
Operation C takes

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.220
after the NES games

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.550
more so than the arcade style,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.430
definitely for the best if you ask me.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.989
The most obvious difference is that your

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.650
horizontal movement speed of running

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.560
if you will is a bit slower than the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.760
NES games but you'll get used to it

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.830
Aside from that this really feels like a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.700
proper Contra experience,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.939
lots of enemies, bullets flying everywhere,

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.260
uncompromised action gameplay,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.300
on the Gameboy it's impressive really.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.470
Operation C introduced a few cool things

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.890
that the series took with it into the future.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.360
Machine gun is the default weapon?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.800
Nice!

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.630
The homing missiles that you've

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.000
probably used more than you should have

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.640
in Contra 3 appeared first

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.000
right here on the Gameboy,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.600
and it works way better than

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.910
I would have guessed.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.190
Probably the best weapon in the game.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.200
The signature weapon of the series,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.390
the famous spread shot,

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.160
can actually be upgraded

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.510
by picking up a second S icon.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.480
The spread is way wider with more

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.210
bullets but for whatever reason this

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.490
upgrade mechanic only applies to the

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.180
spread shot.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.430
Still this most likely

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.380
served as the inspiration for the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.690
two-tiered upgrade mechanic that applies

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.020
to every weapon in Contra 4.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.483
The best game in the series by the way.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.350
These, plus the fire weapon,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.410
the good type with a big explosion,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.680
not the stupid slow spinny fire thing,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.260
are the only weapons in the game.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
A small assortment but the nice

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.238
thing is that you really can't go wrong

00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:21.770
with any of them.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.710
Operation C seems to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.170
have provided inspiration for Contra 4

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.720
and a few other areas like the little

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.580
scene at the start of each level and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.500
Contra Force Harbor definitely seems to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.130
resemble Operation C's first level,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.310
especially with the submarine boss.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.950
Up to this point

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.810
the game has been pretty easy

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.130
so far.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.660
If there's one mark against the

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.970
Contra series it's that most of the

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.460
games are intent on offering some sort

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.460
of alternate gameplay style that while

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.760
passable is simply never as awesome as

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.150
the side-scrolling stuff.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.420
While Operation C borrows from Super C ,

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.760
it uses its overhead commando style gameplay

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.700
for levels 2 &amp; 4.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.420
I'd have just preferred two

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.090
extra traditional levels instead

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.940
but these are fine and work well enough.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.620
It's easy to see how you could mistake

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.139
Operation C as a rehash of the other

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.430
games in the series.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.340
I mean level 3 is pretty much just a

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.530
mash-up of the first two games third levels.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.740
and the music while it has its

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.530
own twists is for all intents and

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.608
purposes just recycled for the Gameboy.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.900
Where things started getting really tough

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.510
for me was the end of level 3.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.730
This stupid little jump should not be this hard.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.670
I never did manage to hang on to any

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.300
of the good weapons through level 5,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.440
the final level,

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.690
but once I figured out that

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.140
you don't have to worry about platforms

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.820
squishing you on this elevator,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.050
things weren't quite so bad anymore.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.330
Despite mostly unoriginal themes and

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.120
heavy recycling Operation C's level

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.120
design is all its own and will challenge

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.490
Contra fans that are just looking for

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.310
another run-and-gun to master.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.820
The boss designs are

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.770
also completely new

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.230
and I thought were pretty good.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.300
So sure it's

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.850
not the most original Contra game and

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.130
it's few innovations since became

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.520
standard for the series but for me the

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.800
most fun part of the Contra game is

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.690
feeling like you're really getting to

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.700
know the game over the course of

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.910
multiple attempts.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.910
The famous extra lives

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.240
codes just don't do them justice.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.570
You gotta learn to

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.680
pick yourself back up

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.930
after getting beat down and give it

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.590
another go.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.260
It starts off so hard but as

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.990
you learn the game and finally beat it

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.330
you feel like you could totally do it

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.700
again and that's what makes a great

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.950
Contra game and even though

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.746
it's a bit shorter,

00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:24.621
Operation C delivers.

00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:31.651
