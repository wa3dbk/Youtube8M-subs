00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
I think the basic gist of the world is like women did guys are pigs and guys think women are crazy

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.300
And I don't I think we gotta start supporting both sides a little better

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.779
We're just accepting our nature's like wait like women get really mad that we like will do that. Look at someone's ass

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040
So, did you just look at her ass?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.820
They fucking know, you're lying. Like they know.  Ever try lying about that?  It's like "no was looking at; there's a quarter on the ground"  Its like "Where's the fucking quarter Owen?"

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.440
It's like "someone must've picked it up".

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.920
And then the worst is when they ask you the hypothetical  "Would you have sex with that girl?"

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.140
"Like theoretically?, Yeah... Obviously"

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.039
It's a fact. I'm not saying you would it's like would use like no, we made a promise and all that shit

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.539
But like theoretically do I want to of course and of course I do

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.149
Of course I do

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.569
You don't, you shouldn't rub that into them, but if they're gonna ask be fucking honest

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.709
There's the quickest way to happiness is at one point just say yeah, I looked at her ass I looked away

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.119
But it's in our DNA. We think we're gonna die at 20. We're cavemen

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.529
We don't know this world right, so we're full of jizz, we see something

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.739
we stare and then chicks get fucking mad at you and by the way

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.320
They're just as piggish as we are it's just for a smaller demo

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.720
It's like Ryan gosling. It's like they have a scope on their rifle

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.020
They like like 5% of the population guys just have an uzi

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.760
fucking take out Best Buy

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.229
Because it's like these it's like okay for them to have celebrity crush. It's like oh my God Justin timberlake's coming

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.639
He's so hot let's go, and then the dude has to buy the ticket and take them

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.200
That's like he's so hot. It's like. I know you fucking say it all the time

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.339
And then it's like, but I'm the asshole because my crush is the girl at Best buy.  The fuck is the difference?

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.269
But women don't want to fuck strangers like you do it's just a fact

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.140
They really don't I mean they're not just like constantly looking at dudes dicks and asses. It's just not the same thing and uh

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.220
So I wrote a song to try and help women understand what we feel

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.789
Because it's not as threatening as you think it is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.940
But wait if a woman is constantly looking at dudes dicks. There's a problem the relationship. That's why they feel so threatened by this

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.569
Right, but I think I cracked the code of what it is, so this is a little explanation

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.930
Hey Ladies

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.329
You know in that feeling?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.310
when you see a bag at the mall

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.349
and you like it

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.710
Even though you already have one

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.419
You're literally holding one in your hand

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.049
It does the same thing

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.299
As your current bag it holds your keys your cell phone and your other shit

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.540
But that one caught your eye

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.980
And you also have like ten at home

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.400
You know that feeling when you're at this shoe store, and you're like. I really

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.240
like those shoes

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.440
And I'm like you're fucking wearing the same shoes

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.420
What's wrong with those shoes are wearing? That's how we feel about

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360
pussy

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.680
Let's go to shopping spree together that one and that one oh my God its the new Louis Vuitton

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.920
That's really it. Thank you
