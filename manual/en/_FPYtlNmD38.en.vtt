00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.389
It's the new standard in modern luxury.

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.210
The 2014 BYU Supermileage Vehicle

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.350
with comfort, speed and

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.530
elegance all in one sleek package.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.680
This is not a vehicle designed
for luxury.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.070
it is actually quite uncomfortable,
pretty warm,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.990
absolutely zero air conditioning.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.070
The sun's beating down on you and you're just gonna sweat.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.320
What's luxurious about
this car, huh?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.180
It's not built for comfort, for
luxury.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.610
Oh yeah, you're reclined!

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.050
With fully reclined seating, nothing

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.370
brings you closer the open road.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.350
You get to layout!

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.680
Yeah, I think the driver has the hardest job.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.840
He puts his head down, and looks down through his feet at the vehicle.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.720
For true comfort, settle in

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.930
the handcrafted carbon fiber interior.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.140
The interior is scratchy--lots of
little slivers.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.680
Duct tape trim interior.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.680
There is
definitely not a cup holder, I don't

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.420
know if there's room for any cup holders. Although we do have a fire

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.260
extinguisher

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.460
I mean serious luxury.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.090
"Alright let's go!"

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.360
It's built not to be faster or to be cool,
but it's built for one purpose:

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.660
to get a lot of miles per gallon.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.420
We competed at the Shell Eco Marathon in Texas
and we set a record at 1700 miles per gallon.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
So one of our strategies is to go slow.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.210
We go about an average of fifteen miles per hour.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.110
We're not exactly going for speed but

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.430
we do get high gas mileage. The way that
we achieve this high gas mileage is a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.200
little method we call the Burn N' Coast
Method. We burn for about two or three

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.920
seconds

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.720
get up to a speed and then we coast for
another two minutes.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.820
The way we were able to get to
1700 miles per gallon

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.820
was by making the car lightweight, by
reducing the coefficient of friction on

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.439
the vehicle

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.819
and the wheels and bearings and also
the aerodynamic drag

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.940
and lastly engine efficiency. This
vehicle was built from the ground up by

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.440
a group of nine engineering students.
Each person contributed to certain

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.830
subsystems of the vehicle.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.330
There are people who were in charge of
the body of the vehicle and others were in charge of

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.430
the engine.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.720
The reason it looks the way it does is
because

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.920
a blunt front and a pointed back a more
aerodynamic than a pointed front

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.760
and a blunt back. You might not see this
shape out on the road anytime soon,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.190
but the ideas and the principles behind it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.650
are definitely being incorporated into the
industry. Automobiles everywhere are

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.940
incorporating all sorts a streamlines
that allow them

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.250
to be more aerodynamic. We're learning
things that are being applied to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.580
industry right now.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.540
The 2014 BYU Supermileage Vehicle

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.120
from Happy Valley the Motor City on

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720
just one gallon of petrol.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.020
Hold on, I think we have a problem...It says a 'gallon' that doesn't sound right.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.020
what is that in liters?
