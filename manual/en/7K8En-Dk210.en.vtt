Hi everyone! Let me present you a very unique yet simple design! Just pick two colors of your choice and let's get started!

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:38.510
First of all, start with your base coat.
Then, appy a solid white on your nails.
One it's dry, apply on half of the nail your second color. Make sure the chosen colors are opaque!

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.370
Make big blue dots on the edge of the white and blue colors.
Make them verticaly.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.500
 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.200
Be carefull, the blue dots must be connected to the blue line!

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.740
Then, make smaller blue dots on the white side.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.740
Now you just have to repeat the same technique to the other side of the nail with the white color.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.560
Make big white dots on the blue color. These dots must be connected to the white part!

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.450
Because we are dotting a lot, the polish must be opaque!

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.300
Then, make little white dots on the blue part.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.300
As usual, finish your design by appliying
your top coat.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.560
Here's what I used to realise this design!

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.090
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.000
You can recreate this nail art with the colors of your choice.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.590
This design is easy to make when you know the technique!

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.590
I promise that everybody is going to stare at your beautiful nails!

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.119
I have done my best to help you with this design! Hope this helped!

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.730
See you soon!
