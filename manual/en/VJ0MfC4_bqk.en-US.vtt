Hello, my name is Andrew Jones 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.800
and I am director of loudspeakers engineering for both TAD laboratories and Pioneer electronics

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.366
I've been involved in loudspeaker development from both research and the development side of it for almost 35 years. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.733
It started out as a passion for Hi-fi and in particular loudspeakers

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:35.566
in my early teens and I made it my whole life career

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:39.932
My philosophy of what I'm trying to achieve in loudspeaker development

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:46.766
is the idea of bringing to you the original artistic intention of the musicians and recording engineers

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:54.566
this is more than just the original performance because not all performances exist in the form we can listen to

00:00:54.566 --> 00:01:00.799
but the intention of those engineers who capture whatever performance is going on, that's what I want you to hear

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.499
For the second generation of this award winning loudspeaker range

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:11.533
there is a number of improvements I've made primarily to the drive units themselves these the  the heart of the system

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:15.499
for the bass driver in the bookshelf and also in the center channel

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.166
I have a new cone that is a structured surface cone material

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.866
with an embossed pattern into the cone to give it better rigidity to the low frecuencies

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.666
but slowed out the breakup modes of high frecuencies

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:31.666
this allows us to more easily transition to the tweeter

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:38.566
combined with a harder dust cap to control the resonances of the higher frecuencies

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:42.632
now looking at the rear of the driver, you can see we've vented the pole piece

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:46.299
this allows us to relieve the pressure built up behind the dust cap

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:49.333
and give it more dynamic bass performance

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:54.299
we've also lowered the resonant frequency of the driver

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.300
so again getting much more extended bass performance out  of this driver

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:03.432
For the tweeter again many changes 

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.366
new dest dome material  

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:11.132
new waveguide shape to get better off-axis performance and matching to the midrange

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.000
and a much larger magnet, this gives it greatly improved sensitivity of the tweeter

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so it don't get as much thermal compression at high volumes

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:26.666
so all of this changes mean we get more dynamic performance  from this speaker system

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:30.366
We combined that again with a six element crossover network 

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:32.899
we have a film capacitor for the tweeter

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.400
we have an air core inductor on the tweeter

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.466
and for the bass driver we have a laminated steel coil inductor

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:43.566
this allows us to get high sound levels without any  

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:47.099
ill effects from bad inductor 

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.799
Overall, the speaker system have

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.400
more extended dynamic bass

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.366
smoother midrange performance

00:02:54.366 --> 00:03:00.432
and overall increase in both efficiency and easy of drive

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:09.199
so even with entry level receivers we get a very well matched system and a very well performing system

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:16.333
What I wanted to create with this line of speakers was not only bringing you the original artistic contention of the performances

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:19.832
but also the fun factor in listening to music 

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:24.333
we want to listen to music we want to enjoy our music

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:28.199
and we want to be surprised by what is in that music

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.466
and I believe that this line of speakers allow you entry into that

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:35.066
the fun of what is in that music

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:41.632
to listen more and more and fully be involved and enjoying the musical experience
