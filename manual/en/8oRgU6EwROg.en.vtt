Merrick your number one to re-create this
gorgeous static E or you're going to start

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.960
by taking a dotting tool or a bobby pin and
creating large dots at the tip of your nail

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.759
and gradually get it smaller in size as you
move towards the cuticle you're going to repeat

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.070
step one with as many colors you as you would
like I used red white and blue but you can

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.250
use red white and blue silver red Red white
and blue gold whatever you would like you're

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.600
going to wait five minutes and allow the dots
to dry before you add a taco here's what the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.420
finish manicure looks like if you guys watch
Snapchat I just saw that it kind of goes with

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.049
the billboard music awards what totally did
that on purpose if you love this manicure

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.319

a picture on Instagram and use the #LNG nail

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.319

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.639
Moving on to Munich your number to a manicure
number two to re-create this patriotic McDonagh

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:04.259
care start my painting your nails any color
you would like now on the white males or bobby

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.739
pin and create three large that's a long one
side of the nail next year going to take a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.670
smaller dotting tool and create four medium
size dots between the larger dots that you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.599
created before.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.880
Now taking a toothpick you're going to fill
in the remaining see area you're going to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.269
take it and fill it in with some small.wait
five minutes so your dots do not smear applier

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.810
favorite quick drying taco and here's what
the finished manicure looks like I Think this

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.860
manicure is so classy and I really think it
gives that extra pot even though it's not

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.969
drawling a bunch of attention to your nails
it's just such a classy manicure it's one

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:56.090
of my favorites and I think I weren't last
year for Fourth of July and I got so many

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.909
compliments and people just love it

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.940
Manicure number three to create this firework
dry marble patriotic manicured you're going

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.110
to start by painting your nails two coats
of any color you would.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.069
Now except for my accent finger I'm going
to add a glitter polish on the accent finger

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:25.209
to create the dry marble placed a couple dots
of the polish on your nails and you may want

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.290
to practice because different ways of applying
the polish can give you different turn out

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:42.819
and if you want more polish or less polish
you have to play around and see what works

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:50.300
best you're going to take a nail brush and
spread the design any way you would like and

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.630
just remember to move quickly because the
polish is drying as you're working with it

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.659
once the nail art has dried completely make
sure to add your quick drying taco and here's

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:09.510
what the manicure looks like I love this manicure
it reminds me of fireworks and also that playful

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.950
