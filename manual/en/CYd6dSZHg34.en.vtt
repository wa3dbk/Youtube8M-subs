Today on Drinks with Dîablø we're making 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the Watermelon Margarita.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
TheFNDC.com presents Drinks With Diablo

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The Watermelon Margarita Recipe

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Alright, welcome back to Drinks with Dîablø. This is your host Jöhnny Dîablø.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And we are continuing Margarita week with the Watermelon Margarita.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And here's what you’re going to need.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I already have a glass rimmed with Margarita salt .

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You’re going to need about 3 and a half cups watermelon,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
some Grand Marnier, some fresh limes,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a little bit of sugar, tequila of course

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and here's your blender. There's just a little

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
tiny bit of ice, so maybe like a half of a cup.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You might not even need that much.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Okay so, let’s get started.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Lets go ahead and add - and this is going to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
make probably about three,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
maybe like four of these.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So if you want to cut back the recipe,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
just cut it back but

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
if you’re making Margaritas, you’re probably going to have friends over.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So, 3 ½ cups watermelon.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Okay, we’re going to add four ounces of our tequila.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay, two ounces of Grand Marnier.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You can use triple sec but

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
this is just how we roll here.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Just use quality whenever possible.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
OK, then you’re going to want to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
put the juice from half of a lime in there.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So let’s squeeze this out.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
[ fresh lime juice &gt; bottled lime juice ]

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Then we add two teaspoons of sugar.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And this is just – I’m just using super fine sugar

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[ tongue-tied for a moment ]

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This is what I use to make simple syrup with.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So then we just blend her up.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Let’s try.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Here?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
&gt;&gt; Inferno: Yeah.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: Okay, so this is all blended up

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and let’s – as I said, this is going to make

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
probably like 2 or 3, maybe 3 or 4.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This looks like a lot.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But it’s OK. That’s OK.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That’s what friends are for, right?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So we’ve got that, and guess what?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Ms. Amy Inferno

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
has done me up a nice little skewer

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of watermelon, kiwi, and lime. Like that.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So let’s try this bad boy and see.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Hmm, this is pretty good.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The salt is the first thing that hits me,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but you can use sugar if you want [ to rim the glass ].

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It’s very watermelon-y,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the tequila –

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Let me try that again. Hold on.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The tequila is kind of subdued, but then

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
it comes in, like in the aftertaste.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Overall, it’s pretty good.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I think the Grand Marnier adds an extra little kick.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
There’s just a little tiny hint of lime.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But this is an exceptional Margarita.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
This WILL get you tanked.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Perfect for Cinco de Mayo or summer.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
