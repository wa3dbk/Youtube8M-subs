My name is Grace Helbig, or
Daily Grace, as I'm known on

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.570
the internet.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.295
I have a five day a week vlog
web series called "Daily

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:08.900
Grace." It's all comedy based.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.910
I write it myself, shoot it
myself, edit it myself, and

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.870
upload it myself.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.350

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.130
I'm continuing to do "Daily
Grace." I'm auditioning for

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.040
pilot season right now, which
is a great, wonderful

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.160
experience.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.840
I'm writing a couple pilots
with a friend that we're

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.545
trying to make traction with,
and working on a live ladies

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:32.530
of YouTube comedy tour
that we hope to

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.180
take around the country.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.330
I like interacting with
my fans a lot.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.150
They are the sweetest, nicest,
most wonderfully awkward,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.990
lovable, mostly female,
but males too.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.330
And they've been so great.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.100
A lot of them have come
out to comedy shows.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.050
They've gone to YouTube
conventions of various sorts,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.230
and it's been so wonderful to
meet them, because you make

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.890
these videos and you see
numbers, and numbers don't

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.340
have a face.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.440
And then you see the face that
goes with the number, and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.780
you're like, are you
really watching me?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.200
Because sometimes you forget
that you're doing this for a

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.005
person that's watching on the
other side, like right now.

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:12.320
I don't know who's watching
this, but thanks.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.350
I have met everyone at the table
today, and I have a deep

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.790
seated loathing for all of them
that none of them really

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.460
know, but they will by
the end of this.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.690
I am not really a gamer.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.620
I take a different approach
when it comes to gaming.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.270
My friend Michelle and I tried
to play "Halo" a few times,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.190
and I enjoy the conversation
that there is to be had with

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.160
the angsty, dirty, dirty,
12-year-olds.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.870
There's a story in my family
that is legendary.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.830
We as a family, the same
brothers that I made laugh, we

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.810
used to all play "Risk"
together.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.830
That was our thing we did
on weekends growing up.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.310
So I would be with my dad, my
stepmom, my stepbrother, my

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.480
older brother, my younger
brother, myself all playing

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.100
"Risk." My stepmom always
got out right

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.190
away, which is normal.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.060
She just wanted to have some
ice cream and a margarita.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.950
And my younger brother was kind
of like this little tiny

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.080
dictator, and so my older
brothers and I thought we

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.370
would teach him a lesson, and
we would form an alliance

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.570
against Tim, my younger
brother.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.590
And Tim was probably seven or
eight at the time, and we

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.110
formed an alliance, and
we started only

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.550
attacking his countries.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.290
And he got so livid that he
started sobbing, crying, and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.400
threatened to throw up all over
the board game so that we

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.370
couldn't play.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.620
We were the type of family that
would take photos of the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.380
game board that night, and then
continue playing the next

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.750
morning and make sure that
everything matched the photo,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.540
that he started gagging himself
so he would puke on

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.550
the game board.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.380
And my dad was telling him--

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.650
we have this amazing family
photo that's framed now in our

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.930
house because we turn tragedy
into memories.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.640
It's Tim sobbing, red faced,
trying to puke on the board,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.450
and my dad telling
him to stop.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.860
And I got a sweet, sweet, French
braid in it, so that's

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.050
how you know that the '90s
were a great time.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.330
For me, gaming is like having
two glass eyes.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.100
You don't know where you're
going to end up, but people

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.770
try to help you get there.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.713
