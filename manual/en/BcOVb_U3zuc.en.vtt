00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:02.748
I mean first of all, such a wonderful welcome

00:01:02.748 --> 00:01:05.627
fantastic people, and you know the stop was important

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:10.580
because we have these airplane technologies

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.640
research, products, which have been developed

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.080
in this part of the world, in Gujarat

00:01:16.848 --> 00:01:19.728
So it made a lot of sense to come to Ahmedabad

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:23.520
and I think it was really worth being here

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.440
It's sad to leave but also very happy to proceed to Varanasi

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:32.611
You have to understand that it's an attempt

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:34.148
to make a historic first

00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:36.494
it has never been done before

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:40.696
So it's difficult, it's challenging, there is a lot of unknown

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:44.086
a lot of unpredictability, so we cannot say in advance

00:01:44.086 --> 00:01:48.566
everything we are going to do, and everyday we are going to takeoff

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:50.557
It's an adventure

00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:52.302
and it's not easy

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:44.396
Ok so Solar Impulse everything is ready for you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.350
you are released to proceed and have a nice flight

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.940
Welcome to Varanasi

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.818
Thank you very much but I have to say something that

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.360
all the people I talk to on the way here today,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.800
all the ATC Controllers, the towers, they were exceptional, they were fantastic

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.700
Thank you very much for your warm welcome
