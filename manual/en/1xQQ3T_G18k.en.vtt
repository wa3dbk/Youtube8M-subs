00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.700
The last exercise I'm going to show you for
the lower back is the back extension or the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.900
'superman'. You can do this on the floor.
What I'm going to have you do is you're going

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.220
to lie on your stomach. There's a couple different
ways to do this, beginner and advanced version.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.210
I'm going to show you the beginner version
first, which I recommend you start with. What

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.291
I'm going to have you do is start with your
hands at your sides. From here, all that you're

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:37.150
going to be doing is lifting your torso up
off the floor, while looking down at the floor

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:45.330
or just look straight ahead. Then back down.
Be gentle with this movement. You do not want

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.100
to place any excess strain on your lower back.
Once again, more is not necessarily better.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.440
You're going to feel this right here at the
lower back. Lift up, hold for about two seconds,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.580
lower down. It's a very simple, but very effective
exercise for the lower back muscles. Tighten

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:11.859
your glutes too as you come up. Higher is
not better. We all have different ranges of

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:17.450
motions, so just because I can come up this
high does not mean you'll be able to come

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.280
up that high. So please work within your specific
range of motion. It may only be a couple of

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.539
inches and that's okay, you'll still be working
your lower back muscles. You can add your

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.749
feet into this exercise as well to make it
a little bit more advanced. However, if you're

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.780
new or if you already have existing lower
back problems, I do not recommend you add

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.329
the feet. Adding your feet will look a little
bit like this. It's called the 'superman'.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.759
You're bringing your torso off the floor and
your feet off the floor as well, hold and

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.249
lower. This one, by bringing your feet up
off the floor, you'll be working your glutes

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:05.459
a little bit as well. To even make this exercise
more challenging, you can bring your arms

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:15.361
up overhead. But I only recommend this one
if you're an advanced exerciser and if you

00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:26.750
have no lower back problems whatsoever. So,
you have your basic torso lift. You can add

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.250
your feet as well, and then you can bring
your arms up overhead. Great and effective

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.760
exercise for the lower back.
