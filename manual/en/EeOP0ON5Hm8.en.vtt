"ALL PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE MADE
UP OF TINY THINGS CALLED CELLS."

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.029 line:0%
RICK: VERY GOOD.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.432
LUCKY: SHE'S ONLY SEVEN,
BUT DON'T TELL JILL WEAVER

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:35.935
SHE'S TOO YOUNG TO LEARN ABOUT
THE MAKEUP OF LIVING CELLS.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.438
RICK: AND IDENTIFY PROPER
NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.273
USING THE FOOD PYRAMID, OK?

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.707
LUCKY: RICK WEAVER
IS A LITTLE MORE CANDID

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.710
THAN MOST OF US MIGHT BE.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.912
HE ADMITS HE'S LEARNING
AS HIS KIDS LEARN.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:49.982
STUDYING, HE SAYS, WASN'T HIS
PRIORITY WHEN HE WAS IN SCHOOL.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.918
RICK: IS IT THE BLOOD CELL
OR THE NERVE CELL?

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.586
"B." THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.221
I HAD BETTER THINGS
TO DO WITH MY TIME--

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.189
YOU KNOW, KICK
AROUND THE CUL-DE-SAC

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:58.691
OR HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.794
UM, FOR ME, A GRADE
WAS ALWAYS A THREAT.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:03.129
IT WASN'T A GOAL.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:12.338
LUCKY: A FAMILY HIKE IN THE
FOOTHILLS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.640
NEAR THEIR HOME
IN COLORADO SPRINGS

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.976
IS PART OF
THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE,

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.645
PART OF WHAT RICK AND LISA
SAY THEY HOPE THEIR FOUR KIDS

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:24.817
WOULD GET OUT OF K12--THE DESIRE
TO LEARN FOR THE FUN OF IT.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.687
RICK: WE WANTED OUR KIDS
TO ADOPT AN ATTITUDE

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:31.857
TOWARD LEARNING THAT IT'S NOT
SOMETHING THAT ENDS ON MAY 28.

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:35.195
"OK. MAY 28 ROLLS AROUND.
WE GET TO STOP LEARNING NOW."

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.062
WE-- WE NEVER WANTED THAT
FOR OUR KIDS.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:39.465
WE WANTED OUR KIDS TO BE
FASCINATED WITH LIFE

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.867
AND WITH WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND THEM.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.203
LUCKY: LISA WANTED
AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.638
THAT WOULD FIT EACH OF HER KIDS
INDIVIDUALLY

00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:49.075
AND ONE SHE COULD
BE INVOLVED IN.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.977
SHE SAYS MOST OF THE OPTIONS
SHE LOOKED AT

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:54.680
WERE UNINSPIRED AND UNINSPIRING.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.015
LISA: THERE'S A LOT
OF CURRICULUM OUT THERE,

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.651
BUT I WOULD TRY THIS ONE,
AND IT WOULD WORK

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.821
FOR ONE OF THE KIDS,
BUT NOT THE OTHER, AND SO FORTH.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:05.124
LUCKY: BUT LISA IS A DETERMINED
WOMAN NOT TO BE DENIED.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.861
SHE'S SPENT HOURS
IN THE LIBRARY SEARCHING...

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.333
BUT THEN SHE FOUND K12,

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:17.103
OFFERED THROUGH
THE COLORADO VIRTUAL ACADEMY.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.339
IT PROVIDES A FULL
CURRICULUM PREPARED

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.041
BY SOME OF THE BEST MINDS
IN EDUCATION,

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.979
WHO MUST HAVE HAD A BALL
PUTTING IT TOGETHER.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.614
THEY SEEM TO HAVE
GOTTEN IT RIGHT.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:30.516
HERE'S AT LEAST SOME
OF WHAT IT IS.

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:32.018
THE PACKAGE COMES

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.753
WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING
YOU CAN IMAGINE,

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:37.556
INCLUDING A YEAR'S WORTH
OF BOOKS AND SCHOOL SUPPLIES.

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:42.095
I SEE A MICROSCOPE, PAINT,
SCALES, WORKBOOKS,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:45.131
MY FAVORITE--
"HANDWRITING WITHOUT TEARS."

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:48.133
THE K12 PROGRAM
IS AVAILABLE IN MANY STATES

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.403
THROUGH VIRTUAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:53.505
K12 ALSO PROVIDES
A STATE-CERTIFIED TEACHER

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:55.842
WHO'S AVAILABLE BY EMAIL,

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.578
BY PHONE, FACE-TO-FACE.

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:02.916
WE ALSO HAVE,
UH, OUR, UH, EXPERT IN READING

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.950
THAT THE SUPPORTING TEACHER
CAN GO TO IF SHE NEEDS HELP...

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.951
LUCKY: RIGHT.

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:07.720
AND THEN THEY CAN
ALWAYS GO TO K12.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:14.260
WE ARE GOING
TO BE MAKING A CELL.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.762
LUCKY: ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT IMPRESSED ME

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.298
ABOUT THE K12 CURRICULUM
IS THAT KIDS CAN LEARN

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.933
THE BASICS OF GROWN-UP,
COMPLICATED TOPICS

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:23.069
WHEN THEY'RE JILL'S AGE
AND THEN BUILD

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.304
ON THAT KNOWLEDGE
AS THEY GET OLDER.

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:27.606
RICK: JUST POUR IT ALL IN.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.076
JILL: WHOA! THAT...

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.812
LUCKY: FOR INSTANCE, JILL HAS
STARTED LEARNING ABOUT CELLS

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.648
WHILE SHE IS IN THE EQUIVALENT
OF THE SECOND GRADE.

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.583
IN THIS EXPERIMENT,
SHE AND HER DAD

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:40.353
ARE MAKING A CELL
FROM JELL-O AND A BANANA CHUNK.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.087
RICK: NOW, WHAT IS THE BANANA?

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:44.657
JILL: THE PART THAT CONTROLS--
NUCOLUS.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.426
RICK: NUCLEUS.
JILL: YEAH, NUCLEUS.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.760
RICK: OK.
THE CONTROL CENTER, ISN'T IT?

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.827
THAT'S THE BRAIN.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.963
THEY ENTER THESE CONCEPTS
VERY EARLY,

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:53.366
AND-- AND SHE DID
A LESSON ON CELLS.

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:56.035
THEN AUSTIN DID A LESSON
ON CELLS, AS WELL,

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.071
BUT IT WAS MUCH MORE
COMPLICATED--

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.040
THEY DO A GREAT JOB AT KIND OF
STAIR-STEPPING THE CONCEPT--

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.808
AND THEN SCOTT,
OUR SEVENTH GRADER,

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:06.012
IS NOW DOING CELLS
AND GETTING A MICROSCOPE OUT

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:09.348
AND REALLY OBSERVING CELLS,
AND THEY HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE,

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:11.217
SO THEY CAN HAVE
CONVERSATION ABOUT CELLS...

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.584
LUCKY: RIGHT.

00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:16.489
AND THAT MAKES OUR ATMOSPHERE
AT HOME VERY INTERESTING.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.296
SOMETIMES I'LL JUST BE
WALKING BY, AND I'LL JUST THINK,

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.465
"MAN, I REALLY WANT
TO PLAY PIANO."

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:30.603
LUCKY: IT WAS A K12 MUSIC COURSE
THAT GOT AUSTIN STARTED

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:33.939
ON THE PIANO BEFORE HIS PARENTS
HIRED A TEACHER.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.941
NOW AFTER ONLY ONE YEAR,

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:39.345
THE 10-YEAR-OLD
IS COMPOSING HIS OWN MUSIC.

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:45.251
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:47.253
THE-- THE ONE COMMON THING--
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THIS--

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.321
THEY'LL ASK ME
THE SOCIALIZATION QUESTION.

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:50.857
THEY'RE AFRAID
THAT SOMEHOW YOUR CHILDREN

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.591
ARE BEING DEPRIVED SOCIALLY.

00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:53.626
THERE'S SOMETHING RIGHT HERE.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.228
YOU'RE HERE
IN FRONT OF THE DESK.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.929
YOU'RE LEANING ON THE DESK.

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.998
LUCKY: IF THE WEAVER KIDS
HAVE A SOCIAL-LIFE PROBLEM,

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:01.768
THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB
OF CONCEALING IT.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:04.370
THESE KIDS ARE NOT SHY
AND RETIRING.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.140
THEY INTERACT WITH OTHER KIDS
IN LOTS OF WAYS,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.841
INCLUDING THIS
COMMUNITY DRAMA CLUB.

00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:12.478
AUSTIN: JUST REMEMBER,
THIS GUN CAN SHOOT THE TRUCKS.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.213
LUCKY: IF YOU'RE CONFUSED,
THE OTHER KIDS

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.215
ARE ACTING AS STAGE FURNITURE.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:20.119
AUSTIN IS THE CAT BURGLAR AND
HIS BROTHER SCOTT THE VICTIM.

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.421
AUSTIN: STICK THEM UP!
SCOTT: DON'T SHOOT!

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.357
AUSTIN: BE QUIET!

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:27.125
SCOTT: RIGHT. MY BA--
RIGHT. I'M TOTALLY SILENT.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.662
RICK: THEY ASSOCIATE WITH KIDS
HERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.330
UH, THEY HAVE CAMPS THAT THEY
GO TO DURING THE SUMMER.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.633
THEY-- THEY PARTICIPATE
IN ATHLETIC PROGRAMS,

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:36.402
UH, MUSIC PROGRAMS.

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:38.805
SO THEY DO GET A LOT OF EXPOSURE
TO OTHER KIDS.

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:47.446
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE,
YOU HAVE A STATE REPRESENTATIVE,

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:48.714
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:51.050
WHAT DOES THE WORD
"STATE REPRESENTATIVE" MEAN?

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.886
LUCKY: K12 AND THE VIRTUAL
ACADEMY HAVE FIELD DAYS

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.322
LIKE THIS ONE
AT THE COLORADO STATE CAPITOL

00:05:56.322 --> 00:06:00.292
WATCHING THE LEGISLATURE
IN ACTION UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:01.660
RICK: OK. THAT'S RIGHT.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.830
THERE'S THE SENATE AND
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.633
LUCKY: AUSTIN, NEVER ONE
TO DECLINE AN INTERVIEW,

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:11.070
IS QUESTIONED ABOUT
HIS FIELD TRIP BY LOCAL TV.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.607
AUSTIN: I'M HERE TODAY
TO SUPPORT CYBER SCHOOLS,

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:18.277
TO SHOW THE SENATORS
THAT WE'RE ACTUAL PEOPLE.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:20.546
WE'RE NOT JUST--
WE'RE PEOPLE.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.714
LUCKY: WHAT'S GOING ON IN STATE
CAPITOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY

00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:26.385
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE
OF ONLINE EDUCATION.

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.654
MANY STATES HAVE ADOPTED
OR AGREED TO FUND

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:31.924
ONLINE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
TO GIVE PARENTS A CHOICE.

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:34.593
LISA: GOOD JOB. ARE YOU DONE?
GOOD JOB, JILL.

00:06:34.593 --> 00:06:37.797
LUCKY: EVERY DAY IS A LEARNING
DAY FOR THE WEAVERS.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:40.933
WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE KITCHEN
COOKING OR READING A NOVEL,

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.836
THE WHOLE FAMILY
ACTUALLY SEEMS TO ENJOY

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:47.172
THE FUNCTION OF LEARNING
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

00:06:47.172 --> 00:06:48.707
WHAT A CONCEPT.

00:06:48.707 --> 00:06:50.642
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
EUKARYOTIC.

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:53.413
RICK: YOU ONLY GET TO GO
AROUND THE BLOCK ONE TIME,

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.014
AND YOU HAVE A VERY SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.782
IN WHICH TO ACCOMPLISH THAT,

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:59.852
AND I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO
WASTE THE TRIP AROUND THE BLOCK.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.853
I WANT THEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IN THE WORLD.

00:07:01.853 --> 00:07:03.956
LUCKY: THE WEAVERS KNEW
THAT ENROLLING THEIR KIDS

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:06.825
IN THE K12 VIRTUAL ACADEMY
WAS NOT GOING TO BE

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:08.194
A WALK IN THE PARK,

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.229
THAT IT WOULD TAKE
A STRONG COMMITMENT,

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.731
BUT, THEY SAY,
IT'S BEEN WORTH IT.

00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:15.434
RICK: I'M LEARNING THAT
EDUCATION IS A WONDERFUL THING,

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:17.970
UH, THAT IT CAN BE A REAL JOY,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.972
THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE A THREAT.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:22.408
WAS IT NEAT TO WATCH THREE KIDS
LEARN HOW TO WALK?

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:26.245
ABSOLUTELY, BUT WATCHING THEM
LEARN HOW TO READ,

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:29.048
THAT IS AMAZING,
AND IT'S JUST--

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:31.183
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
THEIR LIFE--

00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:33.052
THEIR LIVES OPEN UP.

00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:38.257
LUCKY: IMAGINE GROWING UP
IN A HOUSE

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.926
WHERE LEARNING IS AN ADVENTURE
AND THE COURSEWORK

00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:44.897
ALLOWS EACH KID TO ENJOY
THE JOURNEY AT THEIR OWN PACE.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.868
FOR "K12 SPOTLIGHT,"
I'M LUCKY SEVERSON

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:53.406
IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO.
