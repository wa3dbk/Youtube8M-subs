00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.399
In this segment we're going to start taking
a look at how to collect and use naturally

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.929
occurring clay. That's clay that comes straight
out of the ground. Now, up to this point we've

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.160
looked at how to create your own clay body
based on highly processed industrial materials,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.640
but because clay is a naturally occurring
substance, and it exists right in the ground,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.100
we can dig it out of the ground and use it
as is. Now, remember that it's a sedimentary

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.760
material, so, stream beds, and lake beds,
and things like that where the material collects

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.621
when the erosion occurs are good places to
start looking. Depending on what part of the

00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:45.690
country youâ€™re in, you may have tons of
clay all around you, and maybe right under

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.719
your grass in your front yard, just under
the topsoil, or you may have to dig a little

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.710
deeper, or you may not have any at all, but
sufficed to say that stream beds and lake

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.090
beds are good places to start looking which
is why I've identified this area here because

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:09.930
this stream cut has less topsoil in it already,
it's got, the bank is kind of cut, so I can

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:31.420
start digging right here, and see what we
can find. OK, I found some clay. I didn't

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.780
have to dig too deep. As you can see hopefully
you can see this, it looks like strata, like

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.310
layers. If you've ever seen a picture of the
Grand Canyon for instance, then you know what

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.350
that looks like. The sedimentary material
that collected over time, and that's just

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.630
what this is, so. But it's got a different
coloration to it, and it's got that sticky

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.390
plastic kind of feel that we're looking for
out of a clay body, so. There's a lot of organic

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.180
matter here. Leaves and twigs and I had to
cut through a bunch of roots and things to

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.500
get down in here, so. I'm going to try and
avoid as much as possible getting that extraneous

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.500
crap into the clay so I have less to clean
out, but it's kind of inevitable, and then

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.570
after I dig some of this out I'm going to
show you how to clean out that extraneous

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.600
material and prepare it for testing and use
in your ceramic work.
