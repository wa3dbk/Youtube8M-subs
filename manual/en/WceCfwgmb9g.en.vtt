chris

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.910
this story

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.330
over the weekend

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.100
you should know it is now illegal

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.159
azerbaijan's saturday

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.710
two on the lock your cell phone

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.160
yes

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.310
apparently the librarian of congress are
not a exactly shore why but

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.129
they determine uh... the library
determines exemptions

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:33.820
to the digital money m copyright act

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.820
and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.729
the for some reason that librarian
decided that uh...

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.060
unlocking your mobile phone

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.250
essentially saying if i buy entity into
the phone

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.730
and iphone

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.030
and what about contract i decided to go
into

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.000
use some device dunlop it so that i can
call it that photo the t mobile

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.640
or whatever it is

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.110
uh... is illegal

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.220
now if you are already on lock your
phone where you've purchased are you

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.400
purchase an unlocked phone

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.540
then you're okay

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.390
but if you are unlocked yourself

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.930
you are subject it to you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.820
fairly draconian

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.120
um... punishment scenes

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.230
right i mean you can go to jail you'd
like a five hundred was it a five

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.280
hundred thousand dollar

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.930
fine and uh... i don't know what it is
and it's good to crazy how can they

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.650
prove the if if it's a legal to have it
on my phone just not unlock it i guess

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.510
they would have how we go to your
records and i don't know

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.220
until now

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.750
i'm not quite clear i'm sure they'll
come i'm sure it'll involve a you know

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.800
some type of

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.320
facial recognition or drone technology
or

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.020
something ridiculous but it's just one
more example of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.960
through the beast corporate stranglehold

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.550
and that enough

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.060
i wanna cast aspersions on speculating
here but i wonder if i would love to see

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.650
what do you know

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.660
who's been taken a librarian of congress
out the debtor lately

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.100
gimme a break

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.619
what do you inform and lost my phone i
lost my phone and then everybody backs

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.859
off

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.799
and present

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.839
uh... so that's a ridiculous but for
hopefully there can be some type of

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:21.019
uh... uh... congressional action on this
i don't know if there will be it does

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.930
seem absolutely ridiculous though
