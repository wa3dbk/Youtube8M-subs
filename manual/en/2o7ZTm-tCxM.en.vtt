00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.300
Who's car spottin' in Japan?
That bald Australian -- Dan the man

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.400
Always filming cars, and snappin' pics,
Come get your Wasabi fix

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.100
Nissan, Toyota, Datsun more
Rust and dirt is at its core

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.000
Who's that man snoopin' 'round real shady?
Wooo... It's Dani-el O'Grady

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.400
Wasaaaaabi,
Get your, Wasaaabi

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.000
With a little bit-a-rust, and a little bit-a-dirt
On Wasabi Cars, it'll never hurt

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.800
Wasaaaabi

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.400
Searchin' back roads will always pay,
It makes that man say "Good Day"

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Classic cars just are his flow,
Started when he found that Ca-maro

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.000
He likes his grunge, and he likes his rust
He likes 'em coated deep in dust

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.900
East car, west car, all a score
Hatchback, two door, truck or more!

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.000
Wasaaaaabi,
Get your, Wasaaabi

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
With a little bit-a-rust, and a little bit-a-dirt
On Wasabi Cars, it'll never hurt

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Wasaaaabi

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.200
He'll always bring those cars to you no matter
what it puts him through

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Wasaaaaabi,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.200
That's right. Coming at you, my man Dan, the
Australian in Japan. Bringing you them classic

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.100
autos from across the sea. Showing them, to
you and me. Cars that would never be seen

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.600
again, rusted up, tell a friend. Cars that
no one gives a damn, except the Wasabi Dan.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.000
Then they're seen again, what do you know?
Seen on another Wasabi Cars video.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.900
Teachin' in school and YouTube too
Spottin' them cars is what he'll do

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.500
Keep on watching till the end,
Buy a shirt and a tell a friend!

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.300
Tweetin', and postin', and tubin' it up
To Wasabi man we raise a cup

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.000
Any car he finds he'll always show
Thank you, Dan, Arigato!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.300
Wasaaaaabi,
Get your, Wasaaabi

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.700
With a little bit-a-rust, and a little bit-a-dirt
On Wasabi Cars, it'll never hurt

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.000
Wasaaaabi

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.600
Wasaaaaabi

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.000
With a little bit-a-rust, and a little bit-a-dirt
On Wasabi Cars, it'll never hurt

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Wasaaaabi
(Get your Wasabi!)
