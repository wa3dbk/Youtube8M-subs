00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.868
Hey! It's Rowan, and I am in the

00:00:01.888 --> 00:00:03.830
glorious London sunshine today

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.664
to talk to you about the LGBT

00:00:05.683 --> 00:00:07.579
TV shows that are coming to your screens

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.132
this summer. [Intro]

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:15.937
So, as you can see, I am outside so

00:00:15.937 --> 00:00:17.309
I apologise for the tweety birds slash

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:18.522
airplane noises that might be coming

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:21.283
to you, but, I have in front of me a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.586
list of TV shows. Two TV shows which

00:00:23.616 --> 00:00:25.603
I love that are returning for a new

00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:27.657
season, two TV shows that are new and

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:29.334
are having their first season this

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.053
summer, and two TV shows that are

00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:32.018
returning for a new season that I

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:33.365
haven't got around to watching yet

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.563
but which everyone tells me I need

00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:35.337
to watch, like, right now.

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:36.376
So, let's start with the two shows

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:38.344
that I love that are returning. First,

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:39.783
Orange Is The New Black. If you are not

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:41.683
on OITNB already, I

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:43.003
don't really know what to tell you

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:44.523
about this show that's going to make you

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:45.764
want to watch it more than all of the

00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:47.102
many things that people have already

00:00:47.123 --> 00:00:48.577
probably told you. But I love this show.

00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:50.109
It's got a very female-heavy cast, it

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.417
has a lot of queer characters, including

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:55.402
a trans character. I just adore it. It

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:57.457
is coming back to Netflix on June 12th

00:00:57.464 --> 00:00:59.204
and with the way that Netflix works,

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:00.728
the entire series will be available on

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:02.200
that day; if you have any kind of

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.993
self-restraint, you may pace this over

00:01:03.993 --> 00:01:05.719
a few days, maybe even a few weeks.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.084
I do not have that kind of self-control;

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:08.648
I'll be watching it all on that day.

00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:10.299
And probably making a lot of videos

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:11.963
about it as well. Another TV show that's

00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:13.608
returning that I adore is the Fosters. It

00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:14.994
actually doesn't seem like that long

00:01:14.994 --> 00:01:16.658
since it ended, now we have this new

00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:18.611
season, and the first episode of this

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.336
season is called Wreckage. If you've

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.707
seen last season, we know why it's

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.652
called that and it's breaking my heart.

00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:25.725
It is a show with quite a large number

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:27.885
of queer characters, including a trans

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.275
character played by a trans actor, which

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:31.379
is always nice. The plot essentially

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:34.156
centers around a mixed-race lesbian

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.457
couple who have biological, adopted, and

00:01:36.457 --> 00:01:38.485
fostered children. And it's just kind

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:40.978
of a nice interesting family drama.

00:01:40.978 --> 00:01:42.656
It doesn't make all the drama about

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:44.060
these particular identities that they

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.609
have but it also doesn't ignore them,

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.273
either. So that's coming back on June

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.931
8th to abc family. I'll definitely be

00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:50.822
watching, I hope you will too. So,

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:52.154
on to the returning shows that I

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.425
definitely need to start watching.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:55.039
The first is Halt and Catch Fire.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.191
It's Lee Pace's TV show, it's in the 80s,

00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:59.999
it seems very kind-of corporate, chic

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.272
stuff going on, and it has a bisexual

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.021
lead man. But it seems like a really

00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:05.683
interesting series. If you guys have

00:02:05.683 --> 00:02:07.338
seen it let me know in the comments

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:08.600
what you thought about it.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.546
That is coming back to AMC on May the

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.950
31st so check it out if you're so inclined

00:02:12.157 --> 00:02:13.653
So, another show that's coming back-

00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:15.712
not technically a TV show, it's a web

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:17.862
series, is Carmilla. I know - "How have I

00:02:17.862 --> 00:02:19.892
not seen this?" It's like, based on a

00:02:19.892 --> 00:02:21.872
literary work, it's set in a university,

00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:23.801
it has like non-binary characters, and a

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:25.761
ton of queer women. I have no idea

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.529
how I haven't watched this. I think I

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.169
just have never really been in the right

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.229
zone and had the time.

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.259
So that's coming back on June 2nd on

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.299
youtube. If you enjoy modern gothic

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.009
stuff, it seems like that would probably

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.869
be your thing. Now let's talk about the

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:39.349
two new shows that I've picked out.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.339
So the first one is Sense8 from the

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.399
Wachowskis. It's coming super-soon to

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.199
netflix. I think it might be this week

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.799
or next week and again, with netflix,

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.319
I think that's all gonna be coming on

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.699
the same day so you get to marathon

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.269
through. I looked at the trailers for

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.129
this. it looks like just total sci-fi

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.249
bonkers fun. It's these 8 people across

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.769
the globe who get connected

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.199
telepathically after this incident

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.869
happens and it just seems so interesting

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.809
The characters include a trans woman

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.749
blogger from San Francisco, and a closeted

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.149
gay actor from Mexico as well. The whole

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.069
thing is just super intriguing to me. I'm

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.849
gonna leave links to the trailers to

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.499
all of these different shows below so

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:14.139
you can check them out. And the last one,

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.139
technically doesn't air until September,

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.819
but I'm wishful thinking that summer,

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.029
summer, September, it's kind of the same

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:22.239
thing; It's called Quantico I don't really

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.109
know much about it except what the trailer

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.729
tells me but I am intrigued already so,

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.809
essentially, it seems like it's coming off

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.119
the back of "How to Get Away With Murder"

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:30.719
that ABC has realised that this is a

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.009
formula that works. Training these young

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.109
people, kind of a diverse cast of young

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.999
people, in something that's pretty elite.

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.789
In this case it's the FBI rather than like

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.339
law school. We have at least two out gay

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.029
characters within the series so far,

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:44.489
judging by the trailer. And the whole

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.819
thing seems like it's gonna be making

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:46.739
some interesting comments about

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.709
anti-islamophobia and things like that.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.179
And honorable mention is gonna go

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:51.759
to a show called Rosewood. It just looks

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.209
like this like ridiculous, funny, peppy

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.209
buddy-cop thing between these two people

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.099
It gets an honorable mention because I

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.229
don't know how far the queer character is

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.079
gonna be like a big part in this

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.449
particular show, but apparently the

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.399
main character Rosewood's sister is

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.639
gonna be in it, who's got a fiance who is

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.669
also a woman so that sounds like it's

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.579
gonna be a super interesting show, a

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.649
bit of fun to watch in the summer/fall.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.169
So let me know in the comments

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.449
if you've got any TV shows that you're

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.089
looking forward to this summer or if

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.469
you're particularly looking forward to

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.479
any of the shows I mentioned on the list.

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.879
Until I see you, bye! [Outro]
