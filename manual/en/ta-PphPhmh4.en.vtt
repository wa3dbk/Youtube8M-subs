Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen, and in this segment
we're going to talk about how to grow pear

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:11.360
trees. Now pears are one of the most beneficial
fruits that you can eat. They have so many

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.600
antioxidants and vitamins in them, and they're
just so healthy. The taste is just wonderful,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.670
especially if you have a little bit of pear
with brie or a little bit with chocolate.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.349
It's just a wonderful, wonderful treat. But
pear trees are actually easy to grow as well,

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.491
and there are so many different types of pears.
You have just the basic red pear or you can

00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:36.070
have the mikan or the Japanese or Asian pears
which just taste really good, they're almost

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.070
a cross with an apple, they're a little more
crispy, and they just taste really, really

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.650
good. But pear trees are just like other fruit
trees, and they're very similar to apples.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.210
So they grow pretty much anywhere an apple
tree would, especially in full hot sun with

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.830
good drainage. And lots of room to grow 'cause
they can get really big. And you can start

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.341
them by seed, you can actually take the pear
seeds from a pear and dry it and start it

00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:04.021
in the spring. It doesn't always work but
it is possible. The easiest way is to grow

00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:08.070
from a root stock. And you can buy them at
local garden centers or you can buy them in

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.470
a pot already, but pear trees are really easy
to grow. And all you need to do is when you

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.920
plant it, make sure that the root part is
covered but the plant part and the stem is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.890
not covered and that it will continue to grow.
The best time to plant them is in the middle

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.670
of winter or even late fall or in the early
spring. 'Cause they'll start setting roots

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.850
and getting established and then that way
they'll be ready to grow when it warms up

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.950
that spring. Sometimes it takes you know anywhere
from three to five years to get fruit on your

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.271
pear trees, and a lot of times if you have
an older property you might have pear trees

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.030
that aren't producing anymore, because really
after twenty years they don't produce a lot

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.240
of fruit. And there's nothing you can do about
it, you can try to trim them out and get them

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.850
to grow again, but really once they've passed
their fruiting stage, you can't get anymore

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.030
fruit. But if you do have a pear tree that's
just out of control and it's growing like

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.710
a Medusa, the trick is cut it back one third
of the height every year. And it will bush

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.560
out and grow much better. So if it's really
out of control, cut down one third one year,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.470
then one third the next year, and that way
you can control it a little more. And as it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.940
grows too, it doesn't hurt as soon as the
fruits are finished, go in and prune out all

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.630
the wild stems and leave just some base strong
stems in the middle, at least five, three

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.730
to five main branches off the bottom plant.
And that way you'll get a lush plant for the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.200
next year, lots of fruit. And make sure never
to cut it back more than one third at a time,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.720
and that way you'll have lots of pears for
the next year.
