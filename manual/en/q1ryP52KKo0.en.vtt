00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.830
My name is Charity White 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.900
I am a mother. I'm a blogger

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.740
I'm passionate about health and politics
immunizations 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.460
I love to run and play guitar

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.300
I have two little girl

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.509
and their 3 in 1 they're very adorable
and cute

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.400
I've been married almost five years now
we live in Idaho together in Twin Falls.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.500
I've been pretty blessed. I believe

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.680
in attitude. I believe that as long as you can stay positive

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.920
you wont have very many trials.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.990
when we got married they would say "aw just wait till your married a few years its going to get hard"

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.260
and its not, its easier

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.730
having a helper. Its the same with kids

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.690
people would say, "oh just wait till they can walk, its going to be hard" you know, and its not. It gets better and better. 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.980
so on my blog it's all about getting
both sides

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.880
and not judging a person that put something
up whether it's the side I agree with

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.420
or not

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.479
a few of the thing that I'm really passionate
about on the blog that I

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.960
post a lot about homeschool, immunization

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.520
and home births, things that are somewhat
controversial, I'm trying to straighten

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.950
those ideas out and get the facts so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.550
I have had a very unique upbringing  

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.860
doctor Howard is my dad and
I was

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.760
their throughout the whole process with Balance of Nature

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.960
He started off with a really great chiropractic office 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.330
and he was doing really well for himself, you know I kinda watched him as a little girl

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.120
he came up with the idea of Balance of Nature I remember as a kid taking vitamins 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.220
those big ol horse pills and you know
the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.220
gummy vitamins all of that and

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.220
slowly he started stopping ya know not giving it to us anymore

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.260
my dad he is a scientist

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.780
he loves to just study things out maybe
I got a little bit of that from him

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.900
although I do get a little bored when it comes to science

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.890
bit he loves to study things out and
figure things out so he started

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.060
seeing studies the vitamins might be harmful
and not helpful

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.639
and figuring out what was helpful because there
had to be something

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.670
and he came up with the idea of Balance
of Nature and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.969
I remember he when he bought this little
pill maker it was literally like

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.920
60 pills at a time any and he started giving it
the family and friends

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.230
and you could not deny some of the result I saw my dad

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.069
going through you know he he thought
it's either

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.930
chiropractic or Balance of Nature and
he went all and he bought

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.529
all the material he needed he bought the
building and he just said "I'm gonna do

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.620
it myself I'm gonna 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.239
make this happen" because he he knew what
it could do

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.430
I didn't I didn't see it then but I
see it now

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.680
I really look up to him for that for
doing that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.930
but it was quite a journey getting there

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.769
and I didn't see that coming you
know he didn't have workers and

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.139
it with kind of a work to survive thing if we wanted to eat we need to work you

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:05.669
know 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.849
I was labeled the production manager
but I was the

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.400
only one you know and it was me
Helena Lex

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.150
Lex is now the CEO and we would go
back there my dad would show us the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.029
right way to do it the right way to
clean

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:24.779
was very professional clean you know I
remember one time a

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:29.510
FDA guy came in and he wanted to kind of
check it out. We weren't big enough to

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.169
really care

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.449
you know for them to care that much but
he came and checked out he said "this is

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.290
the cleanest

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.779
play I have ever seen" and it was so small we
took so such pride in it because it was

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:42.249
just me and my brothers and sisters who
did it. We didn't have a farm

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.829
that my parents could teach us hard work
that was our farm I am the person that I am

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.959
because of that

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.329
and um

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.120
it was yeah it was hard at times

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.469
but I'm really grateful for it and I'm
grateful for dad's

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.780
example

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.650
 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.220
and that he believes in himself enough to do
that it was a great example to me

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.349
that he with willing to give up his
livelihood

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.669
to do something but he knew was right
and and I look at it now

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.350
and not a part of it anymore um

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.539
but I look at it now and I think wow
it has grown so much

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.090
they've come leaps and bounds and the
people that they're able to help

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.500
and studies they've been able to do I
never saw that as a kid I didn't know

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.720
when I would working until 6 am you know when I was working late

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.340
nights

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.820
and thinking when is this gonna end I
didn't know that I was helping people as

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.310
well

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.620
I do take pride in knowing that even though
it was a lot of

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.940
hard work a lot um

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.520
I take pride in realizing that he
couldn't have done it without us

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.690
and without our family and um

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.440
now were able to help tons people they
get the nutrients that they need

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.920
and live better lives

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.230
Balance of Nature for me

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.290
it's really just the peace of mind

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.210
and I've taken it for a long time ten
years

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.450
and I have noted permanent differences
huge differences

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.320
same for my kid it just it's a good
feeling

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.660
for me to know that I can give them those
nutrients as a mom

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.290
and I don't think many other kids are getting that

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.140
and it's just a good feeling to know
that I could do that for my kids

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.520
