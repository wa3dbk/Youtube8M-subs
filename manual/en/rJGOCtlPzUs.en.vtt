00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.774
Would it matter that you might be
saving a human life?

00:00:07.848 --> 00:00:11.181
And whose human life
would be important enough for all this?

00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:14.517
Mr. Donald Brown,
Director of the F.B.I.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.853
[Chuckling]

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:20.019
Wouldn't that be droll?

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:23.928
Look, we know that certain gang elements
in this prison want you dead.

00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:26.933
The entire government
wants me dead, mister.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.299
- Yet here I am.
- All right, smart-ass,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.304
let's cut the bullshit.

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:35.035
You cooperate,
and we'll get you transferred
to a minimum-security facility.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.046
That's our deal. And that's
your only chance to walk out
of this place in one piece.

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:43.208
That's a one-time offer.
Now take it or leave it.

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:46.482
Stuff it then,
as many fucking times as you like.

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:49.149
Pardon the language.
I've been in prison.

00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:56.155
[Sighs]

00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:07.838
All right, what will it take
for you to help us?

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.505
First, I'd have to be convinced
Isabella would be kept safe.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.674
Done.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.684
Then you'd have
to let me go.

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:18.186
Back to Ireland, free man.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:20.917
Out of the question.

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:25.690
Besides gunrunning, you're a known
killer of British government personnel.

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:28.253
Not to mention all the women
and children you've probably blown up.

00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:31.698
It's not my war.
I was never a bomber.

00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:34.794
I don't see the distinction.
You still took human lives.

00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:37.533
The distinction is I killed in a war.
Now I want to go home.

00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:39.700
- Simple as that.
- Simple for you, perhaps.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:43.543
Look, even in Russia, soldiers go home
when the treaty's signed. Nyet?

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:46.276
That's not gonna happen.
Sorry.

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:51.150
All right,
just the chance then.

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:55.783
Your best efforts
to get me free.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.794
I'll settle
for your word on it.

00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:02.123
Sorry.

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.004
So the Jackal's after
your director, is he?

00:02:08.072 --> 00:02:10.336
Best tell him to get
his affairs in order,

00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:12.342
'cause nobody
can save him now.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.562
Nobody except me.
'Cause I met him.

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.996
Yeah, didn't I mention it?
