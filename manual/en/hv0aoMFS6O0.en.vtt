00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.540
If you or a loved one have been in an accident
involving a commercial vehicle, such as a

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.110
truck, tractor trailer or bus, it is important
to know that there are special laws and statutes

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.820
that govern the operation of commercial vehicles,
and the companies that own them.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.180
It is important to contact an experienced
trucking accident lawyer who can protect your

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.230
rights and maximize the compensation to which
you are entitled.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.830
For 25 years I have represented the victims
of accidents caused by truck drivers and the

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.660
companies that own them.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.690
Experienced attorneys in truck accidents know
that different from the operation of a car,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.250
trucks require a greater degree of skill and
care.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.020
In order to operate a commercial vehicle,
a driver must obtain a special license.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.190
Special state and federal statutes control
the operation of commercial vehicles.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.190
The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 was passed to
establish national rules and regulations and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.370
the Inter-State Commerce Commission oversees
common carrier operation.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.120
As in auto accidents, driver error is many
times the cause of a collision.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.240
For truck drivers this can include fatigue.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.649
Many times the trucking companies require
their drivers to drive long distances without

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.009
sufficient breaks to rest.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.480
Sometimes the drivers will take drugs to keep
them awake.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.510
An experienced lawyer will know how to investigate
the conduct of the driver and their company

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.750
by obtaining the truck manifest showing the
routes, stops, and deliveries, as well as

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.050
the driver's daily logs showing all the schedule
of hours driven and breaks taken.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.401
Because drivers must be specially trained
and qualified to operate motor carriers, it

00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:58.190
is important that the company properly investigates
the background of a driver to ensure they

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.020
have the skills and qualifications to operate
a commercial vehicle safely.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.430
Many times companies hire unqualified drivers.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.000
Did the company perform a proper background
check?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.780
Did the driver have previous accidents, prior
traffic violations or license suspensions?

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.030
Companies can be held liable for their failures
when hiring and failure to supervise the drivers

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.960
which lead to unsafe drivers on the roadways
causing collisions.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.750
There are special regulations requiring proper
maintenance, inspection and repair of the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.930
truck and its equipment.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.990
Trucks and their equipment must be kept in
good working order at all times otherwise

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.980
they become a lethal danger on the highway.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.810
For example, improperly inspected or maintained
breaks that malfunction and lead to collisions

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.220
can cause catastrophic harm to another law
abiding motorist.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.780
The special laws, statues, rules, regulations
and requirements regarding the operation of

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.480
motor carriers requires the expertise of an
experienced attorney.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.580
If you or a loved one have been involved in
a collision involving a commercial vehicle

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.940
seek competent legal representation.
