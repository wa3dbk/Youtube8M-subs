00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.790
What do you do when you have the best
selling

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.210
best-performing fin in the world to make
it even better.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.740
It's a tough question we thought about
this for a very long time

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.080
and in the end we changed the material
formulation just a little bit

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.430
the result is the Mares Avanti Quattro
plus.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.559
Undoubtedly the most successful fin in
scuba diving in the last twenty years

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.780
it now has a more responsive material
that allows you for out better channel

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.579
formation

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.180
a more comfortable kick but don't
mistake that for

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.170
a less performing fin because if the
channel conform more

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.550
easily displace more water in the proper
direction

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.000
now this material is the result
technological improvements and therefore

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.660
it makes sense that it comes out at this
point has an improvement what the fin

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.530
was before

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.640
and since we came out with this new
version of the Avanti Quattro we

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.580
decided to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.640
jazz it up a little bit everywhere we
have a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.090
more shiny foot pocket with a new logo

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.009
and we have the bungee strap our
patented fin strap

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.659
that is taken the industry by storm and
with the introduction of the Avanti Quattro plus.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.130
We also introduced three new colors two
actually not so new because we used to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.720
have them

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.549
but it's a welcome return to the line
the lime

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.960
and the Flamingo and then the white now
what is special about these colors

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.759
think about visibility in the water you
want your buddies to be able to see you

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.860
well this red is the unlikeliest red
that you would

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.689
ever come up with because we know that
red is the first color to disappear

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.009
under water and turns brown

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.979
well this one does not you can be 130
feet and it is still a bright shiny red

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.770
white is by all means the easiest colour 
to spot under water

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.399
and green is also very very visible

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.869
more so head towards the surface then at
depth

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.260
but a very visible colour that allows
you to stand out in the crowd or two

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.200
be a reference for others so dive
instructors will love these colors

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.739
for sure.
