00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
In this video, I'm going to show you how to fold

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.820
a modular origami "Hex Star"

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.280
designed by Maria Sinayskaya.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.240
Do also check out her website: goorigami.com

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.440
and her Flickr stream: flickr.com/goorigami

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.380
for more of her fantastic work.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.700
For this model you will need

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.200
six rectangular sheets of paper with a ratio of 1 by 4

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.900
so the sheet is four times as long as it is wide.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.980
I will be using sheets that are white on one side

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.440
and colored on the other,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.260
but actually the color on the reverse, like the white side,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.320
doesn't really matter.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.800
And I will be using two different colors

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.300
for this kind of effect of alternating colored tips.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.240
And this, by the way, is the other side of that Hex Star.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.160
Now, the sheets I'm using are 15cm long

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.780
and 3.75cm wide

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.980
or that's 6 inches by 1 and a half inches.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.900
And then the diameter of the star--

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.000
that's kind of this distance right here--

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600
will be 15cm or 6 inches.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.600
So, let's get started!

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.600
We're first going to pinch a little,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.860
so we're going to take one edge

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.100
and bring it to the other edge.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.760
But we're not going to crease all the way through,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.640
but, well, maybe just about a quarter or so.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.020
Maybe a third is okay, too.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.520
And then you've got that crease line.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.160
Now we're going to take the lower corner

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
and bring it so it lies on that crease line.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.360
We're making a crease through the top point.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.920
So we first want to have a crease through the top point,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.780
and then ensure that that corner lies on there,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.020
to get a nice sixty degree angle.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.640
And crease.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.700
Then we're going to take this long edge,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.380
and we're going to align it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.380
with that raw edge of the paper,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.980
while its lying flat.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520
And crease.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.060
Then we're going to unfold this flap,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.320
and we're just going to rotate a little bit,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.580
and then bring this corner to that corner right there.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.100
And that crease should exactly go

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.600
through the end of that diagonal crease, too.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.660
Then unfold.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.580
Then we're going to flip over the paper,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.280
and now we're going to take this edge

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.080
and align it with that raw folded edge.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.240
And, again, make sure its lying flat

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.960
so that we get nice precise folds.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.100
And align perfectly.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.360
Then I'm going to unfold this,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.880
flip the paper over,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.480
and fold it over that edge.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.100
And make a crease.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.160
Then we're going to just take that paper, unfold it,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.760
and bring it to the front, like that.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.920
Then we're going to refold this edge, and refold that.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.000
And then our first module is all done.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.220
And once again.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.900
Now once you've completed those folds,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.520
we're going to take two modules,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.420
and this is always going to be the flap--

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.580
like, that's the smaller corner--

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.620
and right here, there's a pocket.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.480
To make assembly a little easier,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.760
we can actually unfold this,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.760
and then we're going to take that flap

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.240
and insert it into the pocket.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.300
And then you can see, you can refold it right underneath,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.600
and then its nicely locked.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.780
And then we continue with the next one,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.320
going counterclockwise.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.140
Inserting it here, and bringing it together.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.820
And again:

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.480
inserting the flap and refolding that edge.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.860
Now for the last one, we can't actually unfold this edge,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.260
so you can first insert this tip again,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.500
and then you just start fiddling a bit.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.360
Can you see that?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.440
I'm just opening it a little,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:13.420
and opening it like that and kind of taking that tip

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.080
and starting to insert it.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.220
And there you go!

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.960
You might have to fiddle a bit longer;

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.760
it depends on how much practice you have.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.240
But then your beautiful Hex Star

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.520
designed by Maria Sinayskaya is all done,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.560
and isn't it an absolutely beautiful star!

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.960
Do check out Maria's website: goorigami.com

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.360
and her Flickr stream: flickr.com/goorigami

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.820
for so many more fantastic stars that are just perfect

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.680
for folding and just looking at for pure pleasure.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.100
So I hope you enjoyed this video, and Happy Folding!

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.760
Bye bye!
