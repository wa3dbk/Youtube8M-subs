WIL WHEATON: Ahh!

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.510
WYATT: It is one of the funnest

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.620
games I've ever played.

WIL WHEATON: Wyatt,
you're my nemesis.

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:20.150
WYATT: It's the first I've
ever played the game, so

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.770
probably beginner's luck.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.315

very graciously.

my hands very briefly.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.315
It was pretty exciting.

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:43.375
HANNAH HART: This is my
favorite kind of game.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:44.357

Tron maneuver.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.685
Oh, no.

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:02.675
MALE SPEAKER: I didn't
see that.

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:03.665

RHETT: And you have
an alien city.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.486

You believe not that the
monolith held energy crystals.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.525
And they do.

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:20.505
I didn't know I had it in me.

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:21.495
RHETT: You didn't
have it in you.

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:22.155
LINK: Obviously, I did.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:22.980

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:42.036
I'd like to thank all the girls
who didn't know how to

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:42.780
play the game.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.750
I was able to exploit them.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.720
WIL WHEATON: I want to
exact a little bit.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.175
I just want to exact a little
bit of meaningless revenge.

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:53.740
What?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.882
