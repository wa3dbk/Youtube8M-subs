00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.080
Going home right now. Going upstairs.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.100
Going to the crib. This is my house, or my apartment.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.130
Well my parents apartment. It's where I live at.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.170
My room. It's not much. But,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200
it does the job.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.350
My full name is Walter Alexander.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.390
I am 18. I go to

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.430
Miami Jackson Senior High School. This is my last grade. Well, my last year.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.440
12th Grade. I want to be again the first one in my family

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.450
to graduate from school. You know, that makes out of the "hood".

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.460
The subjects in school that I like are science, but

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.500
I hate math. My grades, whew, they've always been bad.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.520
I only made it to the honor roll once. That was in 2nd grade.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.530
Then from there, just the people I started hanging around with

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.540
started guided me wrong ways. And

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.560
I just followed it, cause I didn't want to be one of the boys that was left out.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.570
And 9th grade, was when I really started messing up, when my grades started

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.580
skipping school. Started missing a lot of days.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.590
Then my arrest, when I was 16. And that changed my life.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.600
The thing I learned from that arrest and stuff

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.600
from picking my friends better

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.620
seeing them in a different way, and like losing my trust towards them.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.640
That's in the past. I am just moving forward now. You know you

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.650
learn from your mistakes. But, it's dumb if you keep doing the same mistake over and over.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.660
One of the reasons that

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.680
I just want to keep going in school

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.700
and try to become a better person, and a better Dad

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.720
you could say too. Cause ten months ago

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.730
I finally seen my son. This was the first time I've seen him

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.740
and I couldn't believe it. You know that's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.750
my little responsibility. My little love.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.760
That's something you never forget, the first

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.760
time you see your son. And this is a picture

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.790
right here.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.810
There's a painting of me and my son. That's just a little something to show him

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.820
how much I feel about him and everything. My son

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.850
used to be here. From school, my friends would tell me

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.870
"come to my house". I'd be like nah, you know

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.910
I gotta go see my son. So, as soon as school

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.920
end, first thing home, come straight home, just to go

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.960
and see him laugh. And he'll be waiting, just looking

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.980
and he'll see me and start jumping. And you know just to come home, and just hug him

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.020
and kiss him. You know. Now, he's not living with me

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.040
It's hard. I try not to think about it that much

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.060
It hurts. Just the thought of it. Sometimes I get lucky if

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.070
I see him on Friday or a Saturday.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.080
When I see him, anything I am doing

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.100
I cancel it. Just to be with him. Any money I get

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.110
first is for him. So whatver I get, if he needs pampers, pampers is the first thing.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.130
I'll buy him something else, like wipes or anything he needs. Anything.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.140
So then, I give him everything first. And then I worry

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
about my stuff. Cause he comes first. And if I have money

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.200
left over for me. Then I'll probably get a cell phone. But, right now

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.230
no cell phone. Some of the dreams I have for me and him

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.240
is to have a better relationship, than I do with

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.260
my Dad. If we can communicate more. Have fun together

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.270
and like he can could trust me. I just

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.290
don't want to be his Dad, his friend, his best friend. In my free time

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.330
when I don't see him, I am in to music and everything. I had bought a program

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.370
to be recording, to be producing. The type of music I like is hip-hop.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.410
It was like a song is talking about my life.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.430
And I called it the "Battle Rages On", the battle rages on for

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.480
years to come. The battle rages on for years to come

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.510
and then there's, they say the good die young and the bad lives on

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.530
or a better way to say it, the badders never won. No matter what I refuse to be silent.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.570
Get mad at me like Pac cause I am also violent.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.590
For support In school the one that helps me

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.630
if anything, if I have any doubt, or I don't get something

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.640
I ask Mimi about it. The Director

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.690
of the Gate Program. I ask her cause

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.720
she'll understand and 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.740
she'll help me out with anything she can. But, she won't do it for me. She'll just show me how to

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.750
I thought about dropping out of school a lot of times

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.780
But, my Mom always told me, that no she wants

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.810
a better life for me. Better than the one that they could give me

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.840
That's my mom, and that's my sister. This is one of my Boostups

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.880
This is my life right here too. Without her

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.920
I don't know what I'd do.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.100
[Laughing]

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.120
I'm just a nice person when you get to know me. I have a great personality.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.150
I don't get mad.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.170
You can be mad at me. But even when I'm mad

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.200
I still have a smile on my face. People know that

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.210
when I'm not smiling, there's really something wrong. But, besides that

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.230
you know, life is great just to smile.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.520
[The End.]
