00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.930
Hi I'm Graeme Newell.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.890
Today, the important difference between ego-focused
brands and product-focused brands.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.759
It's the critical identity question every
brand must ask itself.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.440
What motivates your customer?

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.329
Vanity or functionality.

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:21.890
"You gotta work hard to win, you gotta want
it!"

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.839
Nike ads never try to convince customers that
Nike gear is the secret to success.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.810
Winning comes from just one place...from deep
within.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:42.010
"You can accept defeat, or you can stare at
it until defeat blinks."

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.960
The brand message is that if you believe in
unstoppable tenacity and perseverance, then

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.170
you're in the Nike club.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.220
"Go go go go go go go go go go go!

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.320
Be aggressive!"

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.370
Nike isn't a product line, it's a way to live
your life.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.790
Nike's brand is built on customer ego.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.110
But Gatorade takes a different tack.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.690
"At the limits of your ability, you need to
hydrate fast."

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.440
It's a product-focused brand.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.050
Sure, they use the same sweaty, straining
athletes, but the ads don't just build egos,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.660
they also cast doubt.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.390
"Your moisture wicking fabric isn't enough.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.920
Your zero weight shoes aren't enough."

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.590
...and maybe YOU aren't enough.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.040
But maybe, just maybe, if you drink Gatorade,
you still might be able to pull it out.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.280
In this Gatorade ad, an athlete drinks the
magical Gatorade elixir...

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.580
"Trial number 10.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.460
Fuel training.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.530
Trigger muscle response."

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:05.060
...and Gatorade empowers him to beat his weaker
self in a race to glory.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.779
Product focused brands showcase the product
as the key to solving a problem or achieving

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:10.779
a goal.

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:16.939
"I got to take care of my heart, for me, Cheerio's
is a good way to start."

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.269
Ego-focused brands stay away from pain &amp; doubt.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.870
The product isn't just a tool, it's proof
you're at the top of your game.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:35.959
Only wonderful parents take their kids of
Disney World.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.560
Has a moment ever hugged you and never let
go?

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.140
Yay"
"We're getting on the plane right now and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.140
going to Disneyland.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.140
We're going to California.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.489
Only confident men use Gillette razors.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.569
"We all have confidence.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.640
We all have doubt.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.790
But when the moment comes, what's gonna win?

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.409
Here's to confidence.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.239
I've been dreamin' a dream."

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.239
Feel that uplift?

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.659
That's a hallmark of ego-focused brands.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.349
So which is right for your brand?

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.750
An ego-focused brand or a product-focused
brand?

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.329
Most brands inevitably dabble in both, but
the general rule is, the more mature the product

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.920
category, the more you must appeal to your
customer's identity.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.200
If there's not much difference between your
product and others, get busy stroking some

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
egos.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:51.109
I'm Graeme Newell and that's 
emotional marketing.
