00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.360
This is a good spot to fish because you can cast upstream - 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.960
- and then the spinner will drift underneath the bank.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.500
In a real 90 degree bend, where everything just twirls -

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
- the fish have a hard time finding rest, 
 so this isn’t a typical hot spot. 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.300
A place like this however, where the current is 
 very steady is a really good bend.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It is really effective to fish the wobbler directly below the surface - 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.200
- so that it bulges the water – and then you stop.
