00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.979
I did everything myself in here.  That is
not how you do

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.590
the business and there right there is a
house that I have already flipped.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.639
as well and I already know that I can flip
this house to a buyer on my buyers' list 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.810
because I got a strong buyers' list in this area.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.759
Yo.  What's up guys.  John Cochran here and
today is System Saturday.  The day that I

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.890
bring you a system that I use in my
business

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.300
that you can rip off and duplicate using your own local market.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.050
Now if you haven't been to one my live
events yet why not?  I only deliver my

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.579
entire blueprint to you

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.589
which qualifies you for a five hundred
thousand dollar line of credit

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.650
to do business with.  Now in today's
System Saturday session, we're gonna talk

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.079
about how to identify your real estate

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.120
sweet spot.  Now what your sweet spot

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.500
is is basically where you need to be
doing business in.  Okay so you're sweet

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.030
spot

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.300
is going to be - you need to find
your sweet spot to be where everybody is

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.800
buying properties at

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.800
okay and that's where you're going to be
flipping real estate in because you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.700
already know

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.200
that the market is buying properties in
this areal.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.300
Now this data that you need to pull and the
research that you need to do is 100

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.090
percent gonna come from the MLS

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.580
by far that is only place where it's
going to come from is from

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.300
the MLS.  if you're not a licensed Realtor
you can always have a license realtor

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.119
pull

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.000
all this information for you.  Now this
data

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.100
it will tell you exactly where you need
to be flipping properties in.  So

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.200
back early on for the first eight years
when I was in business believe it or not

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.700
guys

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.200
I flipped every single property in one
subdivision.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.170
Now the reason I did that was because I
knew the area so well

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.500
okay and from knowing the area so well

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.500
it really stopped me from working in all
the areas

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.300
of where all the properties were actually
selling in because I didn't know my

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.759
numbers.  I didn't know

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.100
what you're learning today.  So this data
will show you exactly where you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.900
need to be doing business in.  Okay now
here's the exact system that we use in

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.700
order to find out where you

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.100
need to be flipping properties at.  First of all, you need  to login to your local

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.900
MLS.  So do that login right into your

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.700
local MLS and all MLS are different.  So these screenshots you see right here

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.780
is possible that they are different than
what your MLS is gonna look like

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.700
log in to the MLS and do what's called a
standard search.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.200
Okay whenever you do a standard search
you can do 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.300
a plethora of different things and what you
want to do is you want to search for

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.100
properties

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.500
that are residential, that are single family

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500
that were sold in 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.100
every single County in your entire

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.600
MLS.  Every single county in your entire MLS. 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.700
Okay whenever you choose all of that
data

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:57.100
now you need to choose all the sold
homes the past year.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.100
So you can see that I'm searching for
residential homes that are single family

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.600
in every single county in my MLS

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.519
and that has been sold last year.  Okay

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.500
this is what's going to show you exactly
where your sweet spot

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.400
numbers really are.  So you can see right
here, this right here is my sweet spot

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.519
numbers.  There's 15,281

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.700
sold properties last year into all of those counties into our MLS.  

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.819
And here's your sweet spot numbers.  You can tell that everybody is buying

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.859
properties that are 3-bedroom

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.989
2 bath, 1,742 square foot

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.400
with the list price of  $121,000

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.700
and the selling price of $116,000.  So that tells me right

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.230
there

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.900
that I need to be buying properties that
are 3-bedroom 2-bath around 1,700

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.500
square foot that are going to be selling

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.600
for right around $116,000.

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.060
Once you identified your sweet spot
numbers

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.260
now what you need to do is you need to
do a search

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.529
to find all the cities or the areas

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:07.200
that meet those sweet spot numbers.  You
gotta go find all those areas.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.969
And this literally by finding all these
areas, it is going to tell you a lot

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.900
about your sweet spots.  So check this out.  What I did was I did a search of all the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.600
properties that were sold in every
single city

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.600
in every single town in our entire MLS.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.500
Here's what I found out.  The average
sales price right here is really what I

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.500
was looking for.  What you can see
highlighted in yellow

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.100
is all that properties that are in our sweet
spot because the sales price is right

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.900
around that $116,000 figure

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.900
that we have just identified.  So you can see
here that Englewood, Clayton

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.020
that is in my sweet spot.  Fairborn/Bath
Township

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.200
98,000, that is in my sweet spot.  Franklin
Carlisle, that is

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.900
in my sweet spot.  So you look for
all the towns that are selling the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.000
properties

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.400
in your sweet spot that has sold a lot
of 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.020
inventory 395, 336, 315

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.200
510 homes sold last year alone.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.910
Now this data will also tell you
other things as well.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.600
I want you to look at these stars right
here Beavercreek, Bellbrook

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.500
Centerville.  You can see here that the
average sales price is 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.600
$188,000 for BeaverCreek, Bellbrook $251,000.  Centerville 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.700
$193,000.  Now those are higher

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.000
than our sweet spot but you can tell
that the units sold or the homes

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.630
sold is 690, 214. 927.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.700
So they're selling a lot of properties
in those areas

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.200
so but they're gonna be harder for me
to pick up but whenever I do pick them

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.730
up

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.200
you can tell that I'm going to make a
lot of money on them whenever i am able to

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.940
buy in those areas.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.400
One other figure that you need to look
at is say Dayton.  See that

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.800
right here it has a lower dash Dayton and 
Trotwood.  Notice this.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.700
Dayton has sold 1267 homes last year in 2013.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.200
Right here the average sales price is $47,712 .

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.220
So what this means is that that area is
perfect

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.300
to wholesale properties in because
there's a lot of people buying

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.560
but at the same time they're really
really cheap.  So that's a great area to

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.400
wholesale properties in same with Trotwood-Madison

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.400
34,000.  There's 261 homes sold last year

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.000
great area to wholesale and then going back
to the BeaverCreek, Bellbrook and

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.700
Centerville.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.000
Great places right there to rehab
because they sell for top dollar

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.800
and they sell a lot of them.  So guys
identify your sweet spot.  I can tell you

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.100

doing business in.
