Hi! I'm Scott Reil on behalf of expertvillage.com
I would like to talk to you about tree and

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.120
shrub maintenance. Pruning your trees and
shrubs is probably one of the best ways to

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.120
help maintain them in a healthy and ecstatic
way it is going to look good in your yard.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.160
Now everybody assumes when we start talking
about pruning we got to break out the tool

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.259
right away but there is even pruning jobs
say I'm the new foliage of a blue spruce it

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:32.870
is best handle by hand. Simply by snapping
off and shorten the length and actually removing

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.970
the entire candles on some of these branches
I can control the length of the growth for

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.809
that season simply by shutting down the growth
of that particular branch. That is going to

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.059
cause the tree to bud back, creating more
buds back behind causing it to fill in and

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.000
that is the real reason we prune. Well that
is the easy way to get it but not all of them

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.289
are going to be able to be done by hand sometimes
you need to break out the pruners especially

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:10.909
for woodier deciduous plants. Now my hollies
got done flowering about a week ago and that

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.510
is important to remember best time to prune
for almost all plants is right after they

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.680
have got done flowering that way you are not
pruning off next years flower buds which in

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.579
some cases could definitely happen. On this
Hollie we could I got a few growth shooting

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.940
up here now a lot of people are going to want
to take a electric preadge pruner or something

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.299
like that just buzz this thing right around
it is one the worst ways to prune. It really

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.850
doesn't make a clean cut it just haggle it
up and I don't like it because it leaves a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.750
less to natural look to the shrub. I prefer
to go with hand pruners and cut now I have

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.710
picked this point here I have a bud right
below there and I want it to grow forward

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.200
so this bud is called advantages bud that
would start the next series of growth out

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.090
to the front. By going through and selectively
pruning and you only want to prune about a

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.480
quarter inch at best above that advantages
bud that is going to be the next place where

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:26.230
the tree pushes and grows from. Now by going
to through and selecting just a few of the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:40.670
leaders on tops off of this plant I can get
it back to a nice full look that looks natural,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.530
it doesn't look sheared and clipped. The tree
is going to go better and healthier that way,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.989
the air is going to move through the plant
because it help lighten some of it up and

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.200
the plant is just going to have a natural,
healthy appearance that is going to serve

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.870
me well look good in my garden for years.
If you prune like this your would do the same.
