00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.269
dot a you Fibonacci retracement

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.329
so he was here but Archie Leonardo
shipping archie

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.719
was a famous Italian mathematician and
he discovered a simple

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.840
series of numbers decorated ratios

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.129
to describe the natural proportions all
things in the universe

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.600
at these ratios can be used as

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.860
a trading tall so why do we use him in
Archie

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.579
Fibonacci retracement is used by many
professional

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.680
and retail traders have because that
fact

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.369
it is self-fulfilling how is have been
archie

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.340
used sippin archie is used as a training
tool

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.979
to identify the endeavor trace mint for
a pullback

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.380
it price I can be used to join

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.170
market rallies wild price swings in a
general opposite direction

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.170
price uptrends when price for used
legible

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.509
down was direction price down trends and

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.119
price creates this step immersion which
is a series of pushes

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.439
am all backs or rallies retracements

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.790
so with the downtrend we could have
rallied to the downside

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.079
the retracement a rally a retracement

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.170
and safe 4th with an uptrend we can have
a rally

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.570
and a trace mint or using different
terminology

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.700
at perch and a pullback perch

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.860
and a pullback its once we identify
tread oversee the ideal place to join

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.549
the trend

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.619
is the straw thoughts on an uptrend

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.640
and the peaks over downtrend here is
your ideal

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.890
area to place calls and here

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.120
are you up i do. areas to play sports

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.400
as price

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.020
me strongly in that direction of all
binary options position

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.930
safeguards for trace from provides a
series of levels

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.640
which act as potential areas of price
reversal

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.680
potential levels

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.610
of where have retracement will become a
rally

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.510
or a pullback becomes a push if you
could imagine this

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.519
Blackline is an uptrend we've had

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.730
retracement followed

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.310
by a rally to the upside now prices pull
it back alright racing

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.170
again we we choose to sleep in our
church basement all

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.379
to measure the start and and

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.170
of this rally or push and then the ban
on she

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.170
tall will automatically calculate these

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.760
ratios for us and he to these levels

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.540
is a potential level by price would
reverse

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.420
to pull back with Dad and and price
would go for the for perch

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.750
there are five levels all ratios

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.330
but the middle three nope 1382

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.560
0.5 00 and 0.61 I'd

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.470
are the most commonly use levels and
these can also be expressed

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.629
has percentages this is an hourly charts
above

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.349
the dollar Swiss franc prices down

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.159
training we have I rallied the downside

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.370
retracement a rally a retracement

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.370
and a rally if we were to use

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.170
financial retracement from here to the
end this rally

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.170
you'll see our theme levels

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.220
and as mentioned the most common

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.610
are these middle three has prize for
traces

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.199
we reach that point six one 8 fib level

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.810
prices rejected

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.169
we have a bearish engulfing

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.389
and then we have stronger

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.940
down what's momentum as price

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.830
carries for other commercial the
downside so once this has been

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.330
identified

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.800
we then have a number of opportunities

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.120
to look for signals to play spurts as we
know the momentum

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.639
is going to be on the downside this is a
4-hour chart

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.990
of the pound against the dollar we have
clear uptrend

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.740
Peche call back at Peche pullback

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.600
and another perch that sees of it
tonight she

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.850
retracement mark the start

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.199
and and office kirsch up

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.410
we will look at are three main levels

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.990
donates s our first level point in 382

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.610
is reached prices rejected

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.150
we haven't got candle abolishing golfing

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.620
and then price reverses

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.620
and goes further push one of the key is
to fit archie retracement

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.870
is to identify signals on the Fibonacci
level

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.710
such as Pitt bars rejection of the
financial levels

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.870
and then go from candles instead of
purely

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.590
easing a fib level by itself to place
calls for petes

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.270
