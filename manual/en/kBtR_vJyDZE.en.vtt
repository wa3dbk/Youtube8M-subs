ALAN MARK LIGHTNER: Hi. I'm Alan Lightner
with Expert Village. Today, we're talking

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.960
about playing with steelpans in various musical
situations. We've already talked about some

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.129
traditional ones and some non-traditional
situations. When I talk about the next one,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:23.080
which we'll be playing solo, playing steelpan
solo, unaccompanied by any other musicians,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:34.010
it's one way that steeldrummers love to play,
because you can really play in a nice volume

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.650
where you can really here how sweet the drum
can sound. You're not trying to compete with

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:50.440
any other musicians. You can play it softy
or as loudly as you'd like without having

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.290
to be too loud where you hurt the drum. So
steeldrummers really enjoy playing solo. One

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.570
nice thing and one thing that you have to
practice in order to play solo is trying to

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.020
play melodies and accompaniment. That's difficult
and there a lot of different techniques that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:25.390
people use, one you could try playing the
melody, and then accompanying yourself. So

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.800
you can see, that first part I was playing
a melody and then I was pretending that I

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:45.060
was the guitar playing and playing the chords
and then I'd join them, play that melody again.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:02:04.000
So that's one technique that I like to use
when I'm playing solo, playing melody and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.250
accompaniment, and trying to be creative and
figure out how you can go back and forth between

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.640
the two.
