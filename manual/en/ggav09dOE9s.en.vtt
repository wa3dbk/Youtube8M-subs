&gt;&gt;Steve Zaragoza: Hey guys, welcome to SourceFed, I'm Steve Zaragoza. 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.840
Joe Beretta: I'm Joe Beretta.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.000
&gt;&gt;Steve: Speaking of hygiene. Here's an important
cautionary tale for all of you wearers of

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
contact lenses out there, in the form of a
children's fairy tale: There once was a 23

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.039
year old girl from Taiwan, who kept her contact
lenses in for 6 months straight. Then a bacterial

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.530
bug ate her eyeballs and now she's blind!
The End!

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.350
&gt;&gt;Joe: Wow. Maybe you shouldn't be a parent.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.800
But it's true. 23 year old Lian Kao, presumably
under the pressures of being a student, in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.420
Taiwan, failed to remove her contact lenses,
resulting in the perfect breeding grounds

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.000
for single-celled amoebas.
&nbsp;

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.750
&gt;&gt;Steve: Oh god. Reason # 9 billion why I don't
wear contacts. The single celled bugs in questions

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.879
can apparently burrow their way straight through
the cornea, looking for amoeba things all

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.860
up in your lookie things. Basically your eyeball
is a magnet for infection if you don't provide

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.250
enough oxygen to your cornea, IE by leaving
your dang gross ass contact lens in. GROSS

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.110
LIAN KAO! GROSS.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.960
&gt;&gt;Joe: Now for some science talk from Dr. Mark
Fromer, as read by Joe Bereta. "Without adequate

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.880
oxygen, the cells of the cornea can break
down and fall off, essentially removing the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.810
eye's barrier to infection." And because of
that risk, Dr. Fromer tells his patients to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
never keep their contacts in even overnight.
I'm learning so much right now.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.999
&gt;&gt;Steve: Also, apparently Lian Kao kept her

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:19.819
lenses in while swimming and shit.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.419
&gt;&gt;Joe: Swimming in shit, or swimming AND shit?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.420
&gt;&gt;Steve: AND shit.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.420
&gt;&gt;Joe: And shit. Big difference.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.560
&gt;&gt;Steve: So she did all sorts of not caring about her

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.979
body, and now has acanthamoeba keratitis,
which is actually rare, but more common in

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:30.950
the summer. FYI.
&nbsp;

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.950
&gt;&gt;JOE: So what have we learned here kids? Take
out your dang contact lenses and clean them,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.009
or throw them away and ready some new ones.
It's that easy! Don't be gross. Me. Yes I'm

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.200
talking to me now. Kinda talking to you. More talking to me. I've slept with my contacts in for 6 months straight. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.200
Oh my God, I'm blind.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.479
&gt;&gt;STEVE: And with that I ask, what is something
you learned the hard way due to fairly avoidable

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.419
negligence? Let us know in the comments down below.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.540
I only know how you feel based on the contours of your face now. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.540
&gt;&gt;Steve: Okay! Joe!

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.120
&gt;&gt;Joe: SourceFed.
