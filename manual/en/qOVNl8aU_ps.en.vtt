00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.520
Welcome to my living room and we are going to start our next tutorial.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.560
And this is the Christmas ball wreath and I'm going to provide a link in the "more information" of this video.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.980
If you're looking for ideas of what to do.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.580
First thing you're gonna need to do is you're gonna need to do a little bit of shopping.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.520
You're gonna have to get yourselves some balls.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.920
And this is just what we need to do is get a standard coat hanger,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.700
and what we need up here is that we just need to untangle the top section,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.620
I've already done a little bit of it already. So that it opens up, so you don't need wire cutters or anything.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.300
And then we start bending this into a circle.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.680
So, I'm gonna pretend that I've just done that because I don't wanna waste your time.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.940
So, you bend it into a most perfect circle that you can possibly get,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.000
and because you're not going to see the wire, if it's not totally perfect, whatever, whatever, it's not a big deal.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.940
So that's the first thing I want you to do.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.760
So, you're gonna have to go out and get your balls and you're gonna need at least 80 balls.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.200
And yes, that's a lot of balls, but... [laughs]

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.960
But what I found, I went to a store,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.640
and apparently they had these big canisters, here.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.560
And they were 32 balls inside for only $9.99, and they were clearance, half price.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.160
And they're only plastic balls, but that's not a big deal.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.180
And they work for me.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.860
The next step you need to do is that you need to grab each ball.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.640
So, I used several purple and pink are my colors and next week this whole house is going to get transformed over.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.000
And what we need to do is that you need to get yourself a glue gun. Okay? So if you have a glue gun, crafting glue gun, this will be perfect.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.780
And you see these little knobs that are, uh, at the top?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.820
Well, these have a lot of pressure because they're being fastened to the wire.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.280
So, what we need to do before you put it onto the wire, you have to glue in around the top section there, so that these things don't pop off.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.860
And again, these are just plastic balls.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:16.620
The next step what we need to do is now that you got the glue on, is that now you are just gonna be putting these on top, onto the actual ring.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.120
Just like so. And they're gonna fall where they may.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.480
And so, the thing about these things is that you wanna make it 3-dimensional.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.040
So, you're gonna need a lot of balls.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.600
In order to create because it has to go all the way around the ring, that's why you need so many of them.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.200
So, once we get that done, uh, you're gonna really have, you'll find yourself adjusting. I would put them on top when you're lying this down,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.300
and feeding them on, I would put them down on a towel so you don't scratch these balls because they are plastic and if you're going to use glass, you want to be delicate.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.740
So, I put this down on a towel when you're feeding this all along.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.840
And you're going to do it until you're totally packed in, all the way around.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.420
And you can fasten the top shut.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.280
And what I mean by fasten the top, what I did, I just went like this,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.820
I just bent this down,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.700
Okay, I bent this down and I just linked it.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.280
That's what I did.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.640
Okay.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.920
So, that's what we did there.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.620
The next step you're gonna have, is that you're gonna see a lot of gaps in between all the balls because the balls are the same size.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.300
Uh, you're going to see too many gaps and it's not going to be great. And you can still see the wire.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.140
So, what, I went to the Christmas store and I thought, "What am I going to do about it?"

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.560
So, what I realized is that some of the cheap ass decorations, they're shoving tinsel in between gaps just to kind of give it... it's really just a filler, in fact

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.980
even though you think it's all Christmas-y, it's really just a filler.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.080
So what I suggest that you do is that you run out and go buy yourself some tinsel and in this case,  chose a really

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.200
thick, uh, tinsel, that was $1.99.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.060
And what you see here is what, all you need to do is grab your tinsel,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.100
and just start, and just, because this is just one sided,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.180
right, the other side doesn't have all of this tinsel that you can't see.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.740
So, what you just do is you just tuck in your tinsel.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.200
In and underneath.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.640
And by doing that, it causes the balls to really compress outward and really be looking full.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.720
So, you're gonna go all the way around with that,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.540
and right at the top, I provided extra tinsel at the top.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.800
So, I start at the top, work my way around and I just weaving myself in behind so

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.660
if you want more tinsel, then don't push it so deep.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.260
If you want less tinsel, just push it in further.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.660
So, that was my next step.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.060
The next thing that we did is that we looked at it and went, "Well, you know, it's still missing something."

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.920
It still doesn't have pizzazz.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.220
So what was did was that we ran out and Daniel provided and bought these things here for $4.99. And it was a large string of just wire with

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.680
uh, plastic pink beads.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.680
And this was one big, long wire, and what we did was that we just weaved it and pushed the wire

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.320
in and then all the extra pieces that are out

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.600
they're actually sticking out.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.160
So, it gives it a 3-dimensional look.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.320
And again, it's still missing something.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.580
And realizing that the balls, because they're all the same size, it doesn't look as great.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.880
So the next step that we did is that we went out and got these small balls.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.320
And there was 24 of them for $4.99.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.680
And all you gotta do is just

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.300
glue it, you glue it to the like the section on the side,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.600
and then you push them, you know how it's got the tabby thing? You just

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.040
gotta push it upside down and then these are all glued to a big ball that's right beside it.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.300
And that's how you complete this Christmas ball wreath. And it's actually a really great project.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.660
And I would not say that it was a cheap project so this would be right about $35 or $40.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.180
It all depends on what tinsel and the balls are pretty much the most costly thing in this project.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.580
So, good luck and enjoy!

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:54.900
