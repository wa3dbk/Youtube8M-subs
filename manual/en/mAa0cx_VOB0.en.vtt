Hello! My name is Grady Johnson and I'm a
professional painter. And today I represent

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.690
expertvillage.com. Okay now we're going to
talk a little bit about sanding the trim.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.620
Now, we went ahead and spackled all the little
holes on our baseboards and on our door jambs.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.779
Now we're going to sand those out nice and
flat. But the first thing we need to do is

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.779
to get our paper ready. Now, you want to get
a two-twenty grit sandpaper. It doesn't fill

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.470
up quite as fast, but it does give you a nice
fine finish. Now, when you're getting your

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.539
sandpaper, you'll find that it comes in one
big full sheet and you're going to want to

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.989
cut that in half. So you can see this is a
half of sheet of sandpaper. Then fold it over

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.070
one, about halfway and then the other way,
kind of like folding a letter that you're

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.440
going to put into an envelope. This will give
you something that you can hold in your hand

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.579
like this, so that you can do your sanding.
Then, you take one of these areas where it's

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.050
built up here and you just start working it.
You see, that will sand out nice and smooth

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.940
and that's what you're looking for. You want
to get these surfaces nice and smooth so that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
it'll be, be slick. Now, that's going to handle
where there that was spackling. You can see

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.450
how that works. It sands it out nice and flat
so it's even. So we're going to go ahead and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.009
do all of it and bump it all the way from
top to bottom. Don't forget this little edge

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.250
over here. That's why I kind of like to do
this before I paint my wall. Get this little

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.990
edge back here and smooth that out too. We're
going to take that down, down to the bottom.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.740
Now, you can see here where I put the spackling
on here and we piled it up nice and high so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.619
that it would cover it. So this is how that
works. We sand it flat and you see it just

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.729
completely disappears. Now, it's like there
was never a hole there and that's how that

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.509
works. Now we're going to do that with the
rest of them as well and you can see how that

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.880
just evens out. So we get a nice smooth surface.
Now, use your hand and go back over it and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.270
that'll let you know wherever any rough spots
are and just sand those out flat. Then bump

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.570
this side a little more as well and by doing
this, we work every square inch of the jamb.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.680
Then, we want to run our hands over it and
make sure it's really, really smooth. Now,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.300
if you feel you've got to cut a corner and
you can't handle all the sanding, cut the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.680
corners off on the bottoms or the very tops
of the jambs. Always make sure it's most smooth

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.030
right here in this middle area where the hand
traffic's going to go. Well, these are just

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.660
a few tips and pointers that'll help you when
you're sanding your trim and this is exactly

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.640
how you sand the trim for interior painting.
