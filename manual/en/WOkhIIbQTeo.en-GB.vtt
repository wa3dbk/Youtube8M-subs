00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:13.833
Welcome to the Nespresso Assistance video on directions for use

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:16.889
for your Rapid Cappuccino System.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.015
In order to obtain a perfect milk froth, time after time,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.530
we suggest you follow some simple instructions.

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:29.421
Turn on your machine and let it heat up for 25 seconds.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.701
To prepare a Cappuccino or a Latte Macchiato,

00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.522
fill the milk container with the desired quantity of milk.

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:41.878
We recommend that you use skimmed or semi-skimmed milk

00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:46.082
at refrigerator temperature (about 4° C).

00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:48.986
Do not use raw unpasteurised milk

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:54.718
and be sure not to use milk after its expiration date as indicated on its packaging.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.423
Open the steam connector door and put it in place.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.786
Lift the lever completely and insert a Nespresso capsule.

00:01:08.374 --> 00:01:09.810
Close the lever.

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.396
And place a Cappuccino cup under the coffee outlet.

00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:20.013
Always orientate the milk spout towards the centre of the cup or glass.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.369
If you want to use a tall glass for a Latte Macchiato, simply lift the foldable drip tray.

00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:32.521
You can adjust the texture of milk froth by turning left or right the regulator knob.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.730
Press the Capuccino button.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:41.233
The preparation starts after a few seconds and will stop automatically.

00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:03.289
After every use, it is important to remove the used Nespresso capsule

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.701
and not let it remain in the extraction system.

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:12.280
It is also very important to rinse the system after each milk based preparation.

00:02:13.137 --> 00:02:15.757
Place a container under the milk outlet.

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:21.871
Rotate the milk regulator knob until «CLEAN» position.

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:24.660
The machine starts rinsing.

00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:30.469
It stops automatically after 15 seconds.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:36.507
Once the rinsing has finished, turn the milk froth regulator knob back in milk position.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.817
Disconnect the milk container from the machine and place it in your refrigerator.

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:44.645
Then close the steam connector door.

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:51.524
Every two days, disassemble the Rapid Cappuccino System

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.345
and clean all the components in the upper level of a dishwasher.

00:02:56.814 --> 00:02:59.013
Remove the milk container lid.

00:03:00.902 --> 00:03:02.948
Remove the milk froth regulator knob

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:06.502
by turning it until the “REMOVE” position, and pull it up.

00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:12.035
Remove the Rapid Cappuccino System connector

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.468
by unlocking it from ‘LOCK’ to ‘UNLOCK’ and pull it off.

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:20.328
Remove the milk spout by pulling it off.

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:24.837
Unplug the milk aspiration tube.

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:33.818
In case a dishwasher is not available,

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:39.549
rinse away carefully any milk residue from all the components with fresh drinking water.

00:03:42.297 --> 00:03:48.815
soak all the components in warm water, approximately 40° C or 104° F,

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.789
together with soap detergent for at least 30 minutes.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.300
Rinse with fresh drinking water and dry them with a clean damp cloth.
