00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.300
Do you have to deal with IP address conflicts on a daily basis?

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.570
Are mobile devices in the workplace leading to an increase in duplicate

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.929
IP's?

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.549
Are human errors resulting in incorrect address assignments?

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.039
Does that outdated spreadsheet make you want to scream?

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.789
If you answered "Yes" to any of these questions,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
then you know how difficult it is to manage IP addresses.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.719
An IP address conflict happens when two or more devices in your network have

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:30.380
have the same IP Address.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.070
This will cause the affected machines to experience erratic or complete loss of

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.930
network connectivity.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.350
The fact isâ€”IP address conflicts can wreak havoc on your network.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.200
And they can impact any system on the network that has the misfortune of

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.320
having a duplicate IP address, including laptops,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.310
printers, VoIP phones,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.090
and critical servers.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.930
Imagine the business impact if one of your mission-critical services goes down due

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.060
to an IP address conflict!  There are several main causes of IP address

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.550
conflicts.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.309
Bring-Your-Own-Device (or BYOD) phenomenon is typically a "home"

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.400
laptop or tablet that still has a static IP address assigned.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.650
This may generate a duplicate IP when connecting to the corporate network.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.300
A DHCP Server misconfiguration occurs when two DHCP servers

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.640
are managing the same IP subnet or segment with overlapping IP addresses.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.970
And there's always human error such as a Network admin that makes a mistake

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.869
when assigning an IP or forgets to update the spreadsheet.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.680
Resolving IP address conflicts can be time-consuming and extremely frustrating.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.049
First, you must determine which two machines or devices caused the conflict

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.890
and find the associated MAC addresses.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.320
If you're fortunate enough to have the MAC address, the first step would be

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.670
to unplug one of the devices.  Then, use another machine within the same subnet

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.760
to PING the IP address in question.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.810
In some cases, there will be no DNS name provided or the ICMP protocol

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.640
is blocked on the firewall.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.530
with the mac address information

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.710
you can go to the switch or wireless AP and block that port.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.580
Doing this will allow the original device to use its correct IP address

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.249
without the second device vying for it.

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.169
Instead of doing this manually,

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:15.829
why not have IPAM do it for you?

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.449
