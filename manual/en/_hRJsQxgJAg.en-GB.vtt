Hello. 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.200
My name is
Charlie McDonnell,  

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.640
and this is my
dance recess. 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.480
Thank you.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:39.000
HEAVY BREATHING

STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.190
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.190
Thank you very much for
watching whatever that was. 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.400
This video was inspired by
Linda's video titled  

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.880
"How to Take a Dance Recess,"
so you better watch that too. 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.850
Todd, who wrote this song,
is selling it on iTunes  

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.530
if you'd like to purchase
it from him,  

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.660
and maybe even do your own
little dance recess if you'd like to. 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.220
I think that'd be fun, but you are
by no means obliged. 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.630
Thank you for taking me
seriously as a filmmaker. 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.420
Goodbye.
