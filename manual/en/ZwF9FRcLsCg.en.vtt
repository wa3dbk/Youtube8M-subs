00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.169
NO MATTER WHO BECOMES INDIA'S
NEXT PRIME MINISTER, THEIR

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:04.671
ELECTION WILL HAVE GLOBAL
CONSEQUENCES.

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:05.839
OUR OWN JASON JONES HAS MORE.

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.642
&gt;&gt; Jason: INDIA IS HAVING AN
ELECTION. AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.444
TOLD IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PLACE TO
VISIT. BUT I'D RATHER AVOID

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:14.848
DYSENTERY IN 120 DEGREE
WEATHER. SO INSTEAD I WENT

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:22.089
TO THE INDIA CONSULATE IN NEW
YORK AND MET WITH AMBASSADOR --

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:28.695
(MISPRONOUNCING NAME) -- I MET
WITH THE AMBASSADOR.

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.297
MR. AMBASSADOR, I AM NOT AT ALL
EMBARASSED TO ADMIT THAT I KNOW

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.164
NOTHING ABOUT INDIA.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.165
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
TO START.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.534
&gt;&gt; I HEAR YOU GUYS
ARE HAVING A LITTLE ELECTION.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.669
&gt;&gt; YES. INDIA IS ACTUALLY THE
GREATEST DEMOCRACY IN THE
WORLD.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.603
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT'S THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:37.671
THAT IS THE GREATEST
DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.872
&gt;&gt; NO, HOW DO YOU DEFINE IT?

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:43.043
&gt;&gt; Jason: OH, I DON'T KNOW, 121
MILLION PEOPLE VOTING IN OUR

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:43.977
LAST ELECTION.

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.812
&gt;&gt; AND WE HAVE 814 MILLION
REGISTERED VOTERS.

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:50.651
&gt;&gt; Jason: OK, BUT THAT'S,
THAT'S, THAT'S IN RUPEES.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:51.852
HOW MANY IN AMERICAN?

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.086
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE DON'T CONVERT
PEOPLE INTO RUPEES AND DOLLARS.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.589
&gt;&gt; I KNOW WHY YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT US BECAUSE WE'RE THE BEST.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:58.192
BUT, WHY DON'T WE KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU?

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.761
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND INDIA IN ONE LIFE.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:05.632
A PERSON SAY FROM TAMIL
NADU IN THE SOUTH WOULD NOT

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.134
UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF
SOMEBODY IN THE NORTHEAST.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:11.205
MY WIFE OFTEN THINKS WHEN I SAY
NO, SHE THINK IT'S YES.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.340
&gt;&gt; Jason: HOW DO YOU SAY NO?

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.341
&gt;&gt; I SAY IT LIKE THIS.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.676
&gt;&gt; Jason: WHAT, YOU SAY NO LIKE
THIS?

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.110
&gt;&gt; SO, NOW ACTUALLY YOU'RE
CONFUSING ME.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.045
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.547
&gt;&gt; Jason: YOU DON'T REMEMBER
HOW YOU SAY NO?

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.117
&gt;&gt; AT ONE LEVEL INDIA IS
VERY CONFUSING, AT

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:25.586
ANOTHER LEVEL IT'S
VERY, VERY FASCINATING.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.653
&gt;&gt; Jason: WELL, AMBASSADOR, IF
YOUR ELECTIONS ARE SO

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:31.258
FASCINATING THEN
WHY IS THIS ALL I CAN FIND ABOUT

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.660
INDIA ON AMERICAN TELEVISION?

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:37.097
&gt;&gt; GOOD RICE, GOOD CURRY, GOOD
GANDHI, LET'S HURRY.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.732
&gt;&gt; THE COVERAGE HERE IS,
I WOULD SAY, LOPSIDED.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.835
IT DOESN'T CAPTURE THE
COMPLEXITY, IT DOESN'T CAPTURE

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.737
THE ENTHUSIASM OF INDIAN PEOPLE.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.507
IT'S, IT'S, IT'S SOMETHING THAT
YOU MUST SEE TO BELIEVE.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.843
&gt;&gt; Jason: PLEASE DO NOT DARE
ME TO GO TO INDIA.

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:51.745
&gt;&gt; THIS IS REALLY A FASCINATING
ELECTION.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.247
&gt;&gt; Jason: DON'T MAKE ME GO TO
INDIA.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.014
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU MUST GO.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.282
&gt;&gt; Jason: BUT, I DON'T WANT TO
GO.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.751
&gt;&gt; SITTING BEHIND A DESK IN THE
U.S., AND

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.455
APPRECIATING OR UNDERSTANDING
INDIAN ELECTIONS IS ALMOST NEXT

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.256
TO IMPOSSIBLE.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.790
&gt;&gt; Jason: OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,
PAL?

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:07.327
I AM GOING TO GO FIND SOMEONE
WHO IS WILLING TO TRAVEL TO

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:08.128
INDIA.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:08.795
&gt;&gt; YOU BETTER GO. YOU BETTER GO.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.797
&gt;&gt; Jason: I'M NOT GOING.

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:11.965
&gt;&gt; YOU BETTER GO.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.336
&gt;&gt; Jason: LUCKILY, I KNEW
SOMEONE WHO LOVED INDIA.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.704
(KNOCKING)

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:18.705
GUESS WHAT? WHO THE (bleep) ARE
YOU?

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.012
&gt;&gt; HI, I'M JORDAN.

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:29.316
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DON'T CARE. WHERE'S
MANDVI?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.717
&gt;&gt; HE'S HAS AN HBO SHOW.

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.353
&gt;&gt; Jason: WELL, GOOD NEWS. YOU
ARE GOING TO INDIA.

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:34.788
&gt;&gt; OH, I CAN'T. I'M A RACIST.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:35.722
&gt;&gt; Jason: JESSICA.

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.191
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T. I'M RACIST, TOO.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:41.061
&gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO
INDIA, HAVE A NICE TRIP.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.964
&gt;&gt; I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
TO COME TO INDIA. YOU KNOW,

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.801
I'M PRETTY HUNGRY. LET'S GO GRAB
SOME CHILLED MONKEY BRAINS.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.736
IS THAT RACIST, BY THE WAY?

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.109
(MUSIC)
&gt;&gt; OKAY, LET'S AVOID THAT CIVIL

00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:56.977
WAR.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.645
NO, NO, CAN'T FLY IN THEIR
AIRSPACE.

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.180
WHOA, TOO MANY DRONES THERE.

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:05.018
THERE WE GO. DELHI.
JUST ONE LOOK AT THE CHAOS OF

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:09.756
INDIA'S CAPITAL CITY AND IT
WAS CLEAR THERE WAS NO WAY THIS

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.526
DEMOCRACY COULD EQUAL
OURS. FOR EXAMPLE,

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.729
IN THE U.S. YOU ARE FREE TO
CHOOSE ONE OF TWO PARTIES AND IN

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.098
INDIA YOU HOLY (bleep) THERE'S A
LOT OF CHOICES.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:22.836
OK, BUT IN AMERICA, A STAGGERING
23% OF OUR YOUTH PLAN ON VOTING

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.304
IN OUR NEXT ELECTIONS.

00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:27.841
MATCH THAT, INDIA.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.776
&gt;&gt; AS YOU KNOW 60 YEARS WE HAVE
BEEN WITH THE CONGRESS PARTY,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.013
WE'RE TRYING SOMETHING
NEW THIS TIME.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.616
&gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE 15 YEARS OLD AND
YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT
POLITICS.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.050
&gt;&gt; YES, WE DO BECAUSE IT IS OUR
FUTURE.

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.886
&gt;&gt; REALLY? YOU GUYS ALL CARE
ABOUT POLITICS?

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.053
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:45.492
&gt;&gt; YES, OF COURSE I CARE
ABOUT POLITICS BECAUSE OUR

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:46.527
FUTURE DEPENDS ON US SO WE
CARE A LOT ABOUT POLITICS.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.496
&gt;&gt; YOU CARE THAT MUCH YOU
DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE THAT

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.464
MOTORCYCLE.

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.099
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:54.801
&gt;&gt; WOW. AND WITH 150 MILLION
FIRST-TIME VOTERS, MAYBE INDIA'S

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.203
YOUTH IS A LITTLE MORE
ENGAGED THAN OURS.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.806
BUT IN AMERICA, OUR POLITICIANS
KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO EACH

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.841
COLOR-CODED GROUP.

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:04.144
&gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU
DADDY YANKEE.

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:05.612
&gt;&gt; WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:06.413
WHO?

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.414
WHO?

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:11.618
&gt;&gt; SO, INDIA, DOES YOUR
DEMOCRACY PANDER TO ITS

00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:12.853
MINORITIES?

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:17.291
I'M LOOKING FOR MINORITIES --
PEOPLE WHO LOOK -- MINORITIES --

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:21.328
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT IS YOUR
MINORITY HERE?

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:22.863
HEY PAL, YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:23.630
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:24.398
&gt;&gt; Jason: YOU DO. OKAY. WHAT'S
UH,

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.467
WHAT DO MINORITIES LOOK LIKE
HERE?

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:27.935
&gt;&gt; YOU.

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:30.571
&gt;&gt; Jason: LIKE ME?

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:31.638
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:33.440
&gt;&gt; Jason: OH YES. WHY AM I
ASKING THE QUESTIONS THEN?

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.743
HERE, YOU TAKE IT. I'LL TAKE
THAT.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:37.211
HERE, LET'S, LET'S SWAP THEM.

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:49.690
JUST READ THEM.

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:51.859
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE WHITE PEOPLE SO FAT?

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:52.860
&gt;&gt; Jason: WHAT?

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:55.329
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE, WHY ARE WHITE PEOPLE
SO FAT?

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:56.864
&gt;&gt; Jason: NO, I HEARD YOU. IT'S
JUST VERY OFFENSIVE.

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.866
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE WHITE PEOPLE SO LAZY?

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.802
&gt;&gt; Jason: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT!

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:04.204
&gt;&gt; I HAVE 30 OTHERS, DO YOU WANT
ME TO KEEP GOING?

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:05.339
&gt;&gt; Jason: NO. I DON'T WANT YOU
TO KEEP GOING.

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:08.876
IS THAT WHAT THIS INTERVIEW IS
ALL ABOUT? TO MAKE ME LOOK

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.110
FOOLISH AS A MINORITY?

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.011
THE INTERVIEW IS OVER.

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:13.514
BUT, THE REAL WORK IS BEGINNING.

00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:17.084
BECAUSE EVERYWHERE I WENT IN
INDIA, EVERYONE HAD AN OPINION

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.085
ON POLITICS.

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:19.319
&gt;&gt; EVERY PERSON'S
ASPIRATION, EVERY SINGLE VOTE.

00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:21.889
&gt;&gt; Jason: YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE
ALL THAT BUT I'VE GOT A LONG,

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:22.890
LONG LINE OF GUYS I'VE GOT TO
GET TO.

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:23.757
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.893
EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
POLITICS.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.060
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:27.895
&gt;&gt; Jason: OF COURSE, YOU ALSO
WANT TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS.

00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:29.796
&gt;&gt; -- LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.136
AND IN A COUNTRY WITH
1.2 BILLION PEOPLE, 780 OFFICIAL

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.340
LANGUAGES AND 330 MILLION HINDU
GODS, CUTTING THROUGH THE NOISE

00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:43.977
WAS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE.

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:44.077
&gt;&gt; Jon: JASON JONES, WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK!
