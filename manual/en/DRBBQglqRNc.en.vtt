[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.290
The next step for us is actually
work down this timeline.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.452
Take the current menu,
the new concept ideas,

00:00:27.452 --> 00:00:29.660
and we're going to blend
them together into team 2.0.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.530
Yeah, let's do it.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.330
That's called Hot Dog in a
Hallway, fireman's pole--

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.620
down into a pit of water.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.490
It's fun.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.240
It's high.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.620
It's going to challenge
your fear of heights.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.078
Everyone loves sliding down a
fire pole, but there's really

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:42.090
not that many chances in
everyday life to do it.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.006
It's called Birth Canal,
and the idea is to go

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:48.240
through a very small, tight channel
where you're compressed on all sides.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.562
And then you birth out of the other
side, hence the name "Birth Canal.

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.020
When I was a kid, my brother
used to pin me down like that.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.180
He'd throw a blanket over me
and press it down on all sides,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.770
and I'd have to try to squirm out--

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.520
terrifying.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.920
I think we have the opportunity to do
the same thing to our participants.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.440
I definitely think Everest
has a spot in the 2015 menu.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.260
If we want to take it
to the next level, we

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.070
have to change the profile
of the obstacle, something

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.680
like a waterfall actually coming
off the top of the obstacle.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.600
And what I'm thinking is we
try two different profiles,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.015
a curved back feature on Everest.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.090
So you're actually running up, and
you have to reach overhead to grab it.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.190
The second feature is
going to be a rounded top.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.376
So you actually have to go up and
crown over the top slightly and then

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:24.750
have your team help you that way.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.650
What you're suggesting
is there's no ledge?

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.410
It's just round?

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.370
Yeah, basically.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.440
My recommendation for
Walk The Plank iteration

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.510
is a rope swing off of it-- taking
that same obstacle that we have in Walk

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.350
the Plank, add in an element
of both fun and tough to it.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.680
Never done anything like this before,
and nobody's doing anything like this.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.210
And I think a lot of people want
the experience of like a rope swing.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.000
We should be that outlet
for people to say,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.480
I want to go do Tough Mudders because
I want to do badass rope swings.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.670
Yeah.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.560
It's one of those things that
no one really wants to do,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.700
but they sort of want to do it.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.241
And they definitely want to tell
people that they've done it.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:02:00.632
So it's Cry Baby, where we
plan to tear gas people.

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:01.840
So we know what we want here.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.230
We want it to be highly visual.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.456
We want it to be a very intense
experience that really hits people.

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:09.330
We've been thinking through a little
bit what chemicals we might use.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
We spoke to some of the people in
the office that are ex-military,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.390
people at research universities,
people in Brazil who

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.100
make an alternative to pepper spray.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.640
But we have to be very
cognizant of side effects.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.710
We want this to be like a quick
hit but the full experience

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.250
of that being tear gassed is like
without the long-term somewhat

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.422
dangerous effects.

00:02:27.422 --> 00:02:29.380
First things first, we've
got to find that gas.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.870
So we have to find the
gas we're going to use,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.150
and then we can find a way
to make this thing work.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.010
The goal really is get it into the air--

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.960
get it into a visible cloud of smoke.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.090
You're essentially saying,
if you want to continue

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.160
to call yourself a Tough
Mudder, we're going

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.157
to have this new thing, this tear gas.

00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:46.115
And you're going to have to make the
same decision when you hit Electro

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:47.610
Shock or when you hit Arctic Enema.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.877
This year, I'm going to punch
my card as a Tough Mudder

00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:52.710
again because those
bastards at Tough Mudder

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.170
came up with something completely new.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.830
I think it's sick, but I like it.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.880
