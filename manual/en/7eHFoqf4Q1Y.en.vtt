00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.270
I'm now going to show you
Max Factor's latest statement

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.290
making beauty product-- Lash
Extension Effect Mascara.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.410
This product allows you to create
an ultra feminine long lash effect.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.050
It follows in the footsteps of Max
Factor's hugely successful Masterpiece

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.630
and False Lash Effect Mascaras.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.010

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.840
Firstly, the reason the
Lash Extension Effect

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.920
makes lashes appear
so dramatically longer

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.590
looking is due to its state
of the art tapered wand, which

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.340
enables you to get right into the
corner lashes, as well as the roots.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.240
Secondly, the wand has bristles
just at its tip, enabling

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.720
it to grip the lashes, especially at the
outer corner of the eye where they tend

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.240
to be thinner and lighter in color.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.390
Thirdly, Lash Extension Effect Mascara
has an effective liquid lash formula

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330
which is new to Max Factor.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.945
It contains real nylon
lash extension fibers.

00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:07.790
So now I'm going to show you the
best technique in getting the longest

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.490
lashes with this mascara.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.300
So sweep the tip of the mascara wand
backwards and forwards over the lashes.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.170
It'll look a little bit chaotic
until you start bringing

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.510
the lashes in a downward direction.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.040
And the little latex bristles really
pull and define each lash down

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.700
so it really gives a lovely
lengthening finishing to them.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.980
We're going to go to the top.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.481
It's really important on the
angle that you pull the lashes.

00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:33.105
Think of it like blow drying your hair.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:34.689
You blow dry your hair in a direction.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.521
You really need to be
quite directional when

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:38.717
you're putting mascara on
your lashes to really make

00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:40.300
sure you get that lovely almond shape.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.480
And you'll find that you'll get
a really, really lovely effect,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.814
very subtle effect, by
just using the one coat.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.730
If you want to do another coat, say
if you're going out in the evening

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.940
and you want to really,
really full on eye look

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.470
but nothing that's really
clumped or heavy, than quickly

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.260
put on a second coat
just before it dries.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.010
And there you are.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.170
Beautiful, dramatic lashes that will
get you noticed without any drama.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.520
