00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.069
 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.490
Hey everyone! So a while ago I mentioned that
I would have a new

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.530
book haul when my books arrived and they're
here!

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
Yay! So I recently found out about Better
World Books

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.980
a company that donates a matched amount to
your purchase

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.470
to charities, including it to help raise
literacy,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.430
get books to those who need them, and
funding education programs.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.430
They will also carbon balance the shipping of your books for a small fee.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.550
They often have great sales and you can
get some

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.640
pretty incredible titles. A few weeks ago
they were having

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.559
their bargin bin sale, where you can get four books for ten dollars

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.899
shipping completely free. And these are
no crappy

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.170
unheard of ghost written books. So it's a
really great deal and I really recommend

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.620
you check out their site.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.850
And follow them on Facebook. And no, I'm
not mean sponsored or anything I just

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.699
really genuinely think that this is a
great company

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.719
that diserves your support and attention
if you don't already know about them.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.180
So on to the books! For the first one I
decided to buy a book that I have read

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.140
before and loved but don't so I bought

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.289
The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. I read this
about a year ago

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.740
last summer and I absolutely loved it.
It's long

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.820
but well-written and completely original
and fascinating.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.850
It revolves around Howard Roark, an
architect

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.320
and a woman, and the buildings
that he designs.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.289
The book and characters are examples of Ayn
Rand's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.549
political theory called Objectivism

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.929
which is too confusing for me to explain
here so if you're interested you should

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.170
definitely look it up.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.359
I love architecture and the book takes
off

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.189
when Roark leaves school for architecture
to start working in the real world, so

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.689
it's definitely something that I
relate at this point in my life.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.210
for the other three books I went with ones
that I haven't read yet but really

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.929
wanted to.

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.420
So the first one is what I think is a
first edition copyof A Walk to Remember.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.600
You've probably heard of this, it's by Nicholas
Sparks

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.860
obviously, and it's a really great movie
that I absolutely love.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.390
But I haven't read the book yet so this
was definitely a must-have.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.610
Next is The Bermudez Triangle by

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.940
Maureen Johnson. I've read 13 Little Blue
Envelopes and its sequel

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.990
and I read The Name of the Star and
Let It Snow, and I really love Maureen

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.770
Johnson

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.360
and if you don't follow her on
Twitter you absolutely need to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.250
because it's just amazing. If you don't know about this book,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.920
it's basically about 3 girl best friends.
One leaves for camp

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.430
for 10 weeks and the other two kiss

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.720
so it should be an interesting read. The
last of the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.850
four books from Better World Books is The Virgin
Suicides

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.230
by Jeffrey Eugenides. I saw the movie
a few years ago and thought that it was

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.810
great

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.190
and I wanted to read the book ever since.
It's the kind of movie that you see

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.220
and you think "wow that book must be

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.490
brilliant." It's about these four sisters who
are held captive in their

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.950
own home and it's told from the
perspective of

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.630
a few neighborhood boys who come to

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.120
obsess over the girls. All three of
these books have

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.420
pretty big print so I could probably
read each of them in a

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.100
day. I didn't have any say over the
covers or

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.800
if it was in paperback or not so I'm
actually pretty surprised that I got

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.260
this

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.650
first edition hardback, and I probably
wouldn't have chosen the movie tie-in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.550
version of

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.140
The Virgin Suicides but who doesn't like
a picture of Kiersten Dunst lying in the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.990
grass right?

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.210
Now there's one more book that someone
lent to

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.290
me. It's Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.630
It's a true war story and written by the
same author as Seabiscuit

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.950
which I haven't read or seen but I hear
that this is really good.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.770
My aunt who lent it to me said that she
doesn't usually like war stories but she

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.870
really loved this

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.310
so I'll take her word for it and check
it out.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.850
Rather I won't take her word for it...

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.620
So, five books in all, I'd say

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.200
a pretty good haul. In fact I've had to
do a bit of rearranging on my shelves because

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.230
I'm already running out of space

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.110
but now I've got a bit of room to grow on my shelves
so I'm all set.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.610
So if you have read any of these books
let me know what you thought

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.490
and thanks for watching, bye!

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.740
It's Unbroken by Laura Hildenbrand

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.950
Hillen..brand. It's Unbroken by Lauren Hillenbrand...

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.740
no it's not Laura! Oh my god!
