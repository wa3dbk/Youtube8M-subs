00:00:00.474 --> 00:00:03.710
(upbeat music)

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.680
- Robots exist to do our vile biddings.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.132
I mean, that's why we created them.

00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:09.452
So in this episode,
we're going to go through

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:13.828
six through ten on our list
of top ten dirty robot jobs.

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:16.826
(eerie music)

00:00:16.826 --> 00:00:19.727
Now, this robot kind of
looks like a cow's butt,

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:22.964
chiefly because it exists
solely to simulate the anatomy

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:24.372
of a cow's rectum.

00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:26.849
Invented by veterinarian
and computer scientist

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.978
Sarah Baillie of Bristol
University Veterinary School,

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:32.956
the haptic cow is a high-tech
teaching instrument.

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.218
See, in order to diagnose pregnancy

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:37.566
or any number of infections,
you're going to have to

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.114
reach into the cow's rear,
get right up in there,

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:42.785
and palpate the animal's
ovaries, stomach, and uterus.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.492
As you might imagine, however,
it's rather dark and cramped

00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:48.222
inside of a cow, so veterinary
schools have always faced

00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:51.306
a challenge in teaching proper palpation.

00:00:51.306 --> 00:00:53.272
The haptic cow uses
touch feedback technology

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:55.986
to simulate the internal
organs of a female cow,

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:58.791
so students can now feel
inside of the faux farm animal,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.071
they can check their hand
position on a computer screen,

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:05.181
and overall hone their skills
at bovine rectal examination.

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.841
Now, most sperm donors manage
to produce their specimens

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:10.490
via good old-fashioned manual stimulation.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.642
But if that doesn't work
for ya, there's always

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:14.248
the sperm-collector robot

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:16.214
from China's Sanwe Medical Group.

00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:18.565
This lovely pink and
white robot is designed

00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:21.839
for, quote, "semen collection
and premature ejaculation

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:23.635
desensitization training."

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:26.277
And it carries out both
tasks via a throbbing,

00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:28.307
quote, "sperm collection g-barrel."

00:01:28.307 --> 00:01:31.115
The patient merely inserts
his penis into the machine,

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:33.782
which simulates the human
vagina while providing

00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:35.445
sexually arousing sights and sounds

00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:37.098
on a built-in LCD screen.

00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:38.929
The resulting ejaculate then flows

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.698
into a semen collection sheath.

00:01:40.698 --> 00:01:42.373
This robot debuted at China's

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:45.222
International Medical
Equipment Fair in Shenzhen

00:01:45.222 --> 00:01:47.448
back in 2011, but it hasn't quite taken

00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:50.275
the world by storm just yet.

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:51.258
Give it time.

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:54.151
Meet Groundhog, Cave
Crawler, and Gemini Scout.

00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:56.682
Sure, they may look like
souped-up mud-caked four wheelers,

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:59.798
but these bad boys are
certified mine explorers.

00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:02.197
See, mines, especially abandoned mines,

00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:03.987
are dangerous and dirty places.

00:02:03.987 --> 00:02:05.549
They're prone to cave-ins and bursts

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.115
of searing, poisonous gasses.

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:09.859
So we've got to get a robot in there.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.281
Groundhog is the eldest of the trio,

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:14.177
developed by Carnegie Mellon
University's Robotics Institute

00:02:14.177 --> 00:02:16.742
to navigate unmapped mines with lasers.

00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:19.651
The same researchers followed
up on this success in 2007

00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:21.603
with Cave Crawler, a smaller unit capable

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:24.479
of autonomously exploring
subterranean depths and

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.594
testing for dangerous gasses
without a single tether

00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:29.157
back to the surface world.

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:33.501
Then in 2011, Sandia National
Labs unveiled Gemini Scout,

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:36.109
which could navigate
sand pits, rubble piles,

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.229
450 degree climbs and depths
of up to 18 inches of water

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:41.645
all in a lightless mine.

00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:44.270
Armored casings protect its
electronics from explosions,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.490
and prevents its circuitry
from igniting flammable gasses.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.288
It even carries food
and oxygen tanks to take

00:02:50.288 --> 00:02:51.866
to potentially trapped miners.

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.034
Meet the ghoulish Virtobot.

00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:55.338
She performs virtual
autopsies at Switzerland's

00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:58.072
University of Bern's
Institute of Forensic Medicine

00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:00.933
as well as the United
States Dover Air Force Base.

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:02.584
What does virtual autopsy mean?

00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:05.088
Why it means Virtobot leaves the bone saws

00:03:05.088 --> 00:03:06.942
and cadaver shears to the humans,

00:03:06.942 --> 00:03:09.369
relying instead on stereo cameras

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.720
and a computerized tomography scanner.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.965
She records the corpse's
external conditions

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:17.400
with the cameras, and maps its
insides with that CT scanner.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.717
The result, a complete 3D
computer model of the deceased.

00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:23.619
And now there's even a Virtobot 2.0.

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:27.625
The last robot on our
list really has a bum rap.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.446
Now when the Cyclone Power Technologies

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:31.459
and Robotic Technologies Incorporated

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.746
first announced its energetically
autonomous tactical robot,

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.096
or EATR project back in 2009,

00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:39.196
the media had a field day with it.

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:41.518
Headlines full of corpse-munching
battlefield robots

00:03:41.518 --> 00:03:43.003
spread across the internet,

00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:46.301
despite the fact that EATR
is actually a vegetarian.

00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:50.041
Despite this nasty reputation,
this bot essentially mimics

00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:52.087
the fuel system of a common donkey.

00:03:52.087 --> 00:03:54.659
It eats grass, it transforms
that grass into energy.

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.732
Only instead of digesting
biomass, EATR burns it

00:03:57.732 --> 00:04:00.282
in a combustion chamber to generate power

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:03.450
for its rugged wheels and
vegetation-shredding limbs.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.021
But who knows that the
future will bring, right?

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.940
I mean, some Japanese mortuaries
depend on robotic systems

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.842
to store and retrieve urns
for visiting family members.

00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:14.296
Robots like Virtobot already
assist in our mortuary duties.

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.050
And while biomass consuming robots

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.922
are still a developing technology,

00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:20.764
the idea of corpse-based
energy is nothing new.

00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:23.853
In 2011, Britain's Durham
Crematorium even announced

00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:27.818
plans to install turbines in
its burners to generate energy.

00:04:27.818 --> 00:04:29.227
So what do you think
about a possible future

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.774
full of sperm-collecting
robots and corpse-based energy?

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:34.052
Let me know, I'd love to hear from you.
