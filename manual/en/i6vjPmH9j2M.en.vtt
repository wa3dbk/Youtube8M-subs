I'm Marc Kuchner, a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.150
Flight Center, and I work on understanding distant planetary systems.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.180
A major quest of astronomers during the past 30 years

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.210
has been to discover exoplanets and learn how they form. One strategy

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.250
is to search for lots of young stars still surrounded by protoplanetary disks

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.310
and debris disks. These clouds of gas, rock,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.440
ice, and dust, are the same types of environments that gave rise to our

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.530
own solar system. From 2010 to 2011,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.640
NASA's WISE mission scanned the entire infrared sky

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
and captured beautiful imagery. I'm most excited about this imagery

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.730
because of all the new disks we can find in it. The WISE

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.760
mission imaged about half a billion objects all over the sky. Only a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.850
few of these sources might actually be stars with disks, but we can't find them

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.950
with computer software because the clues are too subtle. The human eye can

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.970
sort things out, but it would take years for astronomers to visually evaluate

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.050
all the possible sources. That's why NASA and Zooniverse

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.080
are launching Disk Detective, a new citizen science project.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.140
At DiskDetective.org, you'll see animated flipbooks of 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.240
images from the WISE All-Sky survey and other projects.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Some images show protoplanetary and debris disks--the homes of

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.290
extrasolar planets. Others contain galaxies, asteroids,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.370
nebulae and other objects. When you go to the site and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.390
classify objects, you'll be helping me and other NASA scientists

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.480
figure out which is which. DiskDetective.org

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.490
is a NASA-led crowdsourcing project whose main goal is to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.530
produce publishable scientific results. The disks we find together

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.570
will be future targets for telescopes like Hubble and the James Webb Space

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.650
Telescope, which will search for patterns in the disks, and for 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.740
extrasolar planets they may contain. We hope you'll join us.
