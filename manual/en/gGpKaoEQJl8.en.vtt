00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
did you know that the Bible is just full of beautiful stories

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Stories did you say stories do tell us one first sing a song for me

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that was beautiful children you deserve a beautiful story I want you to listen

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
carefully because there will be a question at the end

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
oh we know that we love that part it's like a game for us

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I always loose I am sure that you will win someday

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
yes all right then today's story is about Jesus the Son of God

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
once Jesus asked his followers

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
how do people say I am if you said some say you're John the Baptist

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the others said some say you're Elijah or one of the other prophets

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Jesus then asked who do you think I am

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Simon said you're Christ the Son of God Jesus said

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
good for you Simon for only God could have told you this

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
from today you will be called Peter you will be the rock on which I will build my church

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
soon Jesus took his followers on high mountain to pray

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
suddenly Jesus changed in front of them his face shone like the Sun and his clothes became white in color

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Moses and Alijah over by his side a bright cloud covered them a voice from heaven said

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
this is my son who makes me happy always

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
listen to him the followers were scared and hid their faces

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
when they finally looked up again only Jesus was standing there

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Jesus touched them and said come stand up

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
don't be scared as they came down from the mountain Jesus said

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
don't tell anyone what do you saw till I raise from death

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that was amazing wasn't it want to hear what happens next

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The question now what was the new name given to Simon by Jesus

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I know Peter  that is right  Now  gumbo let's all sing and be happy
