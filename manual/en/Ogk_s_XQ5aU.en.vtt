Hello, welcome everybody. My name is Lars
Erik Robinson, my company is LarsEr Arts "All

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:09.850
Around Art-tainment", I'm a freelance illustrator,
I've been in the business about fifteen years.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.990
Today, I thought about talking about how do
you hold an airbrush gun and what different

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.530
techniques you can create by different positions
against your surface of your work. The typical

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.641
way of holding your airbrush gun is holding
your hand in a cup fashion and keeping your

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:32.529
hand sturdy. This is especially good if you
try to do detail work. So, if you hold your

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.059
hand like this, you can go. It's really easy
just to be able to create your artwork like

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.370
that and create lines evenly. Another good
way to do it is if you trying to create Mountains,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.350
for example, or you're trying to create sun
affect, hold it to the side like that, helps

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:02.469
you to create different affects in the sky.
Sometimes when you see that Scandinavian sunset,

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:10.470
you could hold it like this and you can create
that wave without using a stencil. Of course,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.710
you can use a stencil under that and when
you use stencils, you just hold it straight

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.440
against it like that and just try to keep
it flat and go right up against it. You can

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.430
cut these in different angles like if I was
just going to do a rip effect, that would

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:40.539
give you texture.
Once again, you hold the airbrush flat like

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:55.810
that and if you stroke it out, if you stroke
out with it, that gives you the sun effect

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.549
too. If you notice I'm going like that, that
helps it. So, for example, if I wanted to

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:15.060
have another effect like that, you notice
that it's small on one side and bigger on

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.550
the other, gives it a squirting effect. So,
those are all different ways you could do

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:33.490
it and then you just play around with it.
Hold it back, you get big sprays, if you hold

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:43.450
it further back. How am I creating that? I'm
actually pushing down and pulling back. There

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.600
you go, that's a little creativity for you.
How to hold the airbrush gun, hope that helps

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.459
you out. Keep airbrushing.
