00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.490
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper method to remove, replace, and diagnose

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.830
a turn signal bulb and socket on a 91 Ford
Explorer. In this step we're going to talk

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.929
about the proper service procedure for testing
the integrity of our wiring using a test light.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.900
We're going to check the positive and negative
side of the wires inside here through the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.869
headlight, which is going to turn on the parking
light portion of this socket through the turn

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.210
signal and through the hazard flasher portion
of the socket. I have an assistant in the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.020
vehicle who's going to go ahead and turn on
the left turn signal. I'm checking the ground

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
side. What I do is have my test light hooked
up to the positive part of the battery and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.050
I'm going to check the wires and see if my
ground circuit has its integrity. This is

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.361
the ground circuit here and as you can see
it lights up. That means that all of the wiring

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:57.430
from here all the way through the switch and
back to the battery is good. I'm going to

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.500
go ahead and switch my test light from the
positive to the negative side and we're going

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.230
to check the positive side of the circuitry,
where the power is sent. As you can see my

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.090
light lights up. What that does is indicates
that the same thing as the ground did, from

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.080
here all the way through the switch and back
to the battery including the relays of the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.590
flasher all the integrity is there. You can
also use a known good bulb. If you got a brand

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.630
new bulb from the parts store and you don't
have a test light you can plug in a know good

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.340
bulb as you can see it's flashing properly.
I'm going to have my assistant step in and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.560
go through the various functions. This bulb
does have two elements in it. Go ahead and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.649
hit the hazard. There's the hazard portion
of it. The turn signal and the hazard use

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.180
the same element, but a different switch.
Go ahead shut off the hazard and turn on the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.840
head lights. That is the marker light portion
of it, as you can see there's two elements

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.130
inside there. The other one is lit up. That
is the proper way to check all the wiring,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.750
relays, switches, and flashers in your turn
signal system.
