MATT:OK.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.260
Today's question comes from One
Jus, or One J U S, who didn't

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.700
get the memo about using your
real name whenever

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.750
asking questions.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.280
But the question was
quite interesting.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.300
It comes from
Newbury, Berkshire.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.930
"Hi Matt.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.080
With the recent news about
website speed being included in

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.610
the Google metrics, how will
Google allow for slow third

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.405
party ad servers, including
AdWords, dragging a

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:23.870
site's load speed down?

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.830
For example, Ad Server on
load: five seconds versus Ad

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.970
Server off: sub one second."

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.410
It's a great question.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.670
The rough way to think
about it is this.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.310
Well there's a couple
things you need to know.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.725
First think about it in terms
of what happens up until

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:39.440
the on load event.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.160
So there are a lot of ways
where you can do asynchronous

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.650
JavaScript to make sure that
things happen after

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.810
the on load event.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.320
For example, Google Analytics
recently just introduced

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.990
code which will handle
things asynchronously.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.990
So you don't have to worry any
more about, OK this request

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.040
goes off, and it happens
after the on load event.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.120
So the on load event is a good
way to think about what needs

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.540
to happen before users are able
to interact with the page.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.740
What is the totality of
everything happening before

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.040
they're able to start clicking
on things, or see what the page

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.940
layout really looks like and
start interacting with it?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.770
So you can do these sort of
asynchronous JavaScript tricks.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.570
The other thing to keep in mind
is that the vast majority of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.150
people really won't
have a problem.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.540
A lot of people were really
worried about page speed.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.660
And they were saying, oh I'm
worried this will be much

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.460
more important than
the actual content.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.770
And that's not the case.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.260
It's one of over 200
different signals.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.510
The content and the reputation
definitely matters a lot more

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.390
than just the pure page speed.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.720
So whenever you're thinking
about it, unless you're really

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.900
an outlier and you're one of
the slowest sites, it's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.860
not going to be the
deciding factor.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.460
That's not the sort of
thing that you necessarily

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.950
have to worry about.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.580
But if you do want to pay
attention to it, you can do

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.440
these sort of asynchronous
calls like Google

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.600
Analytics does.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.350
And I think a lot of ad servers
will probably support this more

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.440
in the future, such that the on
load event can happen, and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.890
then things can show up
afterward if they need to.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.650
And users don't have to wait
around seeing a slow loading

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.430
page sort of situation.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.810
So, again, a lot of people
always think about how is page

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.280
speed going to affect things.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.790
Do what's right for your users,
and think about how it's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.110
going to work in general.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.130
But for most situations,
you really don't need

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.110
to worry that much.
