00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.020
Friday September 6th, 1901.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.040
The Pan-American Exposition

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.740
-which had made Buffalo the focus of the world's
attention since its opening that May-

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.640
was nearing an end.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.830
On this day

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.140
-as President William McKinley hosted a public
reception in the Temple of Music-

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.939
tragedy struck.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.480
A man named Leon Czolgosz approached the president,
as if to shake his hand.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.070
Czolgosz, however, had concealed a handgun
in a handkerchief,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.829
and shot President McKinley twice before he
was overpowered.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.739
Surgery on the president was quickly performed,

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.420
but only one of the bullets was found and
removed.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.870
Following the operation, McKinley was moved
to a private home to recuperate.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.140
Vice President Theodore Roosevelt traveled
to Buffalo when he heard of the shooting,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.140
and stayed here at 641 Delaware Avenue, the
home of his friend Ansley Wilcox.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.580
Initial reports concerning President McKinley's
condition were optimistic,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.690
and by Tuesday of the following week,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.300
Roosevelt demonstrated his confidence in the
president's recovery

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.700
by leaving the city of Buffalo.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.080
He journeyed to the Adirondack Mountains to
join his family,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.590
already vacationing there.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.880
Late on Friday, President McKinley's condition
took a turn for the worse.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.450
Word was sent to Vice President Roosevelt.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.810
He was advised to return immediately.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.220
Rushing to Buffalo,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.220
Roosevelt arrived at about 1:30 pm on Saturday,
September 14th, 1901.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.880
President McKinley, however, had died in the
early morning hours of the same day.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.060
Roosevelt was met by Ansley Wilcox at the
train station,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.990
and brought back to the Wilcox home by horse
 &amp; carriage.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.910
Roosevelt was still wearing his camping clothes,
so he borrowed a coat and hat,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.720
before going to express his sympathies to
Mrs. McKinley.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.720
He returned to the Wilcox home about 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, to take the oath of office.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.980
The crowd assembling in the library to witness
the ceremony included cabinet members,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.980
politicians, community leaders, reporters,
and members of the Wilcox family.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.530
At exactly 3:32 pm, Secretary of War, Elihu
Root approached the vice president.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.459
"Mr. vice president, I have been requested
by the cabinet of the late president

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.459
-at least those who are present in Buffalo,
all except two-

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.389
to request -that for reasons of weight effecting
the affairs of government-

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:19.389
that you proceed to take the constitutional
oath of President of the United States."

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.590
"I shall take the oath at once, in accordance
with your request.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.590
And in this hour of deep and terrible bereavement,
I wish to state:

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:40.329
It shall be my aim to continue -absolutely
unbroken-

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.099
the policy of President McKinley

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:52.099
for the peace and prosperity and honor of
our beloved country."

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.849
United States Federal District Court Judge
John R. Hazel

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.909
had been summoned to the Wilcox home to administer
the oath of office.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.060
"Vice President Roosevelt would you raise
your right hand and repeat after me:

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.359
I do solemnly swear"

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.239
"I do solemnly swear"

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.769
"That I will faithfully execute"

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.400
"That I will faithfully execute"

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.380
"the office of President of United States"

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.860
"the office of President of United States"

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.200
"and will to the best of my ability"

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.130
"and will to the best of my ability"

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.910
"preserve, protect, and defend"

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.720
"preserve, protect, and defend"

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.030
"the Constitution of the United States"

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.750
"the Constitution of the United States"

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.850
"And thus I do swear."

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.260
For almost two minutes the new President of
the United States stood silent.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.260
"Mr. President, please attach your signature."

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.820
The 42 year old president then signed the
oath,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.820
which was hand-written on a sheet of parchment.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.220
"I should like to see the members of the cabinet
a few moments after the others have retired."

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.660
In his first cabinet meeting -held immediately-

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.450
Roosevelt requested that McKinley's cabinet
remain in office,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.490
to demonstrate continuity in the government.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.370
To further downplay the impression of a crisis,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.900
it was also decided not to convene a special
session of Congress.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.500
Later in the evening -as per his discussion
with the cabinet-

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.160
Roosevelt declared a national day of mourning
for William McKinley.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.580
This was the fifth time that an American President
had died in office

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.030
and been succeeded by his vice president.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.280
Guided as much by tradition and by precedent
as by law,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.360
Roosevelt had assumed office as President
of the United States.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.650
Though the ceremony was not held in the customary
manner or place

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.850
-and though it lacked the traditional patriotic
pageantry-

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.640
the oath administered had been the same oath
of office

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.690
as repeated by all presidents since George
Washington.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.400
All Constitutional requirements for assuming
office had been met,

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.950
and in a brief, emotional, and subdued ceremony,

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:31.950
a new presidency had begun.
