00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.910
Introducing the Landmann Kentucky smoker,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.999
In this short video we show you:
- the key features of the BBQ

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.000
- A step by step guide on How to correctly
use the Kentucky Smoker

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.910
- &amp; we show the end cooking results

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.500
The Landmann Kentucky smoker is comprised
of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.900
- A smoking chamber
- an easy access door and side vent

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.700
- A thermometer temperature gauge

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.180
- A height adjustable charcoal grid, and warming rack.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.380
- a chimney with ventilation adjustments

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.380
 An easily removable ash tray
- and a removable side shelf

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.710
You may require several accessories when using
a Landmann BBQ…such as

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.470
charcoal starters, wood chips, charcoal (briquettes),
lighting cubes, 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.280
gas lighter, cooking utensils, drip pans &amp; a digital thermometer. 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.800
Prior to cooking we advise soaking your woodchips for at least 30minutes, or overnight. Making sure all the woodchips are submerged.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.060
Starting the BBQ couldn’t be easier, using
our charcoal starter.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.390
Place the charcoal starter within a tray to
avoid damaging the ground.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.510
Now fill the starter to the top using BBQ
briquettes.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.690
Use lighting cubes for a quick and easy fire
start

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.510
Place around 4 lighting cubes onto a safe
surface.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.510
carefully Light the the cubes, placing the
charcoal starter on top of them.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.930
The charcoal should be left for around 10minutes
until the coals turn white.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.010
Meanwhile, prepare your meat, in this case
a pork shoulder. 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.740
Use a BBQ seasoning rub, ensuring the meat is evenly covered as desired.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.920
Once the charcoal is white, carefully tip
the contents into the smoking chamber. 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.360
The coals should be red hot.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.520
Open the chamber vent to allow air circulation.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.260
We also recommend adding a tray of water beneath
the grills of the main compartment, to create

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.230
a steaming affect.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.260
Now ensure the chimney is open.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.000
Allow the temperature to build to around 125
to 160 degrees,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.200
then carefully place the meat on the grill

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.470
To begin the smoking process place a modest
amount of woodchips onto the coals, ensuring

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.770
to close both lids when completed.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.379
After a few minutes you will begin to see
smoke. Note: further coal and woodchips may

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:46.379
need to be added to achieve a cooking time
of 2-4 hours

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.420
Monitor the meats internal temperature using
a digital thermometer, this can be made easier

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.379
with Landmann's wireless version.

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:04.379
The meat should be probed, ensuring it is
of correct internal temperature before serving.

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:23.280
When carving the meat you will notice a crispy
flavoursome outer, a smoke ring, and a moist

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.289
succulent centre throughout.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.429
Serve with your favourite sides and enjoy.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.870
The Kentucky smoker, from Landmann.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.870
