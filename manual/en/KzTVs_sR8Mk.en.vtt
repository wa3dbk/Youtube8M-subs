00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.709
Got A fridge not cooling here

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.339
and you can hear the compressors kicked
on

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:25.169
but you can hear one of the first things to check for is that the fan is not kicking on

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.109
so it could just be that the fan is stuck

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.199
so

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.340
what we're gonna do is  remove this ice tray deal

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.250
just by pushing up here

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.340
and sliding this out and there is two screws on the back that hold the fan channel in

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.410
so I'm gonna remove these two screws here

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.760
and this is one of the first things to check for when you've got a fridge that is not cooling

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.580
check for a stuck fan motor first

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.130
now that may not be the only thing going on

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.390
lift this fan channel up here and slide it out

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.840
ok

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.790
and theres our fan, you can see it's not spinning very fast

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.570
It should be spinning faster than that

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.010
And chances are what it is is that it is too close

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.980
the fan blade is too close

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.580
see how it was rubbing against the back

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.960
and that's why it wasn't spinning very fast

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.330
so what I'm gonna do is pull that forward a little bit more

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.970
it's probably a little bit safer to 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.050
turn the power off first but I'm just gonna get this done

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.570
ok

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.720
I took the whole thing off there

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.720
anyway place this on and now it's out a little bit more and doing what it should now that was keeping the air from being able to blow down into the fridge and the freezer wasn't circulating the air like it should

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.569
behind the fan channel on this side it's got an adjustment here

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.999
you usually don't have to adjust these to much

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:24.999
but if you wanted your freezer to be colder or needed your freezer to be colder you can adjust this dial by pulling out and turning that, each model has it's own peculiarities. Ok now that we've got the fridge fixed theoretically what we need to check for is

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:40.219
under the pan to see if there is any ice there which there probably is and the freezer drain line is probably clogged

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.480
The way we can tell this is if we've got water dripping

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.879
down here

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.659
which we do so were going to need to clear that out

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:48.249
but I will put that on the next video.
