00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.070
let us now study about interference of light.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.010
you might have studied the phenomenon of interference
in superposition of waves.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:31.590
similar thing we’re going to study about
light waves.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.620
and similarly here for interference of light
we can write, when 2 coherent, light waves,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.340
superpose at a point, the resulting intensity,
the resultant intensity, at that point, is

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.840
different, from sum of the 2 intensities,
which are getting superpose, sum of the 2

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.140
intensities of, individual waves.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.159
so this modification, in light intensity,
at the point of superposition, of coherent

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.189
waves, you must be very careful about the
phenomenon that for, phenomena of interference

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:17.819
to take place, waves must be cau-herent.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:33.100
so here we can write this modification of,
superposition of coherent waves, is called,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.380
interference of light.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:02:03.270
and in some situations like if this is a source
1 this is source 2 which are producing light

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.679
waves, and these are coherent.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:17.990
we already studied about coherent waves these
are the waves which are having exactly same

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.330
phase, constant frequency, and zero initial,
time lag between the sources or, constant

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.250
initial phase difference between the 2 waves.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.140
such sources are called coherent sources and
the waves emitted by these sources are called

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.140
coherent waves.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.430
so if this is a point of superposition, there
are some points where resulting intensity

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.260
becomes maximum, and there are some points
where resulting intensity becomes minimum.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:55.070
so the points where intensity is maximum are
called, points of constructive interference,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:03.430
and the points where resulting intensity becomes
minimum are called points of, destructive

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:12.260
interference. in coming sections we’re going
to analyze mathematically, about the intensity

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.350
of light at the point of superposition in
terms of individual intensities as well as

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.680
of phase difference between the 2 waves, at
the point of super position.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.900
let’s continue in detail with the theory
of interference in the coming sections.
