00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.500
So what you're saying is, 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.800
this is a dinosaur rocket!

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:11.300
[music]

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.420
Ok so today is the special outdoor edition as you can see

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.510
We're gonna be playing with a dinosaur rocket ship

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.550
It's actually not a dinosaur, it's a pteranodon

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.450
and a pteranodon is classified as a reptile.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.750
Could you repeat that again in a nerdier voice?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.160
It's actually not a dinosaur, it's a pteranodon

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.650
and pteranodons are classified as a reptiles.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.030
Anyways, according to the diagram, I am to find myself a cartoon rabbit,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.640
and I will place that rabbit against the bum 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.470
and blow into the bum which will allow me to throw my pteranodon into the air.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.070
Where can we find this cartoon rabbit?

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.190
I don't see anything.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.570
I think that's our next WTF.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.180
Ok let's take a look at this.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.880
Now the reason why we think this is a WTF is,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.800
I know that we have like lots of toys and stuff like that in Canada,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.130
but this one you blow up with air and then you let go of the air

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.720
so it's like a balloon, like an out of control balloon 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.530
It's kind of like blowing up a balloon and letting go of the balloon.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.850
Pterrifying Pteranodon!  Ptearing you a new one since -65,000 BC.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.240
TEE HEE HEE.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.170
Yeah, I think so.  Ok that's good.  

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.060
That's good.  You don't want it too big.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.580
Alright, now put the straw in the bumhole and blow some air into it.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.890
I'm so sorry little guy!

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.780
It's really like the...

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.690
AAAHH!!

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.700
Did you lose the straw?  [NO!]

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.700
This is really like the party booms with the same straw technology

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.120
of placing straws in bumholes and blowing.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.720
Korea's really fascinated with blowing straws into bumholes!

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.340
Ok.  We're ready!

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.450
Can you stop sucking at this and just hurry up and throw the freaking pteranodon?

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470
[epic pteranodon music]

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.690
WAAAHHAHHHAAAAHAAA!

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.570
That sucks!  Ok my turn!

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.800
How'd you get slobber all over it?

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.690
AAHHHH!

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.310
It's from the grass [P.S. Grass doesn't slobber]

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.720
Time to throw a Pteradon, like a man!

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.230
TAKE THAT!

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
Oh!  That didn't go very far either!

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.220
The Pteradon sucks!

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.050
Pteradon sucks!  No wonder you're extinct!

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.580
EH!

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.190
SICK!

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.080
Throwing Pteradons...like a man!

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.790
HAHAHAHAHA!

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.500
Still sucks.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.910
Oh, Daiso!  How you've disappointed me!

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.720
GO PTERANODON!

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.220
GO BE FREE!

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.830
It's pretty much just like a long, lame balloon.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.230
This is, this is, this is exceptionally lame!

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.940
I got slobber all over my face!

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.770
Not only am I disappointed, I'm wet...and uncomfortable!

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.360
So this is what you're supposed to look like,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.880
you're supposed to be this carefree happy child

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.480
being like "the pteranodon is the best thing ever!"

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.820
but this is what you end up looking like:

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.630
[Baby cries]

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.240
I know.  I'm sorry little guy!

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.160
I gotta say, I was really disappointed with this.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.170
Yeah, this was the first WTF that really sucked

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.670
It's like the terrible treasure find.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.380
THE PTERANODON TREASURE FIND!

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.880
PTERRIBLE!

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.890
With a p,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.680
a silent p.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.190
Terrible!  With a silent p!

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.790
Whoever thought of the silent P?

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.410
That's like, the dumbest letter out there!

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.620
I've been looking forward to this, since, like the winter time.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.820
We bought this so long ago; we just kept on waiting for the perfect day

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.270
to go outside and play with it.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.470
I'd be like "Simon can we go play with the Pteranodon?"

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.870
And he'd be like "no" and I'd be like 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.490
oh

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.490
And today we finally played with it and it sucked!

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.300
I'm considering, maybe, souping this up at home

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.500
like, getting a coat hanger, but the problem is it's light.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.940
maybe I'll get like a coat hanger and tape it on?

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.650
And then I'll throw it, and then it'll hit people in the face and cause them to bleed.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.670
Like a real pteronodon!

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.090
And then we can start paying for lawsuits, 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.880
YAY LAWSUITS!

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.600
With a silent P.  There is no silent P

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.010
GONG!

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.820
So it's that W time of the month again

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.540
For our WTF Care Package contest!

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.560
YAY!  OH GOD!  That's pterrifying!

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.730
With a silent P

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.740
So this time we're gonna give away the pterrible pteranodon.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.940
Um, the Ajumma sun visor, which also can be used for welding.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.470
The training chopsticks:

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.310
yep, which we will apparently not be sending to Australia

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.600
because everybody in Australia has them for some reason,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.910
And also the amazing WTF boobies.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.220
Yes!  The Japanese Instant Boobs which are really

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.640
the best find of the WTF this month

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.050
So our skill testing question, and this will be a very challenging question indeed.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.950
You will have to use your math, geography, your art skills.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.180
Your Macguyver skills as well.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.990
Yes, and our question for you is

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.300
If you could use the Japanese instant boobs for anything else

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.220
apart from attracting men, what would you use them for?

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.820
So this question is for our YouTube subscribers only.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.320
If you want to participate in the contest,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.610
leave your answer in the comments to this video.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.530
and we'll announce the winners next week!

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.620
It's so bright out, guys!

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.030
It's really painful.  I want to go home, and hide in my apartment.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.900
I want an ice cream!

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.650
The sun just came out!  HISS!

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.130
Run for it internet!

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.130
GONG!
