00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.880
WIL: Hi everybody.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.440
There's no new Table Top this
week, but we have our Gag

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.290
Reel, from Dixit.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.980
I hope you enjoy it, and come
back next week for an all new

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.170
episode of Table Top.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.320
It is the family party game,
Wits and Wagers.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.160
Until next time, play
more games.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.235
They use a scoring system that
keeps, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:27.870
that's not right.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.840
Communicate emotion, communicate
emotion.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.680
They use a scoring metric that
keeps everyone in the game,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.290
until the last round.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.010
What?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.420
No.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.670
It's important to
have in our--

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.435
[BLEEP]

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:41.810
[BLEEP]

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.275
Dixit.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.165
Oh, I held it bad.

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.040
FEMALE SPEAKER [OFFSCREEN]:
It was fine.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.540
WIL: I felt like I had
a hook for a hand.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.230
Where a sense of artistic

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.100
communication, that's not right.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.520
Votes are revealed,
oh, I am stupid.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.942
And then the votes
are revealed.

00:00:57.942 --> 00:00:58.980
[BLEEP], no.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.020
And I cannot wait to
hear what my--

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.760
I was doing so good, too.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.480
Welcome to Loserville, USA.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.730
CASEY: Population, Will.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.080
WIL: The freeway's winning.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.250
BETH: Honk, honk.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.500
WIL: Jump, jump.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.320
BETH: I think-- did
my mic just fall?

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.840
It's down here now.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.120
CASEY: Third nipple.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.850
BETH: Does it matter?

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.116
Stop looking at my
cards, Casey.

00:01:33.116 --> 00:01:35.250
CASEY: I'm not looking
at them.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.500
BETH: Me and bunny.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.732
My plan.

00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:46.155
FEMALE SPEAKER [OFFSCREEN]:
You're a professional.

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:47.390
You can rock this [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.920
BETH: I slipped.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.900
WIL: What're we having
for dinner?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.005
I don't know, it's
just so Dixit.

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:54.480
BETH: God, stop being
such a Dixit.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.212
WIL: Vote reveals.

00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:57.530
CASEY: Suck my Dixit.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.022
BETH: Holy Dixit.

00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:02.330
No one left the cello in a car,
and what did they do?

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:10.225
I don't know.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:11.220
CASEY [OFFSCREEN]: Is
there a time limit?

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.650
WIL: Shut up.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.520
You can't call the
clock on this.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.360
It's not poker.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.620
BETH: When they brought
that Macbeth quote

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.770
out, I don't know.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.485
The moment Will lays his
card down, I know.

00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:24.310
Oh, [BLEEP], what is it?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.857
WIL: Beth, you receive--

00:02:26.857 --> 00:02:27.791
BETH: Can we start over?

00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:30.130
I was going to try
to do a curtsy--

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.690
WIL: And you fell?

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.820
BETH: And then I was like,
it needs to be up here.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.220
But then my dress would
be over my head.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.670
WIL: I'm really glad
you stopped that.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.400
BETH: OK, good.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.030
WIL: Before it became--
because it's not

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.840
that kind of show.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.670
BETH: OK, great The Table
Top trophy of awesome.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.570
FEMALE SPEAKER [OFFSCREEN]:
Bend down.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.820
WIL: Yay.
