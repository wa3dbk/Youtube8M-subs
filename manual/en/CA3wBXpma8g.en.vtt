In this video we are looking at how to get 
 the guitar sound from The Game album by Queen.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.274
In particular the songs Play the Game and Dragon Attack

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:25.420
I can't take credit for this Guitar Rig 5 preset. 
 Sent to me by Mr Queen on Youtube.

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:31.764
This is what it sounds like

00:00:54.985 --> 00:01:02.163
That gives you a good idea of what the preset sounds 
 like. A good replication of the sound from the album

00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:15.465
My blog in the description takes you to the download link for this preset.
