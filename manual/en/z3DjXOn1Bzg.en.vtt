Definitely if you have the time and if your
course will allow it - go on exchange.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.760
It was honestly one of the best things I've
ever done for my degree.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.690
I think it was just a general interest to
further my language studies so I thought may

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.900
as well do it in China and Shanghai is one
of the biggest international cities, if not

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.740
the biggest international city in China.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.560
So I thought why not?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.230
The international office and the exchange
program they gave me a travel grant of about

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.489
$5,000 which was really helpful and then as
a business student the Curtin Business School

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.210
also gives me $3,000 on top of that.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.469
The university I went to was Shanghai University.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.510
So when I arrived there it was about lat...
early evening, I put my bags down, checked

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.170
in and then I wanted to buy, you know just
some necessities and I didn't know where to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.170
go.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.399
So I went downstairs to the lobby and I asked
the man oh wheres the nearest shopping centre

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.399
or supermarket.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.760
He pointed to a map and I looked at the map
and felt helpless and then I hear these two

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.830
voices behind me speaking in English and I
turn around and go oh my god like you speak

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.629
english can you please help me.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.712
And yeah they took me around to the local
shopping centre, treated me to dinner, showed

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:14.370
me where to buy like you know water, toilet
paper, SIM cards and one of the guys - Richard

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.770
- he turned out to be one of my really really
good friends during my semester.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.360
We had a pretty full on class schedule.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.430
Classes were about 20 hours a week.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.010
When ever we could escape the classroom we'd
travel and explore Shanghai city.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.420
Shanghai is huge - the city itself has a population
of 23 million.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.770
My friend actually devised a little game called
Train Roulette.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.130
So what we'd do is hop on to the train and
we don't even know which way, which direction

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.220
its going and then once we decided to go we'd
point at the map and go yep we'll exit there

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.990
and we get off at the station and we'll explore
the area.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.880
This one time we got off at a random stop
- I can't even remember what it was called

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.910
- it was a little place but we walked past
a firing range - shooting range.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.700
So that was the first I've ever held a gun.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.030
But things like that happen in China!

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.470
Yeah and my other good friend Kimberly - she
was from the UK.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.740
And she's got a similar background to me.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.320
Both of our parents are Cantonese - from Hong
Kong sooooo... but we got a long really, really

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320
well.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.930
And at the end of the semester she felt like
a sister and which was weird.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.480
You think going on exchange when you'll only
be there for a semester you wont really develop

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.600
strong friendships you know you compare them
to your friends back home - who you've known

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.690
for years - and you think oh you know I'll
make some friends but they wont be that close.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.560
You live and eat with them every day!

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.030
For a semester so you kind of become really
really good friends.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.530
China is a great like place for all different
types of food.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.319
I mean in Beijing I managed to try a whole
heap of different type of food.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.740
There's a strip called Wang Fu Jing and its
famous for their street food, in particular

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.410
creepy crawlies and bugs.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.890
So on that one night my friends and I ventured
to try everything and in a course of an hour

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.860
we had Starfish, Baby Shark, Tarantula, Scorpions,
Silk Worms, Sea Horse.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.130
It was an interesting experience, definitely.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.980
Went to Tibet for three weeks so that was
an amazing trip.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.370
We went to the base camp of Mount Everest.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.040
Saw the Himalayas and we managed to spend
one sunset and one sunrise at Mount Everest.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.050
And it was really beautiful.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.440
I was lucky enough to get a job at a marketing
consultancy here in Perth and my employer

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.460
said to me that definitely one of the reasons
I stood out from all the other applicants

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.910
was this international experience.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.060
The fact that I put myself out there.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.540
That, you know, I've got out of comfort zone
and you know gained this international experience.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.910
They look at, you know, exchanges and international
internships as a plus.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.330
To all the students out there considering
the idea of an exchange - I mean it is a daunting

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.330
process at first.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.340
You think theres a lot of paperwork and its
not that easy to get in, but I think when

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.749
you just start talking to the exchange office.

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:25.520
You know the coordinators are really lovely
people and after that you know once you kind

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.199
of take that first step you'll realise that
its actually quite an easy process and you'll

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.729
find yourself you know wanting it a lot and
you know really working for it and its - at

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.989
the end of the day it is one of the best things
that I've ever done
