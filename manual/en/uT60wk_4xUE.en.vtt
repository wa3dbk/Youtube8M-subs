00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.899
Now we are going to talk about cloud hands.
There are two types of cloud hands. One is

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:14.969
inside cloud, the other one is outside cloud.
Remember that, in and out. In and out. In

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:31.619
and out. In and out. Or in and out. Now watch.
Does that remind you of something? In boxing?

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.079
Inside block, remember this is not only your
inside block. What if I have a face right

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:50.280
here? It is inside slap, inside slap. Take
a look. Inside slap. That is the first type

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:00.840
of cloud hand. Now outside cloud. Outside
block, outside block. Now, at this moment

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.220
you are doing the cloud hands you have got
to incorporate your hips. And some time we

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:20.500
do it slowly in this position. And I was explaining
about outside block finger jab. It is right

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:36.800
there. Outside block, finger jab. Take a look
one more time. So for this one, in fighting

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.070
positions the modern fighter would interpret
as this. That is outside block. Inside block,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.400
inside block. And I am going to have my assistant
show you how to do it. Now we are working

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.620
on inside cloud, first. Inside cloud. This
is same as inside block and take a look. He

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.360
is in the fighting position and I am coming
with this one and this one. That is inside

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:16.110
cloud. Outside cloud, outside. If I try to
touch his shoulder, his cheek.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.560
He is good at this, very good at this. So
this practice conclude the subject of cloud

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.630
hands.
