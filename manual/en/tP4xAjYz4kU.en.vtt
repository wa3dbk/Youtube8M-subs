Hi! My name is John Armstrong with expertvillage.com.
I am a professional guitar instructor and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.270
today we will be discussing slide guitar and
slide guitar techniques. A slide guitar commonly

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.840
utilizes a lot of work referred to as open
tuning. This is where we tune the guitar to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.849
the three or four notes of the chord depending
on whether we are using a triad chord or a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.850
dominant seven chord. What we typically can
do is a lot of your common tunings or open

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.180
G tuning or open D tunings, those are two
of your real common open tunings that we used

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.730
to play slide with. What we can do is tune
the low for an open G tuning, is to tune the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:51.109
low E string down to D, one of the notes of
the G triads. The A string we can tune down

00:00:51.109 --> 00:01:01.469
to G, so I will do that by using my open third
string or my open G. D, we can leave it alone

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.757
because it is one of the notes of the G triad.
G, we can leave it alone because it is one

00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:12.010
of the notes of the G triad. So far we have
D, G, D, G again and then B, we can leave

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.000
it alone because that is our major third,
that’s the third and the high E we want

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.571
to tune down to a D, which I have already
done. This allows you to use the open G tuning

00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:51.160
which is… It is real nice when you are playing
in the key of

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.910
the G, once again keying of my C chords and
D chords by fours and fives.
