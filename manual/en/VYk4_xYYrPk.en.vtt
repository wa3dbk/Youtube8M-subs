00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.649
Rabbits nails can grow to be very long and sharp.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.809
And when this happens, it's very
uncomfortable for the rabbit.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.909
That's why it's important to keep them
nice and short.

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.730
Trimming your rabbit's nails can be a
rather challenging and daunting task.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.039
Many rabbit owners are afraid of clipping
their rabbit's nail for fear that they will

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.150
cause the rabbit to bleed so they seek
help from their vet or rabbit groomer.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.399
But trimming your rabbit's nails is really not
that difficult. After some practice, you'll

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.289
realize it's much easier than you
thought.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.310
I like to sit on the floor with my legs stretched out and have sugar facing up.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.980
Sugar is in what we call a bunny trance.
It should be fairly easy to trance your

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.490
rabbit once you get them in this
position but if you're having problems,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.130
a tower over the eyes helps calm them
down.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.710
Just remember to go slow at first, clipping a bit at a time. Nails should be trimmed once every

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.040
one to two months.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.760
Use a clipper like this one here to take
of a portion of the nail.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.660
Remember to do it firmly, you do not want to
have the nail dangling off half way.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.600
Be very careful not to cut the quick
in the toe nail. The quick is the end of the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.460
light pink tissue in the nail bit and
includes blood and nerves because doing so

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.700
can cause pain to the rabbit and a bloody
toe nail.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.840
If the nail is too dark to see the
quick clearly, shine a torch through the nail,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.270
use the silhouette of the quick as a
guide.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.680
If the nails are too long, cut a little
of at a time. This makes the experience more

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.119
comfortable for the rabbit.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.990
When too much nail is taken off at a
time, the change in pressure is sometimes

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.549
a little uncomfortable.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.899
Trimming of the nail a little at a time also
make the task less stressful.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.689
Rabbits have five fingers on each paw.
See the little thumb here

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.170
and four toes on each foot so remember to get them all.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.800
Here's a tip. For the first few times, you
might wanna wear a long-sleeved shirt and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.320
jeans, prevents scratches.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.680
If you accidentally hit the nail quick
and caused some bleeding, don't panic. What you

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.520
want to do is try to stop the bleeding
immediately.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.890
There are commercial products like Kwik
Stop which is a powder, these sting a

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.730
little but are very effective. Take a pinch of the powder and press it onto the tip

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.909
of the affected of nail after wiping away
the blood.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.710
Corn starch or flour can be use in a
similar manner. If the bleeding is not that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.590
serious, simply apply pressure to the tip
of the nail and that can be effective as

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.319
well.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.680
No matter what method you used, make sure
the bleeding has stopped before placing

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.680
your rabbit back into living area or leaving her unintended.
