\b Tucked away in rural Randolph County is

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:13.720
a farm featuring some vegetables, plenty of
goats and the vision of Ginny Tate \'96 a

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.330
former nurse who called herself \'93The Goat
Lady.\'94

\b0 \'96 I think one of the reasons she came

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.640
to North Carolina is because she wanted to
get back to nature somewhat and live away

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.100
from town, have a little place.

\b Ginny Tate's brother, Steve, was farm-raised

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.000
himself, in the Midwest. He and his wife,
Lee, are self-described environmentalists

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.440
would couldn't resist joining the Goat Lady,
to create the Goat Lady Dairy. \

\cf0 Steve Tate \'96
\b0 We realized we had this unique opportunity

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.790
as environmental activists to save a farm
rather than just try to save the planet, and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.620
use that as a way to educate people about
the importance of caring for the earth and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.620
saving local farms.

\b0 I think she sort of captured my imagination

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.520
about what could be done here, about all the
different things we could do. And I trusted

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520
her. I thought she had a really good mind;
her ideas were good and solid and she was

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520
kind of a down-to-earth person. And I thought,
\'93I can work with her.\'94

\b0 \cf0 Kelly Mc:
\b The family DID work together. They raised

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:24.119
goats and vegetables. They made cheese from
the goats' milk and built a business to thrive

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.899
with life's changes \'96 one being Ginny Tate's
losing battle against \'93Lou Gehrig's Disease.\'94

Lee Tate \'96
\b0 We all, kind of, gelled in our idea of

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:42.539
what we would do here. And I feel like, when
she died, it wasn't a matter of \'93What would

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.420
Ginny do?,\'94 but I kind of felt like I already
knew what Ginny would do.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.719
\b0 For us, it's more about a mission \'96
a mission to connect local eaters with the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.020
food and the local farmers that produce that
food. So, we're about \'93food with a face\'94

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.580
 - meeting the farm, meeting the farmer, knowing
your cheese maker.

Lee Tate \'96
\b0 He's trained in the ministry. So, I think

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:35.890
he sees this as his ministry to other people
by showing them a good way to relate to the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.860
environment. All that's important to me but
I'm not as articulate as he his. Maybe the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.310
vision isn't as strong for me. I think it's
more of a personal love.

\b The Tates want to save the world and, if

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.129
not that create a great example of sustainable
farming. They have a partnership with the

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.180
goats that part-family and part-business.

\b0 \'96 These are the daughters of our best
milkers. So, these are the ones that we kept

\b Everyone has a job and the goats are hired

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.980
to give milk. Their personalities come free
of charge. \

Steve Tate \'96

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.980
\b0 I like to think of goats as the \'93canines\'94
of the livestock world. You think about cat

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.980
personalities and dog personalities, sheep
are cats and goats are dogs.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.980
\b0 I like it because we sort of count on
each other. They're predictable and that makes

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.980
me be more predictable. And, some days when
I kind of just don't want to get up and face

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.909
the world, I have to because they're counting
on me.

\b The results of idealism, hard work and

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.859
that herd goats allow The Goat Lady Dairy
to produce 35-THOUSAND pounds of cheese, host

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:41.159
weekend dinners for food enthusiasts AND grow
vegetables for local customers. The dairy

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.940
is profitable. Steve says he can't make a
that difference any other way. \

\b0 This is America, Kelly. This is a free
enterprise, free market, capitalistic system.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.939
If those of us who have really high ideals
really want to make a change, we have to compete

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:07.620
in that market and we have to show that we
can do well while doing good at the same time.
