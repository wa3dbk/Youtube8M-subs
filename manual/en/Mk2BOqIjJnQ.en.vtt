00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:13.946
Peter, day 2 of Dakar, what happened?

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:27.262
Yesterday we had to retire due to technical problems. The 
 rear diff got stuck, the gearbox broke down. 

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:30.881
So after 60 km into the stage we were standing still.

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:41.270
It took a long time before the service truck arrived because 
 they had another route. It took about six hours.

00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:51.190
They saw it was 6 till 8 hour work and 
 almost not doable, so we had to retire.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.270
The rear axle was broken. We drove completely our 
 own tempo, we didn't take any risks.

00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:12.270
We really can't understand what happened, really disappointed.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.940
Dakar 2015, what is your view?

00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:25.340
Always when you had to retire you start thinking about the next Dakar.

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:33.580
I will start again, also with my son, so with two cars.

00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:40.700
Always an advantage when one car has to retire.

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:43.270
Also good for the sponsors, I will thank them for the support.

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:51.497
They helped us to drive this year. Next year with two 
 cars, so I hope they will support us again.

00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:57.400
All the other people thanks for the support and see you next year!
