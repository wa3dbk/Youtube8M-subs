00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.040
I want to make a
quick clarification

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.210
and then add more tools in
our complex number toolkit.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.040
In the first video, I said that
if I had a complex number z,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.222
and it's equal to a
plus bi, I used a word.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.930
And I have to be
careful about that word,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.870
because I used in
the everyday sense.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.460
But it also has a
formal reality to it.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.100
So clearly, the real part
of this complex number is a.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.200
Clearly, that is the real part.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.250
And clearly, this
complex number is made up

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.510
of a real number plus
an imaginary number.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.970
So just kind of talking
in everyday terms,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.460
I called this the
imaginary part.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.780
I called this imaginary
number the imaginary part.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.880
But I want to just
be careful there.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.012
I did make it clear
that if you were

00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:54.770
to see the function
the real part of z,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.442
this would spit out the a.

00:00:56.442 --> 00:01:00.030
And the function the
imaginary part of z,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.520
this would spit
out-- and we talked

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.561
about this in the first
video-- it would spit out

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.450
the number that's scaling the i.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.540
So it would spit out the b.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.130
So if someone is talking
in the formal sense

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.900
about the imaginary
part, they're

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.670
really talking about the
number that is scaling the i.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.620
But in my brain, when I
think of a complex number,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.296
I think of it having a real
number and an imaginary number.

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:23.420
And if someone were to say,
well, what part of that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.530
is the imaginary number?

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.750
I would have given
this whole thing.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.920
But if someone says just
what's the imaginary part,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.680
where they give you this
function, just give them the b.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.330
Hopefully, that
clarifies things.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.040
Frankly, I think the word
"imaginary part" is badly

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.380
named because clearly,
this whole thing is

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.660
an imaginary number.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.810
This right here is not
an imaginary number.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.300
It's just a real number.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.610
It's the real number
scaling the i.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.970
So they should call
this the number scaling

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.990
the imaginary part of z.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.770
Anyway, with that
said, what I want

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.910
to introduce you to is the
idea of a complex number's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.070
conjugate.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.950
So if this is z, the
conjugate of z-- it'd

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.550
be denoted with z
with a bar over it.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.000
Sometimes it's z with a little
asterisk right over there.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.270
That would just be
equal to a minus bi.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.580
So let's see how they
look on an Argand diagram.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.375
So that's my real axis.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.220
And then that is
my imaginary axis.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.620
And then if I have
z-- this is z over

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.200
here-- this height
over here is b.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.010
This base, or this
length, right here is a.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.840
That's z.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.860
The conjugate of
z is a minus bi.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.590
So it comes out a
on the real axis,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.350
but it has minus b as
its imaginary part,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.580
so just like this.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.320
So this is the conjugate of z.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.270
So just to visualize it, a
conjugate of a complex number

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.920
is really the mirror image of
that complex number reflected

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.807
over the x-axis.

00:02:57.807 --> 00:02:59.640
You can imagine if this
was a pool of water,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.612
we're seeing its
reflection over here.

00:03:01.612 --> 00:03:03.070
And so we can
actually look at this

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.220
to visually add the complex
number and its conjugate.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.220
So we said these are just
like position vectors.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.870
So if we were to add
z and its conjugate,

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.010
we could essentially
just take this vector,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.860
shift it up here,
do heads to tails.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.530
So this right here, we are
adding z to its conjugate.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.220
And so this point right
here, or the vector

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.270
that specifies that point,
is z plus z's conjugate.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.400
And you can see right
here, just visually, this

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.380
is going to be 2a.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.130
And to do that algebraically.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.370
If we were to add z--
that's a plus bi--

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.889
and add that to its
conjugate, so plus a minus bi,

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:52.930
what are we going to get?

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.670
These two guys cancel out.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.214
We're just going to have 2a.

00:03:56.214 --> 00:03:57.630
Or another way to
think about it--

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.680
and really, we're just
playing around with math--

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.970
if I take any complex number,
and to it I add its conjugate,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.760
I'm going to get 2
times the real part

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.410
of the complex number.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.660
Oh, and this is also going
to be 2 times the real part

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.070
of the conjugate because they
have the exact same real part.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.190
Now with that said,
let's think about where

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.280
the conjugate could be useful.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.490
So let's say I had
something like 1

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:37.220
plus 2i divided by 4 minus 5i.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.154
So it's no real obvious way
to simplify this expression.

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:42.320
Maybe I don't like having
this i in the denominator.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.030
Maybe I just want to write
this as one complex number.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.780
If I divide one complex
number by another,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.280
I should get another
complex number.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.680
But how do I do that?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.005
Well, one thing to
do is to multiply

00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:53.380
the numerator and
the denominator

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.710
by the conjugate
of the denominator,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.620
so 4 plus 5i over 4 plus 5i.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.390
And clearly, I'm just
multiplying by 1,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.598
because this is the same
number over the same number.

00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:07.230
But the reason why
this is valuable

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.700
is if I multiply a number
times its conjugate,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.120
I'm going to get a real number.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.020
So let me just
show you that here.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.420
So let's just multiply this out.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.850
So we're going to get 1
times 4 plus 5i is 4 plus 5i.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.360
And then 2i times 4 is plus 8i.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.250
And then 2i times
5i-- that would

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.890
be 10i squared, or negative 10.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.130
And then that will
be over-- now,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.190
this has the form a
minus b times a plus b.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.710
Well, a plus b times a minus b
is a squared minus b squared.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.890
So it's going to be equal
to 4 squared, which is 16,

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.450
minus 4 squared-- oh, why
did I have 4 plus 4i here?

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.460
This should be 4 plus 5i.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.170
What am I doing?

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.450
4 plus 5i, the same number
over the same number.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.834
This was a 10 right over there.

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:06.750
This is the conjugate.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.291
I don't know.

00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:09.030
My brain must have
been thinking in 4's.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.071
So obviously, I don't want
to change the number--

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:14.075
4 plus 5i over 4 plus 5i.

00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:14.950
So let's multiply it.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.690
This is a minus b times
a plus b, so 4 times 4.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.710
So this is going to be 4
squared minus 5i squared.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.210
And so this is going to
be equal to 4 minus 10.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.720
Let's add the real parts.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.490
4 minus 10 is negative 6.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.050
5i plus 8i is 13i.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.560
Add the imaginary parts.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.980
And then you have
16 minus 5i squared.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.610
Well, 5i squared-- i
squared is negative 1.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.490
5 squared's just going
to be negative 25.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.240
The negative and the
negative cancel out,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.360
so you have 16 plus 25.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.852
So that is 41.

00:06:54.852 --> 00:06:56.560
So we can write this
as a complex number.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:03.270
This is negative
6/41 plus 13/41 i.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.220
We were able to divide
these two complex numbers.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.660
So the useful thing
here is the property

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.190
that if I take any
complex number,

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.465
and I multiply it
by its conjugate--

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:19.340
and obviously, the
conjugate of the conjugate

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.882
is the original number.

00:07:20.882 --> 00:07:22.340
But I would take
any complex number

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.090
and I multiply it
by its conjugate,

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.789
so this would be a plus
bi times a minus bi.

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:30.080
I'm going to get a real number.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.120
It's going to be a squared
minus bi squared, difference

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.180
of squares, which is
equal to a squared-- now,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.810
this is going to be
negative b squared.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.351
But we have a negative
sign out here,

00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:46.319
so they cancel out-- a
squared plus b squared.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.360
And just out of curiosity,
this is the same thing

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.680
as the magnitude of our
complex number squared.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.930
So this is a neat property.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.970
This is what makes
conjugates really useful,

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.370
especially when you
want to simplify

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.760
division of complex numbers.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.230
Anyway, hopefully,
you found that useful.
