Hi welcome to another video.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.460
My name is Vincent Woon.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:15.469
In this video I’m going to with you a question
from one of my subscriber who is a dodgeball

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.000
player, as to how to stretch his deltoid muscle.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now who uses the deltoid muscles?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.200
Mainly people who exercise a lot who do a
lot of bench press who use this movement and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.300
also this movement which use this middle muscle
of the deltoid, the middle piece of the deltoid

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:47.110
and people who stretch this way that’s the
use of the back deltoid muscle or the posterior

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.800
deltoid muscle.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.239
So what else that you do that will use the
muscle?

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.910
Putting too much weight while you
are sleeping on it, you get pain on the front

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.939
deltoid muscle or sometimes in the middle
too and carrying a heavy bag, like kids going

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.329
to school they have a heavy back pack or even
carrying a heavy purse or handbag that might

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.299
cause the pain there.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.650
What I’m going to do right now, I’m going
to show you how to stretch the front muscle,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.939
the front deltoid muscle, the middle deltoid
muscle and the back deltoid muscle.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.829
In order to stretch the front deltoid muscle,
you need to find a pole or a wall or a door

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:36.829
frame.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:45.779
What I’m going to do is to use the wall
here, put one hand on the wall and turn away

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:53.219
from the wall, one hand parallel and then
turn away from the wall... make sure your

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:00.749
arm is parallel to the wall like such and
turn.

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:10.179
One stretch away from the wall, you will feel
the muscle stretch here.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:23.010
In order to stretch the middle deltoid, you
can raise your arm up across your chest and

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:31.060
push it with the opposite arm... push it that
way not pull but push and stretch.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.160
Up and stretch, you’ll feel the stretch
here.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.000
Same thing on the other arm, across push and
stretch, you’ll feel the stretch here.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.870
Stretch across and push help assist.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.030
Across and push and above the elbow and stretch
and stretch.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.270
And to work on your back deltoid muscle or
your posterior deltoid muscle, look for the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:16.590
pole or the wall again, hole the pole or the
wall and turn into it, hold it and turn into

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:26.060
it, you’ll feel the stretch here, in.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.739
Find a wall or a poll and walk into it, hold
it walk into it you will feel the muscle stretch

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.739
here.

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.490
Those are 3 things that I do for each part
of the muscle and I hope it help you too.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.810
