Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course.
Can we get these books to roll in in the future?

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.680
It doesn’t feel like Crash Course unless
there’s a roll in.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.560
[Theme Music]

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.839
Today, before we begin our mini-series on
reading and writing in English, we’re going

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.769
to discuss how to read and why.
So, if you watched our series on world history,

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.960
you’ll no doubt remember that writing (and the ability
to read it) are so-called markers of civilization.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.300
Now, that’s a really problematic idea. I mean, for one thing, great stories can have great lives in the oral tradition.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.280
Like, one of my favorite books, Mules and Men by
Zora Neale Hurston, was a collection of folklore

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.579
that lived in the oral tradition until Zora
Neale Hurston wrote it down.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.519
And the same can be said for another of my
favorite books, The Odyssey.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.620
But we privilege reading and writing because
they allow us to communicate directly and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.690
transparently with people who live very far
away from us, and they also allow us to kind

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.609
of hear the voices of the dead.
I mean, I don’t want to get all liberal

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.809
arts-y on you, but I want to make this clear;
for me, stories are about communication.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.140
We didn’t invent grammar so that your life
would be miserable in grade school as you

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.590
attempted to learn what the Marquez a preposition
is. By the way, on this program, I will be

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.250
inserting names of my favorite writers when
I would otherwise insert curse words.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.159
We invented grammar because without prepositions,
we couldn’t describe what it’s like to

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.279
fly through a cloud, or jump over a puddle,
or Faulkner beneath the stars.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.460
Like, right now, if I’m doing my job, and
you’re doing your job, you aren’t thinking

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.240
about the fact that I’m contorting my mouth
and tongue and vocal chords to create sounds

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.590
that then exist as ideas in your brain; it’s
just happening.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.750
But if my language gets confusing -- if I parles
en francais or incorrect word order use or

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.630
eekspay inyay igpay atinlay, then I erect
a barrier between you and me.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.860
You and I? You and me.
Writing--or at least good writing--is an outgrowth

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.380
of that urge to use language to communicate
complex ideas and experiences between people.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.750
And that’s true whether you’re reading
Shakespeare or bad vampire fiction, reading

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.820
is always an act of empathy. It’s always
an imagining of what it’s like to be someone else.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.920
So when Shakespeare uses iambic pentameter,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.500
or Salinger uses a red hunting cap, they aren’t
doing this so that your English teachers will

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.450
have something to torture you with.
They’re doing it, at least if they’re

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.810
doing it on purpose, so the story can have
a bigger and better life in your mind.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.070
But, for the record, the question of whether they’re
doing it on purpose is not a very interesting question.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.570
Oh, we’re still doing open letters?

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.320
An Open Letter to Authorial Intent. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment today.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.200
Oh, it’s a boat beating against the current,
borne back ceaselessly into the past.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.680
Dear authorial intent, As an author, let me
speak to you directly. You don’t matter.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.620
Look, I’m not willing to go as far as the
postmodernists and say that the author is

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.780
dead because that would make me very nervous.
However, the author is not that important.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.379
Whether an author intended a symbolic resonance
to exist in her book is irrelevant. All that

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.050
matters is whether it’s there because the
book does not exist for the benefit of the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.959
author. The book exists for the benefit of
you.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.810
If we, as readers, could have a bigger and
richer experience with the world as a result

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.470
of reading a symbol and that symbol wasn’t
intended by the author, we still win.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.390
Yes, inevitably, reading is a conversation
between an author and a reader. But give yourself

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.950
some power in that conversation, reader. Go
out there and make a world.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.560
Best wishes,
John Green

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.409
Here’s the thing: It is extremely hard to
get other people to feel what we are feeling.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.409
Like, you may have experienced this in your
own life. Say my college girlfriend broke

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.560
up with me...and she did.
I want to explain what I’m feeling to my

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.459
best friend in the entire world. So I say,
I am completely OBLITERATED. My HEART IS BROKEN.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.590
In fact, my heart is SHATTERED INTO A MILLION
PIECES.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.549
Right, so, a few things are going on here:
First, in excellent news, my heart has not

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.310
been shattered into a million pieces. It is
pumping blood in precisely the same way that

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.799
it did before the breakup.
Secondly, in further good news, I am not totally

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.659
obliterated. Total obliteration of me would
look like this.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.890
I’m using the techniques of hyperbole, in
the case of obliteration, and metaphor, in

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.129
the case of my broken heart, to try to describe
the things that are happening inside of me.

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.180
But because I’m not using particularly compelling
or original figurative language, my friend

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.950
may struggle to empathize with me, and this
is my BEST FRIEND in the entire world.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.470
Now imagine that you’re trying to communicate
far more complicated and nuanced experiences

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.640
and emotions. And instead of just trying to
communicate them to your best friend, you’re

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.040
trying to talk to strangers, some of whom
may live very far away and, in fact, live

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.420
centuries after your death.
Not only that, but instead of this happening

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.790
during a pleasant conversation, they are reading
your dry, dead text on a page.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.080
So they can’t hear your intonation or see
the tears dripping from your cheeks even though

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.260
it turns out that this breakup is going to be one
of the best things that ever happened to you.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.240
So THAT is the challenge that Shakespeare

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.410
faces, and it’s also the challenge that
you face whenever you write for an audience,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.790
whether it’s a novel or a pedantic YouTube
comment about the accuracy of our Gallifreyan.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.170
Hush! This is fantastic Gallifreyan.
So I’m going to ask you to read critically,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.120
to look closely at a text and pay attention to the
subtle ways the author is trying to communicate the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.040
full complexity of human experience, but I’m not asking
you to go symbol-hunting because reading is supposed

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.640
to be some treasure map in which you discover
symbols, write them down, and then get an A in class.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.980
I’m asking you to read critically because
by understanding language, you will

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.720
1. Have a fuller understanding of lives other
than your own, which

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.260
2. Will help you to be more empathetic, and
thereby

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.540
3. Help you to avoid getting dumped by that young
woman in the first place, although more importantly

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.600
4. Reading critically and attentively can give you the linguistic tools to share your own story with more precision.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.080
And that will help people to understand your
joy and your heartbreak, yes, but will also

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.210
be helpful in many other ways, like when you
are trying to convince the company to move

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.580
forward with your fourth quarter strategy
or whatever it is that people with real jobs do.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.400
Reading thoughtfully gives us better tools

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.920
to explain corporate profits and broken hearts.
And it also connects us to each other.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.770
The real reason the green light in The Great
Gatsby is such a wonderful symbol is because

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.440
we all know what it’s like to be outside
in the evening, staring off into the distance

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.970
at a future that may never be ours.
We’ve all felt that stomach-churning mix

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.910
of yearning and ambition that Gatsby feels as he
stares out at that green light across the harbor.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.830
And by knowing what it’s like to be Gatsby,

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.000
we learn more about those around us, those who
came before us, and we learn more about ourselves.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.540
So, over the next few weeks, we’ll be reading

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.580
not just Gatsby but also Romeo and Juliet,
some poetry by Emily Dickinson, and The Catcher

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.560
in the Rye. There are links to get all of
these books in the video info below. We’ll

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.660
begin with Romeo and Juliet next week. I’ll
see you then.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.540
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.480
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by me. And our graphics

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.810
team is Thought Bubble.
If you have questions about today’s video,

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.780
you can leave them in comments where they
will be answered by our team of experts. And

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.270
if you haven’t already, read Romeo and Juliet.
It’s a very good play, although at times

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.900
derivative of West Side Story.
Thanks for watching Crash Course. And as we

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.480
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.
