00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.200
multi-national companies right

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.179
your government you're going to be easy
beer

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.889
uh... now

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.579
if only somebody had warned us

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.319
the president of mom i had planned to
cut social security in an effort to do

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:21.159
the grand bargain

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.809
those of you watch the show a long time
no that i've been saying this for years

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:25.720
right

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.150
but i wanted to be tripoli on the record
last year

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.100
because every once in awhile you get or
no and i was a all the time you get

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.860
democrats who said are don't change

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.080
you're always in four years they have to
answer a link

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.350
i've been here all along

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.160
and i didn't even remember this article
one of our producers every mustapha

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.600
found some remember what you wrote

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.010
last year

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.500
and now minute this is in december
twenty twelve when they were in the low

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.090
budget negotiations

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.850
it janina had done the stupid plan
beefing that was embarrassed and it was

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
a boat that his guys even voted against
the republicans had just lost the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.040
election

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.290
bears all play on the budget

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.950
failed in his own house of
representatives

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.229
they had nothing they had no leverage

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.360
president obama has all of the leverage

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.510
and at that time at the height of
bureaucratic power are wrote this

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.710
court i've been saying for every over
two years now the president while his

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.790
dying to do the grand bargain he will do
it at any cost in fact he actively wants

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.670
a counselor security and medicare

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.770
now when i wrote that last year of
course the democratic

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.909
party base

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.310
flipped up alcock cad

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.200
door publicist wheat

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.710
first how

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.920
president obama has a great progress but
democrat help their of course it will

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.159
cut so sick what now that has

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.440
what now

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.700
he just propose cutting social security
who's right who's wrong

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.869
pick your product shopping in your face

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.810
as you've always been wrong about all
bomber he's not a progressive

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.300
i'm actually in this in hindsight i'm
quoting

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.609
from beforehand

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.550
meanwhile back were video after many
opportunist rate years of me sayin

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.100
invited out more points for you

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.340
soberly having enough croat present
lighting dot net lessons

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.109
because every time you guys issue one up
a lot of even more quote

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.449
i couldn't believe the people couldn't
believe the president prepared all bomb

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:31.319
offer because so security they get in
this round of negotiations

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.309
what do you still surprise that

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:37.000
what do you still surprised and i said i
can quote myself as awesome

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.040
that has offered to cut the so-called
entitlements

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.579
everytime

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.260
what i'm gonna get it through your head

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.649
he wants the cut them

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:51.499
i have quotes going back to before he
was president talking about how we want

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.909
to cut entitlements

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.940
specifi was he drank the cooley it
doesn't matter you like

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.670
although bomber kool aid

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.190
hope taste so good

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.250
tell me about why we shouldn't dot
progressive policies in fact the top

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.380
progressive policy in fact the most
popular policy democrats ever got in

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.199
this country

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.159
although on the topic i've got an idea
for something you won't do it so i could

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.370
tell that needle gently you won't do it
off close to what bobby duvall what it

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.930
is probably a great idea

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.710
this quarter of the republicans

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.489
you know what did

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.619
dharma argument today is

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.790
well some republicans agree with him on
cutting so security

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.799
and some like represent a woman don't
agree

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.559
so he split the republicans what a
brilliant move split the republicans

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.149
to do what

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:38.130
hey he agreed with that began in
everything you they wanted

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.239
and some of the one in even more of some
of the one at last

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.399
all what how brilliant

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:49.449
inside dollars strategy what if you care
about policy

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.239
if you are a lot would know bombing you
fall in love with him

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.589
any every time you see unlike little
rainbows in hearts ah... little birds

00:03:56.589 --> 00:04:00.299
pop up and butterflies well that i can
help you because everything you know

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.389
income a book that the slightest right
across the face

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:09.019
it had all but uh... compliance strategy
to prints let me also prelude the

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.299
republicans are split on whether a show
slightly twice only once

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.279
on the continue calling my so someone or

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.579
poppin role

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.320
quote i'll tell you this even the
republican party's darkest hour the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.570
president will stall beyond that most of
what they want

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.649
my guess is that levels will be stopped

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:31.370
at the concessions president obon makes

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.759
even when he and the republicans in the
corner

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.779
and totally defeated

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.639
and guess what happened i use

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.050
republicans in a corner totally defeated

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.370
president obama gives them their prize
possession cutting social security

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.800
while at school

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.500
i think it all at least agree that if
ever there was a time to press

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.629
progress of priorities this would be

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.759
so this will be a true test of who he is
and what he believes

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.300
let's see what he does

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.979
you shall not unbiased works

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.389
j cuter december twenty first twenty
four

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.300
now here we are

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.369
in april twenty thirteen

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:11.479
and we known by his works

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.360
the republicans in propose cutting so
security

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.479
they wanted it

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.729
it was their top priority

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.229
but they didn't have to do it publicly

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.150
is just as i wrote back then

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.099
president obama rolled to the rescue in
their darkest our

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.439
and gave them

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.629
the queen

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.789
anyway

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.090
gave them what they most wanted

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.150
and by the way in return

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.259
earn so far has gotten

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:37.580
as usual

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.070
absolutely nothing
