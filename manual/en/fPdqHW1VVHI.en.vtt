Teacher:
I'm waiting, Tyriq.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.440
I noticed that so many people

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.120 position:58%
quickly stopped what they were doing.
Everyone was so busy.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.800
So many people stopped, right away

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960 position:69%
and got ready, showing me they're listening.
It is time to clean up

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.070 position:97%
from choice, and then you're going to go right into your jobs.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.140
Zev?
Show me you're listening.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.150 position:98%
So, who can raise their hands to tell us what they're going to do

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.100 position:84%
when the lights go on, to start cleaning up at choice?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.860
Michael?
- House.


00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.980 position:73%
Tell me more, what are you going to do?Student:
We're going to clean up

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.540
the house area.
Teacher:
Okay. So you're going to clean up

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.640 position:69%
things that are around in the space station?
- Yes.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.040 position:97%
Who else can tell us what they're going to be doing when the lights go on?
Rachel?

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.280 position:72%
I'm going to be cleaning around my space ship.
Teacher: Kizziah?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.990 position:59%
I'm going to say goodbye to my camera.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.730
Okay.
Where are you going to put it?

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.710
In the box.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.930
And how about Daniel?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.900 position:63%
I'm going to put the snacks in the back.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.530 position:98%
Alright, if you have nothing to clean up, you can go right to your jobs

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.590 position:66%
and make sure you're helping other people.
