00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.970
Please describe the Mercedes-Benz Museum in one sentence.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.990
To me the Mercedes-Benz Museum is the most
 incredible and one of a kind statement of a brand,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.730
that exists for so many years.
 It's the car manufacturer with the longest history worldwide

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.090
and with an unbelievable history in racing.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.930
What is your favourite place in this Museum and why?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.020
This steep corner right here is my favourite spot
 for sure, because of these racing cars.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.030
I have driven most of them, and this is 
why I especially love this place.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.600
Do you still remember your first car?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.300
The very first car, although it didn't belong to me, 
but that I drove was an Mercedes V170.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.890
And that, of course was a great car and
 I remember it very well,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.930
because my first ride in this car was backwards. 
It was on a very narrow street

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.420
passing the wall of a house and a fence. I didn't
 crash though because I found the brake in time.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.650
These are my first memories and 
the first car I drove on my own.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.770
What connects you with this car?

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.250
The car, I'm sitting in right now is a really important
 car to me, because after lots of attempts

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.090
I finally won the 24 hours of Le Mans. 
That makes the car a very special part of my life

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.010
and that's why I love to see it again every time 
  I come around. Sometimes I'm also still driving it.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.280
That's the best thing about this museum.
The cars are not only presented here

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.100
they are still driven in the same
 way as back in the days.
