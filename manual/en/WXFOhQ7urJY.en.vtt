00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
President Obama:
Well, I just want to say how
much of a pleasure it is to be

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.934
able to see, once again,
Prime Minister Najib.

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:10.233
We just had excellent
conversations and consultations

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.100
at the APEC conference
that we hosted in Honolulu.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.367
This allows us to expand
discussions not only on our

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:18.333
bilateral relationship,
which is strong,

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:23.266
and the cooperation that
we've seen on issues like the

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:27.467
Trans-Pacific Partnership, but
it also allows us to discuss

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:32.533
how we can best use the East
Asia Summit to assure shared

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:37.166
prosperity and shared
security across the region.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:41.367
And so I appreciate the
extraordinary cooperation

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:45.100
that we've received on a
whole range of issues.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.367
We want to be a strong
partner with Malaysia,

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:49.266
and Prime Minister
Najib, I think,

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:54.967
has shown great leadership not
only in continuing to boost

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:59.900
Malaysia's economy, but also in
showing leadership on a wide

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.600
range of multilateral fora.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.967
So thank you very
much, Prime Minister.

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:05.667
Prime Minister Najib:
Thank you very much,
Mr. President,

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:08.767
for your very encouraging words.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:12.133
We believe we have a very, very
productive relationship between

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.200
our two countries.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.300
Before this, they've been
very strong in the areas

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.667
of trade and investment.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.967
The United States is our
fourth-largest trading partner.

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:23.266
On a comparative basis,
you're still the largest

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.867
investor in Malaysia.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:27.767
We certainly look forward
to expanding trade and

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.133
investment linkages.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.633
And with the TPP, hopefully we
can meet the deadline next year.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:37.133
We see great prospects in terms
of enhancing trade investment

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.600
between our two countries.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.433
And certainly we look
forward to working in

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.433
other areas concerned.

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:45.934
We are very committed to
ensuring peace and stability.

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:48.333
We're working with
you in the area of

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.166
nuclear nonproliferation.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.400
We're doing our part to make
sure that Malaysia is not a

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.033
transit point for illicit
goods that can be used for

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:02.867
nuclear proliferation.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:07.533
Working towards helping
you in Afghanistan.

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:11.367
And we're looking at new areas
of cooperation -- including

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:16.633
receiving 50 English teachers
from the United States.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:18.000
They are coming in January.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.834
So I'm excited
about the prospects,

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:22.266
and I look forward to
deepening, strengthening,

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:23.800
enhancing our bilateral ties.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.533
And I thank you for your
leadership in this.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.166
President Obama:
Thank you.
