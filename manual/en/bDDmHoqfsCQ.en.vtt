00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:02.796
WHEN YOU THINK OF CORN AND
SOYBEANS, YOU USUALLY THINK

00:00:02.796 --> 00:00:04.726
OF CORN ON THE COB
OR MAYBE EVEN TOFU.

00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:06.636
BUT HERE AT PURDUE,
THEY'RE COMING UP WITH NEW

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:09.156
AND EXCITING WAYS TO
INTEGRATE BOTH INTO NEW

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:10.046
AND EXCITING PRODUCTS.

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:11.056
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:15.946
I AM HERE WITH PROFESSOR BERNIE
TAO, AND I HAVE BEEN HEARING ALL

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:17.006
OF THESE FABULOUS THINGS

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:18.746
ABOUT THESE NEW PRODUCTS
STUDENTS ARE MAKING

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:19.896
OUT OF CORN AND SOYBEANS.

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:21.856
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US
THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT?

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:25.346
SURE. AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY,
WE'RE HERE TO EDUCATE STUDENTS

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:27.846
AND PROVIDE THEM WITH A WAY
OF ADDRESSING THE BIG ISSUES

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:29.836
THAT THIS GENERATION'S
SOCIETY FACES.

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.916
HISTORICALLY, EDUCATION HAD
ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT THE THREE R's.

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.976
WELL, TODAY IT'S ABOUT THE
FOUR E's, AND THOSE ARE ENERGY,

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:40.356
ENVIRONMENT, ECONOMICS,
AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:42.816
AND THE WAY WE'RE TRAINING
THESE STUDENTS ARE NOT JUST

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:44.776
ABOUT WHAT THEY LEARN IN
THE CLASSROOM BUT ALSO

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:48.166
TO TAKE THEIR SKILLS AND LEARN
ABOUT HOW DO WE REPLACE THINGS

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.426
THAT ARE USUALLY
MADE FROM PETROLEUM?

00:00:49.856 --> 00:00:51.326
HOW DO WE HELP THE ENVIRONMENT

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.626
BY MAKING THEM BIOLOGICALLY
BASED AS OPPOSED

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:55.146
TO PETROCHEMICAL-
OR CHEMICAL-BASED?

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:57.476
HOW DO WE MAKE A
DOLLAR DOING THAT?

00:00:57.856 --> 00:00:59.676
AND THIS WORLD AND
THIS COUNTRY MORE

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:02.946
THAN EVER NEEDS ENTREPRENEURS
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:05.136
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EDUCATING
STUDENTS HERE AT PURDUE FOR.

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:07.846
THE FIRST PRODUCT
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:09.766
AT TODAY ARE MELT-A-WAY
CUPCAKE LINERS.

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:11.306
AND TWO OF THE GROUP'S
PARTICIPANTS,

00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:13.216
MARCI AND ERIN, ARE
HERE WITH ME NOW.

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:15.436
AND CAN YOU GIRLS JUST
WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:16.836
OF HOW YOU CAME UP
WITH THESE LINERS?

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.486
THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS
DID SOME BRAINSTORMING,

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:21.966
AND WE WANTED TO REPLACE
THE NORMAL PAPER LINER

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.716
THAT EVERYBODY HATES TO PEEL
OFF WITH OUR EDIBLE LINER.

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:29.156
AND WE DID SOME RESEARCH AND
LOOKED AT SOME PATENTS TO SEE

00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:30.536
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
ELSE OUT THERE.

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:32.676
AWESOME. NOW, WHAT'S THE
NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS?

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:35.066
WE DID A LITTLE BIT MORE
RESEARCH ON HOW TO FORMULATE

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.036
AND HOW INGREDIENTS
INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER,

00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:38.356
AND SO WE PUT THEM TOGETHER,

00:01:38.356 --> 00:01:40.286
AND THE REALLY COOL
THING IS IT HAS BOTH CORN

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:41.266
AND SOYBEANS IN IT.

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:43.226
AWESOME. ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE GONNA HEAD

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:45.636
OVER TO THE OTHER TWO
GIRLS, ANNA AND VICTORIA,

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:48.016
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
REALLY YUMMY CUPCAKES.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:50.086
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS, WHAT
DO WE HAVE GOING ON HERE?

00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:52.236
OKAY, WELL, TO MAKE
OUR CUPCAKES,

00:01:52.316 --> 00:01:56.246
YOU JUST TAKE THE LINER AND
ADD IT TO YOUR MUFFIN TIN

00:01:56.246 --> 00:01:57.196
AND POUR THE BATTER IN.

00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:59.946
AND THEN AFTER YOU BAKE
THEM, THEY COME RIGHT OUT.

00:02:00.296 --> 00:02:01.876
YOU DON'T NEED TO
GREASE THE PAN.

00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:04.156
THAT'S PART OF THE
GOOD PART ABOUT THESE.

00:02:04.246 --> 00:02:07.026
AND THEN YOU TAKE THEM OUT,
AND THEY LOOK REALLY DELICIOUS,

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.816
AND YOU CAN EAT THE WHOLE
THING, LINER AND ALL.

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:11.946
WE'RE ALSO HOPING TO DO SOME
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT WITH THIS.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.826
AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY'RE
JUST PLAIN RIGHT NOW.

00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:16.276
BUT WE'RE HOPING TO CHANGE
THE COLOR OR TEXTURE,

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:17.476
MAYBE GET SOME DESIGNS IN THERE

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:19.276
AND HOPEFULLY USE IT
FOR CAKES OR COOKIES.

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:20.836
THAT IS REALLY AWESOME.

00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:22.596
NOW, LINER AND CUPCAKE
AND ALL, HUH?

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:24.076
SO, I'M JUST SUPPOSED
TO BITE INTO THIS?

00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:25.546
YEAH. HOW DOES IT TASTE?

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:27.676
WELL, LET'S FIND OUT.

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.306
ALL RIGHT, YOU GIRLS
COME ON OVER HERE.

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:30.856
WE'RE ALL GONNA TASTE
THIS TOGETHER.

00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:32.386
ALL RIGHT, READY, SET, GO.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:35.276
LET'S GRAB ONE!

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:38.356
ANOTHER INNOVATIVE
PRODUCT THAT USES SOYBEAN

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:40.886
AND CORN IS TERRA MAT,
AND ONE OF THE INVENTORS

00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:42.526
OF TERRA MAT IS HERE
WITH ME TODAY -- JACOB.

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:44.236
JACOB, WHY DON'T YOU GO
AHEAD AND TELL US ALL

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:45.046
ABOUT THIS GREAT PRODUCT?

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:47.816
WELL, TERRA MAT'S A REPLACEMENT
FOR ANY SORT OF CORK PRODUCT.

00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:50.056
IT'S MADE OF EITHER
SOYBEANS OR CORN.

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:50.906
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:50.906 --> 00:02:52.416
AND I NOTICE THERE'S
TWO DIFFERENT COLORS.

00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:53.446
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:55.586
THIS IS THE CORN-BASED PRODUCT.

00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:57.356
IT'S MADE OUT OF
ETHANOL BY-PRODUCT, DDGs,

00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:00.086
AND THIS IS THE SOYBEAN-BASED
PRODUCT, MADE OF SOYBEAN MEAL.

00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:02.006
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH
THIS TYPE OF CORK?

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:05.066
THIS CORK CAN BE USED FOR
ANYTHING, SUCH AS FATIGUE MATS

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:07.056
OR EVEN CORKBOARDS AND
WINE-BOTTLE STOPPERS.

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:09.966
NOW, WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS VERSION OF CORK

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:11.056
OVER THE NATURAL VERSION?

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.986
THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE THAT WE
SEE IS THE COST COMPARISON.

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:15.806
THIS COSTS ABOUT 60
CENTS A POUND TO MAKE,

00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:18.956
WHEREAS NATURAL CORK COSTS
ABOUT $7 A POUND TO MAKE.

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:22.376
WOW. THAT IS A GREAT
HOME-ECONOMICS SAVER, ISN'T IT?

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:24.886
WELL, JACOB, THANK YOU FOR
TAKING THE TIME TO EXPLAIN

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:26.846
TO US WHAT THIS LOVELY
PRODUCT IS CALLED,

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.326
AND WE HAVE JUST A LITTLE SLICE

00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:30.076
OF HEAVEN RIGHT HERE
FROM INDIANA.

00:03:31.536 --> 00:03:34.786
LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT
LEAST, I'M HERE WITH DAVID,

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:37.246
ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF
GREEN SILK TECHNOLOGIES,

00:03:37.376 --> 00:03:39.376
WHO INVENTED NATURE'S SILK --

00:03:39.516 --> 00:03:41.386
TOILET PAPER THAT'S
MADE OUT OF CORN.

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:44.346
AND TODAY WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
HOW IT WENT FROM THIS TO THAT.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.286
DAVID, CAN YOU WALK ME
THROUGH THE PROCESS?

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:49.626
SURE. WE WENT TO LOCAL FARM
FIELDS AND COLLECTED THE COBS

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:51.956
AND STALKS THAT ARE NORMALLY
JUST LEFT ON THE FIELD.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:55.256
WE THEN TOOK THAT AND REACTED
IT WITH HOUSEHOLD VINEGAR.

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:58.096
AND WE WERE ABLE TO FORM
THIS SILKY-SOFT FIBER

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.376
THAT WE MADE INTO TOILET TISSUE.

00:03:59.526 --> 00:04:00.416
WELL, THAT IS REALLY NEAT.

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:02.446
IS THERE ANOTHER PRODUCT
LIKE THIS OUT ON THE MARKET?

00:04:02.836 --> 00:04:06.036
NO. ACTUALLY, THIS PRODUCT
IS MUCH STRONGER, SOFTER,

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:08.616
AND MORE ABSORBENT THAN EVEN THE
MOST PREMIUM OF TOILET TISSUES

00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:09.676
THAT ARE CURRENTLY
ON THE MARKET.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.096
WELL, THAT IS ONE
REALLY COOL PRODUCT.

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:13.266
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:13.706
THANK YOU.

00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:15.096
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, DAVID.

00:04:15.786 --> 00:04:16.916
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT --

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:20.316
A FEW GREAT INVENTIONS
MADE FROM SOYBEANS AND CORN

00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:21.896
FROM STUDENTS RIGHT
HERE AT PURDUE.
