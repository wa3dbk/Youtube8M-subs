00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.230
After Capcom saw a decent success with the
original Street Fighter, they decided that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.430
the game was in need of a sequel.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.920
They wanted to continue the story but from
a new perspective.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.070
But somewhat into production, they decided
that the game was so far removed, that it

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.650
couldn’t be seen as a Street Fighter sequel.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:56.640
So instead they make it into a parallel game
series and gave it the title Final Fight.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.710
As stated, Final Fight is not a fighting game.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.610
Instead it is a side-scrolling beat ‘em
up, and one of the best.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.320
Like most games in the genre, Final Fight
has a simple but effective story.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.610
The Mad Gear Gang has kidnapped the mayor’s
daughter and are holding her captive.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.740
This is not something mayor Mike Haggar is
going to take.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.140
He recruits Cody, his daughter’s boyfriend,
and the two of them go out to take out the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.229
Mad Gear Gang for good.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.920
This being the Super Nintendo version, one
of the most disappointing things about this

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.219
game how the game left out a couple things.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:36.380
First off, the arcade version had an extra
playable character, Cody’s friend and awesome

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.359
ninja, Guy.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.079
Another big thing that was left out was the
multiplayer, making this a completely single

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.570
player game.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.380
Seriously, there is no option to play with
a friend, which is the best way to play beat

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.479
‘em ups.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.420
But if you understand that they had to do
these things because of space limitations

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:09.369
and just judge what it left, you will still
find a very good game regardless.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.900
If you have ever played a beat ‘em up, then
you pretty much know what to expect here.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.600
You start at the left side of a street and
you move to the right, fighting, punching

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.530
and kicking everyone along the way.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.209
The combat itself is very solid and very satisfying.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.230
With the great sound effects and character
reactions, you feel like your punches are

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.260
connecting.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.500
You can also pick up and use weapons on your
enemies, such as knives for extra damage.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.830
One thing that I like is how every enemy you
target has their name and life bar appear.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.261
It is both helpful for knowing the health
of the enemies and also funny to read some

00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.730
of the names.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.000
Final Fight for the Super Nintendo is a great
arcade beat ‘em up but suffers from missing

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.760
content, like Guy, multiplayer and who can
forget Poison.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.610
But even with these missing features, you
can’t go wrong with some Final Fight, except

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.690
if you are choosing it over Turtles in Time.
