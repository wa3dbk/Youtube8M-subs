00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.080
Today we're here to show you some of the how
to's on BMX riding. One of the very, one of

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.110
the most important things to me in in the
world of bike riding is is rhythm. Rhythm

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.360
is a key element towards riding properly in
dirt jumps. So here, let me give you a demonstration

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:54.860
on rhythm.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.620
Okay, so like I was saying, rhythm is one
of the most important things when it comes

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.670
to bike riding. Rhythm's similar to music;
you want to have a nice steady pace. Everything

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.080
needs to be real similar, every jump. The
first element towards rhythm is finding a

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.780
rhythm section. Here at Ninth Street, we have
the perfect rhythm section. It's not too big,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.530
not too small; the perfect size jumps. There's
a little bit, it's a little bit more difficult

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.549
to get over, but once you do you feel it,
you feel the great rhythm that it has. So,

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.920
you want to find the right speed. Clearing
the first jump is everything. Once you've

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.260
cleared the first jump, you want to land as
perfect as you can on that landing. Once you've

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.450
got both tires on the landing, you want to
come towards the bottom of the landing with

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.869
all your weight, forcing all your weight towards
the ground in the middle of the pits. The

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.930
pits are in between each jump. Now, once you've
gotten to the bottom, you want to pull everything

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.940
back up, and jump the next jump. Most rhythm
sections are built to be used the way they

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.511
are. You're going to, if you clear the first
one, you're definitely going to clear the

00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:07.180
second one. If you clear the second one, it's
going to go, so on. Now once again, the importance

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.950
of rhythm sections are if you get the rhythm
down, then you move the tricks towards the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.349
rhythm section. Tricks and the rhythm section
are always so good. And that's basically the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.959
elements to rhythm. Hopefully, you guys can
try it, and get a feel for it for yourselves.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.300
But like I said, it's one of my favorite things
in bike riding. I wouldn't ride bikes if it

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.950
didn't have rhythm.
