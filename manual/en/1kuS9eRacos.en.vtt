We gotta get moving if we're gonna keep AJ alive. We're runnin' outta' time

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.140
You are tired, Kenny. Maybe you should get some rest

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.254
I'm fine

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.680
Oh don't look at me like that

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.000
Yeah. I'm sorry. You're right

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.900
Come in!

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.180
Oh, we could use a hot meal right about now... Might be all I need

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.580
Please! Just take the kids.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.740
Why did you do this?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.840
Please, Clem, just... do as I'm askin'... this one last time.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.820
No! We're leaving! All of us. Together.

00:02:14.974 --> 00:02:16.974
Please, Clem, please...

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.580
Stop! Stop, okay? We're not staying, so just stop. That's that.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960
Kenny. Are you okay?

00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:30.514
I'm sorry, Clementine.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.920
I know I can be real shit sometimes.

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:37.234
I don't think so...

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.360
Thanks for not giving up on me just yet.

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:03.153
Come on. Let's get some sleep.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.120
Clem!

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.080
Clementine!

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
Lee?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.120
It's just a bad dream, sweet pea.
