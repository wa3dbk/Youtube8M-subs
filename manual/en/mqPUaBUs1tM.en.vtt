00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.590
Yo, what up?

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:24.580
El Tiro here, Dance Saves Lives, going to
teach a quick tutorial today on how to do

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.070
some hand isolations.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.789
What you're going to be doing is adding that
cheesy I'm-in-a-box mime stuff, and adding

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.040
cool concepts to your dance and freestyle.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.020
So the first concept that we're going to teach
is moving around in circle while keeping your

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.370
hands at the same spot.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.530
So if you're going to a low position, we're
going to put our right hand and left hand.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.120
Now, doing isolations like this is all about
the details.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.079
So even when I put my hand here, as if you're
going to put up a wall, when you put your

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.719
hand on something, you're hand is going to
naturally expand right when it gets to that

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.760
flat wall.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.620
So you want to add that even small detail
to it.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.670
So I put my right hand right where my imaginary
wall is.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.770
My hand's going to expand.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.330
And then I will put my left hand and make
sure it expands right at the same spot.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.790
So right here, I'm would be moving in a circle
with my upper body and I'll be trying to keep

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.960
my hands still on the same spot.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.009
Now of course, it's going to move just a little
bit, no one's perfect, but the concept and

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.170
you can see it right in the camera, is that
isolation movement like it's frozen, right?

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.200
Now there are some amazing dancers that you
can find on YouTube that can do this quite

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200
amazing.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.090
I'll leave some info of some people that I
think do the best isolations in the info box

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.090
below.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.409
Let me show you how you're not supposed to
do it.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.190
And maybe that might help you to learn how
to do it.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.450
When I go like this, see how my hands are
moving with me?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.560
Obviously, not a cool move.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.299
If you're having difficulty with this concept
right here, what you can do is go to a real

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.840
wall, put your hands on it and then practice
moving around.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.730
It's going to help with your muscle memory
and body control.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.750
The next concept that I will teach you about
isolation is like switching the angle of the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.750
tut.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.319
What I do is I will use my left arm, put my
left wrist up and so this will be my tut angle.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.940
I'm going to try and freeze this palm right
here.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.560
So what I'm going to do is use the rest of
my body to try to swing underneath as I try

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.930
to keep that right still.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.400
Now of course, it's going to move again, no
one's perfect, but I'm going my best effort

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.060
to try to keep it here.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.690
So that switch that we just did is like a
lateral level.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.910
Now we're going to try doing a vertical level.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.290
So this is going to be the most challenging
one we're going to do today in this tutorial.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.410
I'm going to use my left arm again.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.620
And this time, I'm going to try to go in a
whole rotation, trying to keep this palm still

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.360
facing the floor like that.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.650
So I'll use my whole upper body, trying to
keep this still, moving around.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.200
Now, this is my halfway point, I just switched
it to the other vertical side.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.510
Now, I try to rotate it up over time again.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.459
For this one, the best way to practice is
actually putting your hand on the edge of

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.459
the table.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.564
You'll be over the table like so, table will
be right underneath.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:23.340
You're going to try moving your arm around,
as your palm will stay right there.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.209
Once you think you got that down, got your
muscle memory intact, you'll try without it.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.130
So I'll be right here, moving over, under
and over again.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.409
So those are some quick three types of isolations
you can add to your freestyle today.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.379
