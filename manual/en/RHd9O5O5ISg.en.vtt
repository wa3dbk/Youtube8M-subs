Hi, everyone from Saigon Vietnam my name is LeDuey

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'd just finished doing the clip,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and taking my coffee break

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm in Saigon's CBU inside Highland cafe

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Today Lick no.8 is in E minor pentatonic scale. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Connecting patterns #5 and #1 together.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You should play it in different keys and positions, not just in E

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Ok, here it is, lick no.8

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We can also play it backward like this.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Let try it out with the band

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Ciao from LeDuey and see you in the next video, bye-bye!
