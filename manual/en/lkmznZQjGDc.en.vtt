Hi my name is Lauren and today I'm here to
discuss transitioning from a relaxer to naturally

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.010
curly hair. Usually if you are getting a relaxer
you have some sort of curl within your hair.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.100
Unfortunately there's not much that we can
do in order to change your hair that's growing

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.919
in. The relaxer is permanent so therefore
your hair that is relaxed is going to be a

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.750
little bit more work on your part in order
to transition if you are looking to grow your

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.260
relaxer out. What I do recommend is using
a styling agent that is for straightening

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.450
hair. Putting it in your hair when it's damp.
You are going to want to use a vented paddle

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.360
brush and you are going to want to use your
blow dryer to start off in getting your hair

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.660
straight. You are going to really want to
pull on your hair and focus on that root.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.570
Because the ends for you are going to be a
lot easier for you to straighten it if they've

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.650
already been relaxed. You want to use your
brush to really grab those ends and start

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.100
pulling those ends straight as you are drying.
After you are done drying I would definitely

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.390
use a heat protectant and I would go through
and anywhere that you cannot get your hair

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.430
straight enough in order to match the rest
of the relaxed hair, I would go through and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.010
use a flat iron in order to make it a little
bit better. That way you'll get more consistency

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.280
from root to end for your hair. Now using
so many hot tools and in order to make your

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.010
transition a little bit less noticeable to
the naked eye, plus a little bit more comfortable

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.670
for you would be to go through those steps
in order to get your hair straighter, as straight

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.090
by the root as it is towards the end or as
relaxed as it is towards the ends. Since you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.440
are going to have to use so many hot tools
you are going to want to use some the protecting

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.420
agents for your hair. That way you do not
damage it. Also considering you will be using

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.480
more hot tools in order to transition a little
bit more smoothly from your relaxed hair into

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.250
your natural hair, you are going to want to
wash your hair on every three day basis, or

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.670
every other day basis. Since you will be doing
a lot to make your transition a little bit

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.790
easier you are not going to want to wash your
hair as often so that way you do not have

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.060
to use as many thermal tools and damage your
new growth that is coming in, plus your ends.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.840
And that is how to transition a little bit
more smoothly from relaxed hair.
