Lizzy's top five unusual,
appetizing pizzas!

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:13.866
<c.yellow><i>Lizzy's top five unusual,
appetizing pizzas!</i></c>

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.066
<c.yellow><i>The Ranking Is Up To Me</i></c>

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.133
<c.yellow><i>A bubbly and eccentric girl
Lizzy of Orange Caramel</i></c>

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:27.066
<c.yellow><i>Let's find out which unusual
pizzas she's loving</i></c>

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.600
Today, I've prepared
some unusual pizzas.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:36.400
We wore pizza dresses when
we were promoting 'Catallena'.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.533
You're right.

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:42.566
With that in mind, I prepared
five kinds of pizzas.

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.700
There's so many!

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.033
We're especially excited
about this pizza.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:51.833
<c.yellow><i>A cheesy pizza with a thick dough
Original Chicago pizza</i></c>

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.200
<c.yellow><i>How does the Chicago pizza taste?</i></c>

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.700
<c.yellow><i>Yum...</i></c>

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.600
- Is it good?
- How is it?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.866
There's so much cheese
on the thick dough.

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.533
It's very American-feeling.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.200
I feel like I'm in Chicago.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.000
Let us try some.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.166
Chicago is famous for pizza.

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.166
Nothing is for free.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.366
Do math!

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.000
<c.yellow><i>Raina VS Nana
Math battle</i></c>

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.500
I'll win for sure!

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.900
<c.yellow><i>Raina: 71</i></c>

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700
<c.yellow><i>Nana: 74</i></c>

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.200
- You got it wrong.
- Really?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.600
- You said 'plus two'!
- Yes.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.000
<c.yellow><i>Nana won the math battle!</i></c>

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.100
Oh, it's 74...

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:38.800
I can't believe
I lost to Nana!

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.900
I'm an embarrassment
to my family.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.266
I feel hurt...

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:43.900
How could you lose to Nana?

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.866
<c.yellow><i>How does the Chicago
pizza taste to Nana?</i></c>

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.333
<c.yellow><i>She's in bliss!</i></c>

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.900
I'm making a weird face.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.800
<c.yellow><i>She doesn't want
to share the pizza!</i></c>

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.300
- I expected this taste.
- Really?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.933
It tastes strongly of cheese.

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.233
Let's move on.

00:01:58.233 --> 00:01:59.366
Can't I have some?

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:04.400
<c.yellow><i>Pizza topped with flowers
Flora pizza</i></c>

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.966
Flowers that are pretty like me!

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.800
<c.yellow><i>What's wrong with her?</i></c>

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.766
It's time to taste myself.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.400
They're real flowers.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.633
<c.yellow><i>How does the Flora pizza taste?</i></c>

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:19.300
It smells like grass.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:23.133
You won't get cravings
for this particular taste.

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:25.933
But it's good for a light meal.

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:31.366
<c.yellow><i>The toppings are inside the dough!
Bachelor pizza</i></c>

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:34.133
This pizza is a bachelor.

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:36.066
<c.yellow><i>He looks delicious!</i></c>

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:38.866
- They look like big tortillas.
- I agree.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.300
<c.yellow><i>Om nom...</i></c>

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.166
<c.yellow><i>It looks delicious!</i></c>

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.200
<c.yellow><i>How does the bachelor
pizza taste?</i></c>

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.133
Is it tasty?

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.066
<c.yellow><i>It makes her gasp
with surprise!</i></c>

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:50.333
It must be really good.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:51.866
- It's delicious!
- Really?

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.900
Lizzy, can we have some?

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.333
Say 'I had a scary dream'
in an adorable voice.

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:01.833
<c.yellow><i>Raina is ready for the challenge.</i></c>

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.666
By the way, how old is Raina?

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.233
- Almost thirty.
- Be quiet.

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:08.866
<c.yellow><i>Looking forward to it...</i></c>

00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:13.533
<c.yellow><i>Raina is about to
switch on her cuteness!</i></c>

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:16.466
<c.yellow><i>Whine...</i></c>

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:20.166
I had a scary dream!

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.100
<c.yellow><i>They can't stand it...</i></c>

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.033
<c.yellow><i>Applause!</i></c>

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:28.633
<c.yellow><i>Embarrassed...</i></c>

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:29.400
You win!

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.666
You have to do it, too!

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:34.933
<c.yellow><i>It's Nana's turn!</i></c>

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:36.766
<c.yellow><i>Let's wait and see!</i></c>
Good luck!

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:40.166
<c.yellow><i>Nervous...</i></c>
I had a scary dream!

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:41.966
<c.yellow><i>Baa...</i></c>

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:43.900
<c.yellow><i>What the hell?</i></c>

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.166
<c.yellow><i>Sob...</i></c>

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.333
<c.yellow><i>What was that?</i></c>

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:50.033
Please edit this out!

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.366
<c.yellow><i>Embarrassed...</i></c>

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.066
Eat the pizza!

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.800
Can I really have some?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.133
<c.yellow><i>Let's all be cute!</i></c>

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:58.566
- Life is hard.
- I know.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.466
<c.yellow><i>Was the bachelor pizza
worth all this effort?</i></c>

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:07.766
<c.yellow><i>OMG!</i></c>

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:09.766
<c.yellow><i>The bachelor is popular!</i></c>

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:13.033
It's too messy to have
in front of your boyfriend.

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:14.566
<c.yellow><i>Don't eat the bachelor
pizza in front of your crush!</i></c>

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.666
<c.yellow><i>Plenty of meat and vegetables
Wrap pizza</i></c>

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:23.600
<c.yellow><i>Wrap the dough around
the meat and vegetables.</i></c>

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.933
We'll get onion breath.

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:29.233
<c.yellow><i>Shoving it in...</i></c>

00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:32.066
You shouldn't eat this in front
of your boyfriend, either.

00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:33.033
It'll be a disaster.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.166
<c.yellow><i>How does it taste?</i></c>

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:37.800
You can taste the meat
more than the pizza.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:41.300
I'd like to have this
with dipping sauce.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.666
<c.yellow><i>Lots of fresh salmon!
Salmon pizza</i></c>

00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:50.100
I've actually had
salmon pizza before.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.366
- The greens...
- Look very threatening.

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:53.966
It looks like a weapon.

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:55.900
<c.yellow><i>It's scary!</i></c>

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:59.100
<c.yellow><i>How does the fresh
salmon pizza taste?</i></c>

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:02.366
<c.yellow><i>What is her reaction?</i></c>

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:04.333
Have you fallen asleep?

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:07.100
Did my dark circles go away?

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.733
Salmon is good for
treating dark circles.

00:05:09.733 --> 00:05:11.000
Lizzy, you should
have lots of it.

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.966
I'd recommend this to
people who like salmon.

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:15.866
<c.yellow><i>A pizza that's perfect
for salmon lovers!</i></c>

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:19.500
<c.yellow><i>Lizzy's top five unusual,
appetizing pizzas!</i></c>

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.733
Lizzy's top five unusual,
appetizing pizzas!

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:25.600
It's time to rank the pizzas.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.533
First of all, I'll reveal
the fifth place.

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:29.633
Which is fifth place?

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:34.466
I like tomato sauce,
so it's the salmon pizza.

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:38.433
Personally, I want to have
salmon and pizza separately.

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:39.600
Fourth place is...

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.200
Me!

00:05:41.533 --> 00:05:43.133
The flower one!

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:47.466
It's very pretty, but
it could taste better.

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:48.500
Third place is...

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:52.933
<c.yellow><i>Wrap pizza</i></c>

00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:57.933
This kind of meat should
be eaten with lettuce.

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:03.966
I think pizza tastes better
with Western toppings.

00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:06.733
First place is...

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.733
I can tell by your attitude.

00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:10.500
<c.yellow><i>Which pizza did Lizzy
fall in love with?</i></c>

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:14.333
<c.yellow><i>The bachelor pizza made

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:17.633
<c.yellow><i>The Chicago pizza made her
feel like she was in Chicago.</i></c>

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.666
<c.yellow><i>Chicago pizza VS Bachelor pizza</i></c>

00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:22.566
I want to marry
this bachelor pizza!

00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:27.333
I think everyone
would agree with me.

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:28.566
It's really delicious.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.266
This is first place.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.500
Second place is
the Chicago pizza.

00:06:34.066 --> 00:06:37.233
The cheese and
the tomato sauce...

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:39.300
It really surprised me.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.766
We experienced a new world!

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:49.333
