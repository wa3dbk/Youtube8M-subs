hi i'm Dr. Pedersen and we're going to
be going over an exercise to help with

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
tennis elbow something that is really
good in rehabbing tennis this exercise

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.710
is fantastic for helping to strengthen
the muscle in what we call eccentric

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.869
loading something you should understand
about muscles, muscles can contract while

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.510
they shorten as  in my biceps
shortening as it contracts but they can

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.629
also lengthen as they contract that's as
I bring the weight back down. Most

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.879
muscles get hurt from a sports
perspective in eccentric loading which

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.129
is muscle lengthening as it contracts
and so this exercise is all based on

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.930
creating eccentric strength. So what
we're going to do is take, and these

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.770
steps are very important so we'll go
through them slowly. First thing we're

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.820
going to do is put our wrist back in
extension and our elbow by our side.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.619
We're going to put the Thera bar in our
hand stay in this position we're going

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.930
to take our other hand facing away from
us put it up on top of the Thera bar and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.220
with it back as far as it can go, our
elbow as far as we can, rotate and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.630
then we're going to take keeping our
wrist back bring our arms straight and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.829
then we're going to slowly let our wrist
go out. With that we're going to get

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.030
eccentric loading of this, a lengthening
of the muscle as we contract against the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.750
bar, we're also going to get a good
stretch right at the end. That shouldn't

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.680
be painful for you.
