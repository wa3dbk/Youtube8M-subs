00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:39.470
I have always had a drooping in my left eyelid
and was even present in pictures from when

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.810
I was a child.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.840
However, up until now, it never really gave
me trouble other than cosmetic.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.600
Now at 24 years old, I feel it may be worsening.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.400
Recently, I have been having headaches (on
that side) and discomfort and more of an overall

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.410
puffy feeling on that eyelid.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.600
Also, the conditions seem to degrade with
fatigue.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.900
Basically, I'd like to know if I should see
a doctor.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.980
Can it be corrected with surgery?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.870
Thank you for your question!

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.610
Based on your question, you've described that
your eyelid has been droopy since you were

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.390
a child.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.300
And that recently, at the age of 24, your
eyelid has been drooping further and you've

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.320
been developing symptoms such as headaches
on that side and you're asking if you should

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.080
see a doctor.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.580
When you have symptoms that are constant,
in a way it appears based on your question,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.290
the answer is yes, you should see a doctor.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.200
What I'm going to share with you is some of
my experiences of congenital ptosis and help

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.870
you understand what options you have in moving
forward.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:04.800
So, assuming that you are born with this drooping
eyelid, majority of the people have this history

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.001
have something called congenital ptosis.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:12.370
Ptosis mean there is drooping so it's congenital
eyelid ptosis.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.570
Now what that means is that the muscle that
lifts your eyelid did not develop the same

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.700
way as the normal eyelid or the eyelid that
has no droop.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.240
It means that muscle doesn't contract nor
does it fully relax.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.689
When we deal with congenital ptosis, if the
child has no significant ptosis where it is

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.319
affecting visual information before the age
of 6, then correction can be done at a later

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.659
time when it's more of an aesthetic issue
or functional issue.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:59.139
Now, one of the things that happen during
congenital ptosis is that it can get worse

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.120
as people get older as the facial structure
changes.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.819
And one of the things that we also observe
is that a lot of times the compensation that

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.770
people do when people have a drooping eyelid
is to raise their eyebrow.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:23.020
And very often, especially when the skin is
more tight, you're able to effectively raise

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.120
the eyebrow and lift the eyelid.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.689
As you get older, there's a little bit more
stretch and that compensatory action can doesn't

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.280
work as well.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.470
It's very common for people who have a long
history of ptosis to say it's worse at the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.060
end of the day.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.180
One thing also to be aware of, in my experience,
is that people with ptosis are particularly

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.480
bothered if that eye that is being affected
is the dominant eye.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.549
There is typically in every one an eye that
is the preferred eye where the brain wants

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.019
to see out of that eye.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.000
And it's referred as ocular dominance or the
dominant eye.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.579
So, it is possible, that the source of your
headaches is related to the activity of the

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:22.760
muscle called the frontalis muscle that raises
your eyebrow having tension and spasm.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.530
Again, my recommendation is that you see an
ophthalmologist as well as any other doctor

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.310
if the ophthalmologist can't give you any
explanation related to your headaches and

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.720
your symptoms.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.160
Now, assuming that everything is clear and
that you're ready to have a procedure, then

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.340
eyelid surgery for congenital ptosis is typically,
except for the type of ptosis that is severe

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.140
with poor muscle function, is typically some
type of surgery on the levator muscle.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.340
The levator muscle is like the word elevator
but without the letter "e" that lifts your

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.880
eyelid.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.500
And generally, when I deal with adult patients
with congenital ptosis, I do something called

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.690
levator advancement.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.071
This way, I can move the muscle forward but
not sacrifice any of the muscle but can be

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:24.260
avoided in terms of a resection.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:31.280
So that type of procedure is done so that
the eyelid is more in the appropriate level

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.320
but in a more social interaction.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.570
Remember, that muscle doesn't contract or
relax like a normal eyelid muscle or a normal

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.180
levator muscle.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:49.300
So it will be variable in terms when you look
down or when you look up.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.030
So 9 out of 10 times, people are very happy
when their eye looks good, when they're looking

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.030
straight ahead.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:06.260
It looks good for pictures, it doesn't draw
attention in a social situations and it works

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.740
out pretty well.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.290
But it's important to understand, there is
a possibility that the eyelid in that type

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:20.040
of surgery can be too open, too low or not
exactly having the right contour.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.390
So in my practice, I always tell my patients
that 95% of the time that it works out great.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:33.060
After one surgery, 5% of time, you may need
enhancement and that being said, you many

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.750
need an enhancer.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.340
So you need to understand going into that
decision.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:48.940
So again, you may benefit from a cosmetic
or levator enhancement procedure to lift the

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.420
eyelid if it does affect your vision.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.340
But please visit a doctor about investigating
these symptoms that you have and once that

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:08.340
is cleared up, do some research and find that
right oculofacial surgeon to help you with

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.020
your drooping eyelid.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.840
I hope that was helpful and thank you for
your question.
