00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.530
Why does Ray Peat eat ice cream?

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.750
Doesn't that just make you fat?

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.549
Actually, according to Ray Peat eating ice
cream is actually good for you.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.950
I was always told that ice cream was junk
food, and that I should stay away from it.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.070
Actually the dairy, sugar and fat content
is a great combo for reducing stress hormones,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070
and providing your body with some much needed
nutrition.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.760
They certainly don't call ice cream a comfort
food for nothing.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.070
Don't just eat any ice cream though.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.280
There are many brands that can do more harm
than good.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.510
What is the best ice cream brand?

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.710
Ray Peat's favorite ice cream is Haagen Daz.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.640
The ingredients are simple and healthy.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.510
Nothing artificial, especially if you go for
a plain flavor like vanilla or chocolate.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.500
What do I want to avoid?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.160
Isn't Breyers ice cream healthy too?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.160
While Breyers has a lot of natural ingredients,
they do have one downfall: Tara gum.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.640
What's so bad about Tara gum?

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.289
All of the gums including Tara gum and Guar
gum, along with Carrageenan, create inflammation

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.740
in the body.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.380
They are powerful allergens and have been
linked to colitis, digestive issues and other

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.759
conditions.

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.289
Haagen Daz is so expensive.

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.329
What are my alternatives?

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.450
You can always get an ice cream maker and
make your own ice cream.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.899
Then you know for sure what the ingredients
are.

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.110
Who else would have thought that ice cream
was a health food?

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.209
Matt Stone also promotes ice cream.

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:42.490
He says that it has the same nutritional profile
as breast milk.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.570
That makes it a perfect food.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.959
Can you lose weight eating ice cream?

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.399
Not if you eat too much of it.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.939
Just because it is healthy and good for you
doesn't mean it is a weight loss aid.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.259
Stick with milk and low fat dairy if you want
to shed the pounds.
