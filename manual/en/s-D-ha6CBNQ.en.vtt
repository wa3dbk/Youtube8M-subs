00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hi there!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, we believe all children deserve an education 

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.000
because it transforms lives

00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:18.100
It helps break the cycle of poverty

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:20.100
and fills the future with possibilities.

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.100
That´s where we come in. 

00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:24.100
We may be soft but we´re working hard 

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.100
so more children can go to school.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.200
However, we can´t do it alone.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.200
For everyone of us bought

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.200
IKEA Foundation donates one euro 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.200
to UNICEF and Save the Children 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.200
and together we help children get the education they deserve.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So from all of us, thank you for contributing to the Soft Toys for Education Campaign.
