SECRETARY KERRY: I don't think we need these
big, formal podiums, but let me - it's my

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.240
great pleasure to welcome President Kabila
of the Democratic Republic of Congo to Washington.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.800
I'm very, very happy he's here.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.500
He received me in May on my trip to the D.R.C.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.290
We then talked about the efforts that he is
making with respect to strengthening democracy

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.360
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.820
And we're very grateful to him for the efforts
that he has made, the leadership that they've

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:50.350
offered to help deal with the problems of
the FDLR and the problems with the M23 group,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.219
which with his military effort and MONUSCO,
they were able to help disarm.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.809
That process is continuing and it is a process
that will help bring peace and stability ultimately

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.489
to the region.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.960
We also talked about economic development
and the future.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.310
We have a lot to work on and we look forward
to a good conversation today.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.840
Thank you, Mr. President, for being with us.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.840
Thank you.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.640
PRESIDENT KABILA: Thanks a lot, Secretary
of State.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.100
Of course, first of all, I am, myself, and
my delegation glad and happy that we finally

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.070
meet again in Washington, as I promised I
would come for this particular summit.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.460
And I'm glad that on the sidelines of this
particular summit that we're going to raise,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.560
once again, the three or four issues in as
far as the situation is concerned, not only

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.770
in the Congo but the region.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:00.130
But it's worth noting that since we met, I
believe one, two months ago, the situation

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:08.970
has continued to evolve and move forward in
the right direction, and that now the Congo

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:18.810
is living the era of peace and that we are
moving towards stability and long-term stability

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.470
in all sectors - not only security but also
economic development and the development of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.660
the region as a whole.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:40.530
So once again, I'm glad that we're here as
per the invitation, and I hope that in our

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:49.590
discussions we definitely are going to raise
those issues and chart the way forward in

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.590
our relations.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.590
Thanks a lot.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.260
SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you, my friend.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.310
Thank you, sir.
