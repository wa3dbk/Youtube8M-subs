00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.359
"Beans, Beans, They're 
Good For Your Heart"

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.296
I’ve talked previously about the 
anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:14.364
of various phytochemiclas in beans, 

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:19.633
but there are protective effects on 
the cardiovascular system as well. 

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.558
Plant-specific compounds can have a 
remarkable impact on the health care system

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:25.573
and may provide therapeutic 
health benefits, 

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:28.932
including the prevention and/or treatment 
of diseases and disorders - 

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:33.204
antioxidant effects, anti-inflammatory, 
liver protective, blood cholesterol-lowering, 

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:37.269
blood pressure lowering, as well as prevention 
of aging, diabetes, osteoporosis, 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.282
DNA damage, heart diseases, 
and other disorders. 

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:43.814
Those without legumes in their 
daily diet, for example,

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:48.949
may be at quadruple the odds of 
suffering high blood pressure.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:57.455
Legumes such as chickpeas have been used to treat high blood pressure and diabetes for thousands of years. 

00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:01.664
Here’s what they can do 
for cholesterol levels.

00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:04.797
Researchers took people on a 
diet high enough in fat 

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:08.831
to rival the cholesterol levels in 
the Western world, around 206. 

00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:12.135
Swapped in chickpeas for some of 
the grains that they were eating, 

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:17.366
and in five months their cholesterol 
dropped about 20% to 160, 

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.467
almost down to the target, 
which is around 150 . 

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:24.565
A reduction of more than 15% 
in most of the subjects, 

00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:29.323
and its sustained action during long-term 
administration, not only indicate a definite benefit,

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:34.035
but show that chickpeas are superior to 
many cholesterol-lowering substances. 

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:37.869
In a randomized crossover trial, 
adding 2 servings a day of 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.300
lentils, chickpeas, beans, or split peas 
cut cholesterol levels so much 

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:49.590
that many participants moved below the range for 
which statin drugs are typically prescribed. 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.970
But I want to go back to the study, 
 because they really buried the lead. 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.800
The participants were started 
out on a low fat diet. 

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:03.530
Really low fat, and so their cholesterol started 
out at 123, well within the safety zone. 

00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:09.440
Only after packing their diet with saturated 
fat were they able to boost their cholesterol 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.640
up to typical American levels, 
which could then be ameliorated 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.710
by adding chickpeas to 
their lousy new diet. 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.800
But it’d be better if they just 
ate healthy in the first place 

00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:23.400
or even better healthy 
AND the hummus. 

00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:28.300
A healthy diet with 
lots of legumes.
