ALLYN CHRISTOPHER: All right, we're going
to put the back wheel on. Now, this is a little

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.931
bit different than the front ones only in
the sense that you already know is it does

00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:10.350
not have a shield on it, okay? And that's
all right because this is a passive wheel;

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.270
it actually doesn't engage or deal with the
turbine at all. A little secret though is

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.689
that if you chew up one of these wheels, you
can actually switch this one out as a backup

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.019
'cause, again, it's just open, it doesn't
get chewed up. Try not to do that, but be

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.529
aware that it can't flip into place and that's
why this one has the teeth. Just, you know,

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.500
you just make one mold. Smart, just like all
the other ones, we are replacing the--but

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.750
these are the original parts except for the
brass lock washer which comes new in your

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.309
kit. And that's pretty much the last thing
you're going to find in that kit. So we're

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.521
going to put this beside here, and now, I
started to pre-install here, you're going

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:50.940
to notice, under here there is the--there
are little guides to stop this thing from

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.360
spinning. So, I'm going to try to gently set
it roughly in place here. Now, it has been

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.670
worn over age. I'm going to put my finger
on it, okay? And we're going to actually take

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.750
one of this out to make it just a bit easier
on the install process. I'm going to try to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.580
set this through. Oh boy, here we go. Set
this through the hole. All right, now, this

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.180
is [INDISCERNIBLE] wrong hole there. There,
right there. There you go. See, it's all easier

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.240
said than done, I swear. Okay. And I'm going
to place it in. We're going to try to get

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.050
it started. Now, with the original screws
in place here, sometimes it's a little bit

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.500
difficult. I'm going to use a regular--get
in there--Phillips head. That's it. I'm going

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.220
to try to massage it into where it needs to
be. Get them on, I'm feeling it. Got it. It's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.220
real tactile thing. There we go. It's at home.
I can feel it pushing it through. Now, again,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.781
I'm not going to tighten it too much 'cause
that's going to make the installation of the

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:59.530
other one just a bit easier. So, here we go,
I'm going to set that in place. Now, I'm going

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.590
to flip the whole thing over. All right. I'm
going to try to begin maybe a mini half thread

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.760
there if we're lucky. Come on. There we go.
Pressing it in to make sure that rails will

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.520
catch it. Hold my finger on it and we're going
to get that screwdriver, trying to do much--you

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.830
drink too much coffee, you get the shakes.
All right. There we go. All right, it's bit

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:35.180
on both of them. All I got to do is give them
a couple of love twists. And now, we got all

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.180
of your wheels attached.
