When I started in 1980 on the amphibian catalog,
it had been a hundred years since this had

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.570
been done.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.730
So it was an enormous amount of work to catch
up because the number of amphibians had basically

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.450
quadrupled.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.780
Conservation agencies and regulatory agencies
really needed to have agreed-upon references

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.630
so they all knew that they were speaking the
same language.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.470
CITES, which is the Convention on International
Trade of Endangered Species and the International

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.719
Union of Conservation of Nature, which is
a big umbrella group for conservation agencies,

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.219
they wanted these catalogs done.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.000
We've got 7,170 species of amphibians.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.410
Probably half of all the publications that
have ever been done on amphibian taxonomy

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.150
have happened since 1990.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.710
We're learning about these things right as
they're going extinct.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.700
The conservation people need to know what
they want to conserve.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.020
They need kind of unbiased expertise, and
I provide that.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.280
It turns out it's very useful for the scientific
community because they can very rapidly go

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.630
and find out what the relevant literature
is.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.860
The amount, and I think the quality of amphibian
research worldwide jumped because people could

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.770
access literature, and they could find out
what they otherwise might be ignorant of.
