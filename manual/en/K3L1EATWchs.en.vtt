00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.140
How can I get my water to break?

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.670
If your water hasn't broken during labor,
the doctor has a tool that looks like a crochet

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.400
hook specifically for that purpose.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.100
I want my water to break now.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.720
That isn't a good idea unless you are inducing
labor, too.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.450
The amniotic sack protects the baby from infection,
and you don't want it to break unless the

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.110
baby is about to come out.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.660
Let's say I was in labor.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.700
How could I get it to break?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.600
Walk around a lot.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.440
As the baby shifts down in the birth canal,
it should break.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.270
I've heard it can break for other reasons.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.760
It sometimes breaks as the baby goes head
first down in the cervix, before she has serious

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.390
contractions.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.290
There are women who wear maxi pads in their
ninth month of pregnancy because they are

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.460
afraid others will think they wet their pants.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.851
There are a lot of stories of children thinking
she had an accident, as well as waking up

00:00:57.851 --> 00:00:59.780
to a soaking bed.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.360
It isn't that much water.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.189
Well, it isn't even water but urine and other
outputs from the kid.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.850
I heard that breaking the water early makes
the labor go faster.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.979
No, but when the contractions come down on
an empty uterus, they hurt a lot more.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.450
But they do more work.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.260
That depends on how dilated you are.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.610
If you aren't dilated, the contractions take
about as long to widen the cervix so that

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.560
the baby comes out.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.420
Why would the doctor need to break the water
if it doesn't matter?

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.010
Because few women can push a baby out with
the amniotic sack still filled.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.570
The cool pictures you see on Reddit of a baby
in the amniotic sack are usually Cesareans.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.080
As are the twins that doesn't even know they've
been born.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.740
If they'd been pushed through the birth canal,
squished and pulled for a few hours, they'd

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.620
know they’d arrived.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.130
But breaking your own water won’t speed
that process up much, but will make it hurt

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.430
more.
