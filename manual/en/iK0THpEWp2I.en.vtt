00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.560
Again, welcome back. I’m Jenny Karl, and
we’re moving on to flawless foundation.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.370
My model has “over 40” skin, so I’m
going to use a moisturizer that’s for a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.200
drier skin type, rather than oily skin type.
She has beautiful skin, so I don’t need

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.230
a heavy coverage, but I need something that’s
going to giver her some moisture, so her skin

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.080
doesn’t look dry. It’s going to make her
look younger, and less aged. She has gorgeous

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.810
skin in the first place, so we don’t need
to use much. Probably a dime to nickel sized

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.820
amount is all anyone ever needs of a light
coverage foundation. Now when it’s a heavier

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:48.470
coverage, you need a lot less than that. And
you should really pick your foundation color

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.590
to match your skin tone almost exactly. Most
people think they need to pick their foundation

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.309
to go a little darker than their natural skin
tone, so that they don’t look pale and pasty,

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.680
and that’s not the case. You use a bronzer
if you don’t want to look pale or pasty,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.990
you don’t do a darker foundation, because
its just going to look like a mask on your

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.619
face, and its not going to blend in to the
rest of your body. And then you also want

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.310
to pick your foundation by your skin type.
Again, she has a drier skin type, so I’m

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.740
using a more moisturizing, lightweight foundation.
If you wanted fuller coverage, you’d use

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.999
a moisturizing cream, it’s a fuller coverage.
And if your have oily skin, you want to use

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.749
a foundation that’s oil-free, completely.
Or a powder foundation, and that’s going

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:40.859
to suck up all the moisture, or the oil. And
you want to blend really well into the entire

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.520
face, every nook and cranny. And I’m using
a foundation brush, and you can use your fingers

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.119
at home. Make sure your hands are clean. Or
you can use a sponge. I prefer the brush;

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:00.119
I think it makes the skin look smoother. Sponges
tend to pull, and get streaky. And sponges

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.529
tend to carry bacteria as well. You have to
change your sponge more often than your brush.

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:08.550
Your brushes, if you take care of them, will
last forever. And then I’m just going to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.840
take a powder, and I’m lightly going to
go around her T-zone, concentrating really

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.640
only on the parts of her face that aren’t
dry. So I’m not going near her eyes at all.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.350
Powder under the eyes can make the skin look
crepe, and accentuate the wrinkles, and that’s

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.900
exactly what we don’t want to do. And again,
less is more. You don’t have to put a lot

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.580
on, and you don’t have to look like you’re
wearing makeup. And finish down the neck also.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.040
That’s another little tip. You don’t want
to stop here; you want to take it down a little

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.560
bit. And that’s it, now we are ready for
some color.
