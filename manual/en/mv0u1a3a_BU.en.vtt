Hello, my name is Luis Estrada and I'm a software
developer. In this video, I'll show you how

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.500
to create a frame based web page with FrontPage.
FrontPage is registered trademark of Microsoft

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.289
a company to which I have no affiliation.
I created a new folder called frames inside

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:32.070
the my website directory. We will create a
frame web page linking to the home in gallery

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.540
pages that I have in this folder. FrontPage
does not allow us to freely create a frame

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.409
page rather it makes us choose from any other
of the available frame templates. After choosing

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.280
any of the templates, we can customize it
by adding or removing frames and changing

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:02.120
their size. Press file and new then choose
the lower page templates link and click on

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:12.549
the frame's pages tab. When you select any,
you get a preview of the frames. Choose a

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.420
template according to your needs. For this
example, I'll use the banner and content because

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.960
this is probably the most common configuration.
This template consists of a frame that contains

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.750
the title of the website, a logo or an advertising
manner at the top. On the left side, we have

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.350
the content frame that holds the navigation
menu of the website. In the center, we have

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.439
the main frame that holds the actual information
to each page. To fill each frame, you can

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.060
either create a new page or use an existing
one. When you press of the set Intel page

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:01.090
button, you can browse to the location of
the file. Then you adjust the height or width

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:13.790
of the frame. Now, let's press on the new
page button to create the top page. We will

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:26.280
insert a banner in the page. So, press insert
picture and choose from file.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:38.550
Select your banner image and center it. Next,
let's insert a navigation bar for the content's

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:50.760
frame. Press new page. Select insert and hyperlink.
Select the whole page and enter text for the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:06.840
link. Then press the target frame button and
select a main frame. Now, you insert another

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:21.580
link for the gallery page.
Press on the save button. FrontPage ask for

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:31.290
the name of the top frame. We will call it
top dot htm. Then we have to give a name to

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:43.160
the navigation page call it left dot htm.
Finally, we need to save the page holding

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.940
the frames. We will leave the default index
name because this is the first page more visitors

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:59.510
will see and it is a good practice to call
it that way. Now, open the index dot htm file

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.600
in your web browser. When you click on the
navigation links, you will see the new page

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:18.150
presented in the main frame.
I'm Luis Estrada and I just showed you how

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.759
to create a multimedia website using FrontPage.
