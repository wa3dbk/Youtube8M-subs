00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.591
Hi guys, this is Eva and here I'm going to
read a cute well, not cute for the person,

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:12.340
but cute for me, sometimes when I read these
emails they are cute.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.810
I have huge pores that always appear and they
are quite sol.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.259
I don't really use a lot of makeup, but everything
I does, does not seem to work.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.199
19 year-old-female.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.760
So, uh, she's nineteen, which she meant is
pimples and they hurt.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.940
They are sore.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:47.200
So, I assume that this pimples cause they
are not always there, they just come and go.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.469
Spoke about this in my earlier video.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.530
I related to you, period.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.289
To your hormones.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:03.579
If the pimples are very painful and they actually
don't go away again guys, I don't know because

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.150
I don't see a sort of.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.659
As you can see, I just read you the email,
I'm trying to decide because even the verbiage

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.250
is not very clear.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:22.230
So it didn't say painful, it said sore so,
eh, I'm not clear but I will take an assumption

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.850
or two assumption.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.830
One that they are just pimples and then come
and they hurt.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.310
Before you get your period.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:43.079
The ??? they are pimples that are actually
closed off they come usually before you period.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.670
They are very hard to the touch.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.399
And you can't get rid of them.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.869
And there's nothing on the surface.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.130
It just inflames.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.140
There's no head, there's no blackhead.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.140
There's no puss.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.140
There's nothing.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.200
But they are very painful and they flare up
during or before your period and then they

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.439
go down and they still stay there.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:11.370
If that this the case, for you, my young dear,
nineteen year girl, and for all the millions

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.090
out there that have this same problem, of
pimples that actually don't go away but stay

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.510
in they are very hard and they are very painful.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.960
And they flare up.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.840
Before, during your period.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.519
The only thing that I can suggest that I can
do with that is see a dermatologist or even

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.700
a general practitioner.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.330
Cause they really are big signs.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.540
Have them inject it.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.830
They inject it with cortical steroids.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.470
Which is Cortizone.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.409
They inject a dab with a needle in.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.650
That cortical steroid, which is a Cortizone.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.650
Which is anti-inflammatory.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.659
That will totally shrink the pimple which
is like an abscess under the skin, shrink

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.400
it until it disappears.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.959
Because it will eliminate, it will due to
the injection it will reduce eliminate the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.230
inflammation.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.330
Inflammation goes away.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.599
The whole thing shrinks.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.110
And it will go away.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.620
If you have hard close pimples, that's the
only solution that I can give you is to go

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.160
to the doctor.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.190
Either the dermatologists or even you family
practitioner, anybody can do it.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.080
Inject a little bit cortical steriod which
is cortisone into this pimple.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.349
You require one injection most of the time.

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.959
A little squirt.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.220
Less than a cc goes into this.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.580
And they shrink, three or four days.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.700
And after two weeks, they will completely
disappear.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.330
Sometimes they might leave a little mark.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.709
And if it leaves a mark of discoloration,
then you can go to my website and you can

00:03:52.709 --> 00:04:03.459
buy an HPA Lightening Treatment or if you
are black or dark you can buy the Mandelic

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:11.090
Acid and that will help to lighten the discoloration
that was left there from the pimples.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:19.100
Where that is left after the injections were
put in or it's left from acne, scars, from

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.330
pimples, from inflammation, the Mandelic Acid
will be very, very, beneficial and very, very

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.330
helpful.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.200
The Mandelic Acid is only helpful and beneficial
if the pimple is already gone and you want

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.570
to lighten that area.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:48.670
However, if you have a physical still some
breakouts then I suggest that you get the

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.330
Mandelic Acid treatment line which consists
of a cleanser, toner, moisturizer, Mandelic

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Acid.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:03.730
And if you really have breakouts, then you
get the acne solution.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.860
Treatment and the Mandelic Acid separately
to help lighten the skin.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.520
That's just generally speaking.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:19.290
However, if you have this problem these pimples,
and you've got the injections and it still

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.450
leaves some marks.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.450
The pimples went away.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.540
The swelling is gone.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.580
The pain is gone.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.420
Then you can use the Mandelic Acid or the
AHA Acid.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.740
You can go to my website and you can read
about it.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.340
And then get it just to rad it.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.320
But if it's hard, painful, inflammed, you
don't see anything, nothing that can be taken

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.320
out.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.690
Corticol steroid, injection.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.690
Okay.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.190
So until next time guys, keep on asking, and
I will keep on answering.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.280
Thank you.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280
Bye!

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.440
Eva!
