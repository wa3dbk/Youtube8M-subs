00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.879
This is kind of to demonstrate that it doesn't
matter what weapon is coming at you, whether

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.840
it's a knife, a jo, like the 5 foot staff,
or a sword, or if it's an empty handed attack,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.010
whether it's a grab or a strike, any technique
that we've got in Aikido can be applied to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.770
whatever situation. So we're going to go back
and do the same technique, but reapply to

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.590
a jo. Last time we did sokumen Iriminage with
the knife takeaway, this time we're going

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:38.449
to do a little bit more basic Jodori, or jo
takeaway. So again, Sokumen Iriminage. Daniel

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.699
is just going to come in with the ski. As
he does, obviously I need to get off line.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.660
I want to tap, keeping, one, start with my
hands as far apart, then put one on his hand,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.370
get in as deep as you can, and then I want
to slide in, and get my other hand over the

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:02.230
top. Face the same direction, bring this up,
and stretch both my arms out. So if Daniel

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.580
tsukis on this side, I want to enter, see
if I can get in as deep as I can, keep this

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.860
over the top, raise up, stretch the arms.
It's really the hips turning at the very end

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.850
that does it. Traditionally we would, again
place the jo on the ground and then walk through,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:40.170
or walk away. So for a test, nice and clean.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.390
Next would be an Uda. So that one was very
direct, okay. Maybe we come in and we can't

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:57.600
push; tenkan, cut down, then re-enter. So
as he comes in get to the outside, maybe I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.440
can't go this way, tuck and twist, when you
find space, again stretch. Again, if he's

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.090
doing a regular punch, technique would look
very similar, nice and easy, and through,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.150
okay. It's the exact same technique even with
the ski. Same thing, we're going to get off

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.310
line, turn, and cut. Okay.
