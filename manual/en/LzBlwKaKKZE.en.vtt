00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.069
Welcome to this shed floor framing video.
Here you will learn about the steps to framing

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.790
a shed floor!

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.490
This video shows you the necessary steps for
shed floor framing from laying out the rim

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.390
joists to squaring the joist system.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.891
The first step to building the shed floor
is to install layout marks on the rim joist

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.490
boards. Prepare the boards for the layout
marks by cutting the rim joist boards to the

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.230
length shown on the plans and then standing
the two rim joist boards on edge next to each

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.810
other. Make sure that the crown edge is on
the top sides and the ends of the boards are

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.640
flush with each other.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.320
Now you are ready to mark layout marks on
the two boards. We will be marking the floor

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.960
joist locations at 16 inches on center. Hook
your tape measure on the ends of the two boards,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.350
pull the tape measure down and put a mark
at 16 and three quarters inches. Then put

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.130
an X on the side of the mark closest to the
tape measure hook end to help you remember

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.360
what side of the mark the floor joist will
go on. Continue making marks every 16 and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.330
three quarters inches along the edges of the
boards.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.040
The reason you go three quarters of an inch
past is because the floor joist boards that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.921
you will be installing on the marks are 1
Â½ inches wide. If the center of the board

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:23.060
is to be at 16 inches on center, then the
edge will need to be three quarters of an

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.700
inch past the 16 inch point. It is easier
to line up the edge of the board with a mark

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.810
than it is to line up the center of the board.
Thus the marks are at 16 and three quarters,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.891
32 and three quarters, 48 and three quarters
and so on.

00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:38.891
Wall sheeting materials like plywood and drywall
come in multiples of 4 feet, and the 16 inch

00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:40.600
layout allows the edges of the sheets to meet
on the center of a floor joist or wall stud.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.560
Once all the layout marks are made you will
transfer marks to the other board and make

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.060
a line across both boards using a speed square.
Make sure that both boards have an x to show

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.909
the side of the mark that the joist will go
on.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.880
The second step in building the floor joist
system is to set the rim joists and floor

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.280
joists on the foundation rails.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.360
Start by separating the rim joists and set
them on the foundation rails. Make sure that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.780
the rim joist layout marks are still facing
up and that the layout marks start on the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.350
same end of the shed.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.650
Crown each of the floor joists and then set
them down on the foundation rails and align

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:36.630
them with the layout marks you made earlier
on the rim joists.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.030
The Third step is to nail the rim boards to
each of the floor joists. For 2x6 and 2x8

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.349
floor joists you will use 3 nails at each
connection. Make sure that each floor joist

00:02:47.349 --> 00:03:08.520
end is aligned with its respective layout
mark before nailing.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.349
The fourth step is to attach the rim boards
to the foundation rails. Line the rim board

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.319
outer edges up with the outer edges of the
foundation rails and then nail the rim boards

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.380
to the rails by toe-nailing at 16 inches on
center.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.020
It is also recommended to use an angled framing
connector every 3 to 4 feet to strengthen

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:39.060
the connection of the floor joist system to
the foundation rails.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.010
The fifth and final step is to make sure the
floor framing is square so you can attach

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.520
the floor sheeting.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.980
This is done by measuring diagonally from
corner to corner. Your goal is get both of

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.730
the diagonal measurements to be the same length.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.129
Measure the two diagonals and then move one
of the rim joist boards, and the floor joists

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.040
attached to it, parallel to the other side
until the two diagonal measurements are the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:19.479
same.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.490
This is a quick view of the diagonals on an
8x10 shed that has been squared.
