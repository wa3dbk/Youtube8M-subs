00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.339
a few years ago we did that story about
how mcdonald's uses this kinks line to

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.429
make its high hamburger meat and a
chicken nuggets right and basically what

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.370
it is it's is basically meet that has
been roundup very finely

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.560
and then they use something known as
uh...

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.369
ammonium hydroxide in order to kill all
the bacteria in the meat now this is not

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.989
like great cuts of meat right it's
basically like the odds and ends of the

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.120
animal that are left over and like i say
it would be obviously

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.760
uh... and then they have to use this
ammonium hydroxide because the fact that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.229
it has a ton of bacteria that and they
use this nasty slash

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:45.069
to make all of their products right so
um... compares the chef by the name of

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:48.540
jamie oliver who decided to really give
mcdonald's

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.829
hard time about this

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.970
and as a result mcdonald's u_s_a_ has
just announced

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.130
that they will stop using ammonium
hydroxide in their beef

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.990
walk you've got a huge immuno over a lot
of credit for associate in the maybe

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.780
using to get some attention and i have
that kind of a to z_ p_r_ move without

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.860
but looking at the job done on the other
hand i remove a bacteria

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.790
now twelve i think they've done another
way i want to find another way as well

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.860
who knows what that weight is but

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.090
well really fascinating about this story
and everyone already knows that's right

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.010
uganda canada or you go to a different
country and they have standards that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.800
they have regulations put in place so
fast food companies can't use the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
cleaning product in order to sanitize
the beat

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.780
machine so what was amazing to me is
that of spokesperson

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.470
from mcdonald's in canada uh... released
a statement saying out we've never use

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.619
this disgusting product in our neatly
we've always only used one

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.490
hundred-percent beef salt pepper and
that's it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.120
you know and i remember having a burger
when i was in europe wants and thinking

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.170
and it was a mcdonalds burger and
thinking wow distance of really good

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.970
the differences

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.310
but without they hide that's not the
same thing it's so different

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.150
yes we have no standards will eat
anything what what i was in town hun all

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.679
the restaurants have signs on them say
that don't worry no usb allowed

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.829
at because already fisher brought his
those guys do anything for a box so

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.080
diana's listen there be

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.420
the good that they use it's pink and
resisting is because they shave some of

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.920
the off of the bones thin the blood
mixes area that's why they got a use

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.659
that bacteria killing chemicals

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.549
to get all the bloodied center out of
the goodwill that's why you're already

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.089
have ninety nine-cent valium and
speakers

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.699
if you did producer for that to you
gotta find a way to do it so it's not

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:43.239
like a kid do with the bacteria doing
things just will cost you a little more

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.119
right

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.499
wallace code our own i never used to be
okay
