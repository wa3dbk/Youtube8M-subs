00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this episode ...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
...french joke...

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we learn how save one bullet in your gun charger

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and reload a litlle faster

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
*exercises*

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Again and as always the principle is very simply

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You spawn in sniper with M98 for example

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the reload of M98 iis particularly long

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that's why, whit my tips, you can reduce the reload time for the most part of weapon

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.000
ie you will reload when your charger is not empty

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.000
we immediately see the difference between the two

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
it's certainly small, but it's always good to take

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
At the left we can see the fast reload, at right normal reload

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's works for the most part of weapon, but not for PKP for example

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.010
some weapon of support class not working

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.010
regardless of the number of bullets remaining in the charger long as it is not empty

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.010
i repeat...

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:45.010
we will also see, in addition to saving time, we win one more bullet in charger

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:55.010
as you can see my charger have 30 bullets, and when i reload, i can reload a second time and i've 31 bullets 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.010
maybe it's difficult to understand, but try this in game, and see it's really simple

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.010
Thanks for watching, like if you like, bye bye :)
