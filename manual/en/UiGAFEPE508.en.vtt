Welcome to Product Spotlight!

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.040
I’m Dr. John Heiss, Director of Sports &amp; Fitness
at Herbalife and Lead Scientist behind our

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.910
Herbalife24 products.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.340
Herbalife24 is a comprehensive performance
nutrition program that meets the needs of

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.770
athletes 24 hours a day.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.279
One of the most exciting products in the Herbalife24
line is Prepare, our Nitric Oxide precursor

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.910
and Creatine supplement.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.650
As the name suggests, Prepare is designed
to be taken just before physical activity,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.070
it helps you get the most out of your training
session by enhancing Nitric Oxide in your

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.070
body.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.470
Whether you’re a serious athlete pushing
yourself to the max or just someone looking

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.470
for a performance edge, Nitric Oxide is a
special molecule perfect for athletes because

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.839
it expands blood vessels and allows more oxygen
carrying blood to reach working muscles, this

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.730
is crucial for athletes.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.440
Without adequate oxygen reaching muscles,
performance can be inhibited and no one knows

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.540
that better than our very own Dr. Lou Ignarro
who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his findings

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.140
in Nitric Oxide.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.530
Although both Niteworks and Prepare share
the same core ingredients for blood flow in

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.930
vascular support, L-Arginine and L-Citrulline,
Prepare is specifically tailored for athletes.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.010
We’ve added L-Orinithine Alpha Keto Glutarate
to stimulate additional L-Arginine production,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.380
a key precursor for Nitric Oxide production.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.979
Everyone has a natural but limited supply
of Creatine which is essential for fast twitch

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.079
muscle contraction but Creatine levels have
exhausted quickly during short intense efforts.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.610
Prepare works through supplemented diet with
Creatine to increase natural levels to support

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.149
muscle power.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.340
Prepare contains a moderate dose of Carbohydrates
that worked when enhanced uptake of Creatine.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.079
Unlike many other Nitric Oxide products, Prepare
has a mellow flavor so it’s pleasant and

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.909
easy to consume and like all Herbalife24 products,
Prepare contains all natural colors, flavors,

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.990
and sweeteners.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.530
You can try Prepare and all Herbalife24 products
by ordering today from an Herbalife Independent

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.530

Thanks for watching!
