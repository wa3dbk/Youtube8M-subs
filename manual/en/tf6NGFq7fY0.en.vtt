Word up Ya'll my name is Tweet Boogie, I represent
the South Bronx, had my first hip hop crew

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.219
at 14, I've done some work with Jay Z, Mary
J Blige, Destiny's child, travelled all over

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.470
the world because I teach hip hop culture
and right now I'm ready to teach you some

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.530
dance style for the club, lets get it started,
so the next move that I'm going to show you

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.359
is called the side look, pretty, pretty easy,
really basics, you don't have to feel like

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.970

look a hot mess on the dance flour so let

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:44.320
me show you what it looks like first, side
look, side look, side look, pretty simple

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.690
you want to look in the direction that your
going in, you want to take your arms bring

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.530
them to about your shoulders, good, the opposite
direction of where your going so if you step

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.850
into the right and your looking to the right,
boom your arms are going to be away from your

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.680
body so they should go opposite direction
to the left, look to the side good, bring

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.350
your left foot to you and your arms center
again, boom, your going to take the left foot,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.500

direction, boom to the side and then bring

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.730
them to the center again, boom what you looking
at, try it again, so you have side look, side

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.500
