00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.620
Hi!

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.460
So today I want to teach you about the different parts of your sewing machine.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.180
This is important because you need to know how your machine works.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.950
So that next time—when I teach you how to thread up your machine—

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.130
you'll be able to follow along a lot quicker.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.670
And also because if at any point you need to take in your machine for repairs,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.730
you'll be able to tell them what part needs to be fixed.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.370
Most sewing machines are built the same way, so what I will be telling you works with any machine—

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.230
even one from the early 1900s.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.890
They all have pretty much the same mechanics, it's just just presented in different ways.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.800
First, let's talk about the source of power.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.180
All machines have a chord that runs from the machine itself to the foot control, to the electric socket.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.900
This is a foot control. Depending on how hard you press down on this will be how fast your machine stitches.

00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:48.127
Whether or not your machine has an on-and-off switch, be sure to put up the [foot control];

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:50.807
so that you don't accidentally stitch something you don't mean to.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.940
This is the spool pin. They can be either horizontal or vertical.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.340
When we thread up the sewing machine, this is where the spool will go.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.720
This is a spool holder.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.823
You put this on after you put on your spool, so that your spool doesn't fall off when you're stitching.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.480
An important part of the sewing machine is the bobbin.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.833
So they can either come in metal, like this. Or plastic, like this.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.460
This is the bobbin winder spindle. This is where you put the bobbin when you're ready to thread it up.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.460
With some machines, there's a switch on the side. [On] both of mine, you have to push this over.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.640
Doing so allows for this to be able to be threaded up.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.780
When you're done with that, push this over.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.720
Because when you move this like this,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.480
that stops this part of the machine from working.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.340
So when you move it over like this,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.200
this part of the machine works.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.800
This is the bobbin winder thread guide.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760
When we're getting ready to thread up the bobbin,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.868
you're going to take the thread from the spool and you're going to pass it through here.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.360
This is the thread guide.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.300
When you're threading up your sewing machine, you're going to take the thread through here.

00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:01.529
This is the thread take-up lever.

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:04.469
This is part of when you're threading up your sewing machine.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.589
It is controlled by this hand wheel.

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:08.472
When you move this forward--

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.660
it moves the thread take-up lever.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.840
And then it also moves your needle.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.120
This is a face plate.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.137
This is one side of your sewing machine that protects the mechanisms inside.

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:24.160
Some sewing machines have a thread cutter on them.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.180
If your machine does have one, it will be located right around here on the side of the face plate.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.920
This is the needle plate.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.700
This is where you're going to put your fabric when you're stitching.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.160
And you can see the different measurements on here,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.560
that will show you how far in the seam you're stitching is.

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:41.376
This is an extension table.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.840
You can either leave it in if you have a larger project, or you can take it out.

00:02:46.283 --> 00:02:50.043
Especially if you need to use this whole way around here.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.180
This also acts as an accessory storage.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.180
So if you wanna put, like, extra presser feet or bobbins in here, you can do so.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.722
Depending on your machine, your bobbin could be located in one of two places when you're stitching.

00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:05.942
Either you have a push-in bobbin or a drop-in bobbin.

00:03:05.942 --> 00:03:08.800
If you have a drop-in bobbin that's like this machine,

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:11.822
then it will be located under this hook cover plate.

00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:16.046
And in order to open it you need to press this hook cover plate release button.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.240
If you have a push-in bobbin, on the other hand, first you're going to take this off.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.380
Then you're going to pull this down.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.660
Then you're going to take out the bobbin holder.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.020
This is the machine needle you'll be stitching with.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.100
This is the needle clamp screw, that keeps the needle in place.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.220
This is the presser foot that keeps your fabric under while you're stitching.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.900
This is the set screw that keeps the presser foot in place.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.600
And then this is the presser foot holder. This is how you'll change presser feet.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.080
So if you pull this,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.260
then you can take it out and you can add another one.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.720
This is the presser foot lifter. So when you pull this up,

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.449
the foot goes up.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.740
These dials indicate the thread tensions, stitch length, and stitch width.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.410
On my machine, stitch width is known as pattern selector.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.740
Depending on your machine, these dials can either be on the front, or they can be on top.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.020
If your machine doesn't label these dials clearly, and you don't have an instruction manual,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.880
I recommend you play around to figure out which is which.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.240
This is the thread tension dial. You adjust this per project.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.988
So if you have a heavier fabric, you won't be on the same number as a lighter fabric.

00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:35.468
If you don't have this number correct, then when you're stitching, your stitches might be messed up.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.000
This is the stitch length dial. You adjust this for how long you want your stitches to be.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.753
So if you want to make it more permanent, you're going to have it at a lower number.

00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:49.953
But if you want a test stitch to see if that's what you want, then you're going to have it to be a higher number.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.620
In regards to the pattern selector dial,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.430
each letter on the dial has a corresponding stitch to it. I typically keep it at A or B;

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.154
but you might find other stitches to be useful.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.320
This is the reverse stitch button. This is for when you want to go backwards on stitching something.

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:11.714
This isn't like a computer where you can backspace, and delete the stitches that you've done.

00:05:11.714 --> 00:05:15.014
So if you want to take out stitches, you're going to need a seam ripper.

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.557
This is for when you want to add more stitches.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.340
This can be located either on the front of your machine, or on the sides; or there's a switch you have to flip.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.880
I hope this introduction to machine parts has helped you understand your machine a bit more.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.792
And next time, when I teach you how to thread up your machine, hopefully it will be a lot easier for you to follow.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.280
And until then, bye!
