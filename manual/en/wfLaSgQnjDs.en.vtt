00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.230
Hey, guys.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.660
Today we're going to do how to trim your dogs
nails.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.660
This is Molly.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.340
She's a beagle, and she's going to be our
helper today, showing off how to trim those

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.340
nails.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.090
A lot of people get really nervous about it
because they're worried about that quick that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.340
they're going to get â€” that they're going
to accidentally clip.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.870
And the way that you're going to avoid that
is by doing routine trimmings, and, if you

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.800
look at their paw and those nails, those nails
should never go past the pad of their foot.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.030
So you just want to make sure... and you can
see hers are pretty short.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.220
So the nail clipper has to be rounded like
that.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.000
Do not use a regular human nail or toenail
clippers.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.780
It's going to be flat, it's going to push
down on their nail, and it's going to splinter

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.780
their nail.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.510
It's not going to feel good for them, and
they'll never want to do it again.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.030
So you want to get this rounded one, so it
kind of wraps around their nail and it puts

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.370
pressure on all the angles.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.449
So it's going to collapse in and do a nice,
neat trim.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.920
Now, the next thing you want to have on hand
is this little product here.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.920
It's a quick stop.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.130
You can use any styptic powder and you can
actually use corn starch if you're in a pickle.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.219
But, um, this styptic powder is going to clot
if you accidentally do nick their quick.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.399
So what you'll do is you'll just tap some
right into the lid there, grab an healthy

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.950
pinch of it, take their nail and pinch around
that nail and hold on to it for 10 seconds.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.860
And it's going to clot up and you can just
let it go, and the nail will be perfectly

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.860
fine.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.979
You don't need to panic about it; they will
be okay.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.189
So that's what you need: rounded nail clippers,
styptic powder, and you're good to go.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.210
What you're going to do, is you're not going
to force them, you're not going, like, to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.399
hold them down and grab their foot and try
and force them to trim their nail.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.969
That's going to cause a sensitivity and a
lot of anxiety around it.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.560
So what the first thing you want to do is
grab some food, some treats for your dog that

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.569
they're interested in.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:09.140
And you want to get a very small piece, make
them very small, and let them know what they're

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.870
up for, you know, "Ooh, this is gonna be really
fun, yes, we got treats going on."

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.460
So she knows the treat is what's at stake
right here.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.090
So she wants that treat, and so- [to Molly]
stay...

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.901
Show her the clipper, say, "Oh, nothing's
wrong with the clipper, you'll actually get

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:26.120
treats when you smell that clipper."

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.510
Now come over here, and, give a nice massage,
get them relaxed.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.010
Just start touching her, just start touching
your dog all over, get them used to, "Oh,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.290
this is gonna be a fun session here."

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.560
Work your way down towards her legs, pick
up a paw, and then let it go...

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.550
Pick up the paw again, and let it go.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.550
Give a treat.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.989
What we're working towards is desensitization
here.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.659
So, we're not going to just go right for the
paw and go, "Okay, this is what we're doing."

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.610
It's just part of everything else, part of
the interaction.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.970
So, paw again, a little bit more manipulation
with that paw, and give a treat again.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.680
Again, this is all supposed to be very positive
with them.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.769
Alright, so we're gonna get this paw again
-- [to Molly] good girl- and we're going to

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.510
pair it with this, and give a treat.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.050
[to Molly] And come closer.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.050
C'mere.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.180
Good girl.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.739
Okay, paw again, clippers, treat.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.879
You can see her behavior: she knows what the
two together means.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.140
So you can she her face moving away, she's
kind of avoiding.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.500
So I'm just going to continue to make it a
positive experience for her by lots of treats,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.239
lots of massages, and now we're going to go
in for the actual clip.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.220
[To Molly] You're looking for more treats?

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.129
Alright, so here's the clipper, I know, touch
touch.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.010
Tap a little bit.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.079
Make some noise.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.680
Again with the treats- here.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.980
Good girl.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.840
Good girl.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.549
One more little tap.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.189
And I'm not gonna actually clip her nail because
it's very short, it's good, but you would

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.209
do a little bit of pressure right there.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.209
Tiny bit.

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.659
Give them a jackpot which is a lot of treats,
kind of a little handful.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:22.049
And look at that she offered me her paw back
cuz she knows the paw means more treats.

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.819
Yes?

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.160
Oh it does mean clipper, too, though.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.860
No, you won't give me your paw again?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.639
She's like maybe I changed my mind there.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.139
Now, you don't need to force, again, we talked
about we're not going to force this behavior

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.139
on her.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.750
It's not essential that you clip their nails
every single day.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.780
So work towards it.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.740
Make it a positive experience.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.831
Right now we're just going to do a full body
massage after to really reinforce that this

00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:55.300
little session we just had was really fun.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.479
And she'll start associating it and looking
forward to it the next time.

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.190
What do you think, Molly?

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.190
You a good girl?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.190
I have some more treats for you.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.190
What do you think?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.190
You can get them.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.300
You can get them.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.650
All right, guys.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.319
I hope you learned something today.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.289
