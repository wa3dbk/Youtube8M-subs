00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.539
Today I'm going to show you four different tricks you can do

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.019
with Jacob's Ladder string figure

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.640
In my other video I show you how to make Jacob's Ladder.  

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.640
I show it step-by-step very slowly

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.460
please take a look at that

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.919
once you can make Jacob's Ladder,

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.590
one of the first things to do with it is a really easy Eiffel Tower

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.239
Just turn it up

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.830
and close your top fingers together

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.100
and you have the Eiffel Tower

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.920
The next thing you can do with Jacob's Ladder is make a Witches Hat

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.539
What you do for this is use your mouth 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.730
and grab the top middle string

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.630
you're gonna drop the pointer strings

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.899
and pull down gently with your thumbs

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.899
Don't pull too hard or the witch's hat will mess up

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.390
By the way, there's another way to make the witch's hat with cup and saucer

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.600
I have another video on how to make cup and saucer

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.280
Just grab the top string with your mouth

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.220
and drop your thumbs again,  just like the other one.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.470
The next trick you can do with jacob's ladder is make pants with suspenders

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.040
To do this you need a friend to help you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.780
ask your friend to insert their fingers

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.300
into the two triangles that are just to either side of the center

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.510
you ask your friend to pull down, and when they do, you drop the thumb strings

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.510
okay

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.320
Another thing you can do with jacob's ladder is make a batman mask (or catwoman)

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.720
Just put the bottom triangle over your nose

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.720
and have your eyes look through the rest

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.339
