00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.990
Hello my name is Dr. Susan Jewell and on behalf
of Expert Village today I'm going to talk

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.300
to you about cholesterol. Now in this series
of clips I'm going to talk about ways of reducing

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:18.450
the bad form of cholesterol in your diet,
LDL. Cholesterol, specifically LDL, is a major

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.680
contributing factor into many cardiovascular
diseases we see today. Like heart attacks

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:33.010
and strokes. Now here I have some items of
food that I recommend that you increase in

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.660
your daily intake and for example if you?re
going to snack a lot I recommend that you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.440
get healthy, healthy snakes. Like for example
here's a vegetable chip based snack. Which

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.030
it's cooked in vegetable oil. So that's already
reduced your LDL intake and it's vegetable

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.020
so it's high in protein, high in fats and
fibers cause fiber is a good source to absorb

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.860
LDL from your blood system so you can get
less LDL deposit into your vessels. So when

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.530
you?re thinking about snaking or eating junky
foods. You should get healthy, junky foods.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.300
Actually, this is not junky food cause it's
really, very healthy for you and other things

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.040
to consider eating more of in your diet of
course is vegetables and fruits. So actually

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.990
carrots are a good source to snacking on when
you?re having a hunger pain. Good fiber and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.100
also helps your digestive system and fruits
of course bananas and apples as well. Also

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.960
lots of nuts and anything that's high like
brown rice versus white rice. There?s more

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.189
fiber in it and nuts as well. So these are
some of the items that you should eat more

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.729
of if you specifically if you have very high
LDL levels in your blood already and you want

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.020
to reduce your chances of getting cardiovascular
problems.
