00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.560
CAT are becoming a stronger and more recognised
brand within the mobile industry.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.550
Their devices have been designed to be rugged.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.879
How does the recently launched CAT S50 compare
with the better known CAT B15Q.

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.210
One area in which the B15Q and S50 share a
common theme, both have the Android OS installed,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.059
version 4.4 out of the box.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.370
One of the most popular operating systems
at the moment, it offers you as the user an

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.839
excellent array of apps through the Google
Play Store as well as a lot of flexibility

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.910
in terms of personal customisation.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.989
Drag and drop apps or widgets on the home
screen, create folders, change the wallpaper

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.699
and ringtone and choose the layout that works
for you.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.810
If you have a Google account with your contacts,
calendar and emails stored, easily sync these

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.150
to your phone and remain constantly up to
date.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.200
In both cases, it is virtually stock Android,
with little customisation by CAT.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.660
Both the B15Q and S50 have fairly fast quad-core
processors which make them pretty responsive.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.541
The S50 and B15Q do use different processors.
Both have positives and negatives. Generally

00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:39.160
speaking the Qualcomm processor found inside
the S50 is more highly regarded.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.990
The RAM is what allows multiple applications
to be running at once. The more RAM the faster

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.720
the phone will operate and handle multi-tasking,
generally speaking.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.800
Whilst the B15Q is very capable with 1GB the
S50 ensures the more demanding user has the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.610
capability to do more at once thanks to 2GB
of RAM.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.041
Both devices support microSD memory card expansion
which is ideal for files such as videos and

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:09.280
photos that can often take up a lot of space
on the internal memory.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.410
The B15Q supports cards up to 32GB in capacity
whilst the S50 is tested up to 64GB.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.700
You can find double the internal storage on
the CAT S50 which is a real bonus for most

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.861
people.
Internal storage is where the operating system

00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:28.629
is installed as well applications you add
to the device.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.060
The most noticeable difference between the
two handsets is the screen. The physical size

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.780
of the screen impacts on the physical size
of the device.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.590
As the newer of the two, the S50 has a 4.7"
display as opposed to the 4" found on the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.480
B15Q.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.830
This is further helped with an increase in
screen resolution from 480 x 800 to 720 x

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.830
1280.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.910
The S50 has a pixel per inch count of 315
which means more detail, vibrancy, and sharpness

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.920
and this is most certainly noticeable when
the two handsets are sat side by side.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.580
A smaller and lower resolution screen will
generally mean less battery drain, therefore

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.840
the B15Q could be the better choice. However
the S50 does have a bigger battery than the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.680
B15Q so this additional power draw is made
up for with the larger battery.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.300
Both do have Corning Gorilla Glass so they
are more resistive to impact and scratches

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.630
and both support wet finger tracking, meaning
the screen is more usable in wet conditions.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.770
Both handsets have similar connectivity options
but the S50 has two additional features which

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.030
could be of more use to you. The first and
more appealing is the addition of 4G support.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.690
The B15Q has support for only 3G.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.150
The S50 also supports USB On The Go (OTG),
whereby you can connect a USB memory stick

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.290
or hard drive (subject to compatibility) to
the phone via a cable.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.550
The S50 boasts an 8 megapixel camera compared
to the 5 found on the B15Q.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.950
Truthfully neither device produces images
or video results that are going to blow you

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.880
away.
Neither device has a particularly feature

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.520
rich camera interface, sticking with the basic
but hassle free default camera apps. Both

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.210
do offer a few nice editing features for improvement
post capture. Both have LED flash.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.250
Whilst image and video results are open to
personal opinion, the B15Q in my opinion actually

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.080
produces the better image results. Whilst
not perfect the balance of colours and contrast

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.650
is handled much better.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.879
Both offer digital zoom by pinching on the
screen during capture or recording and both

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.490
offer a physical shutter button in the form
of the torch key.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.860
The S50 does boast HD video recording at 1080p
whereas the B15Q does not.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.479
The S50 has an extra 630mAh at its disposal
over the 2000mAh found in the B15Q.

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.580
The advantages are somewhat reduced because
the larger and higher resolution display draws

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.770
more power so all told battery to screen size
the performance is about equal.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.851
A user removable the battery was on the B15Q,
but it is fixed internally on the S50. This

00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:18.680
does mean the size of the device is affected
for the better on the S50.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.150
Where the S50 has a real advantage is the
inclusion of Qi wireless charging. The S50

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.430
can be charged by sitting it on a wireless
charging pad or in a wireless charging enabled

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.789
car kit. This means you need not open the
fiddly port covers to charge the device.

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.490
As intimated earlier, the physical screen
size difference means the B15Q measures in

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:51.150
at 125 x 69.5 x 14.95 mm compared to the 140
x 75 x 12.6mm of the S50.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.819
Surprisingly all the features found in the
S50 have not made it heavier. In fact CAT

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:03.979
have knocked 30 grams off the S50 to make
it 140g as opposed to the 170g of the B15Q.

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.860
Whilst we always advise finding the better
suited device for you rather than by deciding

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.229
by price, at some point it is likely to be
a consideration. Whilst prices are always

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.789
changing there is approximately a Â£100 premium
for the S50 over the B15Q.

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.940
Both devices have an IP67 rating, meaning
immersion in fresh water at a depth of 1 meter

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.180
for up to 30 mintues. Drop either in a puddle,
in the sea or down a loo and they should survive.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.180
The Mil Spec 810G rating means either device
is certified to withstand falls onto concrete

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.229
from a height of 1.8 meters. Such a rating
means that both devices have an added bulk

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.089
for this protection.

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:49.169
Both have microUSB connectivity, a 3.5mm headphone
jack, Bluetooth and GPS.

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:54.290
Both devices have a 24 month (2 year) warranty,
so you are covered should anything go wrong.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.759
Those are the differences explained. We hope
this has been of some benefit to you if you

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.979
are considering one of the two devices.
