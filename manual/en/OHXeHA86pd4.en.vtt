00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.040
Nothing beats a proper,
traditional Sunday roast.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.600
I'm Rejina, I'm a busy
mum and a food lover.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.440
And in this video I'm
gonna take you through

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.680
everything you need to know
for the perfect roast beef.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.040
So first up is the all important
issue of hygiene.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.080
You probably know this already
but always wash your hands

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.680
before and after handling raw meat

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.240
because you don't want to
spread harmful bacteria.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.000
As beef is a red meat,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.160
it doesn't have to be cooked
all the way through.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.640
In fact, a lot of people
quite like their beef rare.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.480
Just take it out of the fridge half
an hour before you want to roast

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.320
to bring it up to room temperature

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.560
and that way it should
cook nice and evenly.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.960
You should also, at this point,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.960
pre-heat your oven to 240 C,
which is gas mark 9.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.960
There are loads of different
variations on roast beef,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.800
but today, we're gonna be keeping it
simple with this delicious seasoning.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.880
A tablespoon of oil, a couple
of teaspoons of mustard powder,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.920
a teaspoon of salt and pepper

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.600
and then just mix
up to a loose paste.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.520
It doesn't look like much
but this is quite intense.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.480
Just liberally smear
that all over the meat.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.240
As a guide, I allow
15 minutes per 450 grams,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.920
plus an extra 20
minutes at the end.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.200
And this 2 kilo joint should take
about just under an hour and a half.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.960
You'll have that lovely
well done meat on the outside

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.040
and you'll have that gorgeous,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.280
pink rare meat
in the very, very centre.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.400
Don't forget to keep basting
throughout to keep

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.680
your meat nice and moist.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.920
There's some really gorgeous
juices in the pan.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.040
To give it a lovely,
brown, flavoursome crust,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.280
I cook it for the first
half an hour at 240 C,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.680
gas mark 9 and then
turn it down to 200 C

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.080
to ensure that everything cooks
evenly and to minimise shrinkage.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.440
So when the beef is
done to your liking,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.640
remove it from the oven carefully.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.920
It will be very hot.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.600
So now I'm gonna rest the meat

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.640
for about 20 minutes or so
under a tent of foil.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.720
And what that will do is it
will just allow the meat to relax

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.840
and the juices will come out

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.480
and you can make
your delicious gravy.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.560
At this point, you can
skim off any excess fat.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.760
I've about 450 mils
of beef stock here.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.440
Keep stirring and then add
in about a tablespoon of flour

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.080
just to thicken it
to the consistency that you like.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.520
Really stir that well,
otherwise you'll get lumps

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.040
and no one likes lumpy gravy.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.720
So this should take
about 20 minutes,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.400
which is just the
right amount of time

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.080
for your meat to rest
into tender perfection.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.720
And it should be ready
to go and carve now.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.360
So you want to start
carving some nice,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.560
thick slices starting at
the wide end of the meat,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.080
about a centimetre wide
and you want your knife

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.160
at a slight angle, which will help
you guide your way along the beef.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.120
It's quite a nice idea
just to save a few slices

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.440
to cut just as you're serving
and it should keep it warm as well.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.800
And it's lovely and tender,
having had a good, long rest.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.440
You can really feel how easily that
knife is gliding through the meat.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.000
Serve this simply
with some horseradish sauce

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040
and some Yorkshire puddings.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.880
Don't forget to wrap any
leftovers tightly in some foil

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.360
and it should keep in the fridge
for a couple of days.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.520
So thank you all for
watching and get cooking.
