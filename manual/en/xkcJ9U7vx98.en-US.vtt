00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:07.924
(movie reel rolls)

00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:10.586
(HT Guy) From the brothers 
who went from talented to terrible

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:12.620
faster than you can say "Wachowski"

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.915
comes the sequel audiences demanded,

00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:16.408
then sorta got,

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.684
then once everyone had 
moved on with their lives,

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.396
got again anyway!

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:22.403
Dumb and Dumber To!

00:00:23.778 --> 00:00:25.359
Revisit the buddy comedy

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.116
that's aged about as well 
as Jeff Daniel's face,

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:32.440
as you follow two idiots on a quest 
to deliver a mysterious package

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.827
to a beautiful girl again.

00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:36.170
"Samsonite."

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.647
I was way off!

00:00:37.647 --> 00:00:41.286
(HT Guy) Only this time,
it's soul-crushingly horrible.

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:42.476
Our word is our bond.

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:44.112
(classical music)

00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:45.546
(British accent) James Bond.

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:46.680
(HT Guy groans)

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.193
The goofballs you used to love 
when you were 10 or 13

00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:52.451
are back, and dumber than ever.

00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:56.965
But now they're also old, 
unlikeable, sexist, racist,

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:59.050
and bizarrely mean-spirited.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.661
We love you, Harry.

00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.115
Do you love him long time?

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:04.439
"Lady doctor."
That always cracks me up.

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:06.835
Cha! Doctor doin' the laundry maybe.

00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:07.641
Am I right?

00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:09.004
(both) Show us your tits!

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:10.461
(startled gasps from audience)

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.308
- (Harry) Both of 'em.
- (Lloyd chuckles)

00:01:12.678 --> 00:01:15.479
(HT Guy) If you liked the first one,
this one is really gonna

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.865
bum you out!

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:20.887
Now that Jim Carrey's comedy career 
is dangling by a thread,

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:24.170
get ready to feel uncomfortable
as he does everything

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.760
short of drop to his knees
and beg you to laugh at him,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.363
which you won't,

00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:30.921
since he spends the movie 
creepily trying to bang a girl

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:32.257
decades younger than him.

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:33.856
Kind of like real life.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:35.689
This is a message for Emma Stone.

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.514
If I were a lot younger,
I would marry you.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:40.958
The sex...

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.844
So this is what rock bottom feels like.

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:48.774
(HT Guy) Jokes are never as funny 
the second time around,

00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:52.509
but that won't stop them 
from dusting off the Binaca Spray gag,

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:54.735
the most annoying sound in the world...

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:57.173
(Jim) Wanna hear the second 
most annoying sound in the world?

00:01:57.173 --> 00:01:58.539
(HT Guy) The Mutt Cuts van,

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:59.746
IOUs...

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:02.597
I'm gonna write an IOU 
and I'm leavin' it blank

00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:04.042
(HT Guy slurring) I like it a lot.

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:05.301
(slurring) I like it a lot.

00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:06.614
(HT Guy) Dead birds.

00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:09.708
And Lloyd having a fantasy
about beating up Asian people,

00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:12.506
then hooking up with a girl
who turns into the front of a truck.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.198
There's probably more than I missed.

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:17.730
Get ready for a script that feels 
like it was written in '98

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.164
and kept in a shoebox until
Jim Carrey's career took a dive,

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:24.872
full of dated pop culture references
that no one bothered to update.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.733
What'd they say in Jerry Maguire?

00:02:26.953 --> 00:02:28.521
(parrot) You had me at hello!

00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:29.732
Um, Titanic?

00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:31.280
(parrot) I'm king of the world!

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.357
(HT Guy) And current pop culture
references that aren't gonna age well.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:36.940
Oh, that's sweet.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.499
(HT Guy) Ehhh.

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.381
So ride along with Harry 
and Lloyd in a movie so bad

00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:44.091
you won't even look up 
from your phone when you

00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:45.701
half-watch it on cable,

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.720
when the only fun moment 
is Rob Riggle's body paint,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.923
and the only good parts 
are when the credits show

00:02:50.923 --> 00:02:52.481
clips from the first movie.

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:54.679
Ugh, did they get worse 
or did I just get older?

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.893
She was rumored to be a titanic whore.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:58.021
That's a lie!

00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.149
Frida never stepped foot in the Titanic.

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:01.909
(HT Guy) Naw, they definitely got worse.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.292
Starring...

00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:04.454
Farts.

00:03:04.474 --> 00:03:05.832
(farting)

00:03:05.932 --> 00:03:06.891
Poop.

00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:08.221
Incest.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.397
That means I'm your--
and we almost--

00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:11.488
(HT Guy) Pee pee.

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:12.708
Spit!

00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:13.939
Snot.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.345
More farts!

00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:16.761
(farting)

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:17.895
Period blood?!

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:19.489
Animal farts.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.381
(fart)

00:03:20.421 --> 00:03:22.081
And vagina dust!

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.018
(gagging)

00:03:25.084 --> 00:03:26.532
Grown Ups To.

00:03:28.528 --> 00:03:30.395
As if this movie wasn't depressing enough,

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:32.322
can you believe they guilt 
tripped Bill Murray to cameo

00:03:32.322 --> 00:03:33.563
in that hazmat suit?

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:36.027
Best day ever.
Greatest day of my life, really.

00:03:36.327 --> 00:03:37.604
(HT Guy) I'll bet it wasn't!

00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:41.442

00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:44.881
Biscuits and gravy.

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:47.026
Derp, derp, derpity, derp.

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.518
Did you just double dip that chip?

00:03:49.808 --> 00:03:51.719
Bite my shiny metal ass!

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.465
Tonight we dine in hell!

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:58.070
Oh wait, they close at six.
Okay, how about Mickey D's?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.240
Finagle my bagel!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.630
