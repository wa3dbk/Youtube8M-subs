00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.080
In the final part of our Adirondack build,
we'll fit the back slats, the seat slats and

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.220
the all important arm rest bottle opener.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.220
We'll put the arm rests in place temporarily
to assist in dialing in the back rest angle.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:37.559
17 degrees will do it
With the bevel angle on the upper back support

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.049
done we'll temporarily position the back slats
to mark out the top curve.

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:46.969
Now we could use the flexible ruler.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:01:14.520
But a trash can lid will do just as well

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:59.850
Backslats cut we'll countersink then glue
and screw

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.630
Before the final fit of the arms we'll need
to drill out the bottle recess

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.360
The guide piece here will keep the bit square
since the center pin has been removed specifically

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.190
for drilling flat bottomed holes
The down draft table is doing it's thing here

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:27.400
Now for the arms
Having taken care of the squeeze out we'll

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:47.489
fit the back rest

00:02:47.489 --> 00:04:33.100
Back rest done we'll finish off the arms
With the back rest seat slats and arm rests

00:04:33.100 --> 00:05:27.580
secured that just leaves the all important
bottle top opener

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:43.080
And a wax to finish it off
A cheap and simple Adirondack chair

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.380
Cheers
