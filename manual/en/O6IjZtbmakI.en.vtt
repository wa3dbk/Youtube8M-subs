*Huskies howling*

Look I have Oakley!  Those candies aren't for you Oakley!  And Shelby!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.600
I made the mistake!  I thought that, Shelby and Memphis went to the groomer's yesterday but technically it was supposed to be Oakley

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.120
But, I had Shelby and Memphis!

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.720
So, we left Memphis and I'm taking Oakley and Shelby today.  So, Oakley and Shelby are going to get groomed today!

Alright!  We're leaving Oakley and Shelby to get groomed!

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.460
You'll be clean when we come back!  *To Oakley*  Yeah!  You will be!

*Oakley Barks*

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.520
*Blower sounds*

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.320
*Person to Shelby*  You Can't have the Poodle!

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.540
Well, I forgot to video you girls on the way home, but...  Shelby and Oakley are now all clean and home from the groomers!

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.140
Look at how puffy you are! If you guys could have feel-a-vision, she's like super soft too!

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.100
You're super puffy and you're super puffy and you're super puffy!

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.400
Super puffy girls!  Look how beautiful!  They all look gorgeous!  Yes you do!
