00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.800
Are you recording everything, Rachel?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
A lot of things.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.000
Like your whole life?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
Wait, where are we?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.900
Right here.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.500
Rachel's next vlog is gonna be us trying to figure out how to climb a mountain.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.300
But actually.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.000
Oh, that's actually it.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.200
Huh. Okay, let's go!

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.200
Alright, what are we doing right now?

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.100
Climbing Mont. Sainte-Victoire.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.800
That one.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.200
Right there.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm gonna sit for a sec.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.700
This sucks!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.200
Are we just, like, trailblazing at this point?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.000
Bonjour! Bonjour. Bon appetit.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.800
We made it!

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.000
Time to head back down!
