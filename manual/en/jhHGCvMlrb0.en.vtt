00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.740
We all learned it in school: when it comes
to sex and gender women have two X chromosomes

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.269
and men have XY and that’s all there is
right?

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.309
Is anything that simple on this show?

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.240
Hello Everyone, Crystal here with DNews.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.640
Science has known for a while that it is possible
for humans to be born with more or less than

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.199
two sex chromosomes.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.720
These unusual combinations are rare in the
human population and in most cases are not

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.120
something you inherit from your parents, but
from an error during meiosis leading to an

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.070
inappropriate number of sex chromosomes in
the human gametes.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.600
(yes, yes, … think back to high school biology
…) Usually mature eggs and sperm carry only

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.789
one sex chromosome, in the case of sperm either
an X or a Y.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.870
When exceptions to this rule occur, it leads
to chromosomal abnormalities.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.980
For instance, Turner’s syndrome occurs in
individuals who carry only one sex chromosome.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.980
An X.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.390
These individuals express the physical characteristics
of a human female but they are frequently

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.180
unable to have children and have a lower life
expectancy because that single X chromosome

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.020
is doing the work of two and the information
contained on that one X is less robust.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.830
Often, pregnancies of Turner’s syndrome
babies do not make it to delivery.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.660
Super females are the opposite, they have
an extra X.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.690
There is usually no distinguishable difference
to the naked eye between those with triple

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.990
X and the rest of the female population.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.890
but some studies based on small samples have
correlated exceptional height, learning disabilities,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.040
and weak muscle tone to triple X individuals,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.800
Similar abnormalities involving the Y chromosome
are also possible.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:44.560
Although a Y-only permutation is fatal, combinations
such as XXY, XYY, XXYY and others do also

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.530
occur with variable frequency.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.170
These individuals express male traits and
secondary sex characteristics due to the presence

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.730
of the SRY gene carried on the Y chromosome.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.200
But what happens when that gene migrates to
another chromosome?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
Can it do that?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.560
Can an X chromosome express the gene that
makes male parts?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.460
Well, science says actually yes!

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.330
Recent studies including one performed at
Arizona State University have shown that sex

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.800
chromosomes, like our other 22 pairs of chromosomes,
experience recombination.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.700
All you really need to know about genetic
recombination is that while making sperm and

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.410
eggs our bodies replicate our chromosomal
DNA and then sort single copies of those physical

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.410
records of genetic information into eggs or
sperm that carry half of the set of instructions

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.500
needed for a healthy human including a single
sex chromosome and X or a Y.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.190
When the copying process occurs, near identical
chromosomal pairs are smushed together in

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.960
a way that they can become tangled, and sometimes
identical parts of those chromosomes can get

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.230
shifted around from one to the other.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.590
This tangled mixing is called recombination
and errors in this process are a contributing

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.530
factor to genetic variation and evolution.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.870
But wait! you say, sex chromosomes are not
identical and therefore don’t have similar

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.810
gene sequences to tangle together and recombine.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.740
Well actually they do.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.200
Only the very ends of the X and Y chromosomes
contain enough similarity to stick together

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.410
and swap genes during meiosis.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.510
But that is enough similarity to get the SRY
gene tangled up in the process.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.840
Gene migration is not uncommon, we see it
frequently in evolution.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.490
But when the gene responsible for the “male”
phenotype ends up on the chromosome responsible

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.790
for a “female” phenotype things get complicated.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.260
This condition, called XX male or de la Chapelle
syndrome is relatively rare, occurring in

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.920
something like 5 in every 100,000 individuals.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.320
The individuals carry the female XX chromosomal
signature but they develop like men, although

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.410
their testes are small and they are usually
sterile.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.681
XX male syndrome has been identified since
the 1970’s but it’s only now that we are

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:50.010
starting to understand how the conditions
occurs.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.569
What we can learn from this is that while
the sex chromosomes we carry do determine

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.490
a lot of our outward appearance and reproductive
characteristics, it is frustratingly not always

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.620
that simple and chromosomal composition is
not the last word in gender phenotype.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.710
The past couple weeks on DNews and on our
spinoff show TestTube Plus, we’ve talked

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.240
a lot about sex and gender.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.860

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:27.730
They recently uploaded an episode of 8-Bit
Philosophy called “Is Gender Real?”
