00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.650
Hello, I am Sarolta Eke. Hello, I am Thomaska
Shay. We are here on behalf of Expert Village.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:16.080
We are going to show you how to dance Mambo.
This is the ladies step for Mambo, change

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.440
of place with ladies turn. I will show you
now. It's two and three, four and one, two

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:34.980
and three, four and one, two and three, four
and one, two and three, four and one. When

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.430
you are practicing this alone, you should
do it slowly. When you are practicing with

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.033
your partner he will be able to help you with
this turn. Okay, so the foot technique is

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:55.300
the same as the change of place in Mambo for
the lady, but the end of the change of place

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.770
changes a little bit for the lady. I will
show you right foot back, left foot in place,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.549
right foot closes to left foot. Left foot
forward, right foot in place, and close left

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.530
foot to right foot. Right foot back, left
foot in place, close right foot to left foot.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.140
Now here comes the ladies turn. Step with
left foot forward, and start to turn to the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:28.380
right. Almost a whole turn. Then right foot
forward, and still continue to turn, a half,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.880
half a turn, and close left foot to right
foot. And then you can go back with your right

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.270
foot once more. And start the whole thing
again. So it's right foot back, in place,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:49.759
close, forward, in place, close, back, in
place, close. Forward and turning, forward,

00:01:49.759 --> 00:02:02.202
turn, forward, turn, close. And right foot
can go back again. One, two and three, four

00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:12.109
and one, two and three, four and one, two
and three, four and one, two and three, four

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.940
and one, two and three, four and one, two
and three, four and one.
