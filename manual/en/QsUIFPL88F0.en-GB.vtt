00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.220
Hi, and welcome to Team Wild TV. Today we're
going to be having a look at this bow that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.720
Mr. Harford's given me. He said, Steve, you're
about the same size as me, about the same

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.260
length arms? I've got a bow for you to go
and have a play with. I'm not an expert on

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.000
shooting bows, but we'll give it a go. Now
let's have a look at it.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.000
Oh my god, isn't that sexy? It's like I say,
Bear from Bear Archery, it's the Anarchy model.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.340
You can see all the auxiliaries by Trophy
Ridge, which are second to none. It's got

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.880
a whisker biscuit fitted, so when the arrow
goes in, it isn't going to fall away. Rest,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.229
it's got the full sights, made by Trophy Ridge
again, and the arrow holder again by Trophy

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.310
Ridge. Knowing Ian, it will have a draw away
of about seventy pounds.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.310
Okay when we're training, these are field
point arrow, not a broadhead arrow.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.880
Different, they're interchangeable heads with the same
way a broadhead is to a field point, but if

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.810
we use these ones when we're practicing we'll
be cutting all the targets to pieces because

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.829
they're like razorblades. There's three bits
there, and their designed to cut a wound channel

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.299
into the animal when you're hunting. Where
as the field point is just like the end of

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.549
a dart really, just punching a hole into the
target so when you pull it out it's not destroying everything.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.969
But, we just thought it would be interesting
to show you that.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Okay so we'll just get a few arrows to put
in the holder here.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.229
Looking forward to this.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.450
Been awhile since I shot a bow, so like I
say I'm no expert. I hope I don't make a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.000
fool of myself.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Cool and the gang, ready to go. Let's go and find
the target.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:37.290
Okay, we've got the target set up. Got my
release aid on. Got my Rangefinding Bino's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400
from Zeiss at 10x45. They're Ian's actually
so you've probably seen them a lot. So, I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.769
know exactly where I'm gonna be. I'm gonna
start at ten metres and work my way back to

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.360
fifty, in increments of ten metres. So that's
what I'm gonna do so I know exactly where

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.000
I am and I'll make any adjustments as I go.
So we'll start at ten, we'll have a go.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.290
Make sure the arrow goes into nock.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Put my square on.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.739
Little bit to the right, but that seemed pretty
good to me. Ian was right, it fits me nice.

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.739
Comes back to the corner of my mouth. Nicely,
fits lovely actually.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.000
And I say it is about seventy, knowing Ian. Right, we'll go back
to twenty and fire another one.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.000
Yeah that's twenty, smack on. We'll have another
go.

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.000
Pretty much spot on to me, that was. Go back
another ten.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That one's a little low and to the left, low
and to the right.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.500
Yeah I'm right happy with that. We'll go back
to forty.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.330
It's gone a little high.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It's all good. Go back to fifty and try it
from there.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.110
All good. On that target area I've shot two
a little bit high there but I tried to compensate

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.030
with a pin adjustment. So what we'll have
to do for the longer shots, see the different

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.920
pins? They're aim off points, so you get your
eye on the angle of the bow, so the arrows

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.330
drop into the same area the further you go
back. They're pretty much spot on, just a

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.710
little adjustment from the forty to the fifty.
Might be a great deal but with a little bit

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.810
of fettling, I think I'm gonna be quite confident
with that. I've really enjoyed it. First impressions

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.810
of the bow, fantastic. Fantastic, sits in
my hand nice, feels nice, weighted right.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
All good, I'd get it if a bow was in my market.
