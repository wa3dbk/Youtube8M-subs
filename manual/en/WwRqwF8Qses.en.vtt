00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:20.390
There’s always room for innovations, it’s
part of the driving force that composes the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.089
evolution of all entertainment and art, and
innovation is really just part of human nature,

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.470
we always strive to learn more and improve
what came before.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.500
Then there are endeavors that don’t attempt
to innovate, they set out to do something

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.410
that’s been seen many times before.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.199
Well, when this is the case, it stands out
even more when that undertaking misses the

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.050
status quo, which happens to be the case with
Primal Fears.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.329
At its core Primal Fears is a rudimentary
top-down shooter, you point in a direction

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.660
and shoot at enemies.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.210
The most important part in any run-n-gun affair,
believe it or not, is the running and the

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.350
gunning, unfortunately Primal Fears fumbles
those fundamental principles.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.110
So, let’s start with the gunning.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.180
First off, weapons feel like they’re shooting
rubber bullets, on the normal difficulty I

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.090
found myself pouring three clips into what
is a pretty standard enemy.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.110
The health-to-bullet-damage ratio is simply
unbalanced; I had to lower the difficulty

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.430
to find the combat tolerable.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.180
The lack of weapon damage isn’t the entirety
of the problem; even after weapon upgrades

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.079
your artillery still pack no punch.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.600
When I’m shooting an enemy point-blank in
the face with a shotgun or chain gun, I expect

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.090
them to get shredded to pieces or at least
be affected by Newtonian physics: You know,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.619
equal opposite reactions and whatnot.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.790
Instead, with all barrels a-spinning from
a Gatling gun against the melon of a monster,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.140
they just keep a coming like they’re not
being struck by high-velocity projectiles.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.470
The issues with the gunplay are only worsened
by the other side of this run-n-gun coin.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.829
Primal Fears takes directional aiming and
movement into consideration.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.860
Meaning, you can only move quickly when facing
forward, if you’re facing one way and moving

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.230
another, then you’ll slink around sluggishly.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.370
The directional running is a double-edged
sword; it does create tension while firing

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.840
your weapon and back peddling while a monster
is in heated pursuit, but in combination with

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.870
the weak bullets and complete lack of pushback
from any form of physics, the entirety of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.800
the combat feels like all you’re ever doing
is slowly chipping away at your enemy’s

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.370
health while slowly moving in the opposite
direction.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.569
Primal Fears isn’t all bad though; it does
have a tense atmosphere with great lighting

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.909
that adds to the sense of dread, and the music
and sound effects pack more punch than the

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.870
weapons do, that’s for sure.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.980
Although, any sense of tension created by
going it alone is done away with as soon as

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.629
you enter multiplayer, which doing so is quite
smooth and painless.

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.299
Multiplayer can be seamlessly entered by walking
up to a phone booth to call friends to join

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.080
your game or by simply hopping into a public
game online.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.569
In the end, Primal Fears has a thick, eerie
atmosphere complemented by seamless multiplayer

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.879
integration, but misfires on the gunplay and
combat which should be the highest quality

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.489
aspect of a shooter.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.050
As an idea and presentation, Primal Fear has
some potential, but as far as run-n-guns are

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:29.700
concerned, this one’s shooting blanks.
