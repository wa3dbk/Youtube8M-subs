00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.400
Look at all these gorgeous ladies that have
come to join us! It's so fabulous that you're here!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.700
With all of these beautiful women here, I'm full of excitement to share with you all my red carpet secrets.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.000
I've started by using the Goddess Skin Clay Mask. We did that for 10 minutes. This is like a mini red carpet facial.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.099
This is something that I have been with sharing with facialists, celebrities,

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.740
supermodels ... I have been decanting it into
little pots because it's only been available

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.200
in my kit for the last few years. This is
something that I use every time I do the red carpet,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.899
every time I do any celebrity or
any model, I will always start with skin by

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.289
using the Goddess Skin Clay Mask. I've washed that off, and I've put the Magic Cream on and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.949
then I've put on Light Wonder Foundation.
Light Wonder Foundation ... I am obsessed

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.670
by foundations, because I never think that
makeup should wear you, you should ...

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.000
Someone should just look at you and go, "Wow, you look really gorgeous and really healthy and really great!"

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.550
This is one of my old school secrets called Film Star Bronze &amp; Glow. It's a super-forgiving

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.400
product because it really looks like ... a little bit like sunlight. It's just a very soft, forgiving

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.510
way of giving yourself a wonderful facial
framework. I'm going to pop my Sculpt Brush

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.140
into the Sculpt shade and and then get the
Sculpt Brush dusted off on the back of your

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.920
hand, and then literally follow the hollow, so you can just sculpt,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.630
and the brush will do all the work for you.  You go onto the jawline.... And then we can take a little

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:44.100
bit of ... and go up into the temples. And
that will just kind of naturally give you that  chiseled look.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.860
This is the lighter Highlight shade... and dipping the Sculpt Brush into the Highlight shade, and

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.490
then literally just swiping it on the
top of that C-shaped section. That just drips

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.030
the candlelight onto the skin. I don't know if you can see... Can you see the difference?

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.860
When we did Sienna's Miller's makeup for the Oscars, I really wanted to create that

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.000
that sort of cat-eye with the amazing lift of the eye, really create that curve. Really create that kind of early '60s sort of look.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.269
It's wonderful because actually it really gives you an amazing kind of sexy eye lift. That's what I've already done,

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.730
and lots of color with Full Fat Lashes Mascara. So now I'm going to take my Sophisticate palette

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.030
which is a really beautiful, delicious palette. When you start to apply these Luxury eye palettes,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.790
it starts with Prime - Enhance - Smoke - Pop. So you dial it off like an old-fashioned telephone.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.879
And literally— It goes from Desk - Dusk - Disco. Taking your Blender Brush and dipping it

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:47.400
into the Enhance shade, and then just washing that all over the eyes ... and then taking the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.450
Blender Brush and dipping it into the Enhance shade and then nestling it in here into the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:01.969
socket into the corner of the eye, and then
blending around into the socket....

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:11.969
So you're creating a kind of V and then an arch in the socket, back and forth. — Open up your eyes. — It's so simple and easy!

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:17.609
So I've Primed, Enhanced, and now
I'm basically going onto Smoke. I'm going

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:24.109
to take this and dip into the Smoke shade, 
and taking my Smudger Brush...

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:30.829
So it's super easy. All we're doing is a little bit of smokiness with the Sophisticate palette on

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.560
this outer V, the outer corner of the eyes.
That's just literally creating this smokiness

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.980
and it's gorgeous lift. And then I'm taking
a little bit of the Pop shade, and again with

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.310
my Smudger Brush — Look up for me, darling. — literally just putting a tiny bit of that along the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.169
lower lash line and then blending it in. — Look at me. — Gorgeous!

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:03.319
I always use a lip scrub. It just sloughs
off all the dead skin. I'm going to use my

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.159
Pillow Talk Lip Liner. And this, literally,
I have used on everyone because it is one

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.719
of those amazing lip liners that naturally
gives you a kind of bigger pout. It almosts

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:22.790
mimics the lip pigment that you have inside your lips, and you can cheat your way to bigger lips.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:31.540
— Smile. — And now I'm going to finish it off
with my B. Perfect Lipstick.&nbsp;— Smile —

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.220
I'm just going to quickly pop that on. It's like a
nudie, but it's got a very kind of fresh little

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.000
pink to it. So it's very pretty. It suits
everybody, this.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:52.500
I'm now going to finish it off with my Cheek to Chic blusher, and it's swish and
pop action. Swish and then pop!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.090
You put it on, and you immediately look happier and healthier, and it's just a little bit of blush.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.940
What I'm trying to do with this brand is give people that red carpet finish but in a very easy format.
