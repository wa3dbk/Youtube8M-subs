00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.870
Xbox One's price drop, Legend of Zelda for
the Oculus Rift, Call of Duty Elite shuts

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.599
down - all that and more coming up right now
on the Curse Weekly Roundup!

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.420
This week's Roundup is sponsored by Thief.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.960
What's up it's Jess, and today is February
28th.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.320
First up, Microsoft has dropped the price
of the Xbox One....in the UK.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.189
Originally selling at 429 pounds for the console
and a bundled game, the Xbox One now costs

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.450
399 pounds as of today, and includes Titanfall
in the package.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.399
This drop in price is likely due to the Playstation
4 vastly outselling the Xbox One - by about

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.989
two to one, with 5.3 million PS4s being sold
worldwide.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.530
So HOPEFULLY this means we'll see the price
drop here in North America or other regions

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.989
as well.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.059
Ever wonder what the original Legend of Zelda
for the NES would look like in....first-player

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.090
perspective?

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.090
Wonder no more!

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.399
YouTuber Vaecon played through a virtual reality
clone of the game on the Oculus Rift and put

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.379
clips up on his channel - click the link in
the description to view it for yourself, but

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.720
it looks way more epic than the classic top-down
view.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.880
If you have an Oculus Rift, you can play the
clone for free when it comes out in March,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.140
or even try the beta right now, we'll drop
the download link in the description as well.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.080
Tony Hawk and Activision have confirmed that
they've got a new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.380
in development.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.140
Scant information is available aside from
"we're working on a game, it's pretty cool,"

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.660
from the skater himself.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.340
With a note from Activision that "more info
is coming soon."

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.800
Once again, this Curse Weekly Roundup has
been sponsored by Thief.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.590
Released this week, it's a revival of the
cult classic Thief series of games that require

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.950
the player to use stealth to overcome challenges,
capturing the classic gameplay that you loved

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.920
before but with a driven new storyline.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.750
Thief is out now for the Xbox 360, Xbox One,
PS3, PS4, and PC.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.960
Call of Duty Elite has shut down as of today.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.800
The online service that launched in 2011 alongside
the release of Modern Warfare 3 has been winding

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.030
down slowly since last 2013, with no plans
to ever bring it back according to Activision.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.490
Instead, players are encouraged to download
the official Call of Duty app which works

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.720
with CoD: Ghosts as well as future titles,
and allows you to customize your multiplayer

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.310
experience and weapon loadouts on the go.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.950
Click the link in the description to view
Activision's FAQ which will help explain how

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.610
this shutdown will affect end users.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.790
What Roundup would be complete without a piece
on King being a twat?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.970
Well, this one apparently, because looks like
the studio behind Candy Crush Saga took that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.920
old douchebag dial and turned it down a notch
or two - they've withdrawn their trademark

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.950
application for the word Candy, in the U.S.
only.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.380
A statement from King reveals that this will
not affect the trademark for the work Candy

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.950
in the European market, and they will continue
to, quote, "take all appropriate steps to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.590
protect our IP."

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.530
Lemme ask you this: what made you think that
trademarking Candy in the first place was

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.530
an appropriate step?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.530
That's it for this week!

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.360
As always, be sure to subscribe if you haven't
already!

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.910
And I"ll see you next time - until then, enjoy
the game.
