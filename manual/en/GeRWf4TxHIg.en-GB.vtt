00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.429
Namaste! 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.930
Satya narayan puja may be held in our society or at home,.. 

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.527
..once we offer prayers to the deity, 
next instant thing we think of is prasad (sweet holy offering)!

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:29.752
This is because, the sweet offerings are irresistible 
and we keep waiting to savor them! 

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:33.524
But it's observed, if these offerings are made at home
 it doesn't taste the same. 

00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:35.476
Today's tasty delight is 'Prasadacha Sheera'

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:43.883
1 cup of ghee will require
1 cup of rawa (semolina), 1 cup of sugar,..

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:46.207
..dry fruits (almonds, cashews, raisins), 
1/2 tsp elaichi (cardamom).

00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:51.569
But, proportion of the milk should be 1:2, 
i.e. 2 cups of milk for 1 cup of ghee.

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.701
Let's start with roasting the rawa.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.468
Add 1 cup ghee (clarified butter).

00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:08.873
Next, we'll add rawa..

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:10.974
..but first let the ghee melt completely. 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.048
Roast the rawa till it turns golden brown in colour.

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:17.307
 The perfect texture of the sheera rely upon 
how well the rawa is roasted. 

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:23.172
Once it melts completely, only then we add the rawa. 

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.065
Ghee has melted..

00:01:27.977 --> 00:01:29.363
Now, let's add rawa to it.

00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:30.864
1 cup rawa.

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:39.274
It might seem that there's too much ghee used 
but be rest assured, the proportion is perfect. 

00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:42.465
Roast until it changes to golden brown.

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:52.403
Let's boil the milk while we roast the rawa. 

00:01:53.057 --> 00:01:55.517
Milk is an important element when preparing a holy offering.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.910
So, make sure the milk is boiled and only then added to the mixture.

00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:00.052
Here comes a tip!

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:07.912
Adding chilled milk to rawa makes it sticky, 
while boiled milk will make it loosen.

00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:09.594
Let's boil the milk.

00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:18.943
The aroma while roasting the rawa is so good!..

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.322
..which tends to pull people in neighbourhood 
who ask, "what's that cooking"?

00:02:25.513 --> 00:02:30.082
Now, we'll add some almonds and cashews to it,..

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:32.403
..keep remaining for garnishing.

00:02:36.776 --> 00:02:39.484
While preparing sheera for holy offering,
 you can also add banana to it.

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:41.885
It should be added at a point when we roast the rawa.

00:02:42.286 --> 00:02:45.786
'Elaichi', 'rajeli', or the regular banana type,
 any of them can be added. 

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:49.345
Next we have to add some raisins. 

00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:54.949
Keep it stiring, for around 2 minutes!

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.190
Milk has come to a boil.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.738
 Let's lower the flame and add milk to the rawa. 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.485
Pour small quantities at a time as it's hot and may splutter.

00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:07.874
Rawa begins to get fluffy with the addition of milk to it.

00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:11.006
So, it's recommended little at a time.

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:20.440
We've added the milk completely. 

00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:25.466
It should be completely soaked by the rawa mixture.

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.422
Make sure the milk is pipping hot while we pour in.

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:30.702
Let's set the flame on medium.

00:03:32.343 --> 00:03:36.167
We can see the consistency of the sheera is soft, fluffy and loosened!

00:03:36.268 --> 00:03:37.868
Milk has blended well with it. 

00:03:41.584 --> 00:03:43.128
Let's add a bowl of sugar.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.715
Mix it thoroughly and place a lid on it. 

00:03:53.912 --> 00:03:57.973
It's now mixed well, place a lid and 
keep it for 5 minutes for steaming.

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:00.908
By doing this, sugar will dissolve completely..

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:02.709
..and spread evenly with the help of the steam. 

00:04:09.327 --> 00:04:10.749
Let's see if it's done.

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.281
Yes, it  has steamed well!

00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:16.610
Switch off the stove now.

00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:21.340
It's ready..but wait! We're left with cardamom powder.

00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:25.155
1 tsp cardamom powder. 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.650
Mix this properly.

00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.005
It's preffered to add cardamom powder at the end..

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.606
 ..as then it maintains a good aroma.

00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:38.393
It's mixed well.

00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:40.524
 Now let's take it out in a bowl.

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.704
Garnish the sheera with cashews and almonds.

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:12.450
Prasadacha Sheera is ready to serve!

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.729
Definitely! It's a great offering for the deity..

00:05:21.443 --> 00:05:23.979
..as well the guests will be happy with this sweet
 offering.

00:05:25.195 --> 00:05:28.215
What's next to do!
