Hi, I will show you a recipe for baked potatoes

00:00:20.408 --> 00:00:31.463
I will use about 1,5 kilograms ( about 3 pounds) of potatoes

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:55.544
I peel off the potatoe skins

00:00:56.988 --> 00:01:09.917
I cut them into smaller pieces

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:21.461
I put potatoes into a pot and I wash them

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:54.708
I put them on the heater

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:22.794
The potatoes boiled for 5 minutes and I drain them

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:43.799
Sprinkle the oven sheet with olive oil

00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:47.836
and place the potatoes on the sheet

00:02:55.377 --> 00:03:10.788
add a lot of fresh rosemary

00:03:16.303 --> 00:03:42.755
add fresh garlic with skins

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:47.078
sprikle with olive oil

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:53.166
add big grained salt

00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:58.227
Put into the preheated oven

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:14.159
I baked the potatoes 70 minutes in the 180 C

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:19.754
They are ready to serve

00:04:19.928 --> 00:04:24.462
They are ideal for baked chicken or duck.
