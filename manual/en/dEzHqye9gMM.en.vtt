00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:08.750
Alright, so there are three real basic types
of naps to use when you're doing stage combat.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.750
The first one we're going to go over is the
attacker nap. Now, I'm going to be the attacker

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.599
so that means I'm going to be throwing the
punch or slapping Shaun here. I'll demonstrate

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:24.909
with a slap because that's the first kind
of attack we'll go over later on, but usually

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:31.159
these kinds of naps can be used for slaps,
punches, any kind of hitting that you can

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:36.109
think of. Even if you have like a basic weapon
like a club or something, a lot of times you

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:42.500
can use this type of attack or nap. So, if
I was going to attack Shaun here with a slap,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.870
what I would first do first establish our
distance, then I would make eye contact with

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.379
Shaun to let him know that I'm going to attack
him. Now, when I go into the nap and I start

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.739
to hit him, I'm going to wind up, remember
when you're practicing this always make sure

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.649
it's a quarter speed. You want it really slow
and I can't stress that enough to make sure

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.799
it's slow and make sure you know what you're
doing before you start to speed it up. So

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.640
I'm going to go way back and what I'm going
to do is when I'm right about here you always

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.329
want it lower, remember that frame we want
our nap lower than his, I'm going to go low

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.070
because ultimately you can hide this from
your audience that you're doing this in front

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.030
of. If it's lower you have your bodies to
hide it depending on the positioning. You're

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.869
going to come low and what I'm doing is I'm
just clapping right here with my own hand.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.570
So when I do that I'm going to hit and then
keep going and Shaun is going to react. He

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.119
is 50% of this performance, because he's getting
hit. So, again a little bit faster; shoulders,

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:55.479
eye contact, shoulders, eye contact and there
we go. Now, I did it slower so the nap wasn't

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.110
really loud. We'll do it one more time, you
ready to go a little faster? Okay, so this

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.950
is what we're going to do, shoulders, eye
contact, back, there you and Shaun reacted

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.000
perfectly. That is the attacker nap demonstrated
with a slap.
