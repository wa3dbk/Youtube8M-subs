cars dot com auto reviews

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.139
Hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder with cars.com were taking a first look at the 2010

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
Subaru Outback this is the first full
read it

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.029
redesign it happened a few years it is
now more efficient

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.340
comes with a 2.5 liter engine or 3.6

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.130
before now it was a 3.0 liter but now it
doesn't require premium fuel anymore

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.509
a couple the changes in front you can
tell I

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.390
much more expressive headlights kinda
Laura underbite kinda look to the grill

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.000
and the ride height is actually a little
bit higher more ground clearance and you

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.270
can really see it is it more of an SUV
look

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.980
though they've returned to the
sport-utility wagon name that came out

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.470
with a win is brand new so but fifteen
years ago

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.320
not last time the Outback was redesigned

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.890
a few years ago they didn't grow at any
which surprised me

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.160
partly because when a model as resign
they almost always bro

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.550
%uh but this one really needed it
especially in the back seat now this is

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.630
the 2010 Outback

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.979
a I got the sea all the way back and
talk to bed funny

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.799
%uh leg room now that was not the case
the old one you i mean

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.200
four-inches' have been added here

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.909
on money to raise a little bit but it's
not bad now

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.710
for what it's worth the has a wider to

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.039
which gives you more shoulder room and
have produced the couple inches the

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.770
legacy

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.479
which is the sedan to watch this wagon
is based but we just tested it versus

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:32.969
some

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.999
other mid-size sedans and found that it
was one of the tightest back seat on the

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.499
market

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.310
that has approved a little for 2010 and
of course so as the wagon

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.950
one more improvement back here now
adjustment actually pretty easy to reach

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.740
an aside

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.889
to change the backrest angle

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.979
find it helpful position yourself

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.420
generally think comfortable now back
anyway now

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.740
obviously the front seat which is kinda
important in car are

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.200
also more rooms actually more hip room
here than in the back

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.479
for the front accidents and was never
slouching turned in here

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.580
quality begin with item prove even more
I have to say I wasn't crazy about the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.970
kinda

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.140
textures and and sparkling gray

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.670
stuff but I never miss a thing complain
about it's been replaced by a lot more

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.540
convincing

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.160
gold medal a on the steering wheel as
well now

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.470
there's an a manual transmission is is
standard you can get an automatic is now

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.340
a Stephen King

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.590
anything variable transmission that is
one of the ways that is more efficient

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.900
than the previous model

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.260
even though the CVT it still has his
helping

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.490
here also a now at the growth for the
car overall

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.290
cargo areas a bit deeper

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.520
and wider it's not full SUV size but

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.080
a that Lee very usable now proving that
they're still

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.710
room for innovation something we haven't
seen before these are the cross bars

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.380
for the roof rack usually you have to
take them off for just leaving up there

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.930
any

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.410
free noise when noise here this way
across Lite cell

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.130
oMG what does that do well it's good for
the aerodynamics

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.630
basically every little bit helps with
fuel economy

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.040
that's the story so far the 2010 Outback
we look forward to testing and has all

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.080
wheel drive standard

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.230
it is not just a matter of pavement then
similar small SUV's and wagons it's

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.660
better actually of Road

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.590
it has the sport and as the utility and
it's a wagon

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.590
