00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:05.300
STEVE: Jon we're gonna head down
and see Dave Brown.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.910
Dave just joined us from our Microsoft
Technology Center in the UK

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.150
and he's down here with the
Samsung SUR40 with PixelSense.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.808
So Dave, show us what
you've got here.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.550
DAVE: Thanks, Steve.
This is the Samsung SUR40

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.070
with Microsoft PixelSense

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.430
and I'm going to demonstrate briefly
how I can use natural user interaction

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.720
to navigate around the solar system and
the surrounding universe.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.110
So what I've got here is a chromeless UI,
but I can use touch to start navigating

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.549
around the interface
and I can use a single touch

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:38.500
or can use pinch-zoom type gestures,
multitouch to rotate or zoom the camera

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.420
or combinations of all of the above.
I can come up with some really fast, fluid

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.960
smooth gestures that would be
really hard to do with a keyboard

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.940
and a mouse.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.340
But I probably add some controls sooner
or later so i can just drag a control in

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.660
from the edge of the screen, and this is
a multi-directional platform so I can

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.260
drag in controls from any side of the
screen and they will face the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.940
appropriate direction for a user
on that side of the device.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.140
And actually I can change settings around
the camera here, so for example I can

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.670
pan the camera around in this way,
and actually I can get really in close here.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.970
Let's have a look at Lake Ontario there.
Anyone here from Canada?

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.980
Anyone from Canada?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.240
I can move out and look at the horizon
from a point in space above Lake Ontario

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.690
really, really easily just using touch.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.070
Let's zoom out a little bit more here

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.060
you can see I can use this dial control
to do that, I can use a single touch

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.690
or I can use multitouch to do that.
If I drag in another control here

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.150
this control let's me change
the field of view the camera.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.909
I can use one hand to change this control,
the other hand to change this control.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.479
And you can start coming up with
some really interesting user interfaces

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.156
when you've got this
many touch points.

00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:45.750
JON: Could give you a bit
of a god-complex though.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080
DAVE: So let's zoom out a little bit more

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.220
this is where the Moon is.
This is the inner Solar System

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.155
and I can drag the
background as well

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.090
as the control here
to come up with some

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.860
really fluid gestures.
STEVE: I think they like that Dave.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.720
DAVE: Let's hop over to Saturn.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.843
There's Saturn and its
rings and this is a live

00:02:04.844 --> 00:02:08.039
simulation of the Solar System.
I can actually unpause this

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.060
turn up time to about a thousand times
and start looking around Saturn

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.590
and its moons as I change time.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.230
So let's zoom out even
further at this point

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.297
and one of the great
things about PixelSense

00:02:19.298 --> 00:02:21.180
is that it let's the
device actually see

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.040
what's going on above it, so I've got
these transparent plastic discs here.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.780
When I place these on the screen

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.019
what you can see projected

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.815
through them is a little crosshair.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.060
I can move these around,
they're directional

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.860
so if you're on a particular side of the
device you can orientate it appropriately

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.320
and I can get information about the
stars underneath that crosshair

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.165
by either moving the background, or
moving the plastic discs around.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:45.561
Only PixelSense can actually see
what's going on above the table.

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:49.432
STEVE: So this entire panel, the entire
screen has a set of cameras as pixels.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:50.225
DAVE: Absolutely.

00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:52.949
Two million cameras are embedded
into the screen and we stitch them

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.439
together producing an image of
what's going on above the device.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.650
So finally, let's just have
a look at the constellations.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.129
Most of us are familiar with the
constellations, at least the lines.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.731
Let's zoom out a little bit.

00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:08.019
I really like to show the artwork here

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.427
so if I show...

00:03:09.428 --> 00:03:14.589
these are beautiful images that were
drawn about three hundred years ago

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.252
by a guy called Johannes Hevelius,
they're etchings.

00:03:17.253 --> 00:03:18.810
I can get really close in here

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.949
and have a look at these beautiful,
beautiful images around the sky.

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.589
So let's just pop back to Earth again,
I'll use another control to do that.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:30.559
You can see it still spinning around here
so I better turn down time

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:33.449
just a little bit.
I'll just pause time

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.474
and we've got a few
satellites in orbit here

00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:37.449
so I'll just select this one here

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.269
we'll zoom in...

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.050
What have we got here?

00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:42.433
Some of you might
recognize this actually...

00:03:42.434 --> 00:03:43.830
It's amazing what you can find

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.330
in orbit around the planet Earth.

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.579
[Applause]

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.780
STEVE: Dave, that's terrific.

00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.349
I think this is just a great
example, Jon, of this trend that

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.916
we're fascinated by at Microsoft

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:56.014
the blending of the
physical and the digital.

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:57.609
The ability to put these
physical objects

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.582
on a digital device.

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.159
JON: That's an amazing interface,
I'm sure lots of applications.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.659
What does one of these cost?

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.263
DAVE: These are about
eight thousand dollars

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:07.307
so come and talk to
us at the SIC

00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:09.327
we have several
PixelSense tables there

00:04:09.328 --> 00:04:11.109
have a look at the apps

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.529
and find out which partners are using
them the rest of the week.

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:16.339
STEVE: Fantastic. Thanks, Dave.
JON: Alright!

00:04:16.364 --> 00:04:17.864
DAVE: Thank you.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.589
[Applause]
