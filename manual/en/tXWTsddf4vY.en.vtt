00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.750
Do you know the way to San Jose?

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.980
I've been away so long, I may go wrong and lose my way.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.510
Do you know the way to San Jose?

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.540
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.870
L.A. is a great big freeway.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.160
Put a hundred down and buy a car.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.380
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.590
Weeks turn into years. How quck they pass,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.300
and all the stars that never were

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.520
are parking cars and pumping gas.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.610
You can really breathe in San Jose.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.710
They've got a lot of space. There'll be a place where I can stay.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.100
I was born and raised in San Jose.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.450
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.660
Fame and fortune is a magnet.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.890
It can pull you far away from home.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.490
With a dream in your heart you're never alone.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.880
Dreams turn into dust and blow away,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.970
and there you are without a friend.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.500
You pack your car and ride away.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.470
I've got lots of friends in San Jose

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.950
Do you know the way to San Jose?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.870
Can't wait to get back to San Jose.
