00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.960
Stage 14 is the start of the penultimate weekend
of this years Giro coming on Saturday the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.111
18th of May it's also the first time the riders
will crest a summit over 2000 metres as they

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:17.490
take the long drag up to the ski station of
Sestriere

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.320
The stage starts in Cervere where Mark Cavendish
won last year. Today Cavendish won't have

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.429
many chances as the Giro goes into the Alps
with a steep mountain top finish on Jafferau

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.429
to Bardonecchia.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:49.649
The 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.519
first part of the stage is flat with an intermediate
sprint in Pinerolo after 70 km. The last time

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.600
the Giro finished here, Franco Pellizotti
won and the Italian climber will be eager

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.220
to repeat his victory later today. Pinerolo
is also where Edvald Boasson Hagen won a stage

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.110
in the Tour de France two years ago. After
the peloton passes through Pinerolo, the real

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.680
struggles of the day start. A long uphill
drag to Sestriere covers almost 40 km with

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.390
the final 10 being the steepest.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.680
Sestriere probably won't make any differences
between the GC contenders but if a team like

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.970
Astana take the lead and keep a high pace
all the way to the top, the peloton -- or

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.430
what is left of it -- won't be very big. The
Giro has finished on Sestriere six times in

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.080
the past. The last winner here was Vasil Kiryienka,
dedicating the win to his late teammate Xavi

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.090
Tondo who had died just a few days earlier.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.210
There are 34 km from the top of Sestriere
to the beginning of the final climb Jafferau.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.680
The percentages are very high and don't drop
below 8 % at any point. Jefferau is also the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.000
climb where Eddy Merckx dropped JosÃ© Manuel
Fuentes back 1972 after the Spaniard had put

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:21.430
up a strong fight and given the spectators
a memorable day in the mountains.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.599
The climb up to the finish is relatively short
but it does have some steep sections which

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.709
peak at 14% however it's nothing compared
to tomorrows stage, you can check that out

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:41.790
right here on GCN.
