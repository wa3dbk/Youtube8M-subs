On the ROCHET watch, it is exactly 7h30 AM and we are going to the track for the final round of the Swiss 2012 Supermoto Championship.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.749
-How does it look? How about the weather?

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:27.989
-Seems like it's not raining. It's not warm either though. Not warm. We'll see how it goes. 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:34.249
Sylvain has a 42 points lead. Now, it's not over until it's over, but we hope it will end well.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:28.539
-I am telling him you are not making a lot of mistakes, and your lap times are consistent.

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.859
-Your weaknesses? A big mouth!

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:45.499
-I rode 2-3 laps very fast to try to create a good lead. And finally, I just rode easy since it was the same if I finished 3, 4, 5 or 2.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:55.819
I only needed to finish in the first 8th to get the title. I finished 3rd so super happy ! 
Another title in the pocket, the 9th to be precise. I am very happy !

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.859
Winner and new Swiss S1 Champion, from France, Sylvain Bidart !

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:06.370
-Another plate on the truck door ?

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.030
-Yes. More work for KUTVEK, they will need to print a new plate. 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:18.180
I am very happy for Honda, Owatrol, all the people trusting us for quite some years.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:30.290
It's awesome. This is the 14th title for Luc1 in Supermoto. This is a nice achievement, and very good years behind us. We are still working though.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.660
On the agenda next weekend is the Mettet Superbiker. We will host Michael Pichon in the team. 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:48.200
It's a real pleasure and an honor to have him ride with us in this event. Sylvain is looking forward to shine again in this event that is so popular.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:59.310
And then we will have the final round of the French Championship at the end of November on the Reunion Island, hoping to get a 15th title. Thank you very much !

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:17.210
- You stay with your team next year ? Same motorcycle ?
- Yes, everything the same... hum... right ?
