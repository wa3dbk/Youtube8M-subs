00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.210
Hey dudes!

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.850
I am Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking we're
going to make some grilled corn on the cob.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.470
We're gonna do it Mexican style, so I am gonna
show you how to grill out here, and then we're

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.809
going to top it with mayonnaise, lime juice,
cheese and chili powder.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.070
It might sound weird to you if you're never
tried it, but pinky swears, the best way to

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.470
eat corn on the planet.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:28.999
You got to soak you corn in water for 30 minutes
to an hour.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.629
That's to keep it from catching on fire, and
then I have got a grill here that's ready

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:34.629
and hot.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:35.629
It's about 400 degrees.

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.149
The lid is super-hot.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.449
So we're gonna put these on the hot side.

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.300
All right, and I am gonna put the lid back
on it and let them cook for about 15 minutes

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.760
and then I will flip them and cook the other
side.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760
Okay!

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.660
Time to turn our corn, lovely, smelling like
good corny goodness.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.410
Okay, so another 15 minutes.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.610
It's pretty simple really.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:14.720
Okay, so time to take these babies off of
here for a sec, and then put them over here.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.320
Put the lid back on so I don't lose all my
heat, and then you want to just sort of use

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.320
a hot mitt.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.960
We're gonna peel back almost all of the husk.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.689
Well, it's actually not all that hot.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:39.210
Okay, now we're gonna put these almost naked
corn cobs back onto the grill, and this is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.560
gonna make sure that they not only are cooked,
but also get some of that nice, charcoal flavor

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.909
there, so that will just take another five
or ten minutes.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.720
Final flip time guys!

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.530
Lovely, beautiful.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.510
Okay, okay, finally our corn is ready!

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.670
Yay!

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.450
Look at that, so I am gonna put it in here,
and then I was gonna do the whole thing outside,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.310
but there's too many goddamn flied in Texas.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.280
Somebody needs to talk Rick Perry about that!

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.840
Just kidding, he can't do anything.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.390
Okay, I am gonna take this inside, and we
will cheese them up in the indoors without

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.960
the flies.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.250
Okay, back inside free of flies we are gonna
husk our corn.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.280
See the silk just comes right off.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.280
So that's great.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.300
I am just gonna leave that on there because
it looks pretty like a little Indian festival,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.610
and then I've got this sauce here is mayonnaise,
lime juice, a little bit of salt, and some

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.840
cotija hot cheese which is similar to parmesan.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.420
It might seem really weird to you, but it
is actually awesome.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.970
So I am just gonna use my little brush here
to brush this mayonnaise onto the cob, the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.620
corn cob, get all the sides, and some people
like to actually brush this on and then put

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.090
them back on the grill so that the mayonnaise
itself gets a little bit charred, but I don't

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.090
know.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.090
By the time I am to this point I really just
want to eat some corn.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.980
You know what I am sayin'?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.560
Okay, gorgeous!

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.560
Yay!

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.510
And then we're gonna sprinkle a little bit
more cheese on top, make it extra-cheesy,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.230
and then I have got tajin which is like a,
it's a really popular Mexican seasoned salt.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.790
It's basically just chili powder, salt, and
some dehydrated lime juice.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.480
I am gonna use that.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.380
If you can't find that, you can totally just
put some chili powder and salt on there, whatever

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.370
kind of chili powder you like.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.430
It's time to tasty-taste.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.190
I am gonna eat it like a typewriter.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.740
Mmmm!

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.390
That looks odd.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.080
I have corn all over my face.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.040
Totally worth it, and I have corn in my teeth.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.010
Also totally worth it because this is the
bomb.com.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.090
Sorry to use an ancient expression, but I
am kind of old.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.090
So, there you go.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.090
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.030
I totally have mayonnaise all over my face.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.260
Okay, am I clean?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.260
I don't care.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.740
Okay, well, thanks for watching.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.121
There's how to make grilled corn on the cob.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.250
