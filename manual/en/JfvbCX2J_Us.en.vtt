Memorial Day has come and gone, and I hope
you all had a wonderful weekend.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.260
You know what that means?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.240
It's officially summertime!

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.670
I'm so excited!

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.820
I'm Donna Ruko, and this is the Loop.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.270
Now, some of my favorite things to do with
summer, I would have to say: the long, long

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.890
days, the beautiful sunsets and--as I always
do, I resort everything back to food--I would

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.890
have to say the barbecues.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.800
I love a good barbecue.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.870
Now, let's go down our summer checklist, shall
we?

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.050
We've got workouts for a beach-ready body
form the Tone It Up ladies, Tara Stiles, Ashley

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.140
Borden and Valerie Waters.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.310
We got together with some friends and made
the ultimate Memorial Day menu, which will

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.480
be great all summer long.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.130
And we went to a barbecue with the Tone It
Girls, who showed us an amazing burger recipe.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.800
Damn, that's a good burger!

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:11.610
Now, as you can see, summer is just heating
up on Livestrong Woman, and a lot of our friends

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.759
are getting ready too.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.189
For some summer fashion tips, here's Cassey
from Blogilates.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.829
Hey, guys, it's Cassey from Blogilates.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.109
Now, let's talk about fitness fashion this
summer.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.729
It's all about bright colors and booty shorts.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.829
So, what I want you to get this summer are
bright colored sports bras and fold over colored

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.719
bands because this adds a lot of pop to your
workout wear.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.999
And it's just fun to look good while you're
working out.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.509
And another element I want to add is try out
this do-it-yourself workout shirt.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.709
It's free because you can use your old college
shirts or whatever that you have laying around.

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.340
And it takes less than 5 minutes to make.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.810
Check out this shirt, look.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.810
Look at that awesome back.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.130
It's a racer back and it shows a little bit
of your lat on your sides.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.130
Super sexy.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.810
So, you can find the directions for that video
on this video, right here: my do-it-yourself

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.279
workout shirt tutorial.

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:05.189
And I hope you guys make use of your recycled
fashion.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.899
Alright, watch out for my Valerie Waters collaboration
Ab video later this week.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.459
And let me know in the comments below whether
or not you made the shirt.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.390
Cassey and Valerie's workout on A-List Look
will be up June 8th, so make sure you follow

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.209
us for notifications of all our new episodes.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.159
Well, that's all for me today.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.360
I'm running late for some fun in the sun.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.920
Leave me a comment below and tell me your
favorite thing about summer.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.099
Thanks for watching.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.610
I'm Donna Ruko, and this is the Loop on Livestrong
Woman.
