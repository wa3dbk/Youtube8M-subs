00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.699
I think first of the things we have to deal
with is analytical thinking. I think it is

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:30.960
very important for IT pupils to be able to
analyse a complex problem and divide it into

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.860
manageable chunks, and to work on these things.
I think another really important thing is

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.430
independence. Being able to independently
work on solutions and more specific on solving

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.539
problems. So now with the first problem you
encounter, you already call one of your colleagues

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.840
or a teacher in the school setting, but being
able to work independently on it. And the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.150
third thing I think is perseverance. Tackling
this problem is sometimes very hard and sometimes

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.970
also takes a lot of time, so it is really
important that you persist in it and keep

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.350
working on it until you have a solution to
your problem. If I look at ICT, I think one

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.380
of the things is being a team player. If you
look at IT companies later on, people will

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.579
always work in teams, so it is very important
for them to be a team player. Linked to that,

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:38.909
I also think that communication is very important
for IT personnel. Being able to communicate

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.689
with your colleagues, with end users, with
management, etc. It is very important. Next,

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.869
also linked to that I think, is languages.
English is very important as a language in

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.320
ICT because most of the information you find
online about computing is always in English.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:08.619
Also, if you work together in multinational
teams, English is mostly the language used

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.640
in that team. And more specifically here in
Flanders, I also think that knowledge of French

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.550
is also very important. Become a lifelong
learner. That is important for everyone, but

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.900
especially in the ICT sector where everything
changes very rapidly. It is very important

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.019
that first of all you love to learn new things
and secondly also are able to learn yourself

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.849
new things, because it is not the case that
you always go on training, you also have to

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.519
learn a lot just by yourself. I think it will
be the analytical thinking, so having that

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.890
complex problem, being able to split it up
in smaller sub-problems, being able to solve

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.379
these problems, and to combine these solutions
together to fix the larger problem at hand.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.319
I think you can already start learning this
from a very young age even without ICT. An

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.519
example that I use we don’t make it ourselves
is baking an egg. Get a pan, get an egg, break

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.680
the egg, put it in the pan. I already forgot
the butter. I would say it is important not

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.670
to focus necessarily on the kind of outcome
in terms of their levels. I think the skills

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.879
you need to really hone in on is see that
they have progressed in their interaction

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.080
with other students, see that they have actually
not gone straight away to “Sir, can you

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.080
help me this?”.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.900
They actually took the time to “I have got
this problem” and they are thinking about

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.280
it. Also, the computational thinking does
lend itself in there, but they have actually

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.319
got the kind of skills to understand which
tool applies to and when they should use that.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.670
I think that is really important for them.
I think now that the development is more collaboration,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.700
so fact that you can work in a team, talk,
share ideas. That is coming out very strongly

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.909
in all curriculum at the moment. We are doing
a development on teaching thinking, so sometimes

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:20.560
it is not that the students don’t actually
learn it, it is getting them to express their

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.800
teaching, and using the right language to
tell you that they have actually got that

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.479
understanding. So sometimes they can do it,
but when you can ask them to tell you how

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.600
they did it, they haven’t got the language
skills to do that. A lot is really the creative

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.169
design, not forgetting with the nitty-gritty
and the technical part of it, but having an

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.550
understanding of what you want to achieve,
and having them maybe using mind maps and

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.389
other form of algorithms. But getting away
from the nitty-gritty syntax, and understand

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.210
here is what I want, there is a piece of software
to do, there is a piece of hardware to do,

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:07.669
and understanding it, and then getting all
of that, the hard skills together to perform.

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.580
Really visualising the end product. Visualising
how you are going to do it and not getting

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.289
caught up with the technicalities of the syntax
and the environment.
