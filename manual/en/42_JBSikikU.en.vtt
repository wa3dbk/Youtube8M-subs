00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
The second interview is really important because
in the first interview they've gotten to know

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.750
you and now they're calling you in again because
they think that you're a potential candidate.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.190
But chances are, you're probably up against
someone who is equally qualified, someone

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.609
who they're considering to be on par with
you so now it is time to pull out all the

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.949
stops to make sure that you are the person
who gets the job.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.620
And how you do that is to make it very explicit
why you are the perfect person for this job.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
Chances are in the second interview, you're
interviewing with someone else in addition

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.280
to first person or the first few people who
interviewed you.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.329
What they want to do is show you off.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.090
They think that you're a great fit and what
they're trying to do is either get their boss

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.670
or someone else from the team to validate
their decision.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.100
So in that first interview, you should have
been, and I hope you were, watching for tell

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130
tale signs that you're on the right track.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.930
So when someone is nodding their head, moving
forward, their posture is indicating that

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.950
what you're saying is right.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.940
And what you wanna do in that second interview
is to repeat the same stories that seemed

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.900
to trigger a positive response in that first
interview.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.890
One of the other secret little tips is often
times the interviewer who had you in the first

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.920
interview, they will say, 'tell us the story
about when you did this', and you wanna make

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.290
sure as much as possible you tell that same
story.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.720
And you enhance whatever it is that you told
in the first place again but make it relevant

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.980
to the company you're actually applying for.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.340
So make it relevant as much as possible.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.030
What you're trying to do is make the fit.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.360
The second interview is actually really easy
because you've gotten all the indication from

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.160
the first interview about what went right.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.570
What I want you to do in the second interview
is to make it more right.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.820
Keep going in that same direction.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.430
That's how you ace a second interview.
