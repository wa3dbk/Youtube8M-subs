with these tips.

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:18.030
You will need Ankle length, opaque, dark-hued

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.450
a belt (optional).

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.610
Step 1.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.210
Choose ankle-length, opaque, black, or dark-hued
leggings to avoid looking like a fashion victim.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.949
There are lots of great fabrics and pattern
choices, like lace, "wet look," or torn to

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.719
personalize your look.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.050
Step 2.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.219
Create balance by wearing loose fitting boyfriend-style
t-shirts, flowing blouses, long sweaters,

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.210
or roomy oxfords.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.769
Tight on top and tight on bottom looks trashy.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.699
Remember â€“ leggings aren't pants.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.090
Make sure your top is long enough to cover
your hips.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.369
Step 3.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.350
Wear leggings with tunics for a casual, bohemian
look.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.909
A colorful, printed top becomes the focus
with a pair of simple black leggings.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.210
Step 4.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.500
Pair leggings with a dress, which can be fitted
for a sleeker look, or with a voluminous skirt

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.060
for a more casual vibe.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.110
Cinch your dress with a skinny belt to create
an elegant silhouette while elongating your

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.300
legs.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.770
Step 5.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.310
Top your leggings with a jacket.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.310
Hip-length jackets are flattering, as are
embellished jackets, like a fashionable military

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.619
jacket.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.939
Step 6.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.670
Slip them on under a miniskirt.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.060
This not only looks fashionable and current
but comes in handy if your miniskirt is a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.940
bit too short for you to feel comfortable
in.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.969
Step 7.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.359
Complement your leggings with the right shoes.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.130
Flats, boots, sling backs, and pumps always
look great.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.829
The more fashion forward can opt for funky,
high-heeled platform shoes.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.439
