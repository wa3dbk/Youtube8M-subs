00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.980
Hi, I'm Tim Gipson, I'm going to talk to you
about HVAC troubleshooting. Now, one of the

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.630
best ways to make sure that your system maintains
optimal performance whether it's in the heating

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.310
cycle in the winter months or in the cooling
cycle in the summer months is to make sure

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.580
that you have routine maintenance done on
your systems. So usually how that's worked

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.220
up is you work with a company and they will
inspect and make any repairs to your air conditioning

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.690
system once a year, and then to your heating
system once a year. And that's really the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.550
best thing you can do as far as preventative
measures to keep from having your problems

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.520
with your HVAC. Now if you have a situation
where well, it's a little cold, then the first

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.500
thing you want to do is you always want to
start troubleshooting your HVAC by checking

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.079
the simplest things first. So the first thing
we want to do is we want to check our thermostat

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.420
and make sure it is set and it's working properly
and it's where it's supposed to be. The next

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.139
thing would be if we're not heating well enough
or not cooling well enough we could not be

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:18.490
getting enough airflow because maybe our filter
is clogged up. So we want to check our filters

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.069
and make sure - and these should be changed
out with these high efficiency filters - got

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.579
to be changed out every two to three months
 - with standard filters, they ought to be

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.849
changed out every month. Now, if your system
is not running at all, then what you'd want

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.369
to check there is there is a cut off on the
side of the unit so you may want to check

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.469
and make sure that that cut off is still on
in the side of the unit, and the next area

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.749
would be, would be to check your circuit breakers
in your main panel and then also your emergency

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:58.959
cut off that's on the exterior out by your
air conditioning units. And if you check all

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.380
those and you do have power and everything
is working but some of the part of the system

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.450
that is really recommended that you contact
a professional company that has experience

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.599
in HVAC systems and have them come and take
a look, 'cause in the long run, and particularly

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.150
if you have an ongoing contract with somebody,
you'll be much better off in maintaining your

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.340
system and troubleshooting your system. So
I'm Tim Gipson with some tips on troubleshooting

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.200
your HVAC.
