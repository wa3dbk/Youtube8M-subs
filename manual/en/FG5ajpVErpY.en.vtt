00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.020
As preparations are made for the roll-out
of Hello Kitty's 40th birthday festivities

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.700
in Los Angeles, the company that makes the
beloved mouthless feline wants to set the

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.840
record straight: Hello Kitty is not a cat
at all, says Sanrio.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.850
She's a real human little girl who lives outside
of London, has a twin sister and a cat of

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.010
her own and will forever be in third grade.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.980
It's part of Hello Kitty's origin story that
most of the world never glommed onto as the

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.250
Japanese character steadily won over hearts
and minds across the globe beginning in the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.430
early 1970s.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.870
And it's finally been dug up with the help
of anthropologist Christine R. Yano, who's

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.460
putting together the Hello Kitty retrospective
in Los Angeles to honor the character's 40th

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.460
anniversary.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.680
The truth came out as Sanrio edited Yano's
script for the retrospective at the Japanese

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.300
American National Museum.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.250
'I was corrected â€” very firmly,' Yano told
the LA Times.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.009
'That's one correction Sanrio made for my
script for the show.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.420
Hello Kitty is not a cat.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.380
She's a cartoon character.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.430
She is a little girl.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.600
'She is not a cat.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.860
She's never depicted on all fours.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.670
She walks and sits like a two-legged creature.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.430
She does have a pet cat of her own, however,
and it's called Charmmy Kitty.'

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.790
As it turns out, Hello Kitty has an entire
backstory created at a time when Japanese

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.270
women romanticized life in England.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.600
'She has a twin sister,' Yano continued..

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.960
'She's a perpetual third-grader.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.400
She lives outside of London.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.119
I could go on.'

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.850
Why Sanrio chose to portray the little girl
as a cat with no mouth, Yano did not say.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.970
Instead of pondering Hello Kitty imponderables,
it may be best to concentrate on the character's

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.400
accomplishments.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.370
Besides reaching the ripe age of 40 without
so much as a wrinkle, Hello Kitty recently

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.030
made her first trek to outer space.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.810
A 4-cm (1.6-inch) tall Hello Kitty figure
is aboard the Hodoyoshi-3 satellite, looking

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.210
through a window at Earth, Sanrio announced
this week.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.319
The satellite, which is about the size of
a large rubbish bin, was developed by Japanese

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.829
researchers as part of a $40 million program
funded by the education and science ministry.

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:30.469
Hello Kitty's retrospective opens October
11 and will remain on view through April 2015.

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.549
The inaugural Hello Kitty Convention will
also be held in Los Angeles from October 30

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.859
through November 2.
