Things you didn't know about: The Chicken

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.700
Chickens are so small that they can fit into the gap in between a wall and iron bars or glass panes.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:40.300
This is useful when imprisoning chickens to torture them and / or enslaving them for their eggs.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.440
They are also small enough to fit inside cauldrons.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:58.620
You can actually trap them inside a cauldron by pushing another block on top.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:13.100
This sadly does not work with hoppers, they just fall through or jump out of the top.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.020
Originally, all chickens were male..

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:40.900
This was the word of Notch, although they have always been laying eggs..

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.480
He has later stated that genders doesnt exist in Minecraft, which seems about right.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.480
Chickens are the most stupid mob in Minecraft..

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:16.300
This can be proven by looking into the chicken head, which can be done because the chicken is missing a texture for the bottom of its head.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.340
Throwing an egg has no more than a 1/8 chance of spawning a chick.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:38.820
A single egg has 1 / 256 chance of spawning 4 chicks!

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:50.600
Hitting mobs and players with eggs does not deal any damage them, despite them turning red as if they did.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.260
In creative, you can create a what is often called a 'chicken bomb'.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:23.480
This is done by spawning a huge amount of chickens on a single block high up in the sky.
