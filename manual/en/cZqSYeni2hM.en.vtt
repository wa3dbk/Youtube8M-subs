00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.882
Excuse me, I'm Amy Farrah Fowler, 
you're Sheldon Cooper.

00:00:04.597 --> 00:00:08.710
Everyone pay attention. Yes, I have
a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:12.454
Yes, she's female.
Yes, we communicate on a daily basis,

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:14.576
But no, she's not my girlfriend.

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:18.501
Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me
to meet her mother.

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:21.607
- Yeah, so?
- What does that mean?

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:27.764
Well, you know how you're always saying that Amy is 
a girl who is your friend and not your girlfriend?

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:30.016
Can't say that anymore.

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:33.137
Amy...

00:00:34.937 --> 00:00:38.125
Will you be my girlfriend?

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.921
- Yes.
- Well, that's enough of that.

00:00:45.126 --> 00:00:48.901
Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:52.153
Other than my mother, my sister
and my meemaw, no.

00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:55.627
But you're a scientist, 
where is the curiosity?

00:00:55.628 --> 00:00:58.459
I'm available for experimentation.

00:01:05.568 --> 00:01:06.538
Fascinating.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.684
- Amy, really, she's not gonna come on to Sheldon.
- Oh, really?

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:12.410
Look at this face.

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:19.957
How can any woman spend 8 hours a day
alone with this face and not fall in love with it?

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:25.373
No, there are certain things that say to the world: 
'I have a boyfriend and he's not made up"

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.180
Matching costumes, hickeys
and sex tapes.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.740
Pick one.

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:36.615
What's a hickey?

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:41.153
Hear this, Leonard has some ridiculous notion 
that you're mad at me.

00:01:41.154 --> 00:01:44.257
Tell him you're not mad at me, 
go ahead, set him straight.

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:46.455
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:49.099
Your mother thinks you're losing
your mind over me.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.176
As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:54.865
You insulted my woman.
I'm here to defend her honor.

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:57.862
Now prepare yourself for what may come.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.170
I made a commitment in writing 
to comfort you in times like this.

00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:06.450
Additionally, you're my girlfriend
and I care about your well being.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.157
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome.

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:13.243
Now, let's get this over with.

00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:16.588
It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy.

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.931
I thought our relationship
was based on trust

00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:22.866
And a mutual admiration
that skews in my favor.

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:26.856
- First of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.
- Then what's the problem?

00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:28.456
Penny,

00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:36.137
All my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort 
of physical contact that comes easily to others.

00:02:36.138 --> 00:02:40.556
Hand shaking, hugging,
prostate exams.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:51.203
But I'm working on it, you know.
Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest.

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:54.194
A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.

00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:10.198
Hang on, are you saying that someday you and Amy
might actually get physical?

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:15.284
It's a possibility.

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:19.873
Oh my God!

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.674
Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you
and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.

00:03:37.823 --> 00:03:38.875
How is that?

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:43.546
I feel like I'm being strangled 
by a boa constrictor.

00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:48.864
Why did you stop?
