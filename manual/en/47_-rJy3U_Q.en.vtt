00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.660
This is my review of the Audio Technica ATH
M50 headphones - the best over ear headphones

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.100
for the money.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.320
So before you go out and drop this month's
rent on a pair of Beats headphones, you'll

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.790
want to consider buying these instead.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.079
So as always, the link to the best price on
Amazon is in the description below.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.210
Why are these the best headphones for the
money?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.880
Well currently they are the #1 Best Seller
for DJ Headphones on Amazon and you can get

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.260
a pair for just over $100, and at such a low
price you get amazing sound quality, comfort,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.920
portability, and design.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.550
The M50's come in 3 colors: black, white,
and this limited edition red.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.400
First off, the most important aspect is the
sound quality which is nearly flawless.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.510
They have a super clear and crisp audio that
exemplifies a very natural sound.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.910
The bass is not overbearing, and the mids
and highs are smooth.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.300
They do a great job at blocking external noise
as well so they are good in the noise cancelling

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.300
department.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.920
They are very comfortable, with a good bit
of padding on the top and soft cushioning

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.109
on the ear cups as well.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.810
So you can wear them for an extended period
of time without worrying about them getting

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.899
uncomfortable.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.539
The build quality is also fantastic, and they
are extremely adjustable.

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.840
You can adjust them to fit any head size or
shape, shout out to Arnold.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.579
They excel in portability as well with the
collapse-and-fold feature, and they also come

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.119
with a nice carrying pouch which is pretty
convenient.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.759
They come with a coiled or straight cable,
whichever you prefer.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:40.139
The cable has a 1/4" adapter which can be
unscrewed to reveal the regular 3.5mm connector

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:45.100
that can be plugged into all the common headphone
jacks found on smartphones and computers.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.740
So if you're looking for some affordable high
quality over ear headphones for any type of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.890
audio and video editing or even just casual
music listening then the Audio Technica ATH

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069
M50's are a must-have.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.579
Again the link to buy these at the best price
will be in the description below.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.060
