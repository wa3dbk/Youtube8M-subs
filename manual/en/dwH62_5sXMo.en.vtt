Hi, this is Laura Turner, and today we're
going to talk about how to write in the third

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:12.030
person. As a fiction writer, writing in third
person can free you up a lot by allowing you

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.310
to get out of the first person, which is inside
of one person's head, and into the head of

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.140
an omniscient or an outside narrator. Omniscient
third person is actually different from regular

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.859
third person in that omniscient third person
narratives can actually go into multiple characters

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.910
heads, even in--within the same chapter, or
even in the same paragraph. But today we're

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.680
going to talk about just writing in third
person, which is using that third person pronoun,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:50.800
and actually looking into someone else's head,
as opposed to coming from within. So, I'm

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.430
going to illustrate this by contrast, and
I'm going to give you a sentence that I have

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.810
written in all three different kinds of narrative.
The sentence is, I went to the store and bought

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:12.850
some milk. This is written in first person.
Second person is illustrated by just changing

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.560
the first pronoun to you. So you went to the
store and bought some milk. So just someone

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:30.109
observing one character throughout the entire
narrative. And then third person is Quentin

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:37.969
went to the store and bought some milk, or
you can also replace Quentin's name with he.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:44.740
So you have someone observing a person from
an outside viewpoint. And the difference between

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.179
second person and third person is that the
second person is always going to be the you

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:58.509
form. It's never going to be a he or a she.
The third person will be he or she. And usually

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:06.060
the most common ways of writing are in the
first and third person. And really I think

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.790
third person is what I enjoy to read most,
but you should just use whatever you'd like

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.250
to use. And if you want to use more than one
type of narrative within the same book, you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.040
can definitely do that because there really
are no rules to constrict you.
