00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.197
So, you're thinking of moving to Mars.

00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:15.978
Have you picked out a spot 
for your new home?

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:19.164
No? Well, I'm here to help.

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:20.488
First things first,

00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:23.883
here are some of the things
you'll need to bring to The Red Planet:

00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:29.320
a high tolerance for cold, 
loneliness, and radiation;

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.938
a lifetime supply 
of breathable air and food;

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:35.321
a multibillion dollar spaceship;

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:37.927
a desire to just get away from it all;

00:00:37.927 --> 00:00:39.367
and water.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:43.642
You're definitely going to need water.

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:46.182
So what sort of real estate
are you looking for?

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:50.051
How about a mansion in the maze-like
Noctis Labyrinthus?

00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:52.687
A hideaway in the Happy Face Crater?

00:00:52.687 --> 00:00:56.225
A fortress on the Face Mesa?

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:57.958
An oceanview?

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.788
Uh, bad news on the last one.

00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:04.311
You're about 4 billion years late.

00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:07.948
We're pretty sure that Mars
used to have oceans, lakes, rivers,

00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:09.970
the whole package.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.695
But over time, almost all of it
froze beneath the surface,

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:16.582
or evaporated off into space.

00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:19.182
There's probably still some
trapped beneath

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:25.062
the seasonally expanding and contracting
carbon dioxide ice caps, though.

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:29.337
So what might Mars look like today
if it had surface water?

00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:32.131
That, of course, depends
on how much we're talking about,

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.573
but maybe something like this.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:39.064
The relatively flat northern hemisphere
is below the average elevation,

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.666
so it would become one giant ocean,

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.562
while the crater-ridden 
southern hemisphere

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:47.089
would stay mostly high and dry.

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:50.497
That difference between hemispheres
is a bit bizarre,

00:01:50.497 --> 00:01:52.650
and we don't know why it's like that.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.101
The southern half is probably
much older,

00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:57.432
judging by features 
like the number of craters,

00:01:57.432 --> 00:02:02.756
and the evidence of increased
volcanic activity in the north.

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.140
Okay, so who knows?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.842
Maybe one day Mars will have oceans again,

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:11.749
but for now, what we've got is essentially
one giant dusty desert.

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.611
In fact, it's similar enough 
to deserts on Earth,

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:19.239
that we've been able to learn a great deal
about Mars on our home planet.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.321
For instance, Martian sand dunes
form and behave

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.663
similarly to our sand dunes,

00:02:24.663 --> 00:02:28.007
though the Martian versions 
often grow twice as large

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:33.306
thanks to a gravitational pull
that's about a third as strong as ours.

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:36.227
And Mars has some features
you won't see on Earth,

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:41.363
like tars, which are crestless
sand dunes up to fifteen meters tall,

00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:44.803
whose formations 
we have yet to understand.

00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:46.057
You're probably wondering,

00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:48.819
"What do you get when you
combine a planet-wide desert

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.064
with an atmosphere that, like ours,

00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:56.493
is subject to wind-generating
pressure differentials, dust storms?"

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:59.422
These will be your main weather hazards
on the Red Planet.

00:02:59.422 --> 00:03:02.240
They play a large part 
in making the planet red

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.644
by distributing rusted iron particles
across the surface and into the air.

00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:09.920
Thanks to the low gravity
and lack of moisture,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.964
these dust storms can last for months
and cover the planet.

00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:19.779
So, you might want to build your home
as high as possible.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.481
Well, look no further.

00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:27.195
This is Olympus Mons,
the largest volcano in the Solar System.

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:29.323
Even if Mars had a breathable atmosphere,

00:03:29.323 --> 00:03:34.556
you'd find the views from 
the 25 kilometer summit breathtaking.

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:36.163
Or are volcanos not your thing?

00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:41.919
Then how about Valles Marineris,
the largest canyon in the Solar System?

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.061
It's so wide that from one side,

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:48.182
the opposite rim would be below
the curve of the horizon.

00:03:48.182 --> 00:03:53.694
Still, you'll catch some spectacular
blue sunsets in the normally red sky,

00:03:53.694 --> 00:03:57.136
which gets its color from the dust
absorbing most of the blue light,

00:03:57.136 --> 00:04:01.630
and the way sunlight is scattered
by the atmosphere.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.482
Have you got spirit, curiosity,
or are you just looking for opportunity?

00:04:06.482 --> 00:04:10.908
Then stop stalling
and make the move to Mars today.

00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:14.215
Mars: Redder than Ever.
