00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:15.435
What do Harry Potter,

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:16.561
Katniss Everdeen,

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.578
and Frodo

00:00:17.578 --> 00:00:21.621
all have in common with the heroes of ancient myths?

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:25.609
What if I told you they are all variants of the same hero?

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.401
Do you believe that?

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.982
Joseph Campbell did.

00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:31.044
He studied myths from all over the world

00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:32.537
and published a book called,

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:34.658
"The Hero with a Thousand Faces,"

00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:36.320
retelling dozens of stories

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.079
and explaining how each represents the mono-myth,

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.904
or hero's journey.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.750
So, what is the "hero's journey"?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.850
Think of it as a cycle.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.537
The journey begins and ends in a hero's ordinary world,

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:55.220
but the quest passes through an unfamiliar, special world.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.602
Along the way, there are some key events.

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.213
Think about your favorite book or movie.

00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:02.725
Does it follow this pattern?

00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:05.950
Status quo, that's where we start.

00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.555
1:00: Call to Adventure.

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:12.105
The hero receives a mysterious message,

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.187
an invitation?

00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:14.572
A challenge?

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:16.421
2:00: Assistance

00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:17.840
The hero needs some help,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.122
probably from someone older, wiser.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.706
3:00: Departure

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:26.087
The hero crosses the threshold from his normal, safe home,

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:29.078
and enters the special world and adventure.

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:30.895
We're not in Kansas anymore.

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:32.799
4:00: Trials

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.048
Being a hero is hard work:

00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:35.355
our hero solves a riddle,

00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:36.598
slays a monster,

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:38.433
escapes from a trap.

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:41.548
5:00: Approach

00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:43.848
It's time to face the biggest ordeal,

00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:45.871
the hero's worst fear.

00:01:48.318 --> 00:01:50.843
6:00: Crisis

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.801
This is the hero's darkest hour.

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:55.674
He faces death and possibly even dies

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:57.456
only to be reborn.

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:00.980
7:00: Treasure

00:02:02.196 --> 00:02:05.866
As a result, the hero claims some treasure,

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:08.251
special recognition, or power.

00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:09.977
8:00: Result

00:02:09.977 --> 00:02:12.221
This can vary between stories.

00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:14.416
Do the monsters bow down before the hero,

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:18.347
or do they chase him as he flees from the special world?

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:20.663
9:00: Return

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:25.120
After all that adventure, the hero returns to his ordinary world.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.169
10:00: New Life

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.478
This quest has changed the hero;

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:32.318
he has outgrown his old life.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.620
11:00: Resolution

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.284
All the tangled plot lines get straightened out.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:40.593
12:00: Status Quo,

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.780
but upgraded to a new level.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.784
Nothing is quite the same once you are a hero.

00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:47.469
Many popular books and movies

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.177
follow this ancient formula pretty closely.

00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:53.911
But let's see how well "The Hunger Games" fits the hero's journey template.

00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:55.968
When does Katniss Everdeen hear her call to adventure

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:57.926
that gets the story moving?

00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:01.459
When her sister's name is called from the lottery.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.098
How about assistance?

00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:05.462
Is anyone going to help her on her adventure?

00:03:05.462 --> 00:03:06.735
Haymitch.

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:08.307
What about departure?

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:10.428
Does she leave her ordinary world?

00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:12.645
She gets on a train to the capital.

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:14.094
OK, so you get the idea.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.609
What do you have in common

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.546
with Harry Potter,

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:17.391
Katniss Everdeen,

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:18.522
and Frodo?

00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:21.981
Well, you're human, just like them.

00:03:21.981 --> 00:03:24.897
The hero's journey myth exists in all human cultures

00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:26.606
and keeps getting updated

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.891
because we humans reflect on our world

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:33.082
through symbolic stories of our own lives.

00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:35.079
You leave your comfort zone,

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.558
have an experience that transforms you,

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:40.459
and then you recover and do it again.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.464
You don't literally slay dragons or fight Voldemort,

00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:46.026
but you face problems just as scary.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:47.243
Joseph Campbell said,

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:52.143
"in the cave you fear to enter lies the treasure you seek."

00:03:52.143 --> 00:03:55.111
What is the symbolic cave you fear to enter?

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.522
Auditions for the school play?

00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:59.266
Baseball tryouts?

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:00.813
Love?

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:04.664
Watch for this formula in books, movies, and TV shows you come across.

00:04:04.664 --> 00:04:06.409
You will certainly see it again.

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.616
But also be sensitive to it in your own life.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.083
Listen for your call to adventure.

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:13.665
Accept the challenge.

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:14.936
Conquer your fear

00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:17.293
and claim the treasure you seek.

00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:18.593
And then,

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:20.439
do it all over again.
