00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.540
wild animals in their innumerable forms

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.690
are an irreplaceable part of the earth's
natural system.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.820
Each generation of man holds the
resources of the earth in trust for

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.250
future generations.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.520
Of the world's more than one
million seven hundred and fifty thousand

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.789
described animal species

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.189
at least eight to ten thousand migrate.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.739
Every minute, every single second,
millions of animals are fighting their

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.739
way through dangerous territories

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.719
through skies and seas.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.340
Migratory species have always
contributed in many ways to

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.320
ecosystem structure and function
supporting the Earth's web of life.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.690
While migrating, many species cross
national borders,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.199
artificial constructs meaningless to the
animals

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.379
but with dramatic influences on their
survival chances.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.950
 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.160
Borders not only divide countries, they
also separate national legislation

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.890
and political priorities. The species'
fate

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.520
rests with governments. CMS

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.740
works by bringing together the
governments of its Parties to discuss

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.740
ways of protecting and conserving
migratory species.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.100
If we have a vision of the future, it is a
future, where animals

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.750
also have a space. All in all, the aims
of the Convention

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.390
are the global protection and conservation
of migratory species

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.040
and their sustainable use. At the very
beginning 29 countries signed the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.760
Convention.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.350
Since then, many more countries have
decided to join

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.580
taking a full part in this Convention
with

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.580
all its benefits. Migrating animals face
a wide range of threats to their

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.670
individual lives and their populations.
Habitat loss,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.010
climate change, hunting, bycatch,
overfishing,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.750
wind parks are challenging the travelers
of the natural world.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.900
Gorillas are facing a dire future. We're
cutting down our forest

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.840
we're converting it to farmland, we're shooting
them to sell the meat in the markets

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.959
and capturing their babies to sell alive to  animal traders.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.160
All of these activities are illegal. Human
impact

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.890
takes a heavy toll. A great number of
animals are threatened with extinction.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.320
Extinction rate today's up to a thousand
times higher

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.010
than the normal rate.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.620
Extinction is forever!

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.590
CMS considers obstacles to migration and
the imbalance of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.299
eco-systems to work out solutions. CMS
works with other organizations which

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.850
bring together the best scientific
knowledge.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.540
The convention helps policymakers
address the crisis

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.150
migratory species face in the world. As
wild animals depend

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.980
on various eco-systems, CMS recognizes the
importance of

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.510
restoring and protecting the habitats
which sustain

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.430
animals during their migration. All
species

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.610
have value, have a scientific value,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.730
have a cultural value,

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.330
an estetic value, are very precious to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.150
our wellbeing. Migratory animals have
a right to live with us

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.880
on this planet. The world is increasingly
overpopulated.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.099
Where natural habitats are increasingly degraded, this

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.310
organization can make a difference. We work with species

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.480
on the ground, in the sea and in the air.
We work with many species around the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.810
world that are endangered. We work with
elephants, gorillas, sharks,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.150
whales, birds, marine turtles and bats.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.290
All countries have a responsibility to
save their natural heritage,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.049
the eco-system and the species that make
up the web of life.

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.650
Join CMS to conserve our natural
heritage

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.700
and build bridges for migratory animals

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.700
across all boundaries.
