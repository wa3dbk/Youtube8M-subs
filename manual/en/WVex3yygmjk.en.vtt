00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:05.070
M: Hey Will, this is a food story. I normally
do these alone. They’re kind of my thing.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.920
I mean, are you up to this?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.360
W: In my entire life I’ve only been up for
3 things: cinnamon rolls, naps, and writing

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.430
children’s novels under the pen name R.L.
Stine.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.800
M: You heard it here first!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.199
M: Welcome to Sourcefed, I’m Matt Lieberman.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.119
W: And I’m William Haynes.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.890
M: The food and beverage industry is comprised
of thousands of global brands, but did you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.369
know that the vast majority of those brands
are owned by a small number of huge companies?

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.359
W: I didn’t, but that’s only because I
spend most of my time exploring the back catalogues

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.530
of Cher and the Bangles. Matt wrote that specific
line. I don’t know what that is.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.609
M: The following ten companies represent millions
of jobs, billions of dollars in profits, and

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.820
hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.
These companies control the world’s food.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.210
W: Coming in at number 10, Associated British
Foods, a British food manufacturer whose portfolio

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.100
includes Mazola corn oil and Twinings tea.
This makes sense to me because British people

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.850
often like tea according to stereotype and
that girl I tried to date once that only wanted

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.190
to drink tea with me.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.769
M: At number 9, Kellogg! Aside from its well
known cereal brands, Kellogg also owns Pringles,

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.660
which it acquired in 2012 for 2.7 billion
dollars, and Keebler, which is what Will calls

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.330
all Irish people behind their back.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.500
W: Untrue. I don’t even know what an Irish
person is.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.000
M: This is not surprising to me.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.440
W: At number 8, General Mills, which owns
Betty Crocker, Green Giant, and Pillsbury

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.970
aside from its cereal brands. Can you imagine
those three people in a room together? Hilarious!

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.460
M: Coming in at number 7, Mondelez International.
Now, fun fact, in 2012, Kraft Foods split

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.390
into two separate companies, Kraft Foods Group
and Mondelez. While Kraft Foods handles the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.420
American grocery brands, Mondelez owns its
candy and snack brands, like Cadbury, Nabisco,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.710
Oreo, and Trident gum. Though their products
are sweet, according to corporate watchdogs

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.820
Oxfam, their approach to climate change and
corporate transparency is not.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.580
W: Was...was that your joke?

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.040
M: Yeah.
W: You’re not even trying.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.280
M: I worked really hard on this piece-

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.229
W: You’re making it worse. Number 6 is Groupe
Danone, a French company that has massive

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.980
sales in Russia, followed by France, the U.S.,
China, and Indonesia. They make their money

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.780
by selling fresh dairy and bottled water,
because as we all know, French people do nothing

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.700
but drink water and eat cheese. Nothing! You’re
writing me very racist in this story.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.260
M: At number 5 is Mars, Inc., which is the
only one of these companies that is privately

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.000
owned. It owns tons of candy brands, including
M&amp;Ms, Milky Way, Snickers, and Twix, but also

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.560
owns food brands like Uncle Ben’s Rice.
Do you have an opinion of Uncle Ben’s Rice,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.830
Will?

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.650
W: It’s overpriced.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.190
M: Right.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.310
W: Number 4 is Unilever, a company best known
for their hair and soap products, but also

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.990
owns a bunch of food brands, like Lipton tea,
Hellmann’s mayonnaise, and Ben &amp; Jerry’s

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.740
ice cream. I hate dutch people. No! No!

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.470
M: PepsiCo is number 3. You’re like wait
a second, when’s the last time I drank a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.790
Pepsi? That’s impossible! Well, did you
know that they also own big time food brands

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.080
like Tostitos, Doritos, and Quaker Oats? Neither
did I. That’s pretty cool.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.280
W: Number two is Coca-Cola. The company that
became an American institution by selling

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.350
what was once cocaine soda to people - seriously,
look it up - had 8.4 billion dollars in profits

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.400
last year. They own a wide variety of beverages,
including Dasani and Vitamin Water, but Coca-Cola

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.990
is the strongest brand in their portfolio.
America is destroying the Earth through it’s

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.750
patriarchy of evil. I give up...

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.000
M: At number 1, the largest food company on
the planet is Nestle. Candy, bottled water,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.380
Hot Pockets, the list goes on. They had 11.2
billion dollars in profits last year. They’re

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.290
also the most environmentally and socially
responsible company on this list, receiving

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.300
high scores from Oxfam in corporate transparency,
water use, and climate change. So go buy some

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.780
hot pockets to s thanks. Hey Will, do you
have anything else controversial that you’d

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.440
like to say?
W: I’m not

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.840
reading any of this. I’m pretty sure you
wrote the swariest word I’ve ever read in

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.860
my entire life.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.080
M: Great! So what do you guys think about
the consolidation of all of these food companies?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.080
