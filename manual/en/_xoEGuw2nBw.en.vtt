00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the F1 season begins in only 14 days in Bahrain

00:00:03.808 --> 00:00:06.808
and Rubens Barrichello in new home in the Williams team

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.198
will hit a new record: 300 Grand Prix

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.760
his wife Silvana say that takes care of 3 children

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:16.161
DUDU

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:16.682
DUDU, FEFE...

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.313
DUDU, FEFE...and RUBINHO.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.669
boys of the Barrichello´s family have similar tastes

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.696
He will complete the eighteenth season and will arrive this year also

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:31.561
the incredible mark of 300 grands prix traveled

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:36.223
but Rubens Barrichello not only collects records and historical landmarks in F1

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:38.734
He also collects... helmets.

00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:44.517
In the apartment and in the family´s farm, Barrichello lost count

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:48.093
of how many helmets are ... him and other drivers

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.715
Massa, Schumacher, Alonso, Button, Trulli, Tony Kanaan, Ingo Hoffman

00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:56.127
and this is not the only collection

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.244
Look at the closet!

00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:03.775
Rubinho has recorded all races who played since 1993!!!

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:07.753
Before a race ... Will I run in Australia? ... I see the race from the last year.

00:01:07.754 --> 00:01:10.403
But there are races ... and races.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:14.644
When watching again the final Grand Prix of Germany in 2000,

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:18.914
Rubinho feel that "lump in his throat" (brazilian expression)...

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.341
...remembering the first win in his career.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.685
Normal ... normal ... right people? Normal...

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:30.266
Became a trademark.

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:35.977
At some point do you regret yourself being a person that exposes both their feelings?

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:40.863
Look ... It´s not repentance. I think

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:45.983
I am judged in a way that sometimes I'm not.

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:51.719
I'm this honest guy that I think 80 percent of people understand me.

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:56.416
Believe - Persist

00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:59.726
They´re verbs so conjugated as collected.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:04.987
The most experient F1 driver has videos, helmets but especially...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.372
...Friends!!!

00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:09.693
I think this is what remains.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.310
This something cool from you make friends.

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:17.258
I think this so important. An honest person

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:18.044
make friendships.

00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:22.413
And Rubinho, the friends´ collector also has 

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:25.309
a twisted able to convince anyone...

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:29.246
Speak this: "Twist for Daddy!!!"
