00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.300
The aim of our imaging centre is to develop the new

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.360
imaging techniques of the future. We have eleven state-of-the-art

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.660
imaging devices, which give us a
completely unique view of the body

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.460
or the brain .We're able to look for holes
in the heart

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.449
that are the size of a human hair, or
investigate the subtle changes

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.610
that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Nuclear imaging

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.040
is a truly multi-disciplinary, multi-modal technique.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.330
It brings together groups of biologists,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.809
chemists and mathematicians.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.949
Here, we're able to attack small molecules or cells or antibodies with radioactivity,

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.629
which can be detected as they pass around the body,

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.019
highlighting a cancer or perhaps epilepsy,
as they

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.460
light up cells or molecular processes on
the way.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.500
Light enables us to see the world
around us

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.900
but often in our lab, we want to take
images of things that are invisible to the human eye

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.460
because they are inside the body and
therefore they receive no light.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.620
Jellyfish are transparent because

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.610
they have evolved a way to absorb light
and omit a narrow band

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.530
of blue light, which we call fluorescence.
Light sheet microscopy

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.210
is a scientific technique, which uses this
transparency and fluorescence from jellyfish.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
It allows us to see the biological
processes occurring inside the living tissue.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.500
By making the sample transparent, we can
deliver light in

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.880
and we can receive light out.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.850
Sugar in the form of glucose is found in
various foods

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.869
and it's a primary source of energy for
biological tissue. We are now using glucose

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.950
in a cutting-edge MRI technique to
detect cancer.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.310
This technique selectively images areas of the body

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.840
based on glucose uptake. Tumours tend to
be quite

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.370
energy-hungry and grow much faster than
normal tissue, using up more glucose

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.010
and also have a rich supply of blood
vessels.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.590
By detecting glucose, we can illuminate the tumour in  the scanner,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.340
producing high-contrast images. This
method is safe

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.579
and could potentially be used in
hospitals for cancer imaging

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.400
simply by giving the patient a sugary drink
whilst in the MRI scanner.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.299
Ultrasound is now fueling the next
generation of medical imaging technologies.

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.380
A photo-acoustic imaging system at UCL
combines the principles of ultrasound

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.630
with optical imaging; shining light into
a sample triggers

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.819
thermal expansion within pigments like
hemoglobin

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.069
and ultrasound is omitted. This technique
is great for

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.090
imaging blood flow networks and tumour vasculature with applications in cancer therapy.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.489
With photo-acoustic imaging, we can
monitor

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.769
things like vascular disrupting agents,
which is a new type of cancer therapy,

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.940
in order to sort of visualise the breakdown
of blood flow networks

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.920
within tumours.
