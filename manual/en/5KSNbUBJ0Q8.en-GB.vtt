Gluten-free cooking: pasta. Although it's
a little time consuming to make your own pasta,

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.560
the results are way better than the dried
gluten-free stuff you can buy.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.730
You can make a huge batch at once, as it freezes
well and can be cooked straight from frozen.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.660
This recipe uses a pasta machine to make a
tagliatelle but the rolled pasta can be formed

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.089
into any shape or left flat for lasagne sheets
and ravioli.

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.460
Here are the ingredients you are going to
need. You can also find this in the description

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.160
box below.
Sift the flours, xanthan gum and salt into

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.620
a large bowl. In another bowl, beat together
the eggs and oil. Make a well in the centre

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.680
of the dry ingredients and then pour in the
egg and oil, and mix.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.960
Use a palette knife or a round-bladed table
knife to draw the flour into the liquid. Mix

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.369
until it starts to bind. Then bring it together
with your hands to form a dough.

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.580
Transform the dough to a surface lightly floured
with gluten-free all purposed flour and knead

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.509
gently until it becomes smooth.
Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let it rest

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.619
for 10 minutes.
Unwrap the dough and divide into four equal

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.420
pieces.
Take one of the pieces of the dough and using

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.420
a rolling pin, roll it out into a long strip
about 5 inches or 12 cm wide or 5mm thick.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.649
Set aside and cover with a damp, clean kitchen
towel as you repeat the process with the remaining

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.970
dough.
Dusting well with more gluten-free flour pass

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.450
each strip of the dough through a pasta machine
four times.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.580
Adjust the dial by a stop each time until
the pasta is really thin and don't worry if

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.539
a few holes appear.
Dust and set aside each sheet.

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.220
Attach the cutter and pass the flour dusted
strips through the machine to form the tagliatelle.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.170
The uncooked pasta will stay fresh for four
hours on trays dusted with cornmeal and covered

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.780
with a kitchen towel if you have made it a
little before you are ready to eat.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.519
To cook, bring a large pan of water to a rolling
boil, add the pasta and cook for 3-4 minutes.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.200
The pasta should have some bite.
