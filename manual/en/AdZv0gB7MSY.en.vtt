00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.150
Hey, check it out. HP has got a really
slick little Slimline desktop for you here.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.690
And this one packs quite 
a punch in a really small package.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.880
It comes with tons of really, 
really great accessories.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.190
And is gonna be able to run
all of your software, 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.360
all your games, run Blu-ray 
movies, watch TV,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.160
it does it all 
in one little package.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.840
It's the HP Slimline s3530f.
Now, here are the specs

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.170
on this little pocket, on this little 
basket of goodness, maybe?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.670
Basket? There we go. 1.8 GHz, 
AMD Phenom Quad-Core on board.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.110
4 GB of DDR2 RAM. It's got
Vista Home Premium 64-bit installed.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.950
So it's gonna be able to take
advantage of all 4 GB of RAM,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.750
and allow you to expand beyond.
It's got 750 GB of hard drive space.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.690
It has a Blu-ray drive, as well 
as a Super-Multi DVDRW drive.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.160
It's actually a combo. 
They're both in one.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.690
And that's hidden right back 
in here somewhere.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.200
I can't see.
Hidden in here.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.470
It will open up 
when you tell it to.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.470
The NTSC/ATSC Tuner 
is on board, as well. 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.530
Which means you're going
to be able to watch 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.980
the analog and the digital 
over the air broadcasts,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.750
as well as 
unencrypted cable.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.210
It has NVIDIA GeForce 
9500 GS on board.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.350
That means you're going to be
able to play your games

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.020
on this little computer.
Now, it's not going to be 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.320
a gaming monster,
but it's gonna 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.190
be able to handle most of them,
 without any problem. 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.760
And it's got b/g wireless 
 built-in.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960
So, let's go ahead and 
show you around here.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.860
This here is the very nice media center remote
that comes along with the computer.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.600
It's a very nice, full functioning
 remote control.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.000
And you're gonna need all of those functions
due to the built-in TV tuner and all that stuff.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.440
This is the way Vista Media Center
 is meant to be enjoyed,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.880
with a TV tuner and an 
HDMI port.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.180
And this has all of it.
So, a very nice remote. 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.750
You're going to be able to get to all of your 
stuff with this remote control.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.350
Up front here, you're going to find 
now at the bottom,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.800
we'll start down here. 
There is an HP Pocket Media Drive bay.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.050
So you can use your
HP Pocket Media Drives on this PC.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.100
A couple up front USB ports
as well as headphones, right there.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.840
Behind here is where you're going to
 find that Blue-ray and DVDRW drive.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.630
You've got all of your card readers up here.
This covers all the bases for the cards.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.710
It'll do Compact Flash.
 It'll do Memory Stick.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.180
It'll do SD.
It'll do SmartMedia.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.110
All that stuff, all right here.
Now, on the back.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.820
Here's what we got going on.
Take a look.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.400
We got our two PS2 ports, here.
This is your wireless antenna.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.560
It does do b/g wireless.
You've got digital S/PDIF

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.960
S/PDIF
S/PDIF out, right there.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.900
Right here you've got
 four more USB ports,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.400
FireWire 400, 
Ethernet,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.940
headphone, microphone,
line-out all right here.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.510
You've got HDMI and DVI down here.
Remember this is the NVIDIA GeForce 9500.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.810
And this is your TV tuner 
located right here. 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.950
Now, this TV tuner does have
 an IR Blaster port on board.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.390
So, you are going to be able to control
all of your home theater devices

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.590
through Media Center,
which is very nice.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.500
Now, the computer does come with
an IR receiver here.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.500
As you can see,
 this does come along with it.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.190
So you're going to be able to use this 
for all of your receiving and IR blasting.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.200
And controlling of all 
of your other devices.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.540
That's what's great
about Windows Media Center,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.940
is you can actually control your 
cable box, your VCR, 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.240
all of that stuff with the included
 remote control

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.680
and the IR receiver and 
blaster.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.020
The computer also comes with 
one of these.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.480
Now they didn't build the modem
into it because, well, 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.660
I don't think people are using modems
all that much anymore.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.460
But, it does come with a 
USB modem, so it's there in case 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.780
you need it, which is really, really nice.
 So, we're gonna show you the inside

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.730
of the computer before I wrap
this up. It's a very odd case.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.840
It's a small case and what makes it very strange
is the way this things comes off.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.180
Because you'll notice that the bottom 
is actually part of the cover that comes off.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.470
So, it's very strange.
 I'll tell you the truth.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.600
But, you see it's very tight in here.
Take a look.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.150
Very, very tight.
If you look down here

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.780
you'll see, this is your 9500
GS card, right here,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.090
with this little cooler 
located right there.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.220
And then, this is your TV tuner card
right here.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.620
This is that Pocket Media Drive bay.
And of course, your AMD CPU cooler,

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.570
and everything else hidden behind 
the massive Blu-ray drive.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.570
The Blu-ray drive seems 
to take up 90% of the interior 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.310
of this computer.
So, everything else 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.570
very, very small, 
very, very tightly packed.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.610
So it's not going to be a machine
that you can upgrade easily

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.210
because both of the expansion slots
are already being used,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.880
and they're both
 low-profile slots. 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.740
So, you wanna be sure,
if you're thinking about 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.290
upgrading, in your mind,
 in your eyes, in your heart,

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.290
it might not be a good machine
to look at, to tell you the truth.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.590
But, it is a good machine
if you just need an awesome little

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.100
media center computer.
Be it for a dorm, bedroom,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.700
living room, anywhere.
This thing's ready to go man. 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.260
Ready to go and it's a great, great
setup. You're going to be able to watch

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.510
all of your TV, record TV, 
all your music in Media Center.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.590
It's all there. All inside here.
The HP Slimline S3530f.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.820
To get more info on the 
HP Slimline S3530f

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.690
