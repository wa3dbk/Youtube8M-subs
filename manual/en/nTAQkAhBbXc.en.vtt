00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:21.057
before he was killed by the Powder Gangers

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:24.951
He’s currently being held prisonner inside the Bison Steve Hotel

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.749
Lieutenant Hayes is the one in charge of the NCR encampment

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.613
he’s primary objective is to avoid escaped Powder Gangers

00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:35.903
from the correctional facility to venture more south of the Mojave

00:01:35.903 --> 00:01:38.566

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.034
two NCR soldiers

00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:43.746
And ED-E, a robot which needs repair

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:47.226
before you can eventually take him with you as a companion

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.294
You can find 2 sunset sarsparilla star bottle cap

00:01:55.408 --> 00:01:58.052

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.118
one inside this house

00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:13.823

you will find Lucky

You will alsor find a book that adds 3 Barter points permanently

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:30.461
After arriving at Primm

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:34.329
cross the bridge to acess the city but beware of the land mines

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.509
Enter the Vikki and Vance Casino and learn about the trouble in town

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:43.024
Go inside the Bison Steve Hotel and obtain the journal from Deputy Beagle

00:02:43.024 --> 00:02:44.154
by freeing him

00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:45.001
killling him

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.615
or stealing it from him

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:49.662
The next stop for the main quest is then revealed

00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:51.488
it is the town of Nipton

00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:57.577
After getting ride of the Powder Gangers in town 

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:00.226
you’re gonna need to find a new sherif for it

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:02.928
 To do the quest will unlock the town’s store

00:03:02.928 --> 00:03:06.376
You will have 3 choices regarding who should be the new sherif

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:07.447
Sergent McGee

00:03:07.447 --> 00:03:08.273
Meyers

00:03:08.273 --> 00:03:09.636
or Primm Slim

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.708
If you choose Sergent McGee and NCR

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:16.886
go talk to lieutenant Hayes than will send you to the Mojave Outpost

00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:19.978
There ask Major Knight for reinforcement and obtain it

00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:22.327
by either passing a barter check of 20

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.263
or completing a quest for him

00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:28.037
After that, go back to Hayes

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:30.632
The town will now be protected by NCR

00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:33.567
but prices are going to be higher due to taxes

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:36.409
If you choose Meyers, the ex-sherrif of the town 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.432
You will find him at the NCR correctional facility

00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:41.803
To gain entrance there you can bribe Dawes

00:03:41.803 --> 00:03:45.326
If you are hostile with the Powder Gangers wear a disguise

00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:47.792
but beware because Dawes can still spot you 

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:50.633
so you will need to kill him discretly before entering

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:57.720
Then go talk to Meyers that will send you

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.866
to Major Knight at the Mojave Outpost to gain his pardon

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:04.203
To do so, you can either pass a Speech check of 30

00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:06.454
or bribe him for 200 caps

00:04:07.654 --> 00:04:09.325
After that go back to Meyers

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:11.891
who should now be at the town’s entrance

00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:13.124
to complete the quest

00:04:13.124 --> 00:04:16.581
Now the Primm’s store is reopen and goods are less pricy

00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:19.138
since there is no NCR taxes

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:22.170
If you choose the robot Primm Slim

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.773
You will find it in the Vikki and Vance Casino

00:04:24.773 --> 00:04:27.681
Talk to it and reprogram it with a Science check of 30

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:30.524
or use three fission batteries and four conductors

00:04:30.524 --> 00:04:33.423
that can be easily found at the REPCONN test site

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:34.679
west of Novac

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:37.737
The store will then reopen with normal prices

00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:43.355
Once you’ve brought back order in town

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:45.588
the next time you visit the Vikki and Vance Casino

00:04:45.588 --> 00:04:50.650
you will be greeted by a gang of NCR deserters that are looking to steal from people

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.318
You can decide to kill them

00:04:52.318 --> 00:04:53.373
pay them off

00:04:53.373 --> 00:04:57.082
or convince them with a Speech check of 30 to go away

00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:05.730
inside Nash’s store there is a robot that you can repair

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.814
by passing  a Repair check of 65

00:05:07.814 --> 00:05:12.949
or by first passing a Science check of 55 then a Repair check of 35

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.885
You can also use 1 scrap electronic, 3 scrap metals and 2 sensor modules

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:19.298
to repair it

00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:20.318
You can now recruit ED-E

00:05:20.318 --> 00:05:24.093
to profit from its laser canon and carry capability

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:30.574
It is an unmarked quest which reward

00:05:30.574 --> 00:05:33.052
is the best 9mm submachine gun of the game

00:05:33.052 --> 00:05:33.804
To initiate it

00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:36.461
inspect the car in the middle of the Vikki and Vance casino

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:40.134
Go talk to Primm Slim and pass a Science check of 50

00:05:40.134 --> 00:05:42.202
 Listen to the broken data that will lead you

00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:44.625
to this house located near Westside

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:47.092
Inside you will meet Sammy and Pauline Wins 

00:05:47.092 --> 00:05:49.616
that previously robbed the Vikki and Vance casino 

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:52.827
and are now planning to rob all the casinos on the Strip as well

00:05:52.827 --> 00:05:54.395
To obtain the submachine gun

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:57.451
you need to open the very hard locked safe inside the house

00:05:57.451 --> 00:05:58.221
To do so

00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.381
you can try to lockpick it

00:05:59.381 --> 00:06:00.955
or you can convince Sammy and Pauline

00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:03.430
by passing  a Speech check of 55

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.839
that their plan won’t work

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.349
they will then give you the code to open the safe

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.168
If you killed everyone in town

00:06:14.168 --> 00:06:15.920
Primm become a ghost town

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.104
with some scavengers passing by some time to time

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.074
If you appointed a new sherif to the town

00:06:22.074 --> 00:06:24.484
the ending will vary upon which one you chose

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:27.738
and which faction won the Second Battle of Hoover Dam 

00:06:27.738 --> 00:06:30.700
If Sergent McGee was chosen and NCR won

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.537
the town benefits from NCR influence and see it’s commerce thrives

00:06:34.537 --> 00:06:38.376
although heavy taxes still burdens its residents

00:06:38.376 --> 00:06:41.370
If Sergent McGee was chosen and NCR didn’t won

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.101
NCR abandons Primm

00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.823
and lets the town deals with the new power in place in the Mojave

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.084
If you chose Meyers and Caesar’s Legion lost

00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:52.656
Meyers keeps Primm in order with his own idea of justice

00:06:52.656 --> 00:06:55.875
sometimes people presumed guilty with little evidence against them

00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:56.976
were found dead

00:06:57.523 --> 00:07:00.147
If you chose Primm Slim and Caesar’s Legion lost

00:07:00.147 --> 00:07:03.905
Slim keeps Primm prosper and protected of criminals

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:08.463
even if some time to time its slow speed allow some to escape justice

00:07:08.463 --> 00:07:12.165
If you chose either Meyers or Primm Slim and Caesar’s Legion won

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.650
the sherif took a desperate stand against Caesar’s Legion soldiers

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.796
but ultimately failed and the city was taken over

00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:23.752
Now that we’ve saw what to do in Primm

00:07:23.752 --> 00:07:28.079
you can clic one of the links to learn what you can do in the NCR correctional Facility

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:30.049
or in the Mojave Outpost

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:32.870
If you want to continue directly with the main quest

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.442

00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:40.521
Thank you for watching and see you later
