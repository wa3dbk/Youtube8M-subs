00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.067
How to generate extra power in your smash

00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:06.551
now

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:11.484
let's say your power 10, all is in your body

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:14.051
so you set and smash

00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:21.518
there is way to do or create extra 1 or 2 more power than you have got

00:00:21.518 --> 00:00:24.633
now, the way to do this

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.734
when you set shuttle is flying, when you set

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:35.984
you have to completely stop, freeze and then 

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:44.369
restart your action that way you can generate extra 10% or 20%

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:47.202
power in your smash, this is what I mean

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:49.634
ok, now watch

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:58.602
when shuttle is flying to me I will set but I will completely stop

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:06.286
and then shuttle is coming at the right spot I will sharply restart

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:09.851
that's the way to generate more power

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:12.351
have a look, little higher, yes

00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:28.851
so I will stop wait shuttle comes and then start

00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:32.735
stop start

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:37.921
because I start suddenly you generate more power

00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:44.681
I will be showing you opposite way, shuttle comes, you stand move and hit

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:45.631
compare

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:47.131
this is not the right way

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.633
right way

00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:16.940
so you stop, suddenly make your action that way you will make more power

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.045
one more wrong way

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:26.039
continously moving or you set and start not suddenly, start slowly

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.630
like this

00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:37.936
not like this

00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:41.671
you must stop and then restart

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:43.622
must

00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.685
stop

00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:57.029
as you see it you can see more power is generated

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.336
same like boxing

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.132
bang

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:05.333
rather than like this

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.083
no like this

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:08.568
like that

00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:10.134
so stop and then start
