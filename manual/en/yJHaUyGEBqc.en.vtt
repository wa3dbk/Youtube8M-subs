00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.000
[narrator] What looks like a
typical college dorm is actually

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.233
a living laboratory for students at United Methodist-affiliated

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:12.166
Duke University.
Kelvin Gu gives tours.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.834
He says visitors to the 6,000
square foot Duke smart home

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:18.333
come to see the basement.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.967
[Kelvin Gu] and the rainwater filters through the soil

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:22.300
on the green roofs.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.200
And pretty much all year round
we can take care of all our

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.867
toilet and washer needs
with just rainwater.

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:34.900
[narrator] The house has green
features you would expect,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.000
like solar electric and water
heating and energy
efficient construction.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.667
It's also on the cutting
edge of new technology.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:46.367
[Kelvin Gu] The typical
light will need a high
voltage wire to run to it.

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:50.166
Because LEDs are so efficient,
the amount of electricity coming

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:54.100
through a cable that powers
your internet is enough to
light your house.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.100
We have that capacity here
so that when that technology is

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.900
mature we can take
advantage of it.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.300
Also we have great
internet speed.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.066
[narrator] The exposed ductwork
and encased wiring systems are

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.967
designed to encourage
engineering - minded
students to tinker.

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:14.433
Experiments range
from serious to silly.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:17.734
[Kelvin Gu] We can get temps
up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:21.166
My roommate over the summer, he wanted to cook Ramen noodles

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.533
and he just opened the
tap in our bathroom.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:28.133
I mean it wasn't totally
boiled but we basically cooked

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.934
Ramen noodles with the water.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:32.700
[narrator] The house has ten
full-time residents but about 50

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.800
students and faculty have taken
an interest in projects here.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.633
Esther Granville stops by
to do some weeding in her
smart house garden plot.

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:44.400
[Esther Granville] I am a
clinical research dietician at

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.467
Duke University and I just come
and work in the garden to try to

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.400
grow some of my own vegetables.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.800
[narrator] The technology
you see here may gradually

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.734
be coming to your home.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:57.767
[Kelvin Gu] People will
be installing solar panels

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.700
on their houses as a
matter of habit.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.300
I think the same way television
sets got introduced into

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.033
people's homes, there will
be new utilities that will be

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:09.200
introduced into people's homes.
