00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.529
 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.639
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.520
Start by getting a fork in the ground

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.840
 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.540
So that's one plant. These might be as much as 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.880
ten-years-old actually.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.480
So in Japan, they do not grow wasabi from seed.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.240
It's all tissue cultured and what they've
done is selected

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.870
for taprootedness. It's the same with the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.760
say burdock. If you grow wild burdock, the roots just 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.360
are kinda fibrous and go all over the
place. So they've selected

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.270
for taprooted varieties in Japan.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.060
And in Japan the clones are like specific

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.460
to local areas so

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.670
in one valley they'll be growing one
clone and in the next valley over they'll be

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.780
going a different one,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.869
but you can see these don't have a very big rhizome. They're

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.720
mainly just fiber rooted. This is the
part that they

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.820
typically want to eat but in Japan that part right there

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.229
is like six inches long and an inch and a half in diameter

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.040
from the photographs I've seen. The alternative is

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.350
forget about the rhizome and grow it as
a leaf crop.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.390
I think there's a very big market for
the leaves.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.670
Nobody's ever heard of them in America before so it's

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.500
something new for the chefs to play around with.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.049
There's a million things you could do with it. You could put a big leaf right onto a hamburger or

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.519
something for starters. I think they might

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.040
incorporate it into salad dressings. You know you could

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.480
chop it up. You could blend it. You could even

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.100
perhaps roll up sushi in the bigger leaves...
use it instead of the seaweed.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.610
I think an inventive chef could find many, many different things to do with these.
