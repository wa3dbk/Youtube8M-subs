00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi there I'm Lauren Cox and this is
another episode of Conscious Culinary.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.940
This is a special episode out in the
beautiful national forest.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.540
We've got an open campfire, and we're going
to show you some amazing recipes,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.400
with how to cook on the open flames and ash

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.840
So, stay tuned.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.380
OK. So, first things first, with your campfire.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.540
You want to be as safe as possible

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.260
and we're doing this during a season
where there is an afternoon rain

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.969
the dirt's a little bit wet, 
so we're kind of in the clear-

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.929
but we want to be as safe as possible.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.220
So, you want to build your rocks
at least eight inches tall around your fire.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.830
You want to make sure, number two, 
that all your pine needles are cleared out of the way.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.760
And number three, I've got a nice
pile of dirt behind me with a shovel.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880
So, if I need to smother it, I can.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.840
And also-
last thing make sure you have plenty of water on hand.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.020
When we're done cooking,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.580
I'll show you how to break it down,
and safely put out your fire.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.760
When we're getting breakfast started,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.960
the first and most important thing is coffee.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.120
No one in camp can survive without coffee.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.040
So, this is my husband's cowboy coffee.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.880
I basically have an REI canteen,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880
and then inside of it is a filter.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.270
What I did

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.170
is filled up my bottle of water,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.890
poured it into a pan,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.410
brought it up to a boil,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.300
or even a high summer is just fine as long
as it's really steaming and going.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.820
And put in- my coffee grounds,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.260
and then inside of that
I've got this really cool filter.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.920
You can buy it at REI or camping stores.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.540
Looks just like this.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.640
You screw it on nice and tight.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.440
And then when you pour your hot water 
into your coffee grounds,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.280
you put it on its side so the coffee
can steep.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.040
And when it's ready-

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.550
give it at least 10 minutes-

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.300
I've got my little cup here;

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.580
I poured in some milk and sugar
because I like my coffee with milk and sugar.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.560
And I just really carefully pour the
coffee in.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360
And what happens is those coffee grounds get trapped,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.200
and don't go through the filter.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.080
And it's really just as simple as that.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.370
I'm going to set it down for now,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580
and you just kind of pass the coffee around

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.700
All right. Then to eat-

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.360
one of my favorite things to do
is ash cooked eggs.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.320
At night the night before,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.100
if you take your eggs and bury them in
the camp fire ash after you put the fire out,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.760
they'll cook over hours and hours.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.540
and they'll turn into this like smoky

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.780
beautiful kind of flavor,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.460
and the white of the egg
will get a little bit of- um

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.700
tan or yellowish color it's really cool.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.780
If you're in more of a rush when you
start your fire in the morning

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.540
you can put the egg closer to the poles,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.000
and bury it with a little bit of dirt.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.540
and if you rotate it like every 10 minutes,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.280
you'll get this really kind of cool smoky cooked egg.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.470
So, here it is you can see some of the
charring marks on it-

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.780
but you treat it just like a hard-boiled egg.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.540
and it's cool because the shell comes off pretty easily.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.040
They're just like a little portable snack.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.050
I mean you can make a bunch of them

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.520
and snack on them throughout the day or just for
breakfast

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.150
Peel it. Pop it open.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.470
And you've got really tasty egg.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.100
And you can of course season it with salt and pepper,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.460
or whatever seasoning or herbs that you have.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.360
And then, we'll talk about the other part
of breakfast, which is really cool,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.840
is basically just bread and milk.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.760
What I did was took some leftover french
bread and put it on a pan in the fire,

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.199
and got it nice and toasty.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.540
and you'll see I just kind of tore it up,
nice and rustic like.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.940
Over here on my flat rock,
that's exposed to the flame

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.330
I poured about a cup of milk, and in there is

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.980
a stick of cinnamon, and about a teaspoon of sugar.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.180
So, those flavors are all kind of
melding together and getting nice and

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.300
sweet and cinnamon-y.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.720
I'll pour that right over my toasted bread,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.980
and it's absolutely delicious.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.400
Then I have my egg on the side for some protein.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.920
Then, one of the tools that you really need are gloves.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.460
Don't want to be grabbing this hot stuff, with bare hands

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.300
-done it before.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.960
So, I'm just going to pour my milk right out

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.720
And you'll see my cinnamon stick is left in
there- So, i'll just put it to the side

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.840
Uh-oh. I got my spoon wet.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.740
-Get rid of my glove.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.140
And then you just kind of let your bread

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.620
soak up that really beautiful milk.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.360
And just go to town and it's like-

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.540
A hearty, comforting, awesome breakfast

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.300
So, when we finish this up,
we'll show you how to cook lunch later today.
