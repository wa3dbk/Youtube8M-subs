00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.130
So the first of the issues that we want to
look at is whether or not the neck is warping

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:14.540
or bowing in any way. And so we'll use our
steel rule, and lay it on the frets themselves

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:23.470
in between the strings, in this case, and
while it's laying on the edge, we will look

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.730
through this, and I usually will do this against
a light source like a window, and see if there's

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:41.840
any gaps. If the neck is warped, we will start
to see gaps under the straight edge in the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:52.809
area of the greatest warp. And on this instrument,
there are no warps, this is a good, level

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:00.130
neck, so it does not need to have a truss
rod adjustment. But let's assume that it does

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:08.100
need a truss rod adjustment. The way that
we would address that is to use the truss

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:20.600
rod adjustment tool, find the truss rod Allen
socket, and very carefully, insert this in

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:29.260
there. And if the neck is warped, bowed a
little bit, we will make a slight adjustment,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.670
no more than one quarter of a turn at a time,
and then let it set for ten minutes, and see

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.490
if that adjusts the neck to a level, and then
come back and test it again. The only danger

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.840
with a truss rod adjustment is don't go too
far, and don't force it, no more than a quarter

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:05.040
turn at a time. Usually the truss rod adjustment
will be toward the counter-clockwise, or clockwise

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:16.520
in this particular case, because it's backwards,
in order to create a leveling. Your instruction

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.760
manual should tell you which way to go, different
truss rods go different ways.
