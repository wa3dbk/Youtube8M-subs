Hi I'm Alex and I'm here from Bubblebum to tell you about our fantastic product BubbleBum

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.100
The car booster seat in a bag

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.900
BubbleBum is the worlds first inflatable car booster seat

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.060
its suitable for children weighing between 15kilos and 36kilos

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.020
Which is roughly a four year old to an eleven year old

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
BubbleBum comes in this fantastic stretchy bag

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:39.160
with an additional shoulder belt positioning clip which I will show you in a second

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.800
The product comes out of this bag,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.040
we have instructions inside the bag as well to make it nice and easy for you

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.000
Then you just release the two clips as so

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.840
Fold it out

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.060
Then there's a nice easy valve here which we need to blow into

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.040
Now why is BubbleBum so great?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Well BubbleBum is lightweight, its portable, its easy to transport, its ideal for travelling on holiday

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.340
great when you're renting a car, because the average cost of renting a car booster seat

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.220
is anywhere between seven and nine euros per day

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.140
so that makes your holiday per day really expensive

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.420
Its also fantastic for grandparents as well

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.200
no longer do grandparents have to have a car seat cluttering up their vehicles

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.800
when they can keep this in it's stretchy bag, in the glove box, or the seat pocket

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.440
Then they are always able to just blow it up whenever they have to pick your son or daughter up

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.120
Its also perfect when travelling by taxi, imagine arriving to a resort on holiday

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.520
You arrive at the airport, you've got all your bags and then you haven't got your car seat

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.020
So you jump into your taxi and just blow up your BubbleBum so your children are always safe when travelling

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.500
This is how you fit the shoulder beat positioning clip

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.520
You take your clip that we've taken out of your bag

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.540
then find this back strap here

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.120
You hook it around, very much like a luggage label really

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.100
You put it through this loop, up it goes and just pull it to tighten

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.380
So that's how the shoulder belt positioning clip should fit on the bottom of the BubbleBum seat

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.900
Here is how we demonstrate how to put it into the car itself

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.420
We have the shoulder belt positioning clip which we've already attached to the seat

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.880
Then we put this across the top here, the shoulder belt clip isn't actually a safety element

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.180
It's more a comfort element to stop the seat belt cutting into the child's neck

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.100
You move it across the seat and clip it in through this very important red clip here

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.880
Through the other red clip on the other side and clip it in like so

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.000
That holds your child in perfectly, with the belt across their lap rather than across their stomach

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.800
and you find that children really love it because its so comfortable as well

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.240
Please feel free to look at the other reviews that we've had of BubbleBum on the Kiddicare.com website

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.900
or come in store and really see it for yourself. Thank You
