00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.960
So this is a part of an ongoing relation relationship you have, isn’t it? This is the third visit

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.470
that the Hawaiians have made to us and each time has been a little bit more and more.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.580
When they first came it was a little bit embryonic, we weren’t quite sure of each other so we

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.780
were testing the waters a little bit. The
next visit they made unfortunately it didn’t

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.579
coincide very well with us time wise, we were about to present our end of year performances.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.100
So they performed and we performed as separate entities. But this time we decided to have

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.770
a sharing. So we had this morning and now we're having exchange in terms of classes

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.590
and the Hawaiians are leading our students
in a hula class and then our students are

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.270
leading the Hawaiians in a contemporary dance class. Then we're having a shared lunch, then

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.070
we're having an exchange of performance items from each of the schools. 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.680
You’re both American student here based at the New Zealand school of dance, what do you think of living and

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.680
studying in New Zealand? What I find beautiful about these places is how excepting and culturally

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.920
diverse it is. The people here are so welcoming and family oriented that is just so easy to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.830
transition in to this place. The dance school itself is one of the best in the southern

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.560
hemisphere, personally I think, which is why I’m here. Tell us about what you’ve got

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.549
planned for today. I think first we have the
Hula workshop with the first years, so the

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.530
classical and the contemporary students, everybody together with the students from Hawaii. Then

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.150
after that we are doing a contemporary class with our tutor, Paula over there. It should

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.150
be good, it’s going to be interesting to
see different the styles are and what we can

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.060
apply technique wise to different styles.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.580
New Zealand last night with an epic, what we would call a home run, qualified for the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.780
finals of the world cup. Yeah, we were watching it. You were watching it? 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.560
One, two, three, Go Black Caps.
