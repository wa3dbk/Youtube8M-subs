00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Today I'm gonna show you the Chicken Caravan.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.150
It holds 450 birds, it's 8 meters long, 2,5 meters wide.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.150
And I'll go through the features with you now.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.830
These are the drinkers for the chickens,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.430
they have a lid that opens and closes.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.170
There's two separate water tanks inside

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.610
which hold approximately 200 litters.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.340
The Chicken Caravan collects the water off the roof,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.880
runs down these pipes, and into the tanks.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.580
These tanks hold about 200 litters together,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.290
and they're separated,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.360
 which provides security for your birds.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.990
If one of your drinkers leaks out,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.760
you still have water in the other tank.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.930
And these are designed to be

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.600
holding tanks for a bit of security for your birds.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.230
So the idea is in how whether they

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.300
In hot weather, they'll only last probably a maximum of three days

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.470
To fill the water tanks up by a hose

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.640
you have two fill points in the back.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.410
Just connect the hose up to water them:

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.950
it will fill both tanks.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250
If you want to clean the water tanks,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.320
we have two caps here which

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.990
you can just unscrew and clean them.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.990
The water system has clear pipes

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.260
to show the water level of each tank.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.100
You can see the water level through the pipe,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.500
just below the clear pipes we've got two taps,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.690
these taps go to the drinkers at the front of via the hoses.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.510
You can turn these off and on as you need to.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.310
The Chicken Caravan has a jack stand

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.050
which allows us to adjust the,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.850
part of the A - Frame to level it up.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.260
And we use this bubble down here

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.620
to get the right level.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.730
This section in the front here,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.930
we call it the Main Section.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.900
And no birds can get into here

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.070
when you are in there.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.470
Its got mesh on the wall in here,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.710
and we got an area in here

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.440
where we can collect the eggs.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.740
To get in the Main Section,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.050
we got a nice easy step that just pulls out,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.050
and allows for easy access.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.050
One of the beauties about the Chicken Caravan

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.750
is that you can level up the nesting boxes,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.560
because we have rollaway nesting boxes

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.360
that need to be leveled,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.330
so we can park it on uneven ground,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.660
and just level it out like so.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.700
Once we got it leveled,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.470
we've lock it off,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.700
and that's done.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.020
We have a handy egg shelf here

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.340
which is right next to the conveyor belt.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.970
This is designed so it can be

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.610
taken off and mounted either side.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.450
We just use the same handle which we use

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.850
to wind the eggs in and also for the jack stand.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.500
just pops off, you can put it on the other side,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.200
tie it up and then you can wind your eggs on this side.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.410
With the Chicken Caravan we have a conveyor to collect the eggs.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.110
To collect the eggs, just wind it in.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.390
On the main section there's two doors either side,

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.620
which allows you access into where the chickens are,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.460
this doors keep close just by magnet.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.900
The beauty about this is,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.860
you know, in bad weather or such,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.930
you can get access and have a look,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.340
see what your birds are doing.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.410
The Chicken Caravan has a shelf built into the main section,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.610
so you can store eggs, put your trays in there

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.350
it's a good height, it's out of the road

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.910
you can walk around it.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.880
You can hook it up to a 4 - Wheel Drive quite easily,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.950
just hooks up to a standard tow ball.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.760
The drinkers automatically come up

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.490
 when you wind the jack stand up.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.400
Here we have a tractor with a 3 point linkage.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.130
This allows us to quickly hook up the Chicken Caravan

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.700
and move it forward onto fresh pasture or to another paddock.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.070
And also allows for a quick disconnect.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.070
We've got a hand break fitting,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.710
which allows us to break the wheels when we pull out

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.180
so that the Chicken Caravan isn't going to roll away on us.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.450
The Chicken Caravan has

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.690
three large doors on each side.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.090
These are to provide shade and shelter.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.730
They're on lockable gas struts,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.230
so you can move them in, and lock off.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.970
And you can move the right in if it's cold or windy,

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.270
the birds still have access where they can get in and out.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.980
You can also lock the birds right in if you want.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.550
To open these large doors up,

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.690
you just need to undo the rubber catch, pull it out a little bit

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.860
then there's a catch under here.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.770
When you got the desired position, release the catch:

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.730
the door stays where you want it.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.840
The door is fully open at the moment.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.040
To release the door, pull the handle, push the door,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.280
release it when you want the desired height

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.280
and then the door will stay there.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.980
This is one of the gas, lockable gas struts that we use

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.020
we got one on each side of the doors.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.960
This allows us to lock these doors into any position that we like.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.990
In the Chicken Caravan, we have rollaway nesting boxes.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.360
The chickens just hop up onto this step

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.470
then they have access into the nesting boxes

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.400
behind these flaps. These flaps just make the nesting boxes a bit darker

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.540
and a bit more comfortable for the chickens.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.310
On the bottom of the nesting boxes we have Astro Turf:

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.250
This is where the chickens lay on,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.410
you can take them out and give them a clean.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.250
This Astro Turf is on a slope,

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.790
it slopes down to a center conveyor belt

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.590
and the eggs just roll down on

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.790
that Astro Turf and you wind the eggs in.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.700
The nesting boxes have what we call the "Nesting Box Gate"

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.070
this removes the birds at night

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.410
the nesting box gate is design so they gently remove the birds

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.310
at night, before they come in the roost.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.150
And it opens in the morning.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.850
You want to move your birds out at the night

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.690
to stop them popping in on your Astro Turf

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.590
or else, you'll find that you will get dirty eggs.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.630
And the way this works: we have an electric actuator at the back

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.630
and we have a control box which has a timer,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.070
you set the timer to, when you want it to open and close

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.100
and has a solar panel which keeps the battery charged.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.770
The other big advantage with the Nesting Box Gate is

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.980
you got brooding birds,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.850
you don't have to come down and pull them out at night,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.920
the nesting box gate will move them out for you.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.320
We got timer perches, it's good to have them movable,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.160
so we can take them out for cleaning or for access.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
Makes it a bit easy to move around the Chicken Caravan.
