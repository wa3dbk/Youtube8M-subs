00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.786
First scene with old small cam. 

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:34.307
I said good bye on a grey afternoon, The sky cried,

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:39.521
to my city i said good bye
to my land that is blind. 

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.970
I made the decision to abandon
my home land.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:50.826
And to make better my future
Even thought it hurts deep inside my heart

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.572
the rain drowned my eyes with tears

00:00:55.844 --> 00:01:02.463
as my land disappeared
and alone i was left. 

00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:08.279
and alone i was left.

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:11.622
and alone i was left.

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:17.104
That place i once dreamed of, that i desired
all 
 of sudden, in a moment i awoke

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.623
I didn't love it, but it inspired me
I was surprised 
 to see all the cars, yet i was walking

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:28.909
My English was rough, I couldn't
even say two nor three.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.268
I flew here in an airplane
I crossed the caribean sea. 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.720
As i crossed that crystal it separated 
me from my family

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:46.930
I flew here in an airplane
I crossed the caribean sea.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.820
As i crossed that crystal it separated 
me from my family

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:02.510
I know God will permit that i see my family again

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.100
And there the sky shines more
and it cleans my land

00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:13.220
and that once grey afternoon
becomes a sunny day

00:02:14.252 --> 00:02:20.740
give this desperate one a happy ending

00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:32.010
...Thank you...
...Bravo!!!!... Another!!!...

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:42.240
give this desperate one a happy ending

00:02:43.244 --> 00:02:53.610
give this desperate one a happy ending
