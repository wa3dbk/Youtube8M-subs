The latest viral video going around the net is of a protestor at a Mitt Romney 
 event who is pretty excited about getting her free cell phone from President Obama.

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:18.324
She is absolutely singing the praises of Barack Obama because she apparently 
 thinks he was responsible for getting her a free cell phone.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:51.033
What this sad example of an Obama supporter doesn't realize is that the program that 
 got her this free phone was established in 1984 and is called Lifeline.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:01:08.095
It was originally created to offer free or reduced rate landline service for low income individuals and kept 
 a pretty steady cost for several years all up until 2008 when cell phone service was added.

00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:42.640
Unfortunately, the added cell phone benefit has been plagued with fraud and abuse that has even seen 
 these free phones sold on Craigslist to people who were not even eligible for the service.

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:53.170
As much as people would like to blame President Obama for 
 this one though, these free phones are not Obama phones.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:02:01.910
He had nothing to do with this program that started up in 1984 and 
 had nothing to do with cell phone service being added in 2008.

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:20.420
However, the fact that some woman at a protest against Romney thinks she got a free phone from Obama is a problem. She 
 tells us in the video that Romney sucks and sucks bad, but Obama is good because she got a free phone.

00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:34.260
We are in a sad state of affairs here in America when someone thinks they should vote for the 
 President of the United States based on the thinking that he provided them with a free cell phone.

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:52.960
This is also why we are facing economic collapse in this country. We are now at the point where people 
 are getting free cell phones just because they are poor. A cell phone used to be considered a luxury.

00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:20.360
Where does this entitlement nonsense come from? Cell phones for the poor for free, free 
 contraceptives, free housing, free, free, free. Really, what's next? Where does this foolishness stop?
