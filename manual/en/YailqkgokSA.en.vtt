00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.140
[Intro music]

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.320

Assalaamu Alaikum and welcome to Titli's Busy
Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.290
How to describe Beef Rendang...?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.200
How to describe Beef Rendang...?

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.730
It's originally from Indonesia.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.980
Quite spicy!

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.490
Lots of ingredients!

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.720
It's packed full of flavour!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.759
It will make your head spin!

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.329
It will make your head spin!

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.579
Maybe it's just easier if I show you.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.640
For this curry I've got a complete z...

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.309
What's that?!

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.140
Eek!

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.980
Eek!

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.970
For this curry I've got a complete zoo of
ingredients here.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.719
Let's start with the top.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.160
I've got a 750 g of beef.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.489
Reasonable, quality beef.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.050
This happens to be topside.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.839
About half an inch thick and one and a half
inch square.

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.940
4 large shallots that I've sliced.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.539
10 dried red chilies that have been deseeded.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.109
50 g of desiccated coconut.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.109
2 teaspoons of lemongrass paste.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.090
6 cloves of garlic, peeled and sliced.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.780
Half an inch piece of ginger, peeled and sliced

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.460
and a 400 ml tin of coconut milk.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.829
Along the bottom row, I've got

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.750
3 tablespoons of tamarind paste.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.340
4 teaspoons of dark brown sugar.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.320
2 teaspoons of salt.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.969
4 dried kaffir lime leaves that I've scrunched
up.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.880
A cinnamon stick, broke in half.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.259
4 green cardamoms.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.240
4 cloves and 2 whole star anise.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.469
And here there's 2 teaspoons each of cumin
powder and coriander powder.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.180
2 teaspoons of fennel seeds.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.740
A teaspoon of turmeric powder

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.530
and half a teaspoon of freshly ground black
pepper.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.829
The first thing we're gonna do is mash up
the shallots, the garlic,

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.130
the dried red chilies and the ginger.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.700
Put them into a food processor

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.159
or a herb chopper.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.130
Also add in 4 tablespoons of water.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.020
Also add in 4 tablespoons of water.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.259
What you should end up with

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.009
is this lovely, coarse paste.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.580
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil over a medium-low
heat.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.160
Add in the whole spices

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.140
and just stir-fry them for about a minute.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.390
After a minute, add in all the dried spices

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.150
and stir for one more minute.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.930
Ooh...

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.860
It smell yummy!

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.510
It smell yummy!

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.520
Add in half a cup of vegetable oil

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.940
and the paste we made at the beginning

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.200
and we're gonna continue to cook,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.960
over a medium-low heat,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.650
for around 10 minutes.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.370
After about 10 minutes, it should have gone
a sort of brownish colour, really.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.420
So we'll add in the meat,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.150
turn off the heat a little

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.200
and then cook it for about 2 minutes,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.480
making sure that we cover the beef

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480
in the sauce.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.420
in the sauce.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.260
After 2 minutes,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.110
add in the coconut milk,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.680
add in the coconut milk,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.870
ADD IN THE COCONUT MILK!

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.420
ADD IN THE COCONUT MILK!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.140
(Splosh!)

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.650
the lemongrass,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.880
the kaffir lime leaves

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.850
and the tamarind paste.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.800
Mix it all together

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.980
and bring it gently to the boil.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.230
Once it comes to the boil,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.770
add in the sugar and the salt.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.650
Mix well.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.090
Turn the heat down

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.650
and we're gonna leave this to simmer now

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.930
for about an hour and a half,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.240
stirring occasionally.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.880
While the beef is stewing away,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.630
I'm gonna lightly toast this coconut over
a low heat in a dry pan.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.660
After a few minutes, the coconut should go
this lovely golden brown colour.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.620
Now take it off the heat.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.540
As time goes on, the sauce will get thicker
and darker,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.430
the oil will start to seperate

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.270
and you'll need to stir the gravy more often

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.100
to stop it burning on the bottom of the pan.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.620
Eventually, the sauce will get quite thick.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.140
I'm gonna add in the coconut.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.800
Toasted coconut.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.100
And mix it in.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.130
We'll carry on cooking over a low heat,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.650
probably for about another 30 minutes until
the meat it tender.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.900
Once the meat is tender and the sauce is really
thick,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.370
it's time to serve.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.900
But first, I usually pull out the whole spices

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.759
like the cinnamon

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.370
and the cardamoms if I can find them.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.900
Well, I think that's the lot.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.669
Now to serve.

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.280
Sprinkle with coriander.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.879
Serve with jasmine rice and lime wedges.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.289
A good rendang will be dark and dry

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.120
and won't have a lot of gravy with it

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.169
but it will be absolutely packed full of flavour!

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.819
Join me next time in Titli's Busy Kitchen
with me Titli Nihaan.

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:09.819
Until next time... Khuda hafiz
