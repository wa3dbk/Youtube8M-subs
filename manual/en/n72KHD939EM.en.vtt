My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village and today I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.180
to make a holiday turkey. Alright so our first
step we're going to do is we're going to free

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.830
our turkey from its, the shackles of its oppressor,
which would be the plastic bag that it's in,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:22.512
that double netting thing. So let's get this
out of here, ignore that name brand that you

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:27.810
just saw. And, what we're going to do is,
usually they pack these as they thaw. They

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.730
pack them so tightly that there's going to
be some fair amount of moisture in the bag.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.940
That should be a combination of turkey juices,
as well as, they usually freeze some moisture

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.670
actually onto the bird itself, or into the
bird. So we're just going to go ahead and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.720
pull them all apart, pull them out of the
bag. And that's why you always want to do

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.870
this in the sink because this is going to
make a mess. You can see all the juice that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.260
just came out of it. We're going to rinse
that juice off the turkey because we don't

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.210
want nothing to do with that juice, because
that's all sorts of weird stuff in there.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.940
So if you've got yourself one of these nice
sprayer things for your sink, oops, mine doesn't

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.930
want to cooperate, you can just give your
turkey a nice little turkey shower. Get those

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.710
juices off. You could also just use the actual
faucet head, so, as such. You want to make

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.430
sure you get all over the turkey, get all
the excess fluids off the turkey. This turkey

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.740
actually has one of those little turkey timer's
in it which is kind of a neat touch, makes

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.220
it kind of idiot proff. And at this point
you'll see that this turkey's feet are bound

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.180
together. A lot of the times when you buy
turkeys now, their feet are going to be bound

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.420
like that. So, if that's the case, then that
eliminates some of our trust work. You also

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.500
want to get your fingers inside the bottom
of the turkey here and make sure it's not

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.420
frozen inside. This one's nice and thawed.
So, something else you can do is you can turn

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590
your turkey on its end and just run water
through inside of the turkey just to kind

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.990
of wash out the interior cavity of the turkey.
And, while I get everything else ready, I'm

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.139
going to stand my turkey upright, whoa, goodness,
he's a, that's a big turkey. Oh and also,

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:18.610
last I forget, you want to open up the neck
cavity right here and pull all this fun stuff

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.719
out. This is the turkey giblets, so good stuff.
So, I'm going to stand my turkey up in the

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:33.739
sink, oopsy, he's slippery, slippery and uncooperative.
I'm just going to stand him up like this and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.749
let him drip dry, and he should be fine while
we go cut up our onion.
