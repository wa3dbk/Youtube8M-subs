00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.530
Welcome to the ITFreeTraining video on MBR
and GPT partition tables. A partition table

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.249
forms the low level structure that must be
present before a hard disk can be formatted

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.710
and data copied on it. A lot of operating
systems will make the choice on which partition

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.180
table to use and you may not have been aware
there are two different partition tables available.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
By the end of this video you will understand
how these different partition tables work

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.539
and what features are available on each.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.760
Before a hard disk can be used it needs to
have a partition scheme configured on it.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.920
The partition scheme allows the hard disk
to be divided up into partitions. Let’s

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.850
take a typical hard disk like the one shown.
The hard disk contains space that can be used

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.850
for data. Before this space can be used, it
needs to be divided up into partitions.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.120
Once a partition is created, it can be formatted
by the operating system and data stored on

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.120
it. There are two different partition tables
that are available. These are, MBR and GPT.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.280
MBR is the older of the two and thus has the
most compatibility with operating systems

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.280
and hardware. GPT is the newer standard and
has more features but requires certain hardware

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.210
in order to work. To start with, I will look
at MBR.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.310
The MBR or Master Boot Record was first introduced
on PC’s back in 1983. Since then it has

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.899
become the de facto standard on PC’s for
hard disks and thus offers great compatibility.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.869
MBR allows the hard disk to be divided up
into 4 partitions.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.590
One of these partitions can be changed into
what is called an extended partition. An extended

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.369
partition in the old MS DOS days could contain
an additional 23 partitions taking the total

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.179
number of partitions to 26 to match the number
of available drive letters. This was a limitation

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.430
of DOS, however alterative operating systems
were able to create more than 23 partitions

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.360
if for some reason you required that many.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.879
As a partition table, the MBR system offers
some good features and has great support but

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.879
has one major limitation in modern computing,
this is that it is limited to 2 Terabytes

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.370
of usable space. If you were to install a
hard disk larger than 2 Terabytes you could

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.810
use the hard disk with MBR, however any space
after 2 Terabytes would be lost. You can see

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.019
that all though MBR can offer the basic features
a user requires, its days are numbered due

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.610
to the limitation of how much hard disk space
it can access.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:08.049
The replacement for MBR is GPT or GUID Partition
table. GPT supports 128 partitions without

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:16.099
the need to change an existing partition into
an extended partition like MBR requires. GPT

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.290
supports hard disks sizes in Zettabytes. The
actual amount varies depending on what size

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.340
the hard disk manufacturer makes the sectors
on the hard disk, but either way a Zettabyte

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.090
is a lot of data. Currently with Terabyte
hard disks on the market, first a Petabyte

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.909
and Exabyte hard disks need to be made before
we get close to a Zettabyte hard disk.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.400
If you want to boot your operating system
from a hard disk using a GPT partition table,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.689
you first need to meet some requirements.
Firstly you need a bios that supports Unified

00:03:53.689 --> 00:04:02.120
Extensible Firmware Interface or UEFI. UEFI
was designed as a replacement for the previous

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.610
system called Bios. UEFI manufacturers generally
offer backward compatibility with Bios, however

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.610
UEFI does require 64bit hardware to boot off
and a 64bit operating system.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.820
For boot support you need Windows XP Professional
or Windows Server 2003 or above and they need

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.910
to be the 64bit version. If you are using
Linux, most modern 32bit and 64bit Linux systems

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.910
will support booting from GPT hard disks or
the GPT hard drive being used as a data drive.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.340
You will need to check the details of your
particular distribution to see if it is supported.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.310
What this essentially means is that if you
want to boot off a hard disk that is larger

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.210
than 2 Terabytes you will need to use GPT
hardware and have operating system support.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.970
However, even if your system does not support
these requirements, many operating systems

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.620
will support GPT as a data drive. Windows
Vista and Windows Server 2003 with service

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:19.970
pack 1 will support GPT as a data drive even
on a 32bit system without hardware support.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.690
In the real world, if you have a drive less
than 2 Terabytes, MBR should meet all your

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.240
needs. There is no need to change to GPT.
If however you do find that you need to convert

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.490
between the two, it is possible in Windows,
however this will require all the partitions

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.370
to be created which will erase all the data
on the drive.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.270
If you are using Linux it is possible to convert
the partition table without losing data, however

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.270
you should always backup your data beforehand
just in case. Lastly, there is 3rd party software

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.460
available that will perform the conversion
if you are willing to pay for it.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.460
In a next video I will look at how disk management
is handled with MBR and GPT disks in Windows and, all

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.210
though not required for the Microsoft exam,
I will look at using linux to convert a MBR

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.710
boot partition to GPT.
Well I hope you have found this video useful

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.889
and hope to see you in the next video. Bye
for now.
