00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.769
Hello my friends and welcome 
to another Tuesday of tutorial!

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.230
I am Leonardo Pereznieto, and this time, with
a Christmas spirit, I am going to give away

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.529
as a gift, the watercolor that I am going
to paint today.

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.140
All you have to do to participate in the raffle
is to write me a comment on my Facebook wall.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.070
The link is below.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.070
Today I will show you how to create a VERY
unique Christmas card with an owl watercolor.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.829
You may start by doing the horizon line and
a basic outline of the bird.

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:46.660
By the way, I am only using the bottom half
of the piece of paper, because at the end

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.389
I am going to fold it to create the card.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.489
Do the eyes, then some of the spots 
on the feathers, and so on.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
Remember that the watercolor 
is transparent, therefore,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.460
you can do a good drawing 
and it will always show.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.700
If you want to conserve a white margin on
the sides of the painting, you can cover the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.360
paper with a masking tape.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.280
In this case I will mix different blues.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.600
To paint what will be the snow 
or earth, we do it on dry paper

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.270
mostly so as to keep a sharp horizon line.
Then we wait until the whole thing dries 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.880
so the paint fixes.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120
And then, we get the paper wet again!

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.310
This part had ended up a little bit darker
than what I originally wanted, so I scrub

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.670
some of the paint off to lighten it.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.670
Keep the paper wet except where the owl is,
since we do not want the paint to go on it.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.670
I LOVE the watercolor effect.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.120
We wait once more for the paint to get dry. And
once it is dry, this time we get EVERYTHING wet.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.830
I am going to scrub this a little bit 
more to get it lighter.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.130
While the paper is still damp, we can 
apply some gray for the shadows.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.390
This will be a nice, soft effect.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.640
I think the shadows could be darker.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.410
With a tissue paper I take off some of the
paint from the wing, since I wanted it

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.860
in light, and therefore, white.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.050
I like it how it is coming out.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.020
Mix some yellow and orange for the eyes.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.140
The list of materials is in the 
information under the video.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.370
The dark spots of the feathers for now are
just in pencil. Lets go over them with watercolor

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.370
for some intensity.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.069
In order to give it more volume, we could
reinforce the shadows even more.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.920
Erase the pencil lines that you 
do not need anymore. 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.719
Like this one, which was limiting the head.

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:33.719
I lighten these feathers a little bit with
water... and then, lift the tape off.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.590
The watercolor pads often come with the pages
glued, so they do not ondulate. If that is

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.389
the case, take it off with a knife.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.680
If it had been a lose sheet, I would have
taped it to a board.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.210
Then fold it in half

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.199
and measure where the face is,

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.000
so as to cut a window.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.340
Please be VERY careful when doing this.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.740
On one of these lines I am not cutting right
through, only half way because I do not want

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.839
the whole square to come off. 
I just want a window.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:16.139
And to make it easier to open 
lets stick a tape on it.

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.559
Here you can write a message.

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.899
It is ready. 
Please let me know if you liked it.

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.369
If you enjoyed it, please give it a LIKE 
and subscribe to my channel,

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:57.589

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:58.929
See you on Tuesday.
