00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:17.019
(music)

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.060
The Coral Sea is a remote ocean
ecosystem located to the northeast

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.270
of Australia.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.500
The region is considered one of
the most distinctive

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.630
and undisturbed natural systems in the
world.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.930
It is recognized for its unique physical,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.870
ecological and heritage values and
provides refuge

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.770
for a wide range threatened, migratory
and commercially valuable species.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.800
The environmental significance of the
Coral Sea

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.340
lies in its diverse array a sandy cays
and islets,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.960
deep sea plains and canyons,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.660
seamounts and coral reefs.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.400
The Coral Sea is also home to the Great Barrier Reef,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.680
which at over 2,300 kilometers long is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.090
the largest coral reef ecosystem on the
planet

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.950
and was designated a World Heritage Area
in 1981.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.740
In 1990, after a submission by
the Australian Government

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.980
the International Maritime Organization
declared the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.910
the world first Particularly Sensitive Sea Area.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.660
This area was then extended in 2005

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.940
to create the Great Barrier Reef and
Torres Strait

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.620
Particularly Sensitive Sea Area.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.680
Designation as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.340
helps to protect seas where significant

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.200
ecological, socio-economic or scientific
features

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.060
may be vulnerable to damage by
international shipping.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.600
The Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait
region has an impressive array of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.860
protective measures

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.700
that allow the safe and efficient
operation of international shipping.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.320
These measures include a comprehensive
network

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.450
of aids to navigation, a coastal vessel
traffic service

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.590
supported by a mandatory ship reporting
system

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.720
a dedicated emergency towage vessel

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.940
ship routeing measures

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.080
and a regime of designated shipping
areas.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.560
Additionally there are International
Maritime Organization adopted

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.989
Associated Protective Measures in place
within the Particularly Sensitive Sea Area.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.160
In order to ensure that the
appropriate level of protection is in place

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.220
to protect this vulnerable region, the
Australian Government continues to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.750
monitor shipping volumes

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.640
to identify potential hazards and areas
in need of additional protection.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.760
Over time as the Australian economy has
grown,

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.209
shipping in the Coral Sea has increased.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.040
Like the Great Barrier Reef, the south west Coral Sea contains areas that can be challenging to navigate

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.010
with narrow channels and shallow waters
around the numerous reefs,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.489
cays and Islands lying close to shipping
lanes.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.360
To address this Australia has
proposed to extend to the Great Barrier Reef

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.720
and Torres Strait Particularly Sensitive
Sea Area

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.410
to the south west portion the Coral Sea,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.340
as there are a number of shipping hazards not covered by the current arrangements.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.480
The new area will cover approximately

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.940
564,000 square kilometres

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.720
and represents approximately 12 per cent
of the entire Coral Sea.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.980
This area lives within Australia's
Exclusive Economic zone

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.280
and the Coral Sea
Commonwealth Marine Reserve,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.280
an area of approximately 972,000
square kilometres

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.270
protected by the Australian Government
under national environmental legislation.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.560
The proposed extension
covers the waters of the Reserve

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.450
in which the risk of impacts from shipping
activities is highest.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
The Coral Sea contains critical habitat

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.750
for a rich diversity of species, including

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.740
some of the world's most unique and
significant marine creatures

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.820
like the Green Turtle,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.480
Hump head Maori
Wrasse

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.380
and the Nautilus.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.140
341 species found in the Coral Sea

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.080
have been listed for conservation and
many of these species

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.370
are listed as threatened, or migratory, or
both

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.960
Importantly while more than half of these
species

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.960
show declining population trends worldwide

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.700
many are still found at healthy levels in the Coral Sea.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.100
The area also contains a large number of historic shipwrecks

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.180
and is of great significance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.540
For those areas in the Coral Sea
considered particularly vulnerable to

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.420
impacts from international shipping three Associated Protective Measures

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.730
are proposed.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.720
These are, a new Area to be Avoided and

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.920
two supporting, five nautical mile wide, recommendatory two way routes

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.100
The first route lies in Diamond Passage

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.260
and is approximately 60 nautical miles
long.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.499
It aims to separate opposing streams of traffic and aligns with the existing traffic pattern.

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:23.859
The second two way route lies west of 
Holmes reef

00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:27.539
and is approximately 53 nautical miles
long.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.260
The proposals seek to separate and
formalize these well-established traffic patterns

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.000
while also keeping ships clear of the
new Area to be Avoided.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.320
The proposed Area to be Avoided contains
many reefs,

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:45.749
cays, islets, sandbars and shoal patches.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.020
Establishing Areas to be Avoided
increases ship safety

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.120
by keeping traffic away from
the many navigational hazards within the area.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.779
This reduces the risk of groundings

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.739
and allows more time for intervention in
developing situations,

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:05.739
such as a ship suffering a mechanical
breakdown.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.379
Each year approximately 430 ships traverse these
waters

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.379
while traveling to and from Australian ports.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.179
with many vessels already avoiding the
area.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.679
The new two way route off Holmes Reef will formalize current practices

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:26.979
while adding only an extra 11 nautical
miles to a ship's overall voyage.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.079
This represents a 0.3 per cent increase

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:34.389
to a typical voyage distance of 3,800
nautical miles

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.049
between a Queensland port and Shanghai.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.720
The extension of the Great Barrier Reef
and Torres Strait

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.089
Particularly Sensitive Sea Area and the
implementation of new

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:50.199
Associated Protective Measures provide a
means of protecting

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:55.659
the unique physical, ecological and
heritage values of the Coral Sea

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.540
while having a minimal
impact on international shipping.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.820
It demonstrates a commitment

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:04.860
to sensitive marine environments while
ensuring

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.649
international shipping remains safe,
viable

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:09.809
and efficient.
