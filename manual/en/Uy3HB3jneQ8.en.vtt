We know you can get enough so we're here to bring you more from MotoSport.com

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.359
I'm John Boucher and whether you need them
for the track or for your garage

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.540
Front and rear wheel stand are necessity for any sport bike rider

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.900
today we looking at the Vortex
limited edition MotoSport Aluminum Stand

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.480
which is what happens when the race obsessed crews and Vortex Racing and MotoSport.com

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.640
put their heads
together these are limited in number and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.480
availability

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.990
you can only get them right here at
MotoSport.com

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.440
The stands are constructed of heavy duty two inch diameter aluminum

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.100
and have been powder coated black not only to protect them from abuse of the element

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.450
but to provide a fierce

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.420
aesthetic profile there's a couple
things like about these for starters

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.530
you're stands are going to get packed in the back of a truck or trailer with toolboxes

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.960
tires and motorcycles so your gonna need
that fat two inch aluminum tubing 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.520
so they don't get bent or broken along
the way now this thing might look fat

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.110
heavy but it's

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.340
actually not the rear weighs in
eight-pounds and four ounces

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.840
while the front weighs in at eight pounds and six ounces both the front and the rear

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.750
feature easy to use adjustable hardware
which allows you to make adjustments in

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.540
seconds all you need is that
five-millimeter hex wrench

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.380
which you probably already have another
feature on the front rear stand

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.680
the solid aluminum bushing four inch molded wheels that role with the ease

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.420
you are going to need spools for that rear stand those are sold separately

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.780
if you already have spools you are in good shape before you order these Vortex limited

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.430
edition

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.930
MotoSport aluminum stands make sure
that both your front forks

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.650
are the same length for example the right
fork in the CBR1190RX is a different

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.530
length than the left

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.909
so you wouldn't want to use a front stand
on this bike but the rear stand will work

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.770
perfect the Honda 600RR has the same
size front fork

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.720
so that's what we are going to use as our example the front stands feature custom billet aluminum

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.549
hardware the catchers four bottoms with
ease

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.979
I will warn you it's possible that your
front fork hardware may need to be

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.790
switched out from one side to the other

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.310
so double check your hardware before you
use your stand for the first time

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.369
with the frame of stand laid down to your
left take a close look at the movable

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.009
hardware

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.600
it's properly installed if on the right you you see a little wall

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.810
and on the left side it's open if you
need to pause this video on our close up

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.830
to make sure your hardware looks like
ours

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.890
go and do that now

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.000
once you know that your hardware is properly installed now you can adjust the 
settings to fit your bike

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.180
settings to fit your bike

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.350
loosen the hardware and push it out as far
as it'll go do your best to have the center

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.260
of your stand

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.550
lined up with the center of your tire now roll
your stand

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.120
and bring your hardware up and push them in on each side this is where you need

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.660
that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.100
five-millimeter hex again to tighten
things up once you have a set it's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.330
really easy to use

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.810
