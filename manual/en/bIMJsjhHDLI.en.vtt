ELMO: Oh, yeah.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.580
She knows so much about things
in the park, Abby.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.770
ABBY: Really?

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.116
Like what?

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.230
MISS FRAN: Oh, there's
a ton of interesting

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.165

ELMO: Oh.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:49.750
MISS FRAN: Let's see.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.380
Where to begin?

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.350
Oh, hey, you see all these
leaves on the ground?

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.342

That's right.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.840
But look closely to see how
different they can be.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.380

00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:04.645
Wow.

00:01:04.645 --> 00:01:06.750
They're so different.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.958
One is big and pointy,
and the other one

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.988
is little and smooth.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.040
MISS FRAN: Good for you, Abby.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.410
These are from two different
kinds of trees

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.960
that grow in the park.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.743

little leaves like the one

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.480

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.950

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.480
And if you go around and look,
you'll find lots of other

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.250
kinds of leaves.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.180

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.340
MISS FRAN: Yeah, that's
a pine cone.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.600
And you know, it's from
a whole other kind of

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.450

ABBY: Gee, this pine cone
is rough and hard.

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.404

Oh, there's leaves and sticks
and rocks and bugs and all
