00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:06.791
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:09.710
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:27.041
The hot steam will heat the bowl 

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:30.166
and gradually melt the couverture chocolate.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.655
When the chocolate is almost melted, 

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:38.740
beat the 2 egg whites in a bowl with a hand mixer.

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:46.447
When it turns a kind of white, 

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:51.063
add the extra fine granulated sugar in 3 steps.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.110
Beat until the meringue reaches a stiff peak stage 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.984
and has a glossy texture.

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:06.958
With the desired consistency, 

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.038
it will not drop out of the bowl 

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:12.116
when it is turned upside down.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.990
Now, clean the beaters.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.093
Then, beat the heavy cream in a bowl 

00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:20.592
chilling in ice water.

00:01:20.592 --> 00:01:23.439
Make sure to beat the egg whites first 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.073
and do not reverse the order.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.661
When it begins to thicken, 

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:34.898
switch to a low speed to help avoid over-beating.

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:40.134
Beat until it reaches a soft peak stage as shown.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.819
Then, remove the bowl from the ice 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.225
to help the cream to mix with the chocolate.

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:51.535
Now, remove the bowl of chocolate from the steam.

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:57.251
First, add 2 egg yolks and mix with a spatula.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.766
Next, add about one third of the meringue 

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.291
to the chocolate and combine thoroughly.

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:09.894
This will soften the chocolate 

00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:14.813
and help to keep the foam of the next meringue from breaking.

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.799
Add another one third of the meringue.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.902
This time, carefully combine the mixture 

00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:24.868
to keep the foam from breaking.

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.227
Then, add the rest of the meringue 

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:39.352
and carefully mix likewise.

00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:52.058
Now, add the whipped cream.

00:02:55.677 --> 00:02:58.078
Add the rum. 

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:09.452
And combine the mixture evenly with minimal folding actions.

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:23.532
Then, pour the chocolate mousse into the 6 ramekins.

00:03:26.374 --> 00:03:30.941
Arrange the surface of the mousse with the back of a spoon.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.483
Now, the chocolate mousse is completely chilled and firmed up.

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:49.219
Sprinkle on the cocoa powder.

00:03:54.706 --> 00:04:00.607
Squeeze out the whipped cream 

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.327
and garnish with the strawberry.

00:04:05.643 --> 00:04:08.911
And now, it is ready to serve!

00:04:10.144 --> 00:04:13.292
Make sure to use high quality fresh eggs 

00:04:13.292 --> 00:04:15.614
whose shells are intact.

00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:18.933
If you are not sure about the quality of the eggs, 

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:21.451
please do not try this recipe.

00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:33.321
Don’t over-heat the chocolate otherwise it will reduce its flavor 

00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:36.042
and might cause separation.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.143
Good luck in the kitchen.
