Hi there. I am Tomas Michaud from TomasMichaud.com.
Today I want to talk to you about sore fingers.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.680
Now the reason this is an important subject
is because for many beginners when they start

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.699
practicing regularly, like you should, your
fingers get sore and this is particularly

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.319
an issue on the steel-string acoustic guitar.
Not so much on the nylon string guitar and

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:35.380
not so much on the electric guitar because
of the thin strings on the electric guitar.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.390
Just to be clear I am talking about the fingers
of the left hand, the left hand if they press

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.970
down into the strings, the middle strings
cut into the fingers and they make your fingers

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.420
sore.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.470
Now, there are several things you can do about
this. One is to put lighter strings on your

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.800
guitar. I would recommend starting off by
putting extra-light acoustic guitar strings

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.780
on your acoustic guitar. They are thinner
but they still sound good. Another option

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.860
is to put electric guitar strings on. They
don't sound as good but you can put thinner

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.100
strings on that way and, of course, you can
always build up to thicker strings.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.100
Another possibility is a type of string called
silk and steel. This string is a hybrid-type

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.280
string in-between a steel string and a nylon
string and it goes on the acoustic guitar.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.890
It has a softer sound and a softer feel. Some
people don't like the sound and it might not

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.800
be the overall sound-solution for you but
a good stepping stone to get to the thicker

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.350
strings on the acoustic guitar.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.000
Another possibility is to adjust the action
of your guitar. What I mean by that is you

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.960
are going to adjust the strings so they are
closer to the fret of the guitar, they are

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.460
closer to the neck of the guitar, which makes
it easier to play. Now there are several steps

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.460
in adjusting the action of a guitar. It involves
making the nut of the guitar lower, the bridge

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.390
of the guitar lower and the neck just the
right angle.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.670
Then finally, the last possibility is to file
down the frets so they are more even. The

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.470
trick is to get the strings as low as possible
without buzzing anywhere up and down the neck.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.500
You want to be able to press the note here
[guitar strum] and have it sound nice and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.160
clear, not hit one of the frets up here. This
is tricky and I recommend getting a competent

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.300
guitar repairman to do the work.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.490
If you are mechanically inclined and have
a reasonable tolerance for risk, you can learn

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.670
how to do it. Check out videos on "You Tube".
There are some good videos I have seen on

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.290
there. The risk is if you file the nut too
low or the bridge you are going to have to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.840
go out and get a new one and you can actually
over-tighten that metal truss rod in the neck

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.980
of the guitar to the point you even break
your neck.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.540
Last thing to do is to file the frets and
that is a really tricky one and I wouldn't

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.340
even try that. The last resort is to play
your guitar with sore fingers until they get

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.819
tough. Now they will actually get tough. It
usually takes about three or four weeks and

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.650
some people can just work through it. The
trick is to find that place where if it is

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.590
holding you back from practicing, do what
you need to do to get easier strings on the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.790
guitar. If you can keep practicing and wait
until they get tough then go for it. There

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.959
is nothing wrong with that and once you get
calluses on your fingers, or thicker skin

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.190
rather, you really won't have to worry about
that much anymore in the future as long as

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.560
you keep playing. If you stop playing for
a while you kind of have to go through that

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.989
again.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.959
So, that's it. I hope this has been some help
for you. Mostly I want you to keep practicing

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.760
and that will keep you on the road to getting
better and better as a guitarist and having

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.360
more fun. I'm Tomas Michaud from StarlandGuitar.com.
