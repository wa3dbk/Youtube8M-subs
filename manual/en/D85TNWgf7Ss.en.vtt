00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.340
-[Curtis Smith] Welcome back to Southwest Yard and
Garden, I'm Curtis Smith.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.140
We've returned to the shaded garden of Master Gardener
Ron Jobe, to ask him about the integrated

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.940
pest management procedures that he employs to reduce his use of pesticides here in his garden.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.240
Is this part of your
integrated pest management Ron?

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.240
-[Ron Jobe] Yes Curtis, this is my main insect getter here. This is Rosey, and she has some

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.480
companions that she comes out and cleans my garden out pretty good with it.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.900
-[Curtis] What's her favorite food here?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.160
-[Ron] Well she's good
on grasshoppers, the small squash bugs, aphids if

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.220
they are low enough to the
ground, and a lot of other.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.700
She doesn't discriminate, she'll eat almost any
insect.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.920
-[Curtis] I think she also likes some of your tomatoes every once in a while.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.440
-[Ron] That's very true.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.740
-[Curtis] She takes her salary out.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.680
-[Ron] That's right. In this organic business ,you have to give a little, take a little, and make it come out right.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.040
-[Curtis] I remember a few years ago you had turkeys. And they were a little more efficient because

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.460
they'd even eat the big squash bugs.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.500
-[Ron] Yeah, that's right. Well I still put my turkeys out here, but I lost my real good one that took ahold of that.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.020
But I also have some other means here to keep my pesticide use down.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.160
I've got some bug lights.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.080
-[Curtis] I see them hanging. This is ultraviolet lights with the electric zapper.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.280
-[Ron] Also here, I have about four toads, and I have one that's about this big around.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.540
He is a large one. I try to maintain everything that I can to keep the plants healthy.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.380
Keep the insect
population down.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.880
But when I'm pushed against the wall, then sometimes I have to revert to an insecticide.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.240
-[Curtis] Okay, and one of the principles of integrated pest management or IPM

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.580
is to know the pest you need to deal with.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.820
What are the pests that are most common here in your garden?

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.480
-[Ron] Well as anybody's garden, I think
aphids is a real primary problem.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:09.240
Also I got the tomato hornworm, we get grasshoppers, cabbage loopers, any number of sucking insects.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.100
-[Curtis] So it's a constant
job for these guys, and you get a benefit from that.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.660
In that, you don't buy so much feed because they're finding their own food.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.180
I noticed you've got
some eggs produced.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.080
-[Ron] Yes, they do pretty good at that. And this was a good setting hen too. She raises some young ones for

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.040
me every year.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.260
-[Curtis] So there are a lot of benefits to this, and with the bug light.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.440
I know in the past I've seen that they've killed a lot of elm leaf beetle at night, and the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.280
chickens just love to come eat those
beetles.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.620
-[Ron] They do, and the toads come out at night.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.860
I come out here at night when
they're on and the toads know where the--

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.650
seem to know where the bug lights are.
Because when the bugs fall if they're

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.220
partially paralyzed or whatever they
scoop them up pretty quick.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.360
-[Curtis] So your integrated pest management actually is a
little bit of integrated farming.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.780
The animals and the plants together for a
synergistic effect.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.520
-[Ron] That's right. It works for me.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.140
-[Curtis] Now do you have years where
it really does--you said sometimes you do

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.960
have to go to the insecticide. There are
years where you just really get overwhelmed.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.200
-[Ron] Yeah, if you have an
infestation and it can't be controlled.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.200
Same way like with aphids. If you got
the ladybugs there they'll control them to an extent.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.920
But if it's an epidemic why
they just--it's kind of overwhelming for them.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.920
-[Curtis] Yeah I noticed one
thing, they're not very discriminating.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.640
They're going to eat a ladybug as well
as they'll eat an aphid or a squash bug too won't they?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.600
-[Ron] Yeah that's true. But that's why I
say you gotta weigh the good and the bad.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.560
And you got to give a little and take a
little.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.340
-[Curtis] And that's why some people have a problem with the bug lights because it's also indiscriminate.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.840
-[Ron] Right.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.240
-[Curtis] They'll kill whatever comes by there.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.820
And the lacewings are one of our beneficials which are very much attracted to the bug light.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.040
So people need to be aware that there
are the positive and the negative aspects here.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.900
-[Ron] That's very true. But I've
never seen a praying mantis or a ladybug

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:53.320
in the trees and the bug lights. I've seen a lot of moth and flying insects in that area.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.380
-[Curtis] So at least for your setting and probably in a lot of situations,

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.560
even though it kills some of the good guys, it's getting a lot more bad guys than
good guys.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.280
Now does your integrated pest management procedure have anything to do to help you with

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.460
your plant Disease Control?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.200
-[Ron] Well yeah, especially the plant diseases that are carried by the insects.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.960
It's definitely controlled there.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.919
But the air borne and soil borne spores,
why, I doubt if it does much for that.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.800
Any little bit helps.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.160
-[Curtis] We like to consider that in integrated pest management,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.740
we're also dealing with diseases and weeds.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.700
I've seen them eating some of the weeds out here, so we know that they're also weed controllers.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.580
-[Ron] Oh yes. In the northwest when I was in forest service,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.580
they used weeder geese in their trees and they're specially adapted for that.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.980
But these chickens do, they like the soft

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:53.020
blades of the grass that grows and the Lamb's Quarter and other palatable weeds.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.410
-[Curtis] Yeah once they get too
big. But you've got to be careful that

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.550
your vegetables aren't eaten by these
guys. The little vegetables are first starting

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.140
while they're still tender
because they'll go after them too, won't they?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.790
-[Ron] Yeah that's true. But what I--you
have to kind of get a control on things,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.580
especially once the tomatoes get
ripe because you lose some of them.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.890
Once I harvest my tomatoes, I put all
my chickens, I have about fifteen of them,

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.910
and I just herd them through here
like people herd sheep.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.570
I just run them back and forth and that's why you hardly ever see a grasshopper in this garden.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.840
-[Curtis] Okay that's one of the big
problems. Well Ron, thank you.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.580
Integrated pest management is a good way to manage
problems in the garden.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.420
-[Ron] That's definitely true.
