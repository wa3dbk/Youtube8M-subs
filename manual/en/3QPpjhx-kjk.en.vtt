with

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.169
as the contest's main themes are urban
environment

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:38.130
and idea of every day carry I would like to introduce you to the system that I came up with

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.950
for my EDC

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.520
As you can see it is a tiered system
inspired by TheUrbanPrepper

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.760
On the vertical axis

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.090
we can see

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.390
tiers and on the horizontal axis

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.410
there are needs

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.729
such as SAS basic needs

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.360
based on the SAS survival handbook and
the "fifth needs"

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.490
which are additional needs, identified by other
survival experts. It also includes

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.800
the knife arsenal concept.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.759
If you are a knife enthusiast, you should follow the link in the description below

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.249
O.K. so lets get it started

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.479
In my system, in tier one I include all the
items that are on me during the usual

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.889
work day. Which are... phone... wallet

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.049
sharpie

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.499
neck knife

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.729
another knife

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:27.930
multitool

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.729
lighter

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:32.709
another lighter

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.029
pill box

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.879
another knife

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.509
a lollipop

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.449
and another lighter

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.069
since we have to obey the rules of the
contest

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.929
we're left with three items

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.369
a BIC lighter wrapped in duct tape

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:48.539
a lollipop

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.510
the tin with pills

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.829
band-aids

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.379
and other... if I am to be left with only those five items

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.319
I would like to get some little extra help

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.709
someone once said

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.540
that the duct tape is like Force

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.559
it has a Light and Dark side and holds
the universe together

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:06.450
it can be used

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.640
to patching holes

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.439
as a rope to build the shutter

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.199
and as a belt or shoelaces

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.419
as a temporary band-aid - for health

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.869
and tinder - for five-starting

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.809
market trail as a communication device

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.189
to make a real tourch

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.959
as for illumination

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.709
and an... um...an...tourniquet for health

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.829
and it has hundreds and more uses

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.959
Lighter in another case has two basic uses.
As for means of fire and illumination

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.749
is the simplest way to get both

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.189
and to survive

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.669
okay, next item is a lollipop, you can use it to gain extra bust - as a food

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.979
stop baby from crying

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.879
to help diabetic person

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.680
as a moral buster... afterwards

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.649
you could use a stick as a straw

00:03:56.649 --> 00:04:01.449
in many ways fulfills food water and
health needs

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.569
the number four

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.549
would be

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.109
and an activated carbon capsules

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.649
it can be used to treat poisonings, overdoses following oral ingestion

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.700
used as a drug to treat diarrhea

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.029
indigestion and flatulence

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.969
used as a makeshift gas mask to remove toxins from the breathing air

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.010
and also as a water filter

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.780
fulfills mainly health

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.069
and water needs

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.209
the fifth and the last item would be
a pack of Analgesic drug

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:31.869
commonly known as painkillers

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:34.380
which can save a day of many people

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.100
from headache to wounds and infection.
It is a real weapon in your hand

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.960
okay so let's quickly sum up the items
I will have

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.280
in my EDC

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.610
