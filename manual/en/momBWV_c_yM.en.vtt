It’s beautiful here, the water is nice.
I think it’s very green here, lots of landscaping,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.360
lots of people and everyone seems very nice,
and makes you feel you are at home.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.489
When I got here, the locals of the place warned
me about a story that goes around.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.559
They said… that if you are a foreigner with
a pure heart and a pure soul, you will immediately

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.999
fall in love of the place; you fall in love
of the people, the colors and the passion

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:49.320
that surrounds the area, but be carefully
they told me. If the place loves you in return,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:01:02.659
you will get lost and you will never come
back.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:11.530
Trajinera, is pretty much a wooden boat, its
pretty basic, a Trajinera colors are very

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:20.000
bright, I like bright colors so I like them,
It could be yellow red, turquoise, typically

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.360
bright colors, very noticeable, very Mexico
style, I like it.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.170
Trajinera Jumpers is an idea that red bull
had for us to come here and come to this area,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.950
you know in Mexico city there is not a whole
lot of water, no places to wakeboard and wake

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.630
skate so, it´s a very unique place and has
a lot of history and stuff so to be able to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.930
bring some modern action sports to a traditional
Mexican area is what the idea was, so we built

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.170
so rails on top of the boats and we are gonna
hit them like we do at home and bring it down

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.470
to Mexico city.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.400
just excited to go out there and give it a
shot, I have never try to do this before so

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.041
very different for me but kind of cool and
I never hade done a winch before, so that

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:09.041
will be interesting.

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:12.060
So then I came down a couple of month ago
and we designed the rails over the boats and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.840
we wanted to make some features that would
be kind of easy to hit but also that look

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.230
still look that the natural landscape that
goes on here everyday so we just try to make

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.220
it look as natural as possible but also have
a modern rails and kickers and stuff, so it’s

00:02:30.220 --> 00:03:16.510
what are used to hitting but in a more traditional
setting.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:43.690
You know I am taking home a lot of fun memories
today, we got to hit some fun rails and ended

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.430
up being a place where you don’t get to
normally wakeboard or wakeskate, so to be

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.099
able to come down and to do that was exciting
and I think we have good time. Everyone that

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.682
was riding have a good time, so hopefully
we put a good show for everybody and we can

00:03:55.682 --> 00:04:00.209
come back and do it again some time
I would say what I will be taking home is

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.120
just been able to tell stories and to say
this was my first time I was able to hit a

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.791
winch and do a rail jam, like ever, so here
in Mexico it was definitely my first rail

00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:16.470
jam and it was a lot of fun and to see Grubb
go out and to see him pulling some tricks

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:28.380
and to do some myself was very cool and I
felt I got something accomplished

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.040
Phil Collins once said, I see your true colors
and that is why I love you, but I think he

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.141
never made it to Xochimilco. Other wise he
would have written, this is Xochimilco, and

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:40.460
this is why I love you. Damn I love this place
