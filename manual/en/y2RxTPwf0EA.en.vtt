00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:13.926
1951 International Harvester Panel Truck, this is the 
half ton, with of course the 6 cylinder, 3 on the tree.  

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:19.660
This came out of Saskatoon.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:29.347
This is more of the International Harvester L-110 
Panel Van.

00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:58.676
This one is a basket case.  I actually sold it to my 
neighbor and he has to come and get it.  I have 2 

00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:06.657
more, one is quite prestine and one is not.  This is 
the L-110.  As you can see we put some seats in the 

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:15.909
back.  Those are Tahoe seat that came from the city 
of Phoenix police cars, and they work good because 

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:22.984
they flip 2 times, gaining access to the back of the 
truck.

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:32.059
This is what's left of an L-110.  We have the bed in 
the back and the frame.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:43.723
The fenders and the box in the back are in good 
shape, as is the hood and with a little work they will 

00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:46.222
be ready to go onto a new vehicle.

00:01:46.257 --> 00:01:54.730
Here's the front end of the frame.  Its in pretty 
rough shape but should be able to be cleaned up.  

00:01:54.765 --> 00:02:03.927
Back to the bed again, as you can this was added 
onto a little bit, it was used for construction and you 

00:02:03.962 --> 00:02:11.139
can see in the far back they added on a step-side, 
which was not original to the truck.
