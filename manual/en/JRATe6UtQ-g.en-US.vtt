Hi I'm Mike Green. I'm one of the owners of
1A Auto. I want to help you save time and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.289
money repairing and maintaining your vehicle.
I'm going to use my 20 plus years experience

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.759
restoring cars and trucks, to show you the
correct way to install parts from 1AAuto.com.

The right parts, installed correctly, are
going to save you time and money. Thank you

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.920
and enjoy the video.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.370
In this video, we are going to talk about
wiper blades and wiper refills. There are

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.270
three different general types of wiper blades.
There is the hook style on the lower part

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.530
there is a little hook at the end. This is
the style that's used on almost all new cars

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.430
and a majority of cars from the late 90s up.
The second style is the pin style the wiper

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.370
blade mounts to the arm with a little pin.
The third style is wiper refill.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:15.440
This car, an old GTO, actually has a refill
in the wiper blade. When you change your wiper

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:25.040
blades is up to you. If you start seeing little
lines of water getting left behind, you should

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.360
inspect your wiper blades and make sure they're
nice and smooth all the way across. If they

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.430
have any little ridges or divots in them then
it's probably time to change them. Obviously,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.440
you don't want to let them go too long because
once the wiper blade runs out then some of

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.890
the little teeth in your mechanism can actually
scratch the windshield. Generally on newer

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:56.630
cars, the blade is by hook style. It has a
little tab on the back, and after pressing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:07.670
on the tab, you pull the whole blade back
and it comes off. You can buy a new wiper

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:17.130
blade to replace that. It goes back on by
inserting the arm through the blade and then

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.890
locking it back on.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.921
Another style of wiper blade is what we have
here on this older GM truck. It's kind of

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:43.500
a pin style. You actually need a screwdriver.
You have to be kind of firm with it. It's

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.750
just mounted onto a pin and you'd buy that
blade to replace it. You push it right on.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:01.250
Once you know what type you have, all you
need to know when buying new blades is what

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:12.370
length you have. They come in anywhere from
8-inch for some older vehicles, all the way

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:23.130
up to a 30-inch range for some of the newer
vehicles.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.680
On some older vehicles, like here on this
old GTO, you can do the same thing. There's

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.840
actually a tab under here that you press down
on. Then you can lift the blade up and firmly

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:47.140
pull it off. Many a times, the original style
stainless steel blades are not available.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:55.540
What you can do is use a wiper refill. You
pinch the end together and pull out. Then

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:16.480
just the rubber comes out. Then obviously
to put it back in, you need to make sure on

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:29.210
the arm there's little teeth that come down
and this metal here slides into those teeth.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:40.810
You slide it in and there are usually four
to five sets depending on how big your wiper

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:48.920
blade is. There you go.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.460
We hope this helps you out.
