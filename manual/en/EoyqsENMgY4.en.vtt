00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.490
 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.639
From its very beginning Scouting has been
a movement in which youth develope by

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.620
taking responsibility for their
activities

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.059
and adventures. Lord Baden-Powell's vision for
Scouting was a program in which Scouts

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.000
play the most important role within their
Sections,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.980
and his vision for Scouters was that they
serve as mentors, supporting the youth as

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.630
they step up to run things themselves.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.199
Youth-Led: It's just one of the four
elements of The Canadian Path, but I have to

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:27.590
admit

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.980
this is the one that i think is
particularly important. Over the last

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.190
couple years we've been listening
carefully to the youth of all ages

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.489
participating in our programs. They want to
spend more time outdoors,

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.160
they want to have great adventures, challenging
themselves and trying new things for the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.860
first time.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.219
They want to look up to enthusiastic
Scouters who will ask them what they want to

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.660
achieve

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.680
and coach them to success. This feedback
from our youth is at the core

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.370
of The Canadian Path. A program that will
enable more Scouting youth to benefit from

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.870
great,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.039
safe Scouting adventures than ever before.
It's been a long time coming

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.309
and I'm pleased to kick off the new Scouting
year by inviting you to join me on The

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.340
Canadian Path.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.090
Remember, this is your Canadian Path. Scouts Canada
will provide the tools

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.360
but you will decide where it leaves you
as a Scout or as a Scouter.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.360
As soon as the word aventure is mentioned
something stirs within us

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.790
and excitement of the possibilities. Is it to
explore the unknown,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.210
to challenge us, maybe we want to satisfy our curiosity,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.060
trying something new for the first time.
This totally starts with Scouts!

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.680
Some say it's in our nature to seek out
adventure. Experiencing adventurous

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.390
activities allows us to learn about our
strengths and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.750
reap the rewards of our successes. Scouting began
began as a quest for adventure.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.600
In this spirit, we need to be responsive
to the demands of our youth

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.869
and provide them with the activities
that they want. An adventure is a fun, exciting

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.229
and challenging experience.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.590
This could happen anywhere. For many, new
experiences take place outdoors

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.080
beyond the walls of the meeting hall. The
feedback that we've gathered

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.020
from our youth consistently indicate a desire
for more outdoor adventures.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.759
Adventure can also happen indoors
however. The criteria for having an

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.940
adventure's the same.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.430
An adventure must be exciting,
challenging and fun.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.819
Adventures can happen in the meeting hall,
the local gym,

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.800
the swimming pool or the rock climbing
gym. Wherever the youth seek them out

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.420
remember, this is your Canadian Path. You will identify the challenges and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.209
achievements

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.840
that you experience as a Scout or as a Scouter. So where would you like to go?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.550
Plan, Do and Review are three important
words that describe the process we can

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.319
all follow

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.519
for activities, camps or anything else we
do in Scouting. This is not new of course.

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.790
Be prepared is at the heart of what we
do.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.350
Our goal is to enhance this principle
and make Plan-Do-Review a process

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.070
that is accessible for all of our
Sections.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.410
This process will be consistent from
Beaver Scouts

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.860
to Rover Scouts. It's a way of doing
things that ensures youth and Scouters

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.620
alike

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.650
make their activities safe, challenging

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.849
and most importantly, fun.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.989
Planning may be the most important step
in the Plan-Do-Review process.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.780
We have some great resources to help
plan great, safe Scouting adventures,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.970
and there are opportunities for youth to
be more involved in this important step.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.019
Youth of all ages need to be involved in
choosing their activities,

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.910
figuring out what equipment is needed,
dividing out the tasks

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.440
and thinking about safety. 'Do' does not
mean that we let nature take its course

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.670
after an activity has been planned.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.980
Youth need to consciously apply their
planning to an activity

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.360
and think critically during their
adventures to ensure that everything is

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.930
happening

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.200
safely and successfully. The Scouters
experience is critical in guiding you

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.390
to consider the challenges, risks and
options,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.400
even as an activity is taking place.
'Review' is an important part

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.400
of any activity. As a Scouter I've been
through this many times before,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.700
but the goal on the Path is for me to
guide and mentor youth,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.090
to pass on my knowledge and to help my
Scouts, regardless of their age,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.030
to reflect on their experience, identify
what successes they had,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.200
list what pickups they encountered and
determine what were the strongest

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.500
and weakest moments of the activity. Some
groups will incorporate their review

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.810
into a Scouters 5

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.989
or during the bus ride back home. Other
groups will do it a week later

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.070
back in the meeting hall. When you
review might just depend on how many iof

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.320
you are actually awake during that bus
ride home.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.539
Scouters compose some of the following
questions to their youth during the

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.030
review process:

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.550
What do you know now that you didn't
know before? How did we handle the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.850
activity? Did everyone play a part?

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.630
What was great about this adventure? What
was not so great and needs improvement?

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.590
Start your fall adventure on the right
foot

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.610
using Plan-Do-Review in everything
that you do.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.050
I'm confident that if you do so you'll
have a great number of safe Scouting

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.100
adventures

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.610
on your Canadian Path.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.680
What are SPICES? There's six critical attributes that are
fundamental

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.010
to developing well-rounded youth, better
prepared for success in the world.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.060
SPICES is an acronym for social, physical

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.280
intellectual, character, emotional
and spiritual development.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.770
These building block help our youth flourish in everyday life. Scouting is one of the

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.840
few programs that helps youth grow in

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.110
all six of these areas. Most Scouters
recognize that these six

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.840
attributes are already embedded in our
program. They see it in the open

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.490
conversations and meaningful moments with
their Groups

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.260
that allow you to shine from a Cub Scout
solving a problem in a STEM

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.080
experiment,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.630
to a Venturer Scout sharing her
flashlight to help another,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.460
to crew of Rovers discussing a service
project in a foreign country.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.650
The Canadian Path will simply create
more and greater opportunities

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.000
for our youth to have these meaningful
moments. I look forward

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.690
to meeting you on the Canadian Path during this new Scouting year.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.810
The Canadian Path sets Scouts Canada apart from
other youth organizations

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.050
because it creates an opportunity for young people to
organize and lead their own adventures

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.690
 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.280
This helps Canadian youth to grow as
individuals and helps Scouting to grow it's

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.110
movement.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.430
The four elements are fundamental to The
Canadian Path. So do your best to include them in

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.270
your program.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.680
Over the coming months we'll be launching
support tools and videos for each of the four

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.080
elements.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.010
But you don't have to wait to make your program
more Canadian Path. Start now.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.020
Bring the journey to your group and one parting
thought, although you've heard a few times already

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.020
this is your Path. Your Canadian Path.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.840
As a Scout or a Scouter you can make this as challenging,
successful or as rewarding as you wish.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.510
Are you up to the challenge?

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.670
I thought so, so see you on The Canadian Path.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.480
Welcome to The Canadian Path.
