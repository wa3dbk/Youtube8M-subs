00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.650
Ava: Hi everybody., how are you doing?

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.650
I'm Ava.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.840
This is my identical twin, Loretta.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.180
We're the Double Time Twins, and right now
we're going to teach you how to dance like

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.910
Ciara.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.380
One thing about Ciara is all about her attitude.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.750
She's very cool and relaxed with her choreography.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.330
Our favorite dance moves that she doe is in
her "One Two Step" videos, so that's what

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.620
we're going to teach you right now.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.620
Loretta: Awesome.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.879
Ava: So, two counts of beat.

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.020
The first count of beat is the "let me do
my one two step."

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.780
Okay, so here we go.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
Your leg's going to come front and then your
other leg's going to come behind.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.540
The leg in front is going to come to the side
and this other leg is going to come front.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.840
And we're going to do the same exact thing
the other way; front, back, side, front; front,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.560
back, side, front; front, back, side, front;
front, back, side, front.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.620
Now when you do this, you can lean with it.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.430
Like, your hand's going to be here and you're
pushing through.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.290
Loretta: Like you're pushing through something.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.549
Ava: So here we go; front, back, side, front;
front, back, side, front; front, back, side,

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.549
front.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.549
Let me do my one two step, awesome.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.500
We do that twice, let's do it again; five,
six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.550
five, six, seven, eight, awesome.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.439
Next part, Ciara likes to shake her booty,
so that's what we're going to show you right

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.439
now.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.439
We're going to turn to the side.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.439
Loretta: It's true.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.979
She does a good job.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.049
Ava: Okay, so we turn to the side.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.600
We go one, two, three, four, so our hips are
going to circle.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.270
Then you're taking two steps, so your body
faces the side, okay?

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.459
Let's do it again; five, six, seven, eight;
one, two, three, four, awesome.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.119
From here, you're going to come down like
this.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.062
This foot that's in front, you're going to
come up on your toe, and your hips are going

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:12.300
to shift with it, and then you're going to
push it down -- BOOM.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.170
Then you're going to do it again, up and then
sit -- BOOM.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.870
You do that twice.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.190
Let's turn, so we turn; one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.650
Awesome, let's do that from the turn; five,
six, seven, eight; one, two, three, four,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.430
up sit, up sit.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.870
Awesome, now let's put it together.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.580
From the push, BOOM, and we we go five, six,
seven, eight; one, two and circle, up sit,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.739
up sit.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:53.430
Now if you want to add a little more spunk
or flavor to it, you could even look at it,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.430
right?

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.790
Boom -- pssh, boom -- pssh, or if there's
someone that you want to attract and he's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.620
right up front, you could look at them too.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.599
All right, let's do it to music.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:17.049
Here we go; five, six, seven, eight, and that's
how you dance to Ciara "One Two Step."
