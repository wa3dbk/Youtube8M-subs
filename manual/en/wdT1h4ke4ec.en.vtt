00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.126
Today is an incredibly special day in Miami history.

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:16.371
Welcome to our Miami University Armstrong Student Center.

00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:21.648
*clapping and applause*

00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:27.195
This building is the realization of our student dream 
to have a home of our own on campus.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.916
From the time you first enter the Armstrong Center, 
you are immersed in the idea of family.

00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:41.066
It is almost unprecedented to have so many 
unified so strongly behind one initiative.

00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:48.468
That says a lot about the value we place on the college experience at Miami and the connection we all feel to this place.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.634
When I came here I was asked, 
"What is your vision for Miami?"

00:00:54.942 --> 00:01:01.507
... and I spontaneously erupted with, 
"Well, it was to make Miami more Miami."

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.562
"To take those qualities and values that have defined Miami literally over the centuries and make them better."

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:19.536
To the joint efforts of all the people I have described and so many more that I haven't, we stand in a building that will make Miami better.

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:25.803
It's about learning, beyond the curriculum, the classroom, and the computer screen.

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:34.321
It's about involvement in student government, organizations, and external projects.

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:42.752
It's about adding value, not just to our degree, but to our career and to our life.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:57.550
The Armstrong Student Center, 
where we meet, study, talk, eat, or just relax
and remember each other.

00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:06.344
Where we share experiences of engagement, and teamwork, and leadership.

00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:17.433
Where we turn our dreams into the reality of our potential. 
For love and honor.
