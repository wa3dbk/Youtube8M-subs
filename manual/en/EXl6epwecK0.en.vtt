00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.620
In Media Composer learn how create a quick
slide show with transitions between all your

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.970
clips.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.259
Check out this short tutorial on how to change
the duration of all your slides so that you

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.969
have plenty of handles to add all your transitions.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.949
I've got a brand new project here, so the
first thing I'm going to do is click on the

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.099
settings tab within the project window.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.810
Double click on the import settings.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.470
Go ahead and specify a duration that you would
like for each still image.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.210
Next, I'm going to drag in some still images
into a bin.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.470
After they've been imported, if you double
click on one of the clips you can see that

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.910
the position indicator is at the front of
every clip.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.840
Click on the script tab within your bin window.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.929
Use the keyboard shortcut command + A, or
ctrl A if you are PC user.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.320
This selects all the clips in your bin.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.980
Pressing the number two key will move a virtual
indicator forward ten frames.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.110
Therefore, if you need a two second handle
at the front of each clip, press the number

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.980
two key 6 times.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.650
You won't be able to see a position until
you mark an in point.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.580
Press the letter 'I' to mark an in point.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.720
Then let's press the number two key 9 more
times to advance 3 more seconds.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.350
Then go ahead and press 'O' to mark an out
point.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.060
Okay, there you go, all the clips now have
handles at the front of the clip, and they

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.610
are all exactly 3 seconds in duration.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.000
Go ahead and drag them to a new sequence.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.280
The last step is to mark in-out points around
your entire sequence.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.540
Then press the quick transition button.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.640
Go ahead choose a transition and it's length.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.280
Then click on the Apply to all Transitions
button.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.909
Okay, that's it, back up and watch your sequence.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.629
