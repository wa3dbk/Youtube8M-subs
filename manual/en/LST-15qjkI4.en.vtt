00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.760
Well, it's my favorite flavor [yeah].

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.340
[man] I like it. [woman] I don't.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:20.160
My name is Ambrose lee. I'm the food scientist who developed the Buttered Popcorn Jelly Belly in 1989.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.120
It tastes like it's 25 years old.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.360
It gives you the idea of a candy and a jelly bean,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.560
but also you're at the movies having a little popcorn.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.560
It turned out to be a love it, hate it flavor.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.540
I wanted to try to experience to see if it was truly gonna taste like buttered popcorn

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.900
and so I tasted it, and it was exactly like buttered popcorn, it was very very good.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.700
I would say that 50/50 some people hate it.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.680
How could you make something like that? It's not even candy. I gotta say the Buttered Popcorn

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.100
is really not my cup of tea um

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.649
I think it's kind of like melted corn combined with custard sort of mixed together

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.599
and they're sort of gooey mess in your mouth. Not really for me. [But] other people love it.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.650
"Oh, I never tried that this is a brand new experience." That's much better than I thought it would be. The name, the name seems

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.979
like something you wouldn't expect out of a jelly bean, but the, but the flavor is actually very sweet like it actually works quite well.

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.289
Spotting is to add

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.629
something to the candy to make it look like what we're trying to shoot for, say Buttered Popcorn

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.259
we're trying to make it look like the butter on the buttered popcorn. [it's] a misconception.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.309
The candy has more yellow speckle is

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.649
definitely not, you know, having more butter flavor.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.380
Try again. [nervous laughter]

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.200
Get back in the madhouse man. [laughing]

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.560
Absolutely say congratulations you nailed the flavor on this one. I think that's rather creative and well done.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.520
I guess that turned out to be a success.
