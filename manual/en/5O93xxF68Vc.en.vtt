00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.000
No, I'm not gonna do it. I will not do it,
its a cheap sight gag and frankly my

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.649
audience is above it and so am I, alright, so--

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.080
[From off camera] You did it for John Wesley.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.960
I know I did it for John Wesley
that's different, alright?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.040
That was for a good reason this is not that, okay?

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm not gonna do it. I absolutely

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.380
unequivocally will not do it....
[snare drum roll]

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.279
okay.. hi..

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.429
I'm a Sunday school teacher. Alright, last week I asked my--

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.140
no, I'm not doing a voice. Not gonna do it.
This is enough--

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.400
Last week I asked my Sunday school class

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.840
uh, you know, if they thought Noah did a lot of fishing on the ark?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.180
"How could he"

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.840
replied Billy, "with only two worms?"

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.640
Told you it wasn't funny.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.140
It's not funny. None of this is funny, it doesn't
work alright

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.260
and why does a Sunday school teacher
have to be a woman? Alright, lots of men

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.950
are Sunday school teachers. I am a Sunday school teacher and this, the boa?!

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.469
Inexplicable! I've never seen a Sunday
school teacher wear a boa!

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.209
To class...[pfftt].

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:12.851
It's sexist.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.940
[From off camera] It's funny.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.480
Whatever, let's just-- we're talking about Sunday School

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.400
on this episode of Chuck Knows Church or whatever, alright?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.600
[behind camera laughing]

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.440
[intro music]

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.700
Originally Sunday Schools were literally

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.180
schools. They were places where poor
children can learn to read.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.700
Some historians point to Saint Mary's Church in Nottingham

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.200
as the place the first Sunday school may have been

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.310
opened in 1751.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.160
Now in 1769 Hannah Ball from Buckinghamshire, England founded the school as well.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.640
But it was Robert Raikes, editor of
the Gloucester Journal

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.820
and an Anglican evangelical who became
the movement's

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.340
biggest promoter in Britain in the 1780s,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.540
and soon spread to America. Now religious
denominations and non-denominational

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.650
organizations alike

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.880
were quickly on board to create Sunday schools.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.180
You see, the Industrial Revolution meant many children spent all week in the factories

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.500
working long, long hours and Saturday was
actually part of the work week.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.070
So, Sunday was the only time for these
children to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.890
be educated in school. Now this prompted
Christian philanthropist who

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.350
wanted these children out of a life of illiteracy to get them

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.090
into Sunday school. Now the Bible was the
textbook used for learning to read and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.489
children learn to write by copying scriptures

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.220
and teaching Christian morality and
virtues, well, that was always

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.640
another major goal. Now the early eighteen hundreds,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.079
marked the the spread of Sunday
schools in America and within decades

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.590
they were encouraged

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.930
everywhere. Sunday school attendance was
commonplace and soon

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.950
it was an accepted part of childhood all
around the world.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.620
By the eighteen seventies, in both

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.709
Britain and America, when compulsory
State Education was established

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.090
reading and writing were learned on weekdays at school

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.150
and Sunday school curriculum was limited

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.270
to religious education.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.660
Still, many parents continue to believe regular
Sunday school attendance

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.769
was an essential part of childhood. And
although Sunday school attendance has declined

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.780
many reasons given; growing secular
society, other options on Sundays, despite

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.579
all the obvious factors, if we are diligent

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.750
about meeting children where they are
today with all the crazy distractions

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.060
and competing demands

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.230
Sunday School will not end anytime soon.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.570
To learn more you can ask your pastor or
your Sunday school teacher perhaps.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.180
You can tell them Chuck sent ya.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.440
There's still some on my lips, isn't there?

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.700
It's on my teeth? Feel like its on my teeth, I can taste it.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.600
