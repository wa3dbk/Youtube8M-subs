00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.210
This new Sony pink VAIO netbook 
is the apple in my eye,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.560
and I'm going to tell you all about it next.
Don't go anywhere.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.530
Take a look at this pink Sony VAIO.
This is the VPC-W111XX,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.480
and they are hot.
These netbooks, I'm telling you,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.950
the design is superb,
from head to toe. 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.530
Even the batteries look hot, ok?
And the touchpads.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.030
These are just like stylish netbooks,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.700
and they come in a couple 
of different colors: 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.540
You've got the pink, the brown, 
and the silver.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.240
And I'm telling you, 
netbooks are fantastic. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.350
If you're always on the go,
you just need to check e-mails 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.780
and stay in touch, 
a netbook is a great device to have.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.140
First of all, these netbooks right here,
the Sony VAIOs, 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.400
they run on the 1.66GHz, 
Intel Atom processor N280.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.490
You have one gigabyte DDR2 RAM,
160 gig hard drive, at 5400rpm.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.570
You also have 
Windows XP Home preloaded on here.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.250
And take a look at this display right here.
This is a 10.1 inch display.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.410
It's an LED Backlit Display
with XBRITE-ECO technology. 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.050
And the resolution is 
1366 x 768.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.700
And I was looking at some photos
on here earlier. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.580
Crisp. Definitely crisp.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.750
All right, it comes equipped with
802.11 b/g/n Wireless,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.480
also Bluetooth 22.1 + EDR, 
so you can pair this netbook

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.640
with your smartphone or any other
Bluetooth device, to share files.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.340
Also comes equipped with 
Intel Integrated Graphics, 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.520
Media Accelerator 950.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.100
And you've got the card reader, 
so you can load in 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
your Memory Stick Duo Card,
and load all your photos on here.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.970
82-key keyboard, and last but not least,
netbooks, they're super-light.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.530
They're meant to be portable
and taken places.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.040
And this one right here 
only weighs 2.6 pounds. 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.430
Poundaronies. 2.6 of them.
That's it.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.290
So let's take a look around
this Sony VAIO, 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.290
and I'm going to show you 
what I was talking about

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.340
when it comes to design.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.340
So starting with our tour up here
in the pretty-pretty pink bezel,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.550
you will your Motion Eye webcam.
This is great for all of your Skyping,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.010
and your GChatting,
just staying in touch with your webcam.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.150
Again, you have a 10.1 inch 
LED Backlit display 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.470
with XBRITE-ECO technology.
Again, the resolution 1366 x 768.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.230
You have your 82-key keyboard 
with the new raised-key style.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.570
So food doesn't get stuck in here.
It's great.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.180
Moving down below, 
you'll see you have your touchpad.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.070
And take a look at this design.
Ok?

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.950
It's got a nice pattern on here,
and the border is this shiny pink trim.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.240
Looks hot.
Very girly, though. Very girly.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.960
So you also have your left and your right
click down below your stylish touchpad.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.850
Moving on to the side,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.620
you'll see right here we have 
two USB 2.0 ports right here.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.310
You've got your Ethernet port
and right here you've got your lock.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.950
And on the other side,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.960
Starting right here,
you have your VGA port,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.220
you have your headset 
and your mic Jacks.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.220
And at the very end, right over here,
you've got your power.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.450
And then moving along front,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.280
you'll see you have your 
wireless switch right here.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.550
You also have your Memory Stick Pro Duo card,
and your SD card reader along side here.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.890
And then at the very end,
you will see you have 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.450
your power on and off switch.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.830
So let's close this Sony VAIO up,
and I want to show you guys the battery.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.980
I don't know about you, 
but this battery just looks stylish.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.550
I even think that Sony spent time 
working on the battery.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.180
It goes really well with the silver trim.
I'm just impressed.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.230
I'm really impressed with these
Sony VAIOs. 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.470
So there you have it.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.810
These are the Sony VAIOs
VPC-W111XX.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.360
You got the pink, you got the brown,
you got the silver.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.190
If you don't have a netbook,
you've been thinking about getting one,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.330
I think now is the time.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.900
They're getting more sleek 
and more stylish than ever.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.610
All right, guys, thanks so much for watching.
