00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.680
The Harrowing 2013 has hit the live server,
season 4 changes have hit the PBE, and a Nasus

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.750
visual update has hit the community right
in the feels.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.930
All that and a riot point giveaway, right
here, right now on the league update brought

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.620
to you by American Express.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.740
The Harrowing ushers in a plethora of creative
ways for riot to part you from your hard earned

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.740
dollar.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.810
At first glance haunted Zyra might seem like
the main attraction but look again, because

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.510
unlike the limited skins of harrowings past
Haunted Zyra and Officer Vi will be available

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.859
all year long.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.950
Speaking of, if you've been keeping up on
your league update you know that riot is reviving

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.969
limited edition skins from 2010 and 2011 but
what no one knew is that 2012 Harrowing skins

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.180
like Zombie Brand and Headless Hecarim are
returning for a midnight ride.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.949
Other attractions include limited ward skins,
exclusive summoner icons and the mystery gift

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.949
feature.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.920
Which allows you to purchase a random skin
for a friend.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.610
The mystery gift will only set you back 490
Rp and could end up being an ultimate skin

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.610
worth three thousand.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.010
A word of warning to anyone thinking of buying
a mystery gift, make sure you write down which

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.950
skin the gift ended up being because once
you close the dialog window there is NO way

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.780
of finding out short of going through every
champions 1 skin at a time.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.380
Nasus is next in line for a visual update.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.270
And judging from the preliminary screenshots
released last thursday things were looking

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.270
good.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.140
But when the sound of Nasus's new voice and
sight of his new splash art hit the PBE.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.810
The league community was anything but pleased.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.090
For those who weren't aware Nasus was originally
voiced by singer / songwriter Gene Mcdaniels

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.270
who passed away in 2011 at the age of 76.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.159
So the thought of Gene being immortalized
as the voice of Nasus was a romantic notion,

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.399
but riot ultimately decided to update the
original voice over saying that QUOTE "The

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.479
number of lines included in new champion voiceover
has expanded significantly since Nasus originally

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.009
made his debut, But during the process of
updating Nasus we've done everything possible

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.400
to preserve the spirit of the original voiceover."

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.350
But his new splash art seemed to tell a different
story, portraying him as a snarling and ferocious

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.620
beast instead of the stoic and noble curator
we all know and love.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.890
But while we're on the topic of snarling and
ferocious, take a look at this, Nasus's new

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.560
legendary skin Infernal nasus, featuring nods
to, Snoog Dog, Milkbone premium dog biscuits

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.890
and Cerberus guardian of the Underworld.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.361
Moving on it's time to shoutout or sponsor

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.370

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.280
Let's talk about season 4, I mean I don't
really want to because I'm still trying to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.530
reach my goal for season 3, but none the less
there are some pretty excellent changes coming

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.900
down the pipe.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.200
And the most excellent of those changes being
that player health bars and allied health

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.870
bars now have a color distinction, so keeping
track of where you are in a team fight should

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.720
be that much easier.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.530
Masteries have also been reworked and while
nothing is final cool changes include the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.160
addition of a spawn shield in the defence
tree, as well as the ability to generate three

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.140
gold every time you hit an enemy champion
hit in the utility tree.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.240
Next a ranked and unranked 1v1 and 2v2 mode
has been added to the PBE and while you could

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.150
assume that means the Magma chamber debuted
in June is implemented the entire doesn't

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.590
seem to work at all right now.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.900
And last on my list of cool changes for season
4 is the new jungle camp... the wight camp.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.570
Originally intended to give single target
junglers like master yi and warwick a quick

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.890
kill it succeeds only in making the average
jungle clear time longer... not to mention

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.210
the uninspired aesthetic design of the mob.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.810
Finally, a new skin debuted this morning called
pop star arhi... where do they get these ideas.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.740
I'm sure that we all have a better ideas for
a skin than popstar arhi... if only there

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.000
was an artist willing to visualize our concepts!

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.080
Oh wait there is!

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.270
It's riot's very own riot penguin who took
the best ideas from a forum thread and decided

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.940
to sketch them out in his own personal time.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.531
Now keep in mind these are not official announcements
or even hints of any skins to come but that

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.270
doesn't stop them from being absolutely astounding.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.740
So... what's your skin idea?

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.169

twenty dollars worth of riot points.
