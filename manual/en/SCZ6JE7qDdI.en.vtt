00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.150
Today's Makeup Tutorial is a Valentine's Day
Makeup Look.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.340
Getting started, I am going to apply an eyeshadow
base all over the lid.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.110
As usual, I'm using the eyeshadow base in
Skin-Tone by NYX Cosmetics.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.170
Then I'm picking up Orange Soda from the Lavish
Palette by Anastasia Beverly Hills on a fluffy

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.420
brush, and using this as a transition shade
for my lid and crease.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.230
Then I'm picking up the color Pink Sapphire
from that same palette and packing it on with

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.880
my finger tip onto the center of my lid.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.300
Now, I'm picking up truffle from that same
palette, apply it with a brush on the inner

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.400
and out corners of the eye.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:44.800
Then, I'm taking Sienna on a loose fluffy
brush and blend out any of the harsh lines;

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.980
applying this to the crease.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.510
I'm picking up the color Rumcake and applying
it on the sides of that Pink Sapphire color

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.070
to create a transition from the dark truffle
color to the Pink Sapphire color.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.930
Then, Highlighting my brow bone with the cream
color.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.710
I'm going to add a slight wing to my lids.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.750
I'm using this Gel Eyeliner on a slanted angled
brush.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.360
I've found this method most helpful!

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.850
Then, apply mascara to the upper lashes.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.640
I don't know what mascara this was.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.850
It was sent to me.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.390
It's a surprise mascara that is coming out
in sephora soon, so stay tuned for that!

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.980
Then, take Sienna and Black diamond form that
same palette, I'm going to apply it with a

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.229
smaller brush on the lower lash line.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.800
And of course, add mascara to the lower lashes.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.600
Here, I'm adding a Artist Couture highlight
to my inner corners.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.950
And if you want to see my full foundation
routine and contour routine, I'll link it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.560
down below in the description bar.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.990
, you'll notice I'm using a brush.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.229
It's pretty much the same thing.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.920
And everything I'm doing here, will be in
that video.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:06.409
So, check that out in the description bar.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:26.330
Now, I'm using the Artist Couture highlighter
and I'm going to line my lips with this lipliner

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.780
from City Color Cosmetics called Orchid.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:43.950
And then, I'm topping it off with another
City Color lipstick called Secret Affair.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.819
Then, I'm going to pick up Dark side from
my Naked 3 Palette and Apply it to my lips,

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.680
Because I wanted it to be darker.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.090
