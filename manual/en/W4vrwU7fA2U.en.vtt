Howdy folks hows it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen today i'm showing you how to make

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.110
a jelly cake.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.910
Looks amazing right and it's just a bit of
fun but kids of all ages will go crazy for

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.620
it, I mean I went crazy for it, my kids certainly
did so it's a bit of a project I rushed this,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.590
I actually did this in 5 Hours but if you
want to spend a weekend doing it you can make

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.240
it look amazing if you wanna have a go, hit
pause on the video now, write all the ingredients

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.060
down and this is how you do it.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.910
Grab the tin that you are planning on using
for your cake and give it a little spray in

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.320
oil now what I did was fill up the capacity
of the cake tin with water and I worked out

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.890
it was 2.3 litres and as I was trying to do
12 different colours Ijust divided that by

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.660
twelve and knew that every bit of jelly needed
to be 196.7 litres.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.469
So I got 2 jugs, hello i'm Mr jug 1 and i'm
Mr jug 2 put my 2 jellies in there of the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.450
same colour put my boiling water on there
up to 200ml mixed it all up then one of them

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.039
I poured it into the base and whacked it in
the freezer, you can put it in the freezer

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.039
so it sets a little quicker now your other
one we'll make a pale colour so I poured in

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.569
a little bit of yoghurt but you can use condensed
milk or milk and just mix it through so you've

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:11.700
got a nice pal colour.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.679
After about 20 minutes your first layer of
jelly /jello shall have a nice little skin

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.049
on it which will allow your second layer to
be poured on top, so do that and whack it

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.369
straight back in the freezer.

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.320
Now here is the boring step you have got to
do this with every single one of your colours

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.929
and 20 mins is the absolute minimum, remember
I was rushing this if you do it in the fridge

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.450
and take your time you can do so many cool
things with it maybe put a cup in the middle,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.689
build the layers up, take the cup out like
a pinata cake or ice-cream with jelly on top

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.380
for the final layer, speaking of the final
layer I didn't actually film this bit but

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.099
I got a springform tin whacked it on the top
to give me a bit more height then put my orange

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.200
jelly around it to get like a little base
of orange jelly.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.539
When I lifted it off it looked amazing with
the little orange base too, cut it into pieces

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:55.539
and the kids loved it.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.539
'Hello'...

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:03.159
'Hello guys welcome to our virgin kitchen
and this is Chloe and this is me right'.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:12.060
Oh my goodness this is the quietest they've
been for hours right Phoebes?

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.569
Your looking around for some more but you
can't have it Chloe you've got some around

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.569
your chin and cheek, uh yeah, they're loving
it there's none left mate!

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.950
So that's it once it's cut into wedges like
that it's pretty damn sturdy you've got all

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.790
these colours intermingling that's a kind
of cool word to use intermingling if you enjoyed
