00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.090
Hey it's MosquitBRO.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm out here by the lake area where I like to
go for a hike or run after work.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There's a good amount of bugs and mosquitoes out here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I usually get bitten a couple of times.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I bought a couple of insect repellent bands and products which are all-natural, all DEET-free.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Because I don't like the chemicals.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm actually going to try them out--a different one everyday.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.000
Be your guinea pig and see how many times I get bitten.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
First one we're going to do today:

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is by PIC, the Citronella Plus Wristband.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It says it's effective up to 200 hours.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I bought this from Amazon.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We're going to open this up, see how well it works.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm going to go running and jogging for an hour and then I'll come back and let you know how many bites I've gotten.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.800
There's a good amount of notches.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Hopefully your wrists aren't crazy huge. This isn't necessarily the biggest band.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.130
It's not exactly the strongest smelling.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.000
Alrighty, I'll catch you later.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.000
Hey guys--got back.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.640
Just tried out the PIC Citronella Plus Wristband.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Initially, this band is actually a little hard to put on yourself.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Because it needs this little tab where you stick it into the hole.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.800
But it's not impossible.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Here, let me try that again.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Yeah... it's a little bit hard to put on.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I got lucky the first time.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In terms of effectiveness, I actually got a bite right here on the back.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Granted--I don't know--I might need to put one on my shoulder.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But... then it won't even fit.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And initially too--this didn't really have a strong smell,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.520
even when I opened the package.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It might be because it leaks out of the cardboard backing.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This actually was not very effective.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
PIC, if you're listening to this, you might want to consider stronger packaging to seal in the citronella oil.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'd recommend a different product.
