00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:01.967
The President: All good.

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:02.967
Well, it was wonderful to
have

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:05.033
America's governors in town.

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:08.533
And Michelle and I look
forward to hosting with

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:13.700
their spouses our annual
governor's reception

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.767
here and dinner.

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.367
And it's always a great
opportunity to exchange

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:18.633
ideas and hear what's
happened

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.300
at the local level.

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:24.233
Today, we did bring out
democratic governors

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:28.100
to the White House to spend
some time talking about

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.934
a couple issues that are
critical importance

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.834
to our constituencies and, I
think, to the county.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:37.467
And one of those is the
issue of the minimum wage

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.900
and what we can do to
give America a raise.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.000
Many of he governors in
this room are pushing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.367
to raise their state minimum
wages to benefit more

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.767
working families and help
to grow their economies --

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:52.767
like Governors
Abercrombie,

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:58.000
Governor Inslee, Governor
Malloy, and Governor O'Malley,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.767
by Governor Patrick, Governor
Quinn --

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:02.734
all focused on this in their
State of the State addresses.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:06.166
And in my State of the
Union Address, obviously,

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.500
I promised that I would do
what I could

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.200
as the head of the executive
branch

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.800
of the federal government and have already signed

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.300
an executive order saying that if you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.734
want to do business with the
federal government as a federal

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:21.367
contractor, then you need to be

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:24.867
paying your employees $10.10 an hour.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:29.367
We don't want somebody who
is washing dishes

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.934
for our troops or helping in
some ways to care for them

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.600
to be living in poverty when
they're working full-time.

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:40.433
And what we've discovered
in looking at this issue

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.767
is that, increasingly,
businesses recognize that

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:45.367
raising wages for their
employees

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:50.734
is a smart business decision
because they end up having lower

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:52.200
turnover rates, higher
productivity, higher

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.900
morale, folks stay longer
and are more focused

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.333
on the job, rather than
having to worry about

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.734
whether or not they can
pay their bills

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:06.266
at the end of the month.

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:10.233
And, you know, this is
not just good policy.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.100
It also happens to be
good politics,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.166
because the truth of the matter
is, is the overwhelming majority

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.800
of Americans think that
raising that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400
raising the minimum wage
is a good idea.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.066
That is true for
Independents.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.567
That is true
for Democrats.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:29.333
And it's true
for Republicans.

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.400
So, in fact, where we've
seen some of these issues

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.333
going to referendum -- for
example,

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:36.233
in New Jersey -- even though the
Republican governor opposed it,

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:40.300
it passed by 60 percent.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.834
And the reason that
this is important is not

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:48.400
because everybody is going
to be benefiting from

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.300
a hike in the minimum wage.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.033
The truth is, is that most
working Americans make

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:54.967
more than the
minimum wage already.

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:57.900
But people, I think,
instinctually understand

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.934
that part of what this
county should be about

00:02:59.934 --> 00:03:01.400
is if you're working hard
and taking responsibility,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.934
that you can get ahead
-- and that you can look

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:04.667
after your family.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:07.033
And raising the minimum
wage will help

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.800
up to 16 million Americans.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.100
And that's a big deal.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.567
And that could give a
boost

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:15.900
to our economy as a whole.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.100
So, I'm going to continue
to press congress

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.100
to pass a federal minimum wage
bill that goes

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.033
up to $10.10 an hour.

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:27.000
Being sponsored currently

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.567
by Senators Harkin and Representatives Miller.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:35.400
I'm going to be seeking
Republicans who are game

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.200
to work with us and
prepare to work

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.100
with us on this issue.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.000
As I said in the State
of the Union,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.700
it's not something that requires
a big bureaucracy and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.600
doesn't require a lot
of federal spending.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.266
All it requires is for us
to stake out a claim

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:52.166
on behalf of American workers
that's consistent with our

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:53.367
values as a nation.

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:56.500
And I'm going to be
interested in hearing the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.433
efforts of the governors
in this room to see what

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:02.333
they can do to make sure
that America gets a raise.

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:03.900
So, I appreciate
their presence.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.233
We've got a lot of other
issues on the plate, but I

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:07.333
wanted to highlight that
one, because I think

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:10.667
it's something that is on a lot
of people's minds --

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.834
how can we boost people's
incomes and wages

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.667
if they're working hard so
they can --

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:16.734
they can get ahead.

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:18.033
Thank you so
much, everybody.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:18.934
Thank you guys.
