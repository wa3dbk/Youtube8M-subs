00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.980
Welcome To G-TV!

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.580
Today I will be showing you Eaton’s Moeller
line FAZ Series Miniature Circuit Breakers.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.340
FAZ Series are available in one, two and three
pole configurations with 20 different current

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.160
ratings ranging from 0.5 amps to 40 amps.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.140
All breakers are available in both C and D
tripping curves, offering protection from

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.330
5 to 10 and 10 to 20 times the continuous
rating of the device.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:45.510
The two and three pole devices can be used
in solidly grounded circuits up to 480 volts

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.510
AC.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.080
The full line of these circuit breakers offer
short circuit ratings of 10 kilo-amps regardless

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.790
of the applied voltage.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.290
All breakers mount on standard 35mm DIN-rail.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.820
Bus Connectors and Feeder Terminals facilitate
mounting and wiring of multiple miniature

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.940
circuit breaker arrays in control panel assemblies.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.520
Power to the circuit breakers can also be
fed from the line or load side.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.160
A color coded red/green indicator provides
immediate visual indication of the device

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.520
status and isolation function.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.990
All FAZ breakers incorporate a trip free mechanism
and prevent the trip function from being defeated

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.000
by holding the operator in the ON position.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.560
They also have a bimetal trip assembly, providing
overload protection through a broad range

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.170
of ambient temperatures.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.259
FAZ branch circuit breakers are UL listed
and CSA certified for fuseless protection

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.280
of smaller AWG 18 and 16 conductors.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:59.450
The devices comply with UL 489 and CSA 22.2
No. 5-02, meeting the requirements for Molded

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.340
Case Circuit Breakers.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.009
These devices also comply with IEC 60947-2
and are CE compliant.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.590
Eaton’s Moeller line FAZ Series Miniature
Circuit Breakers along with thousands of other

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.290
products and services are available at Galco.com.
