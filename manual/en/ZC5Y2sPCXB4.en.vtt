Hi my name is Adam Bowling. I'm representing
the Christian Martial Arts Association. On

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.690
behalf of Expert Village, I'm here to talk
to you about the Five Animal Forms of Kung

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.769
Fu. Okay, we're going to talk now about aspects
of the dragon style. Dragon Stylist would

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:26.919
have been probably the biggest person in a
group to do this style. The style is characterized

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.390
by lots of traps, trapping the arm. Your modern
day grappler would probably be considered

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:44.550
more of a Dragon Stylist. Dragon Stylists
were not very fast so they have to be elusive.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.250
A dragon would never come at you in a direct
line. Most of the time the dragon would always

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.120
move in angles. If you look at a lizard's
footprints in the sand, they're all diagonal.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.900
But they would be going in a straight direction
so that the image for whatever that lizard's

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.679
prey is, is that he's going to the right,
and then he's going to the left and not straight.

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:18.069
But before the prey figures that out is too
late. A lot of times a Dragon Stylist would

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:28.850
move blocking, trapping the arm, striking,
moving, turning the knee, striking, inverting

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:38.539
the fist, blocking, turning, stepping, stepping,
stepping, moving so that I'm not coming at

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:49.220
you with a straight line. I'm moving at you
in angles, and all is wanting to strike on

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.349
the outside or the inside of the centerline.
Sometimes striking center, most of the time

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:06.859
striking angles, the cause of the low speed.
This is what typified a Dragon Style.
