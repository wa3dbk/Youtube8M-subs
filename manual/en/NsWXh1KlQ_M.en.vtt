00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.560
So, we're going to be doing some cornrows
with extensions on Ashley's hair, my little

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.440
sister. And I justed wanted to, I told you
guys a little bit about some of the tools

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.420
you're going to need, some of the rubber bands
that you're going to need. Here is some of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.820
the hair that we're going to be adding to
Ashley's beautiful hair. And so if you've

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.590
noticed I've really, I've done a good job
at picking a good match for Ashley. That's

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.630
not always the case though. You may not always
want something that's going to be her exact

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.300
match. I mean you see I have some streaks
in my hair. You could also do sometimes the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.310
same thing with extensions. You can add some
of the same natural hair color and then go

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.550
for different color. Some different lighter
browns or even some blonds to add into the

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.579
hair. And that can be a lot of fun, too. But
today we're just going to keep it simple.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.850
And we've picked a color that matches Ashley's
hair. So what I'm going to do, Ashley wants

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.120
not a long, long pony tail, but what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take this tuft of hair

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.640
and I'm going to get it ready to cut right
down the middle. Because that's an actually

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.061
really, really long, long braid. And so I'm
going to cut it in half like so with my hair

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:14.590
scissors. And part of it's still attached
to the rubber band. I'm going to set it over

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.770
here for just a second. And we need to organize
and basically figure out how thick we want

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.100
these different braids. I've decided that
we're only going to do maybe about 8 to 10

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.850
braids all over Ashley's hair to put it in
the pony tail. And so I need about 8 to 10

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.860
of these tufts separated like that. And so
to organize it I have my tub over here and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.990
I'm going to lay them on the tub. 1, 2, and
they're fairly thick as you can see. 3, okay.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.720
I'm going to keep them fairly thick so that
when I braid them into Ashley's hair she's

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.660
going to have a good amount of hair to work
with. Okay and so we'll get started there

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.250
in just a minute. So organize yourself first.
And then you'll be that much happier because

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.160
if you get going and you're not organized
and you don't have the hair laying out and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.549
ready to go you're going to have to stop what
you're doing and sometimes that's not very

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:13.969
fun so.
