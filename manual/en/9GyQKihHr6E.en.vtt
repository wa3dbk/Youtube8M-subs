00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.720
Hi. I'm Alan Lightner with Expert Village.
We're talking about the role of the different

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.169
instruments in the steel drum family and how
they function in a traditional setting, if

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:19.000
you're playing with a full steel band with
a full range of instruments, how the various

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.900
instruments fit. The next one we're going
to talk about is the double second, the double

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.890
second. We've already spoken about the tinner
pan and the double tinner pan, now we're going

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.620
to move to the double seconds pan which is
the instrument that I have right here in front

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:42.960
of me now. This range, the range on this pan
is very similar to the double tinner. Occasionally

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.940
double seconds go a little bit lower. Some
double seconds start at this low "f", which

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.710
is just where the double tinner start. Sometimes
even an "f" sharp or "g", depending upon who

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.020
made it and then when they made it. My particular
pans go a little lower. They go to "e", go

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.050
down to this low "e" below that "f". That's
where the double tinner started. This "e"

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.250
is where my double seconds start, this particular
set, other sets may be a little different.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.950
The role of the double second in a steel band
is to also support melody occasionally, but

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:29.960
more importantly I would say, and more often
to play chords and rhythm. To function as

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.819
the guitar player in what we might think of
in a normal kind of pop situation. They're

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.679
going to support some, some melodic ideas,
but mostly it's for the harmony and the rhythm.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:48.759
There are specific patterns that double seconds
players play in Calypso and Soca music, which

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.299
is generally the music that comes from Trinidad,
where the steel bands play. I'm going to demonstrate

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:02.119
some of those now. I'll start with the first
one and give you a chance to practice that.

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.679
And we'll use that same little melody that
we've been using. That little "f" scale melody.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:18.140
And I'll use it down low where a double seconds
player would play it. That might be that range.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.670
If a double seconds player was going to harmonize
that, he might play this chord first, then

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.920
this chord, then this chord and move back
to the first chord. I don't want to talk so

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.890
much about the chords. What I'd like to talk
about is the rhythm. The rhythm that we're

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:50.650
going to play on those chords. So, typically,
if that music was going, we've got one, two,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.600
one, two, three, four, one.
