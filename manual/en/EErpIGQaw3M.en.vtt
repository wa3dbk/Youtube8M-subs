So if you guys watched our
Minecraft and EDU episode

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.706
from a couple weeks
ago, you'll remember

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:06.340
that we mentioned something
called MinecraftEdu made

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.740
by Minecraft Teacher, aka
Joel Levin, who we happen

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.990
to have in the studio today.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.370
So I'm really curious about the
moment at which you were like,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.230
OK.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.020
The aha moment?

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.130
Yeah, like I'm a teacher.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.747
I'm going to teach
using Minecraft.

00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:22.580
JOEL LEVIN: Minecraft
is just this rare game

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.225
that kids of all ages
really enjoy playing.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:25.830
MIKE RUGNETTA:
Right, right, right.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.590
JOEL LEVIN: And
both boys and girls.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.620
It was over summer
break, 2010, I think.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.140
I was playing an alpha
version of Minecraft

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.810
with my daughter, who was not
even quite five at the time.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.310
She learned to spell her first
word because of Minecraft.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.820
Oh, what was it?

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.511
She wanted to know how to
teleport herself back home.

00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:42.010
OK.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.980
And you had to type /HOME.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.440
So like what are the things
that you teach using Mine--

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.659
like what are the subjects?

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.200
JOEL LEVIN: I tend
to teach just sort

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.300
of digital citizenship,
the idea of how

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.490
we treat each other online.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.670
What I'll do is I'll put the
kids in these little situations

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.630
where they have
to work together.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.130
And maybe there's
limited resources,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.490
or I often set different groups
of kids with competing goals.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.802
And I've never found
a better motivator

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:05.010
to get the kids to learn
how to do their own research

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.510
on the internet than Minecraft.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.380
But that's just me
in my own classroom.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.620
There's teachers having kids
fly through 3D models of cells.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.310
There's teachers having the
kids fly around the world,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.410
collect a lot of data, and then
represent that data in graphs.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.040
One of the problems that a
lot of people have identified,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920
and I had trouble sort
of seeing past myself,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.145
was that, well, Minecraft isn't
a very realistic simulation

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:24.686
of the world.

00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:25.310
Right.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.950
Everything's in a block.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.490
Yeah.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.710
And sometimes you
cut down a tree

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.850
and, you know, the block doesn't
fall, that kind of thing.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.950
But what a lot of science
teachers are doing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310
is they're having kids map
the physics of this world.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.127
And where is it the
same as the real world?

00:01:36.127 --> 00:01:37.210
And where is it different?

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.410
MIKE RUGNETTA: OK.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.993
JOEL LEVIN: And they're having
the kids design the experiments

00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:41.390
to chart this different.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.260
It's teaching the scientific
method using Minecraft.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.665
I feel like there's
this criticism of things

00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:49.330
like teaching using Minecraft
and maybe game-based learning,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.930
in general.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.885
I don't think that
game-based learning

00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:54.250
is going to-- should supplant
any traditional learning

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.750
methods.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.630
What it's about for me
is using a teaching tool

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.214
that is really
relevant to these kids.

00:01:59.214 --> 00:02:00.879
When they're in the
moment, when they're

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.470
in the game, when
they're in a world

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.700
that I've created block
by block, surrounded

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580
by content that I
want them to learn,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.880
I have never had such access to
the brains of these children.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.410
And it's been really rewarding
for me professionally.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.577
And the science is starting
to catch up with this.

00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:18.160
It's been really fascinating to
see some early work being done

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.310
to prove that there
is a direct connection

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.020
between this increased
engagement and the amount

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.832
of information that
children are retaining.

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:26.290
So if there are
teachers out there

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.289
who want to get started
teaching with Minecraft,

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.170
what is the-- what's
like the first step?

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.461
What's the thing you recommend?

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.605
Well, they can go to my
website, minecraftedu.com,

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.790
and we have some
materials to get

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.639
started and some
ideas for things

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.680
you can do with the game.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.620
So I think that's
everything that we

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.600
have to ask for right now.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.140
Joel, I want to thank you
so much for coming in.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.639
Absolutely.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.630
And for everybody
who's interested in Joel

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.092
and his work, we'll put a bunch
of links in the description

00:02:47.092 --> 00:02:48.092
so you can check it out.

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:49.460
It's amazing.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.160
Thank you.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.210
