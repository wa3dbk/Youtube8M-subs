00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.720
Today I'm going to show you how to remove water spots, and light swirls and scratches using the new

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.380
VSS Scratch &amp; Swirl Remover.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.860
It happened again: I was parked in the lot in front of work and got hit with the sprinklers

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.060
on a sunny day, and the water spots got etched in pretty bad all over the back of my car.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.260
I have a lot of water spots already etched into the paint.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.460
I did a test spot over here and found the clay bar takes off a lot of what's on the car right now,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.000
but the sun already started to burn and etch some of the spots in around the top.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.160
I'm going to show you how to remove etched water spots using a machine polisher and the new VSS.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.680
First things first, I need to clay the area.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.380
So I'll take my clay bar.. I'm using the Chemical Guys OG Clay Bar.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:01:03.000
It's yellow, and is a good all-around bar for removing light to moderate levels of contamination.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.620
A water spot is the minerals left over after a droplet of water evaporates.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.700
I don't know what is in these pipes out in front of work, but it's nasty!

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.560
It stains pretty bad, and if I left this for another day in the sun, it would have etched permanently.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560
It's good I'm getting on this right now.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.840
I'm using some P40 Quick Detail Spray as a clay bar lubricant.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.420
If you want to learn more about the clay bar service, like what it does and how it works,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.380
you can check out the rest of our YouTube channel.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.080
Top tip: Keep your clay in a box or container so that it stays clean.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.860
Once you drop your clay bar, or it gets dirty, you have to throw it away!

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.720
I'll wipe this area down with a towel.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600
I'm using a Workhorse microfiber towel.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.140
It's already looking a lot better.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.980
I took off most of the water spots from the tailgate,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.060
but up here where it gets exposed to more sun, it's already begun to etch into the paint.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.600
If you take your swirl-finder light, and point it directly into the paint, look at the reflection of the beam in the paint,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.920
that's how you catch all the swirls and scratches. That's how you use one of these lights.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.100
I'll pull the camera in to show you all the defects and etching left from the water.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.780
The next step we have to do is polishing.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.400
I need to remove some paint to take out these defects.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:04.840
For that I'll use the TORQ 10FX dual action polisher with a Black Optics microfiber pad.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.480
This is the orange microfiber pad, so the microfiber will cut and also finish.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.760
So I can use a one-step pad with the one-step VSS Scratch &amp; Swirl Remover.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:26.160
Now I'll prep this area and polish it to see if I can take out all these water spots, swirls, and scratches.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.240
I'll just spread 4 dots of VSS on the microfiber pad.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.360
I've got some Polishing Pad Conditioner, give it a quick spray.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.120
I'm going to polish this whole area here.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.220
Dab out the polish...

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.780
I'll do the tail light while I'm here...

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:14.360
Click the machine on, it's waiting for me, and I'll click it up to speed setting 1 to spread the polish out.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.120
And now I'll work it up to speed setting 6 to work the polish.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.440
There we go!

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.160
You see I worked the polish in a grid pattern: up and down, then left to right,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:21.680
overlapping each pass from before 50% to ensure even paint removal.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680
I worked until the polish turned clear.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.040
You can see I'm hardly removing anything from the paint.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.640
That's how you know you've actually let the polish work and do it's thing.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.560
You need to let the abrasives break down to get the best results.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.680
All the etched in water spots are gone!

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.400
This looks really good!

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.960
It's great to use a polish like VSS because in one step I can cut aggressively enough

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.240
to remove water spots, swirls, and scratches,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.920
and then it finishes like a fine polish.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.120
Now I get a lustrous finish again without having to switch to another polish.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.160
I don't need to do two steps; I can do it in one step with one polish, and one machine.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.360
If you're doing a two step polish over your whole car, that will take hours and hours

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.840
and you cut that in half by doing just one pass.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:26.760
So I'll come in here with the light to show you all these defects are gone!

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.720
The paint looks unbelievable! It looks really really good.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.440
So I've got a few more spots to finish around the tailgate, wherever I got hit with sprinklers

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.280
like the bottom of the bumper and the rest of the lift gate, and the tail lights.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.840
