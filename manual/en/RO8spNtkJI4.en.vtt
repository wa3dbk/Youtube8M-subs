00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.660
This sweet kitty is going to help us demonstrate
fleas and ticks. So we're going to look for

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.670
fleas on this guy using the flea comb and
combing through from top along the back. He

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.470
has a very thick coat, he's probably an outdoor
cat, so it's a little bit tough getting through

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.970
with this fine flea comb. And I got a bunch
of hair off and we're just going to look and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:31.289
see if there were any, if there is any flea
dirt in there. There is, there were some spots

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.079
there on him but I didn't find any real flea
dirt or any fleas, so we're going to keep

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:49.840
combing just to make sure. He's a really good
guy, letting me comb his belly like this.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.120
And another way to look for fleas is to look
on their bedding and look for little circular

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.850
spiral specks, which are called flea dirt
and if they're if it is actually flea, flea

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.079
feces then it will turn to blood when you
get it wet. And I actually don't see anything

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.409
here, so this guy doesn't have any fleas,
but I know that he does have ticks. And I'm

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:27.229
going to find one along his head here for
you right now. Where it is buddy? Here it

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:35.909
is. Here's a tick that is embedded in this
guy's neck. I don't know if he'll let you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.990
see it. There it is, you can see it's right
in the fur and it's attaching into his skin.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.640
So that tick is pretty small, it's probably
a larval stage and you can actually see it's

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.329
still moving so it's alive. And what we're
going to do is we're just going to take a

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.270
pair of tweezers and remove that for him.
And when you're removing a tick you want to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.250
take your tweezers, try not to catch too much
of the cat's hair in it, and get those tweezers

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.080
right down at the base of the tick and then
just gently pull, so you get the mouth parts.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.000
Some people would, in the old days, we heard
about recommending putting a hot match to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.900
the tick or squeezing the tick, or popping
it. Those things all cause the tick to secrete

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.180
saliva into the cat, and that can spread disease,
so you want to grasp the tick right at its

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.220
mouth part so you sort of close its mouth
as you're pulling it and it can't get that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.530
saliva into the cat.
