Reginaldo, keep cool.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.620
Don't call the police, 
don't call anybody, all right?

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.089
We're with Ms. Lourdes,

and we're gonna mess her up

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.272
if you don't do what 
we're telling you...

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.107
He's asking who Marcia is.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.777

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.112
Cinthia and Fernanda's grandmother.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.314

-- No, from Lorena.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.619

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:53.853
The orange vase...

How are you?

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.665
-- Do you remember me?
-- That's prepaid, hurry up.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:10.904
You went to school with my niece 
Meire in that school downtown...

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.505
With Ismael...

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.475
Calling a closer relative haven't
 crossed your mind, right?

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.010
Oh, I don't have anyone.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.412
I've been alone
 ever since Orestes died.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.047
Give me that. 
Reginaldo, listen up.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.850
I want a hundred grand,
 in hundred bills,

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:27.087
unnumbered, today at 5 P.M.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.689
Of course it's in Rio de Janeiro!
Where do you think I am?

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.159
Londrina? 
Did you make a call to Londrina?

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.861
Shouldn't I?

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:38.898
Reginaldo, just a second.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.702
Are you trying to fuck me up? 
What do you want?

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
He had to move to Londrina
 because of the landslides.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.744
How I am gonna to make money 
out of you, ma'am? Help me.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.847
Do you want me to give you
 my retirement pension?

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:59.586
Reginaldo I'm gonna let
 Ms. Lourdes go, okay?

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.021
Just so you know. 
Damn it.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:07.460
I can come two or three times
 per week to clean up.

No, the house is nice.
But it's way too dusty.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:22.475
It's often full of a white dust, 
I don't know where that comes from.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:31.417
Oh, the fern is all right, 
it's grown a lot, really a lot.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.753
No wonder,
 I'm watering it everyday!
