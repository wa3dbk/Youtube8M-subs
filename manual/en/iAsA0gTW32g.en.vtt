00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:09.780
Now before we record I want you to follow
me and we're going to my transport to my settings

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.190
and I'm going to go to my metronome settings
as we did before and click that and what I'm

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.239
going to do now is set my precount bars and
what your precount bar is is once you arm

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:28.569
your record function or your record button
to start recording your precount bar will

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:36.050
give you so many clicks before it actually
starts recording to kind of get you in the

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.989
rhythm or the groove of the song and I set
my precount bars at one because that is one

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.120
measure. So that would be four beats that
would give us enough time to feel the rhythm

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.270
before the actual recording starts to come
on. Before you record I want to show you how

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.409
that works when I push record you hear the
four clicks and then you see the recording

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.820
actually happen. That's my precount bars,
your four clicks and then it starts recording

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:16.400
to give me time. So now that your precount
bar setting is set now we will start recording.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:26.640
Remember our drum beats will hit on the one
of every measure. So let's start at one, two,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.990
and then so forth. So go ahead and arm with
your records, my record setting, the red button

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.240
or you can push the record here on your mini
track just to arm your record and I push mine

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.930
and I hear my precount setting four, one,
two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:06.950
two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one,
two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Then

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.450
you can stop. Notice I use my Space Bar. This
is one of those quick functions, instead of

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.280
going up here I just use my space bar to stop
it, stop and start and now that you have recorded

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.670
you should see data and as you see I have
little bars here, you should have little bars

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:42.000
showing that your drum sound is recognized
and after you do that we'll go into project

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.650
and we'll quanta size and what quanta sizing
is is lining everything up on beat to where

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.990
everything hits on the one and this is not
really necessary it is just preference if

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.540
you want it to. I'm going to show you how
to also go in there and do it manually or

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.100
some quick quanta size, you can push q it
is a quick setting and some may have it and

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.670
some may not too quickly do it and now you
should have your data.
