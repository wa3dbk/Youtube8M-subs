00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:27.131
At first I was afraid, what could the answer be?
It said given this position find velocity.

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:31.890
So I tried to work it out, but I knew that I was wrong.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.841
I struggled; I cried, "A problem shouldn't take this long!"

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:44.550
I tried to think, control my nerve.
It's evident that speed's tangential to that time-position curve.

00:00:45.423 --> 00:00:48.638
This problem would be mine if I just knew that tangent line.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.449
But what to do? Show me a sign!

00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:55.609
So I thought back to Calculus.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.682
Way back to Newton and to Leibniz,
And to problems just like this.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:05.701
And just like that when I had given up all hope,
I said NO!!

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:08.875
There's just one way to find that slope.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.161
And so now I, I will derive.

00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:16.511
Find the derivative of x position with respect to time.

00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:21.968
It's as easy as can be, just have to take dx/dt.
I will derive

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:25.630
I will derive. Hey, hey!

00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:48.365
And then I went ahead to the second part.
But as I looked at it I wasn't sure quite how to start.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:54.126
It was asking for the time at which velocity
Was at a maximum

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:57.892
And I was thinking "Woe is me."
But then I thought

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:00.102
This much I know

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.621
I've gotta find acceleration, set it equal to zero.

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:08.944
Now if I only knew what the function was for a.

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:14.040
I guess I'm gonna have to solve for it someway.
So I thought back....

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:15.803
To Calculus.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.164
Way back to Newton and to Leibniz,
And to problems just like this.

00:02:21.898 --> 00:02:25.846
And just like that when I had given up all hope,
I said nope...

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.808
There's just one way to find that slope.

00:02:28.862 --> 00:02:32.182
And so now I, I will derive.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.554
Find the derivative of velocity with respect to time.

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:42.005
It's as easy as can be, just have to take dv/dt.
I will derive...

00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:45.859
I will derive...

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.183
So I thought back to Calculus.

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:56.965
Way back to Newton and to Leibniz,
And to problems just like this.

00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:01.996
And just like that when I had given up all hope,
I said nope...

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.787
There's just one way to find that slope!!!

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:08.208
And so now I, I will derive....

00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:12.752
Find the derivative of x position with respect to time.

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:20.122
It's as easy as can be, just have to take dx/dt.
I will derive.... I will derive....

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.623
I will derive!!!!!!!
