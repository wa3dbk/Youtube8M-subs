00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.660
This recipe is a result of me trying out tofu
omelet recipes.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.129
When I tried this recipe from Claire's blog
"Chez Cayenne," I was like...this tastes like

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.129
quiche.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.000
So, I tweaked it a little bit with Claire's
help, added my TVP sausage with a maple twist

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.580
and I had my friend Kim at work taste test
it for me and give me some tips - Thanks Kim!

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.491
So, I really hope you'll like it.

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:26.720
I think you will.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.610
You'll have to try it and tell me what you
think.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.840
Prepare the TVP breakfast sausage first.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.329
Pour 1 cup of water in a pot, along with 2
tablespoons of soy sauce, 1/4 cup maple syrup

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.469
and 8 other spices and seasonings that you
can get by clicking "Show More" in the About

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.530
section below.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.710
Stir it well and once it starts boiling, stir
it one more time, then remove it from the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.370
heat.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.449
Add 1 cup of textured vegetable protein, TVP.

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.590
Mix it well and let it sit for 10 minutes.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.210
After 10 minutes, you'll see that it's absorbed
everything.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600
The next part is all done in a food processor.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.170
Add 2 14 ounce blocks of tofu to the food
processor and blend it until it's relatively

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.189
smooth.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:31.149
Then add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons
of mirin, which is a sweet rice wine.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:39.399
Add 3/4 cup all purpose flour, 1/4 cup nutritional
yeast flakes, 1 teaspoon of baking powder,

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:47.159
1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of each
of these - turmeric, black pepper, garlic

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.299
powder and onion powder.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.450
Blend it all together.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.649
If you don't have a food processor, but you
do have a blender...Go ahead and blend the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.799
tofu in the blender, put it in a bowl and
add the other ingredients and stir it by hand.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.250
It should be just fine.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.220
Scoop it into a bowl and mix in the TVP sausage.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.849
Pour it into an oiled 10 inch pie dish
or something similar.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.120
And bake it for 40 minutes on 400.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.150
You'll notice that it puffs up in the oven
and falls as it cools, so don't get worried

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.010
if you see it do this.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.421
Let it cool for at least 15 minutes so it
can firm up a bit before you cut it.

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.410
I let mine cool for 30 minutes this time.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.300
I think this is a recipe that you should try.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.580
You could even leave out the sausage too and
it's really good.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580
I swear it tastes like quiche.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.110
It's a really good recipe thats you can kind
of use as a base and make it your own.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.680
Add whatever you want to it.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.430
I think it's going to be good.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.190

to yours in the comments!
