00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.160
Hey guys this is Austin. Is a $100 tablet
worth it?

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.530
Packing a quad core processor, seven inch
IPS display and full Windows 8.1, the HP Stream

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.450
7 looks like a serious competitor coming in
at just under $100. Jump over to the Android

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.090
side and you’ve got the Asus MeMo Pad 7.
Internally it’s very similar but it comes

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.190
in a sleeker design and is running Android
4.4 Kit Kat. While Android on tablets is nothing

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.469
new being able to run full Windows 8.1 on
a $100 tablet is a big deal, not even counting

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:10.090
the included one year Office 365 subscription
which is nearly worth the entire cost of the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.590
tablet on its’ own. What’s most impressive
is just how well everything runs, resolution

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.060
and specs aren’t too far off from a lot
of laptops so doing things like browsing the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.889
web is downright snappy. There are quite a
few decent apps in the Windows Store but you

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:26.460
can also download normal programs like Chrome
and VLC. The biggest bottleneck is the single

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.319
gigabyte of RAM which while it’s fine for
most Windows 8 apps can be a real problem

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.170
when you’re using the normal desktop. Having
the option to use that desktop is a big plus

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.109
for me but at the end of the day this is still
a PC with all the pros and cons that come

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.219
along with that. The MeMo Pad gives you a
much more traditional tablet experience with

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.569
Android Kit Kat. Asus has their Zen UI skin
on it but thankfully it’s not intrusive,

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.420
you’re getting a close to stock experience
which is impressively smooth. It slows down

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.209
a bit when multitasking but in normal use
the Atom is more than fast enough to keep

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.200
up. Android has quickly become a great option
for smaller tablets like this and you’ll

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.520
find a wide variety of apps including Netflix,
YouTube and Kindle. While both tablets are

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.760
about the same thickness the MeMo Pad feels
much nicer in the hand with a tapered edge.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.640
It reminds me a lot of the Nexus 7 in design
which is a good thing, it’s usable in one

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.640
hand without being too heavy or slippery.
It does take a bit to get used to the power

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.810
button being below the volume rocker but it’s
not a big deal. On the other hand the Stream

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.770
7 can’t quite measure up. It’s not really
much thicker but it’s squared off and quite

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.680
a bit heavier making it a bit more awkward
in the hand. Unlike the color options of the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.080
MeMo Pad the Stream is made out of a fairly
cheap feeling black plastic. Turn both tablets

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.470
on however and things are much closer. They
both sport seven inch screens with resolutions

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.980
of 1280 by 800 which is more than good enough
at this price point. You can use either completely

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.810
happily but the display on the Stream is the
real surprise. While there’s some backlight

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.050
bleed the colors are vibrant and the viewing
angles are solid. The MeMo Pad might not quite

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.250
match up but Asus includes an app called Splendid
to really fine tune the colors on the panel

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.130
which is an awesome inclusion. One area where
there’s no competition is in speaker quality.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.610
The Stream has a single speaker which is not
only quiet but very tinny.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.160
On the other hand the MeMo Pad sounds perfectly
fine, miles better than the Stream. While

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.230
the display on the Stream is nicer the hardware
of the MeMo Pad really does feel like a step

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.230
above anything you would expect to find at
this price point. Inside both tablets are

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.960
rocking a quad core Intel Atom paired with
1GB of RAM and in Geekbench they match up

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.010
nicely with the Nexus 7 and aren’t too far
behind the HP Stream 13 laptop. In the graphics

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.380
department it’s the same story, these are
about as fast as it gets for a seven inch

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.620
tablet not even considering price. The Stream
comes with 32GB of storage compared to sixteen

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.090
on the MeMo Pad however Windows eats up a
lot of that with only 15GB of free space out

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.510
of the box. Both sport MicroSD card slots
to expand the storage however it’s hidden

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.240
behind the back cover on the Stream which
is incredibly frustrating to try to pry off.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.050
The biggest area where the budget prices are
noticeable is in the memory. While 1GB of

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.069
RAM is fine for Android it’s really doesn’t
quite cut it for Windows. You’ll run into

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.069
occasional slowdowns and crashing especially
with desktop applications that really aren’t

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.840
meant to run on such little RAM on the Stream.
It’s definitely not a dealbreaker but for

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.560
games like Minecraft it becomes a real bottleneck…well
that and the lack of a keyboard or mouse.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.500
The MeMo Pad is easier to work with for gaming
as basically any Android game should work

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.000
fine. You don’t quite have the same flexibility
as on the Stream but it’s more than good

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.160
enough for some casual gaming. While having
full Windows on a $100 tablet is awesome I

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.400
would spend a little bit of extra money to
get the MeMo Pad, it’s just a better tablet

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.010
overall. So what do you guys think, would
you ever pick up a $100 tablet? Definitely

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.720
be sure to let me know in the comments below!
Anyway guys thank you so much for watching

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.660
and I will catch you in the next one.
