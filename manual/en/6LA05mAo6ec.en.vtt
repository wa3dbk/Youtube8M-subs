00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:10.344
Hi, here i have the Sigma 
17-50mm lens...

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:12.554
which has a constant aperture of
f/2.8.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.681
Let's see it more in detail.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.893
The lens covers a zoom range of 
17 to 50mm.

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.792
It has a maximum constant 
aperture of f/2.8.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:23.899
It measures 9x8cm.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.000
And it uses 77mm filters.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:30.239
It belongs to Sigma's EX line...

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.658
so it has a solid finish and 
construction

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:37.663
and it features Sigma's Optical 
Stabilization system.

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:41.208
Its large front element doesn't 
rotate when zooming...

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:44.962
so it can use any type of 
filters without problems.

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:49.800
And it has a minimum focus 
distance of 28cm.

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:58.000
On the back it has a good 
quality metal EF mount.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.733
Its focus ring it's very fluid 
and smooth...

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.779
and it has hard stops but a very
short range of movement.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:16.000
This can difficult subtle focus 
changes when recording.

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:23.667
Its f/2.8 aperture works well in
most situations.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:28.964
But in low light conditions it's
better to use some fill light.

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:35.596
In this example we use an on 
camera LED light and the change 
in quality is very apparent.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:39.850
It's excellent as a walk around 
lens thanks to its zoom range...

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.439
which covers the most common 
focal lengths fast and easily.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.194
With cameras like the Canon T3i,
the lens usability grows thanks 
to the digital zoom mode...

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:56.751
that extends its range from 17mm
up to 150mm without degrading 
the image quality.

00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:04.000
This is perfect for events because
it covers any possible situation.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
These are examples of what 
can be achieved with the lens
in different productions.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:29.608
One nice detail is that Sigma's 
EX lenses always come with a 
lens hood and protective case

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:34.000
specifically designed for each 
lens in the set.

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:47.376
The Sigma 17-50mm it's an 
excellent choice to replace your
kit lens.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:53.090
Plus, its constant aperture is 
very recommended for shooting 
DSLR video.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.385
It's one of the lenses we use 
the most in our productions...

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.637
because combined with the Canon 
T3i's zoom mode it

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:02.000
works great for any situation 
that may arise.
