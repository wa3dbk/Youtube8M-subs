00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:06.720
Another reason why you may not need the most
megapixels that you can buy is because shooting

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.140
an image at a higher resolution actually takes
up a lot more space on your memory card. So,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.599
a great thing about these compact digital
cameras is you don't have to always shoot

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.720
at the high end of the resolution. On my camera
you can actually choose if you want the large,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:31.060
medium or small size image, which is the number
of pixels. You can also decide if you want

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:41.929
it to be very superfine, normal, or just fine.
You can choose how visible the pixels are

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:48.309
in the image. Every time you shoot a picture
you can decide to change that resolution.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.610
So if you're just shooting a bunch of snapshots
that you know won't be bigger than 4x6, you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.199
can go ahead and shoot it in the medium, normal
size, and you're going to still get a great

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.320
print. Or, if you know you are going to be
shooting a bunch of pictures that are just

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.890
going to be used on the web, you know that
you can scale it down and shoot a much lower-resolution

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.430
image, which means on your 1 gigabyte memory
card you are going to be able to take twice

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.530
as many pictures at this lower resolution
as you will at the higher resolution. The

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.170
way that the camera saves these pictures is,
the format is called JPEG, which just means

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.920
'joint photographic experts group'. This just
means that a group of people got together

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.740
and tried to standardize the way that images
are compressed. It is the most widely used

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.720
method of compression. One of the side-effect
of it is, if you save your image multiple

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.110
times, you can actually start to lose data.
JPEG is considered a loss-y compression format.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.110
There are other formats that you can use,
and if you are more savvy, you could save

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.990
it in Photoshop or use TIF files or the Photoshop
files. But the JPEG is the most widely used,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.130
and it's great for web and it's fantastic
if you don't do a lot of editing and resaving

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.009
your image, and you can still get great pictures
with it. The bottom line really is, for $100

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.360
or $200 you can get a fantastic camera. You
don't need to spend the $500 for the more

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.390
megapixels unless you were going to consistently
print 8x10 photographs, or if you're often

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.280
going in and cropping very in close in on
pictures, then you'll need to keep that resolution

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.790
a little bit higher.
