00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Hyorin starts the morning meal .

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.200
Lego, you like the smell of raw meat right?!

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
(Surprised) Does your cat eat raw meat?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.200
Yeah only that cat likes meat.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200
(Certainly) But that's a wild cat(Lynx)!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.200
I am a cat!

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200
The food, let's see.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
While the mom is making rice.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.200
I'll have a taste in the kitchen

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.200
Seriously, the cat is the owner.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Mouse toy

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
Settling the rice.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
What are the kids doing?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
The paradise in earth.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.200
Bang!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
The cat is nervous for the cooked rice.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.200
Today the menu is  kimchi stew with pork.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.200
Hyorin unnie cooks a lot alone.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
She takes out enough meat to eat.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.200
She filled with cold water.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
What are you doing?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
I'm making Kimchi stew

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
For a single person, Hyorin is making a lot of kimchi stew.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Carefully removing the foam .

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200
Woah I'm hungry!!

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200
Adding the kimchi to the boiling water.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200
H: It looks delicious!

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
Saying that it looks delicious is nonsense.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
You really shoudn't say it.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200
This soup looks like it has no flavor (unseasoned soup)

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200
No oppa, it's good...

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
Is that cat hair?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Ashamed.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200
While Hyorin unnie was living with us,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
(Member's clothes) when all the washed clothes were collected

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.200
The underwear was full of cat hair

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200
(And the members) All shared the cat hair

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.200
(Chemistry) I am missing a lot of hair too;

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200
(Ulkeok): Do not tell us your hair story.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.200
The stew is boiling.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200
H: Children! Meow.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
H: Ok, i know, mother will cut fast.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
The tree siblings' nail cutting cicle.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
H: Hmm you don't want to. Please don't mom.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
(Doesn't want to) Whining                                                                        Bang!

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200
H: Exactly, you're getting annoyed my child.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200
H: Oh my child doesn't want to.
(Skillful hand movements)

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200
In between completing nail clipping

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200
H: Thank you.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200
H: Thank you my child (Expecting)

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200
(My next in order) Oops!

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
She caught him.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200
Raising the three siblings is a busy job.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.200
H: This boy shouldn't be so sensitive.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.200
Is it difficult for you? To live as a boy?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200
If you're so sensitive how do you live?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200
A cat doesn't talk over other cat's back.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200
Doesn't want to trim the nails.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200
H: Oh you're so nice!

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
The toe nail's trimming is finished.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200
H: Ah so pretty!!!

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200
It seems like it's going to get married

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200
She's trying to raise it.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200
H: It's war, war

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.200
There are some nails remaining on the floor after the war

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200
(Clean)  Immediately process

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200
H: What are you doing pushing and sucking?

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
H: I'm asking again.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200
Love and war with the three siblings.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.200
(This time) Cleaning the bathroom

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200
H: Move please.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200
Time to clean

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.200
H: This isn't interesting.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200
(While the Empire Strikes Back) Taking out the firm sand from the toilet

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200
What is that?      H: Poop

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200
At this level she's the butler, butler

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.200
I think Lego is the person that hired her.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200
The cat is the boss.The boss.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.200
H: I'm the cats' butler

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.200
H: Aaaah even your poop is cute.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200
 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200
(Kimchi Stew) H: Hmm a delicious smell, delicious smell.I'm hungry.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
The poop is eliminated yet the appetite remains.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200
