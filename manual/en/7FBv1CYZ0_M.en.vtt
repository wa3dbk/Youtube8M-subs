00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
WHY IS WINTER SO COLD?

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:17.482
Brrr.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:19.383
It is so cold.

00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:21.273
I am freezing.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:22.741
Look!

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.587
It has started snowing.

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:27.051
Oh no.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.104
Now we won’t be able to go out.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.026
I don’t like winters.

00:00:32.047 --> 00:00:36.450
I love summers as it is nice and warm.

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:41.413
I don’t know why winters have to be so cold.

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:44.540
That’s because

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.472
the Earth is tilted away from the sun.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.022
Earth is tilted?

00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:52.951
I don’t understand.

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.247
Tiger,

00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:57.808
Get me the globe from the classroom here.

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:00.874
Can you see how this globe is tilted?

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:03.305
Well,

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:06.344
during summer the northern part of the earth

00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:07.712
faces the sun

00:01:07.712 --> 00:01:10.493
so we get sunlight and it is warm.

00:01:16.982 --> 00:01:19.935
As the earth rotates round the sun,

00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:23.182
the northern part tilts away from the sun.

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:25.202
During winter,

00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:28.169
this part does not face the sun directly

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:30.892
and it is harder for the rays of the sun

00:01:30.892 --> 00:01:31.756
to reach us.

00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:34.958
That is why it is chilly during winter.

00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:43.288
Brrrr.

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:46.208
No wonder we haven’t seen sunlight

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:48.690
for so many days.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.476
Wish I could fix the earth in one place.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.826
But you know,

00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:56.106
the thought of sunny days

00:01:56.237 --> 00:01:58.411
manages to keep me warm.
