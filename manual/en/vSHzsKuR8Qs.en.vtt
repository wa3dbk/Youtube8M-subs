00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.790
Today on this 1998 Dodge Ram 2500 2WD we are
going to install part number F2071 from Firestone,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.670
the Ride-Rite Suspension System.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.480
Before we start our install on the truck we
need to do some pre-assembly on our table

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.490
of some components.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.619
To begin our assembly we are going to use
these main components.

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.710
This bracket is going to get bolted to the
frame itself, obviously the air bag itself.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.900
Take our little covers off.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.040
What is going to happen is the bracket is
going to sit on top of the air bag just like

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.040
that.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.860
Then we will take two flange lock nuts and
run them down tight right now.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.380
:40
We will run them until they stop, about a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.280
quarter turn is all you will need.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.700
At this point you want to double check your
torque ratings and check your bolts too.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:14.210
Next we are going to install our angle brass
part here, it is like an angle pipe.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:26.500
We are going to run it 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:43.159
down 
to where the sealant goes into the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:57.870
threads 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.240
of the airbag itself.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:22.690
Then we are going to use a 1/2 inch wrench
just to tighten it up.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:03:17.010
Looks like we are good to go there, lets 
flip this assembly over and tighten this bolt

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:33.680
finger tight until it stops.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:51.250
We are 
going 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:12.349
to have 
to adjust this on 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:48.039
our spring.

00:04:48.039 --> 00:05:54.349
Certain vehicles may need 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:42.770
it to 
move 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:07:13.159
it one way or another, and 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:40.659
even flip it around 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:54.429
to 

00:07:54.429 --> 00:08:04.129
get the alignment you need.

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:05.819
