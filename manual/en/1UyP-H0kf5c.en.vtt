00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.120
Today we are installing hitch number V81590
on a 1998 Toyota Tacoma pickup.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.330
Step one is to remove the bolts that are holding
the arm on the frame here.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:24.109
This will allow us easier access up into the
frame.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.789
For the hitch installation we will have to
remove the bumper brackets from the vehicle.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.430
That will require us to remove these 2 bolts
here.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.411
Then there are 2 more that are attaching the
bumper brackets.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:41.699
In the instructions they say to remove these
2 bolts and loosen the other two that are

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:42.699
attaching the bumper.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:51.250
We are going to just go ahead and remove those
bolts it makes it just a little easier to

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.230
get the hitch brackets into place.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.260
When removing the bumper make sure you disconnect
the license plate lights otherwise you will

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.200
rip the wires

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:23.170
Once we remove the bolts we can go ahead and
take the bracket off of the frame.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:33.110
Now that the bracket is removed we will go
ahead and put the spacer into position.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.590
Just set it inside the channel with the long
arm up then we are going to line it up with

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.829
the existing holes horizontal and vertically.

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:49.000
Now that we have the spacer block into position
we want to go ahead and re attach the arm

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.700
that we removed from the hitch earlier.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.350
In this instance I am using the driver side
just want to put it up into position and put

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.570
this horizontal tab in line with the hole
in the frame.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:15.250
We want to use the 1/2 inch by 1-3/4 bolt
provided along with the washer.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:25.099
Then attach that with the nut they provided
as well.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:35.870
I went ahead and hand tightened the bracket
here to the frame with the provided bolt.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:54.340
If you can see all 3 holes 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:21.480
align 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:37.659
from 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:04:02.549
the arm 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:19.790
to 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:29.010
the frame 
and the bracket.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:54.190
In doing so 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:56.440
we are going to want to add the bumper bracket
as well.
