00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.760
Today I will be making mirchi ka salan.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.720
A popular Hyderabadi dish.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.040
Generally speaking, Hyderabadi dishes are very spicy and aromatic

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.320
and this is one of them.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.180
Even the name of this dish mirchi ka salan reflects that.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.440
Mirch is pepper and salan is curry.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.100
The chilli pepper is cooked with peanut

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.040
and coconut spicy gravy taste delicious.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.980
This goes well with biryani or plain rice.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.000
This recipe will serve 4.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.770
To make mirchi ka salan we will need:

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.300
8 anaheim peppers

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.180
I am using these peppers because they are very mild.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.160
I have already washed, dried and removed the stems.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.700
And vertically slit them.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.990
1/4 cup of coconut powder

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.580
About 3 tablespoons of raw peanuts

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.180
2 tablespoons of sesame seeds

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.100
And 1.5 tablespoons of besan (Bengal gram flour)

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.360
4 tablespoons oil

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.420
1 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.680
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds (rai)

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.260
1/2 teaspoon kalonji (nigella seeds)

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.480
2 teaspoons finely shredded ginger (adarak)

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.130
1 teaspoon red chilli powder

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.260
1/2 teaspoon turmeric (haldi)

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.460
2 teaspoons salt

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.060
1 tablespoon sugar

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.920
About 3/4 teaspoon of garam masala

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.600
1 tablespoon tamarind paste

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.940
I have soaked the tamarind and squeezed the paste.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.640
This is a very simple recipe.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.660
First I will stir fry the pepper

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.740
then grind the peanuts, sesame seeds and coconut.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.740
Make the gravy and then cook, stir fry peppers with gravy

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.160
and this is ready.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.020
First I will be grinding the peanuts, coconut and sesame seeds.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.060
Peanuts

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.980
Sesame seeds

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.020
Coconut powder

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.560
And just grind them into powder.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.180
I like to use the nut grinder.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.360
Let's check.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.140
And it's looking very good.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.340
So this is ready for the gravy.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.440
Now I will make the spice paste.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.740
Tamarind paste

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.660
Ginger

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.280
Red chillies

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.580
Turmeric

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.620
And about 1/4 cup of water.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.320
Mix it well.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.740
Tamarind paste is ready.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.140
I will stir fry the peppers.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.820
I like to use the flat frying pan.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.100
Heat is on, medium high.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.600
Oil

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.260
Peppers

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.800
Stir fry them.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.540
Till they are brown all around.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.040
And this should take about 2 minutes.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.960
Peppers are ready.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.160
As you see they have very nice color all around.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.200
It has taken me about 2 minutes.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.320
So now I will take them out over the paper towel.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680
I have already taken the peppers out.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.880
And as you see there is still remaining oil.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.360
Heat is on, medium high.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.060
And now I will add the cumin seeds.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
Oil should be moderately hot.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.780
So seeds are cracking.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.400
Mustard seeds

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.800
Kalonji

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.080
And besan.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.520
Stir fry.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.860
Just for about half a minute. Till besan is golden brown.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.900
Besan gives a nice thick texture to the gravy.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.740
Besan is ready.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.100
It has a nice color and you can smell the sweet aroma from the besan.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.420
Time to add the dry mix

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.920
from peanuts, coconut and sesame seed.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.640
Stir fry again for about a minute.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.480
And do lower the heat after you put this dry powder to low.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.800
So this has been about a minute and my mix is ready.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.820
Has a very nice brown color, peanuts are roasted really well.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.800
So now it's time to add the spice paste.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.020
And again stir fry this for about a minute.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.540
It has been a minute and spices are nicely cooked.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.460
So now I will add the water.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.320
About 3 cups.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.380
Mix it well.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.280
Gravy is boiling.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.420
So now I will add the sugar.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.460
And salt.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.660
Let it simmer over medium heat for about 3 minutes.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.020
So gravy has little bit thickened before we add the peppers.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.580
Cover the pan.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.920
So this has been 3 minutes.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.360
So let's check the gravy.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.060
It's looking really good.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.440
So now it's time to add the peppers.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.240
And we will cook with peppers for another 2 minutes.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.660
And sprinkle the garam masala over.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.260
Garam masala has a very nice smell.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.740
Let's cover it.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.940
Partially cover it and just let it cook for another 2 minutes.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.500
It has been 3 minutes.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.620
So it's time to check the mirchi ka salan.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.040
It looks very good.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.980
Very nice thickness of gravy.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.380
I like lot of gravy with this dish

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.620
because I serve this with rice.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.120
Hyderabadi mirchi ka salan is ready to serve.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.040
Very aromatic and this is a very delicious dish.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.640
If you enjoy hot and spicy food this one is for you.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.860
Today I will be serving this with plain rice.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.340
Enjoy.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.120
Thank you.
