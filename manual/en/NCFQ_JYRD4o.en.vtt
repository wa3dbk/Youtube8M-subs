Hello again and as promised, here's the
follow-up to our previous video,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.690
"Give Me a Guide on How to Buy Kids Bike"
and hopefully today,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.670
we're going to teach you how
to teach your child to ride a bike.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.910
Now, this is my son Jude. He's two and a
half years old and he's already got some

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.810
experience of using a balance bike which
is how he came to win the Under-3 Giro

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.740
d'Italia this year. However, he hasn't got
the technique down on how to actually

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.200
pedal one and that's what we're going
to try and teach him today.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.930
Hopefully, combine the two. Wish me luck.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.010
Now, we would always recommend that you
start your child with a balance bike even

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.460
if they're two and a half years old or
eight years old. Of course,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.410
you can't get balance bikes for eight
years old but what you can do is take the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.310
pedals off, lower the saddle right down,
and make sure their able to get their feet

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.570
flat on the floor because that will give
them the most amount of confidence.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.020
If you start them with stabilizers like
this, it means they get used to just being

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
able to stay upright without actually
having to balance which means they

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.200
have to learn the whole technique from
scratch once you take them off.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.390
If you get your kids into riding very,
very young, there are some balance

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.960
bikes like this one that don't have
any brakes but if you do get one with

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.500
brakes like this one here which he's been
using, it's a good idea to teach them to

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.790
use them before they actually get on. That
way, if they do start to get out of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.180
control or speed up too much, they'll know
how to slow down. To do that,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.640
by putting them next to the bike and get
them to just grab the brake on and off so

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.240
that they'll know that that slows the bike
down. So once you've got your child set up

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.680
on the bike, you've made sure that their
feet are able to go flat on the floor,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.510
and they're fairly confident, it's time to
set them off. So, find a flat bit of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.770
either tarmac or soft grass, not too soft
though because you want to make

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.960
sure that the wheels are allowed to move
around then go along with them.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.510
Just help them support underneath their
arms here which is something you can grab

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.950
if they do start to lose balance but never
hold on to the handlebars because

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.130
it's important that they get the feel of
that because that will then later help

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.300
them balance. It's really important to
remember that your child needs to enjoy

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.940
the experience. If they obviously don't
want to do it or they get visibly tired,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.580
then it's time to give them a rest and
come back to it another time.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.020
Once you feel that they've started to get
more comfortable and confident on the bike

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.620
and it's time to let them go on their own,
don't do anything too drastic like major

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.830
downhills but if you get some very slight
gradual downhills either a flat one

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.250
or a slight uphill which is going
to slow them down,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.240
they're going to start to get a little bit
speed up and that's the point that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.350
potentially, they can start to lift their
feet off the ground and really get the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.582
hang of that balance.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.655
Right, go on Jude. You go on your own.
Put your feet up.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.940
Careful, feet up, feet up. Good boy.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.368
Yeah, good boy.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.590
So as you can see, Jude's got the balance
pretty well down. I've been teaching him

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.680
for a good few months but he hasn't got
the technique of pedaling so I have put

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.250
these stabilizers on because he's already
got that balance behind him and hopefully

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.530
over the next 10 to 15 minutes, maybe 2
hours, I'm going to teach him how to pedal

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.297
this bike whilst his got the balance
and get a little bit of strength

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:00.164
in these legs.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.682
Go on and pedal, pedal. That's it.
That's it. Good boy. Good boy.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.650
Join us soon for our next video where we
will show Jude taking the final steps in

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.876
the process of learning to ride a bike.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.640
Being able to ride a bike at a young age
is, in our opinion of course,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.490
one of life's essential skills. With so
many different makes, types,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.000
and sizes of bikes in
the market, it can...
