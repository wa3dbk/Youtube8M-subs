00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:05.271
(whirring)

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.674
- We looked over to Bojay,
who was holding his stomach,

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:11.411 align:start size:94% position:6%
and he screamed out in the
middle of class, oh no!

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.912
(laughing)

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.915
Which was then followed by
the loudest diarrhea noises

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.617
anyone had ever heard.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.021
(dramatic dubstep music)

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.738
(growling)

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:41.007
(groaning)

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.347
(smashing)

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.681
(cheering and applauding)

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.383
- Thank you, everybody.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.285 align:start size:88% position:13%
So if you don't know,
here's what the show is.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.087 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's just a bunch of
funny people telling like

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.155
100% true stories.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.656
He's absolutely hilarious.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.558 align:start size:94% position:6%
You can get his comedy
album on iTunes right now.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.126
It's called James Dean Type.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.262
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
Sean O'Connor, everybody.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.530
Let him hear it.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.365
(cheering)

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:06.599
- I have enemies.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.301
Let's talk about it.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.604
I have one enemy.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:15.675 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's my freshman-year
Biology teacher, Ms. Sydell.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.279 align:start size:94% position:6%
To paint a picture of what
Ms. Sydell looked like,

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.780 align:start size:94% position:6%
take Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
and then that's it.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.284 align:start size:88% position:13%
She looked exactly like
Josh Gordon-Levitt.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.086
She hates me because we
had to dissect a baby pig

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.020
in her class.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.488
She broke us up into groups.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.024
My group was me, my best
friend, Brendan, and a guy,

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:34.194 align:start size:84% position:16%
named Brian Jones
who we called Bojay.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:36.996
We called him Bojay because
he tried to tell a story

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.531
about a blowjob, and
he called it a bojay,

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.467
and we were like that is
your name forever now.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.203
Get used to that, Bojay.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
Bojay was six foot six,
495 pounds, and looked like

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:49.242
a human dolphin, which does
not come back in the story,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.010
but you need to know that.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.679
It was really weird.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.116
Now what happens when
you dissect a baby pig,

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.650
it's super easy.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.019
You cut it open and remove it
piece by piece and label it.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.789
We cut it open, and
then Bojay was like,

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.958
I got it from here, fellas.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.728 align:start size:84% position:16%
He reached his huge
paw into the baby pig,

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.297
removed everything in one scoop.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.968
Brought it out here and
squished it in his hand.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.903
He was holding his fist
so tight it was like

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.372 align:start size:94% position:6%
he was trying to gain
the baby pig's abilities.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:22.242
He was like, now I'm as
strong as a baby pig.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.810
We were like, fuck you, dude.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.644
We're going to summer school.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.478
You suck.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:31.084
And Bojay was like, would
it make you feel better

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.252
if I ate this?

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.755 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was like Bojay I don't
think I've ever felt that good

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.991
in my entire life.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.759
You have to eat that.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.761 align:start size:81% position:19%
He was like, okay,
and he ate it.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.062
(groans)

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.798
And we laughed for 20 minutes.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.168
We stopped laughing just
in time to hear the two

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.870
funniest words I've ever
heard a human being speak.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.840 align:start size:97% position:3%
We looked over to Bojay,
who was holding his stomach,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.011 align:start size:94% position:6%
and he screamed out in the
middle of class, Oh no!

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.483
Which was then followed by
the loudest diarrhea noises

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.851
anyone had ever heard.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.086
(laughing)

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.588 align:start size:84% position:16%
At this point, I
was laughing so hard

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.490
that I forgot how
to breathe, just a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.526
(gasp chuckling)

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.328 align:start size:97% position:3%
Brendan was laughing so
hard, he started throwing up

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:18.231
in the middle of class, and
Bojay was running around

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.534
in circles, going,
oh no, oh no, oh no

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.237 align:start size:88% position:13%
as diarrhea shot out the
bottom of his khakis,

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.306
creating this evil Spirograph.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.575
(laughing)

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.110 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ms. Sydell was
teaching the class.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.579
She looked over.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.414 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was the first time I
ever heard a teacher curse.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:37.550
She screamed out, what the fuck!

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.018
She was 4'11.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.787 align:start position:0%
It was like our school was built
on an Indian burial ground,

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:43.856
and it all came out
through her then.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.829 align:start size:84% position:16%
Bojay stopped, pointed
at us and said,

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.898
they made me eat the pig.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.836
Ms. Sydell looked
us in our kid eyes,

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:59.239
and she said, fuck you, both.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.175
She was 63-years-old.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.110
We'd never felt passion before

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.712
because we were 14.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.313
Now we have negative
feelings about it.

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:10.383
We can't connect with people.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.785
We had to go down
to the principal

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.020 align:start size:81% position:19%
because that's
where you go next.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.488
The principal was like
a cool, young principal,

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.956 align:start position:0%
sitting in his chair backwards,
like what's the haps?

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.891
And I'm like, I'll tell
you what the haps is

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.760
we were dissecting a baby
pig, and what happens when

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.428 align:start position:0%
you do that is you cut it
open, remove it piece by piece,

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.163 align:start size:97% position:3%
and label it, but Brian
reached his huge hand into it,

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.665
pulled everything out,
brought it out here,

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.067 align:start size:88% position:13%
squished it in his hand,
and then he was like,

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.202
should I eat this right now?

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:30.703 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I don't remember
what I said.

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.438
(laughing)

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:35.441
And he ate it and
pooped everywhere.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.544
I was like what happens now?

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:42.482 align:start size:94% position:6%
He was like, I don't
know, I just got this job.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.951 align:start size:84% position:16%
He called the last
principal to find out.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.821
What happens now is we
had to go see a therapist

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.791 align:start size:84% position:16%
to take a personality
disorder test

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.194 align:start size:84% position:16%
to find out if we were
sociopaths or not.

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:57.830
Anyone ever do that?

00:04:59.132 --> 00:04:59.966
One guy.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.905
No one's moving away
from you, that's good.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.608
What happens, for those of
you who've never done that,

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.843
you go in, there's a therapist.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.813 align:start size:94% position:6%
They ask you one
question a hundred times,

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:17.984 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that question is if
everyone in your town died,

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.218
would you care?

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.990
And then you're 14,
so you're like, sure.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.992
I don't know, who cares.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:30.596 align:start size:88% position:13%
They're like, you're not
a sociopath, go home.

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:31.831
We go home.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.666
This next part makes me
seem like a sociopath.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.068
Sorry in advance.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:41.407 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was on AOL Instant Messenger
or Instant Messenger.

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:44.711 align:start size:88% position:13%
I got an IM from Bojay,
and he said, hey,

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.814
I totally forgive you for
making me eat that pig.

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:51.217 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was like, it was
your idea, but thanks.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.322
And then he was like, since
we're such good friends,

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.925 align:start size:88% position:13%
you should know there's
a child molester

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:03.229
in your neighborhood, do
not go outside tonight.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.465
Now, we are 15 years later.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.170 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I have no idea
what he meant by that.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.839
Still, I am baffled.

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:18.811
But my 14-year-old brain was
like, he's trying to prank you.

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.913
Prank him back.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.648
So the next day we
go in to school,

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:25.051 align:start size:97% position:3%
we go up to a water
fountain, and we pour water

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.486 align:start size:84% position:16%
all over our eyes like
we had been crying

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:28.354
for the last 12 hours.

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:31.090
We go up to Bojay and we're
like, we should've listened

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.091
to you, man.

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:36.095
(laughter building)

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:40.032
We were molested last night.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.203
Bojay said, I'm sorry to hear
that, waked to the principal's

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.838 align:start size:84% position:16%
office, told him that
we were molested,

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:49.409 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we had to go to therapy
for five more months.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.310
Thank you, guys,
I'm Sean O'Connor.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.714
(dramatic dubstep music)
