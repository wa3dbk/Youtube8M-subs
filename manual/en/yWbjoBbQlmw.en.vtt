Alright next we're going to do a strawberry
banana smoothie. I'm actually going to use

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:15.380
a cup because it's a little bit more convenient.
Cut a couple of strawberries here.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.980
Again, any kinds of fruits or vegetables,
any kinds of fruits or vegetables that you

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.699
prefer is actually, it wouldn't really matter;
strawberries, bananas, blueberries, mango's,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.470
oranges, grapefruit. They are all really good
for you and the idea is to get the proper

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.339
nutrition. Again, even if you wanted to add
in vegetables, some people do that. It's really

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:44.359
up to you. And again if you need protein,
if you're trying to heal, protein is also

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:56.910
very good. Just put those in there. Actually
a little bit more green bananas are a little

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.250
bit lower in sugar, so if you're watching
your sugar intakes especially when you're

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.579
juicing or blending something it highers the
glycemic index. So anything a little bit more

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:15.130
green is always better. Add a little bit of
ice and also water is always great. You don't

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.700
always have to add milk. Water has no calories,
it's really good for you, you should at least

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:47.130
be doing ten glasses per day. Just put it
on there and turn it on. This is my extra

00:01:47.130 --> 00:02:01.170
blender as you can see. I'm sorry, and we
take it off and we got a great shake ready

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.400
to go.
