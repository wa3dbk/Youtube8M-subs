00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
One

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.620
Two

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.940
Three

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.320
Four

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.000
Five

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.500
I have five copies of Bad Rats

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.660
Uh... People always tell me, ya know, play Bad Rats, do a Bad Rats video

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.140
'cause, ya know, when Portal 2 came out that was the big step for puzzle games

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.380
now Bad Rats... this is the next big step, this is the- this is the...

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.160
It's a thinking man's game, ya know?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.700
If you're one of the smarter guys out there, you appreciate this kind of intellectualism that's uh... on display here

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.600
like, ya know, right now I'm thinking, why is this bulldozer guy driving on the side of the wall?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.320
Like how the- how is that possible?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.080
So just immediately I'm gonna start breaking out these advanced techniques.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100
This is called "rat stacking."

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.320
So the basic idea is here you make two big piles of rats,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.440
Pretty much just put all the rats into two big piles, and then you go ahead,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.760
And then I'm gonna finish this off, I'm gonna put a little trampoline on top of the fat rat.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.260
Now, theoretically, the baseball rat; he should hit that ball, and then it should go to the cannon guy,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.020
And then they just pass it down the line until it gets to the bulldozer guy,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.900
Then he drives it over here into the bomb, and then that bomb will blow up the chain and free the cat.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.400
So the objective of the game is to help the cat.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.820
So let's try this out now- oh. Okay.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.120
Wait, look at the ball, look at the ball!

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.820
There we go, there we go! C'mon! It, oh, headbutt by Stevens! Awh.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.780
So close on that one. You know what?

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.740
It was the balloon. The balloon messed it all up.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.700
See?

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.540
Oh! Yes, yes! Oh my god!

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.480
Oh my god.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.420
These rats are evil.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.060
So these-

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.080
So, I'm not gonna- I don't wanna kill the cat

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.760
So I'm gonna put all these rats in a big pyramid,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.760
And then they should just fall on each other,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.700
And it'll be like a battle royale and all these evil rats can just fight each other,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.700
And the cat can stay safe.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.620
You know, that's my plan.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.480
Aaaaand I beat the level.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.820
Can I turn this horrible music off?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.000
Nope!

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.540
That made it way louder.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.200
Aww yeah, this should definitely work, yeah.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.280
Aww yeah, definitely, yeah.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.300
Aww, wow. Wow.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.940
So close. So-

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.160
You know what? It was the umbrella.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.240
Think about it. It was the- the umbrella needs to be over there.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.380
What was I thinking? What was I thinking, see?

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.100
It's as simple as that.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.600
It's- I can see why this game has a 96 on Metacritic.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.540
It's a good game.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.520
Ooh, they're throwing a curveball at me here, folks.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.380
This is a tricky one. So I'm gonna put the cannon guy up there,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.800
I'm gonna go ahead and bring Bulldozer Pete,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.700
I'm gonna put him right by the wrecking ball.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.260
It's a thematic choice, you know?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.080
Uh, put the rocket down here, and then bring the baseball guy.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.720
You guys see what- you guys see what I'm going for, right?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.480
And then that comes- he comes down here, yeah!

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.900
And then get up there! Get a home run!

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.000
Get up there, yes! Yes!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.500
*Gun cocking sound*

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.660
*Gunshot*

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.900
Peta game of the year.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.220
Uh oh, doggie sign.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900
Yeah, that's not a good sign.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.860
This is gonna, this is probably gonna be the hardest level.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680
So I don't even- I don't even know what I'm doing.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.500
I don't even- I don't- Uh... put the cannon up here? I don't know, I don't know.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.620
I don't know. Hit the- Hit the ball? I don't know. I don't know.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.320
Hit the- I don't know. Put the... Put this-

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.400
Maybe hits the ball, bounce off the wall, bounce on this guy's head,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.680
Up here by the dog sign, cannon guy shoots it into the scissors? That should- I don't know.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.720
Let's try it out. Let's go for it.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.280
So close. So close-

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.900
What am I thinking. What am I- you gotta bring the bulldozer rat up here,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.760
Now I-- Now I get it. Now I get it.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.100
You gotta bring him up here, and put him on a balloon.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.500
Huh? That looks right.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.540
Oh! And it works. Yup.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.980
So it's obvious, you know, once you see it it's obvious.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.300
So I'm seeing that the uh.. cat is already dead before the level even started in the microwave over there.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.240
So I'm gonna attempt to solve it anyway.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.600
Maybe it's just a little glitch? Oh! I beat it!

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.820
It's obvious, once you- once you see it it's obvious, so- oh was that it?

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.420
Is that all the-

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.000
Thank you for beating my game- Bad Rats!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
*Cat meowing*

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:27.000
*Saxophone playing*

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Female Singer: "Just like the wind."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
"I've always been..."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
"Drifting high up in the sky that never ends~"

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
"Through thick and thin."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
"I always win..."
