00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.860
Hi it's Camille with POSGuys.com. Today we're
taking a look at Zebra's new desktop barcode printer,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.860
the GC420t. This has thermal transfer and direct
thermal capabilities. It is a direct replacement

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.180
of the TLP2844 line which is exceptionally
popular. They have almost the exact same functionality

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.439
and the exact same specifications but the
new Zebra GC420 can handle more printer languages

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.460
and also has a slightly larger memory.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.870
As you can see if you have a 2844 it has the
exact same layout on the inside. Your ribbon

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.930
up top here loads in the exact same way.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.930
It has the same tightening mechanisms on the
top to adjust it.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.980
Down below it has the same
 label guide. It
tightens the same way right here.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.319
It's just exactly the same. Looks the same,
feels the same.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:17.319
It even closes the same where you have that
green pushes in, shuts, clamshell design.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.770
When you take a look at the back of the printer

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.479
it has USB

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.250
which you can see right there.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.810
Parallel... and your DB9 serial interface

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.280
so, the same as the 2844.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.560
We're going to do a demonstration of label
printing. So you can see the label on the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.420
screen here.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.649
For settings we're going to have it be at
it's darkest and printing at it's fastest.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.649
So speed 4 inches per second and darkness
15 and also printing thermal transfer.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.410
Then we'll start.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.200
They come out pretty quick and pretty clear.
We've done some very large print orders with

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.310
this printer before.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.070
So the GC420 is a geat replacement for the
2844 models. You can use the same media,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.620
so your same labels, your same ribbons, you
could even use the same interface cables if

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.680
you already have a DB9 interface cable. Your
staff if they already know how to use this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.780
printer will be able to use the new GC420
so it's a very smooth and efffortless upgrade

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.520
to make.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.880
It comes with Zebra's one year warranty. It's
available in direct thermal and thermal transfer

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.460
and comes in at about the same price as the
2844, which is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.850
it starts around $380.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.720
