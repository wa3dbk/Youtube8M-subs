Friday, December the 7th, 2012. 
This Week on GOG: In case you missed it, here’s what’s new.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.700
Eador: Genesis is a real treat for turn-based strategy fans. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.620
Inspired by the Heroes of Might and Magic series of games it
adds layers upon layers of deep and involving gameplay 
to its classic mechanics. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.600
Become one of the Masters and begin your quest to unite all 
the shards of Eador, the world broken to pieces by a magical
cataclysm, under your rule.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.200
If you somehow manage to finish the game under 120 hours it
would been considered a speed run; this is not a short game.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.340
With over 170 structures to build, 80 magic spells to master,
and more than 70 varieties  of units, Eador: Genesis could 
keep you entertained for a decade!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.220
Primordia, the point-and-click adventure from Wadjet Eye Studios,
features a bleak, post-apocalyptic world populated by sentient machines. 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.300
As Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5, you travel this strange wasteland 
accompanied by Crispin, your sarcastic floating orb sidekick.

00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:03.000
You set out to find your stolen power core, but your quest leads 
you to many unexpected discoveries.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.200
What happened to humankind? How much truth is there to the Gospel 
of Man, the holy book that you so piously follow?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.000
Why don't you remember your past? The answers, my friend, 
will blow your positronic mind!

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000
This was a good week for pointers and clickers adventurer types. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.300
The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles, a prequel 
to the hit comedic fantasy game, was released for Windows and Mac.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.160
Even more good news for Mac gamers, the first title in the series 
is now also available for your system!

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Both games now support both English and German language. 
Ist das nicht super? Viele grusse!

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.900
Hail to the king, baby! 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.900
This week marked the addition of two classic Apogee platformers 
starring the badassest badass in the history of badassdom,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.600
the Texas Ranger of video games, the relentless hero of
planet Earth--Duke Nukum. Erm, I mean: Duke Nukem. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.120
That's right! Two iconic run-n-gun games that started 
Duke's legend (long before it was sullied FOREVER),
are now available as a bundle on GOG.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Wondering what's going to happen next week? 
No cryptic hints this time. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.800
We're starting our season sales, so you can expect 
many, many, many, many, many, many--MANY great deals.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.700
On top of that, a great classic game is going to be 
given away as our holiday gift, so stick around that
digital GOG christmas tree, you rascals you!

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.900

so don't MYST out! Get it? Don't MYST out? 
It's funny because--oh, nevermind.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.500
That's the last "This Week" for 2012! 
That's OK, though, don't worry. 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.000
