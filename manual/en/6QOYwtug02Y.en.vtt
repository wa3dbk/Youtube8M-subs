Hi! My name is John Armstrong with expertvillage.com.
I am a professional guitar instructor and

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:12.280
today we will be discussing intermediate jazz
guitar. Let's do a melody line; I'll just

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.550
play it right here kind of in a open position
as much as possible. We are going to have

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:37.050
half B flat, rest, B flat G, half B flat.
Half B flat, D, D, E flat F, B flat, C, D.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:53.559
That takes us through ending one. So here's
ending number 1 again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, repeat

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:08.410
from the beginning. Ending number 2 is different;
resolved in the B flat chord. Down now to

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:22.660
the body of the song, A, D, B flat, A, A,
G,G, A, then G, C, A, G, G, F, F, E natural,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:34.290
back to F. Back to our melody liner or our
original theme; F to B flat, then F, E, D,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:44.450
D, E flat, F, B flat, C, B flat. Now here
we come to our coda situation; we're at D,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:54.409
E flat, F, B flat, C, repeat that; D, E flat,
F, B flat, C. Then pass the codas now, D,

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:02.820
E flat, F, B flat, C, B flat. So that is the
melody line if you don't know how to read

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.690
what is written on the chart right there.
At least you can kind of learn it off of that,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.049
just kinda watching me play it there.
