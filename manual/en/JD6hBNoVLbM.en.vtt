00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.039
Having a powerful console is great but without
a good controller it doesn’t mean much.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.720
Both the Xbox One and PS4 have made a lot
of changes to their controllers since the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.970
last generation. Unlike the DualShock 3 which
was mostly unchanged from the original PlayStation

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.570
the PS4 gamepad is a huge step forward. It’s
wider and more comfortable with a subtle pattern

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.789
on the grips which is nice especially for
extended gaming sessions. The thumbsticks

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.680
are now concave to give your fingers a nice
place to rest and they’ve got a grippy rubber

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.840
coating. This feels good while gaming but
there have been issues, people like my friend

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.109
Lew from UnboxTherapy have had the rubber
wear out and peel with plenty of others having

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.989
the same problem. This seems to be mostly
be an issue with launch PS4s, I haven’t

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.840
had a problem with my controllers so unless
you log some serious hours it shouldn’t

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.639
be an issue. The Xbox One controller might
not be such a huge change but it’s seen

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:50.420
some improvements as well. The grip feels
a bit bigger and more comfortable in my hands

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.999
but the 360 controller didn’t leave a lot
of room for improvement. The thumbsticks have

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.359
been been updated with a nice textured grip
which feels tighter than the smooth finish

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.539
on the older controller. After a year and
a half of use my left thumbstick has started

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.820
to get a bit loose but other than that it’s
held up fairly well. The triggers on the PS4

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.580
are nicely shaped with decent travel and I
definitely prefer the shoulder buttons to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.860
what’s on the Xbox One but the Xbox triggers
are larger and have a nicer feel. The big

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.899
advantage though are the Impulse Triggers.
In addition to having rumble motors in the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.379
controller Microsoft fit an extra motor in
each trigger to give you feedback in game.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.800
It’s especially noticeable in racing games
like Forza where you can feel the triggers

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.689
vibrate as you start to lose traction but
it’s also useful in other games like shooters

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.590
to give you more detailed feedback than just
shaking your entire controller. You get used

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.280
to it quickly, it’s a really nice feature
that I’ve come to appreciate. On the PS4

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.979
you’ll find the traditional X, Square, Triangle
and Circle buttons on the right side along

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.119
with the solid D-pad which is about as good
as it gets for a console controller. Where

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.740
you used to have Start and Select buttons
you’ll now find Share and Options. Options

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.780
is basically the pause button and Share allows
you to grab a quick screenshot or video clip

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.920
along with streaming your game. Square in
the middle of the controller is the touchpad.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.240
Similar to what you’ll find on the back
of the Vita this is used in games to pull

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.079
up a quick option but some titles like Tearaway
Unfolded do a much better job of taking advantage

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.110
of the touch sensitivity. There’s also a
speaker in the controller to listen to in-game

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.380
audio logs or things like a radio. Speaking
of audio every PS4 controller has a built-in

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.900
3.5 millimeter headphone jack to being able
to game quietly with headphones. There is

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.750
a port you can use with a PlayStation headset
but having the option of using your own headphones

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.690
is a big plus. The Xbox One has needed a proprietary
headset for while however they’ve recently

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.740
released an updated controller that includes
a headphone jack. The bigger news though is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.110
the Elite controller. This brings replaceable
thumbsticks which can easily be swapped, an

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.860
interchangeable D-pad with a cool faceted
design and four programmable paddles for easier

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.170
access to things like your face buttons. It
also has a hair trigger bump stop for shorter

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.200
actuation and a dedicated switch to move between
setups. It’s a legitimately cool controller

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.710
but with a hefty $150 price tag it’s not
all that practical. All three versions of

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.460
the Xbox One controller come with AA batteries.
Considering the PS3 shipped with rechargeable

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.110
batteries nearly ten years ago this really
isn’t cool, having to pay an extra $15 for

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.560
the Play and Charge kit is a big pain. On
the other hand it is usable as a wired controller

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.320
on both the Xbox One and PC which is really
useful. The DualShock 4 is bigger, more comfortable

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.890
and adds a lot of features than range from
decent to downright useful. The Xbox One controller

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.090
takes one of the best gamepads of all time
and improves it but at the end of the day

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.490
the PlayStation 4 just barely takes this one.
Of course there’s more to it than just controllers

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.450
so stay tuned, this comparison is far from
over.
