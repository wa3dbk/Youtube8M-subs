00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.990
Based on the first book in the best selling
trilogy by Veronica Roth, this science-fiction

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.990
action film is well on its way to doubling
its $85 million dollar budget a month after

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.619
its March 21, 2014 release.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.150
Set in a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society
has been split into five factions with overly

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.800
hokey names like "Abnegation" and "Erudite"
- where all 16-year-olds are forced to choose

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.929
a group, and stay with it for life.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.829
The ill-intentioned overseer, Kate Winslet
coldly reminds everyone, "The future belongs

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.680
to those who know where they belong."

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.989
The beautiful Shailene Woodley stars as a
young and courageous citizen who is disheartened

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.790
and frightened to learn she has a "divergent"
personality, making her ill-suited for any

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.790
one faction.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.150
If you weren't familiar with the immensely
talented actress before, this blockbuster

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.130
adventure will surely put her on your radar.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.410
She has a bright future ahead of her in Hollywood,
with a career that'll undoubtedly have her

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.970
competing against Jennifer Lawrence for many
roles.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.750
Throughout her journey, she encounters new
friends, enemies, and unlikely allies - with

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.330
Theo James featured as the love interest and
helpful instructor.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:39.049
A sequence where the two enter a drug-induced
fear-based dreamscape is an inventive and

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.479
dramatic resolution to one plot-thread.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.880
Ansel Elgort, Tony Goldwyn, Ashley Judd, Ray
Stevenson, Maggie Q, Jai Courtney, ZoÃ« Kravitz,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.350
and Miles Teller make up most of the PG-13-rated
film's large supporting cast.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.439
With a young female lead who challenges authority
while falling in love with her hunky co-star,

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.789
the comparisons to other young adult book
adaptations, like "Twilight", or "The Hunger

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.369
Games" are inevitable.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.929
With a trilogy of sequels already in development,
it's obvious to see this story's appeal with

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.039
adolescents however; at its core, it's inherently
nothing more than an allegory to fitting in

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.039
with society.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.790
Director Neil Burger does a great job balancing
the strong character arcs and personalities,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.209
but the story gets away from him in this derivative
and bloated 139-minute experience.

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.569
The middle hour plays out like a post-apocalyptic
boot camp, with all the trappings of a stay

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.180
at summer camp; each rookie participant oblivious
to the cliques and traditions of their surroundings.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.599
Far too much time is wasted here, watching
Woodley slowly transform herself into a powerful

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.910
soldier through a series of unnecessary montages.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.010
Otherwise, the picture is very technically
proficient, blending a lively and gritty score

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.239
from Junkie XL with convincing visual effects
and sharp cinematography.

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.239
The movie is interesting enough that I won't
mind re-watching it next spring before its

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.420
first follow-up, "Insurgent" is released.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.560
Although residing in a decently familiar dystopian
environment, the strong and resourceful characters

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.010
make this a compelling picture, and an intriguing
start to a new quadrilogy.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.349
"Divergent", "Believable heroes in conventional
situations."

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:11.530
Here's what you had to say in the YouTube
comments.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.959
Our scores for "Divergent", a SIX and an EIGHT.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.950
You thought it was disappointing and poorly
written, but still better than expected, rating

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.950
it a GOOD.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.209
I definitely was surprised by this movie...
despite its many issues, when it worked, it

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.590
was a very entertaining film, I thought it
was GREAT.
