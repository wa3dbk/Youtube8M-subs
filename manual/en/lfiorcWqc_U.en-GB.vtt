00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.950
Okay so this tutorial is on the back muscles.
If you want to learn a bit more in detail

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.469
about the back muscles, look at my individual
tutorials on the extrinsic muscles of the

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.910
back, and the intermediate and deep muscles
of the back. I talk about innervation, insertion

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.090
and all that kind of stuff in a bit more detail
than I'm going to do here. So I'm just going

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.090
to work from superficial to deep and point
out some of the major muscles that you should

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.710
know about. So this muscle here is the trapezius,
you probably all know this one, and this muscle

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.011
elevates and depresses the scapula, and it
can also retract the scapula. So that's the

00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:49.320
trapezius. You've got the latissimus dorsi,
which is Latin for "the broadest muscle of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.120
the back", and this is the biggest back muscle
obviously. And this muscle inserts onto the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:05.390
humerus, so it adducts, extends and internally
rotates the humerus. So just working our way

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:15.700
deeper, just underneath the trapezius, you've
got the rhomboids. The rhomboid major and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.030
the rhomboid minor. And these muscles attach
to the scapula and they function to keep the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.680
scapula pressed against the thoracic wall,
and when the trapezius is contracted they

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:41.521
can retract the scapula. So here you've got
the levator scapulae, and this muscle as you

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.799
can see it attaches to the top of the scapula
and it elevates the scapula when it's contract,

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.909
so that's the levator scapulae - these two
muscles here. So those muscles which I've

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.310
just covered are the extrinsic muscles of
the back, now we're going to be working our

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.770
way deeper into the intermediate muscle layer,
and here you've got the serratus posterior

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:14.099
superior, and the serratus posterior inferior.
So you can see these muscles they attach to

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:21.650
the ribs and the superior one elevates the
ribs and the inferior one depresses the ribs.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.430
So these are the intermediate muscles involved
in respiratory function. So now we've got

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.900
the deep muscles of the back, the intrinsic
muscles, which are responsible for the movement

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:43.270
of the spine and the head. So you've got these
spinotransversales muscles which move the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.340
head and neck; you've got the splenius capitis
and the splenius cervicis - two spinotransversales

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.170
muscles. This muscle here is the splenius
capitis, and as you can see it inserts onto

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.400
the skull. So what this muscle does, if both
muscles are contracted, it draws the head

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.190
backwards and extends the neck. If just one
of the muscles is contracted, then it will

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.349
rotate the head around to that side. So that's
the splenius capitis. For some reason on this

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:22.709
model, the splenius cervicis isn't shown,
but this originates a little bit lower down

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:32.830
and inserts onto the transverse process of
the first vertebra. So I'll get rid of those.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.510
So next we've got those muscles which move
the vertebral column. You've got the erector

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.470
spinae muscles and the transversospinales
muscles. The erector spinae muscles are more

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.709
superficial, so I'll begin with those. You've
got three groups, so laterally you've got

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:59.340
the iliocostalis - this one here. In the middle
you've got the longissimus, and most medially

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:07.220
you've got the spinalis. So an acronym...not
an acronym - a mnemonic for remembering this

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:17.229
is "I long for spinach" - "I" iliocostalis,
"Long" longissimus, "Spinach" spinalis. So

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.689
laterally to medial, those are the erector
spinae muscles, and these are the primary

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:27.610
extensors of the vertebral column and head,
and they're the largest group of intrinsic

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:36.349
back muscles. So deep to the erector spinae
muscles, you've got the transversospinales

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:47.860
muscles. So you've got three transversospinales
muscles. The semispinalis which is the most

00:04:47.860 --> 00:05:00.789
superficial. You've got the multifidus here.
And then most deep you've got the rotares

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:09.759
muscles. So that covers very briefly the muscles
of the back, if you want to look in more depth

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:15.869
at those, take a look the individual tutorials
I've done on those various groups. But hopefully

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:21.439
that's useful and just shows how which muscles
are deep which muscles are superficial.
