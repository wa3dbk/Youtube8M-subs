00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.800
(1, 2, 1, 2...)

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.240
(1, 124)

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.460
("La Caleta" click family)

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.580
(There is good weather in the capital).

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.280
The roof spinning,
my life in a loop,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.680
the death chewing a gum,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.140
let's see what comes up.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.400
Let me give it another drag,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.540
let me give it another sip.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.860
Let me take my colors from the pencil case.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.560
Stop getting the snot out when you're listening to me.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.380
Paquito is everywhere,
and he goes for your goodies.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.040
You'll see his sign in your mirror when you take a shower.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.920
Mist, whoa, I wrote my lyrics while lying

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.000
maybe that's why they come out sideways.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.580
I bring the ice-cream more fresh.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.620
I take it easy, chill out. Ouch,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920
pinch me if this is a dream, or bye.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.700
Today I want to make it slow,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.740
at double tempo my temperament.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.740
I'm not asking you for forgiveness,
but I'm sorry.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.740
Don't make me beg,
I don't have time.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.920
I'm a "Locoplaya", mommy,
it's just that.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.600
In bones (skinny),
you just move your skeleton.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.620
I keep watching how the wind is taking the smoke away.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.940
I keep watching how someones don't move and stay still.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.000
What the fuck is this?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.580
When I was a boy I pointed the way,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.540
and now they are afraid I'll shoot,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.860
afraid I'll burst the glasses,
and their manners.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.380
It should worth to them.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.180
Less "amen", and love you each other,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.740
just fuck off any body else.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.440
Leave me alone,
I'm having ramen for dinner.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.060
I notice you when I'm done,
you know.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.240
Don't cheat me,
shuffle it slowly.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.800
In my village, keys are hidden under the doormats.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.960
I give you 8 misisipis to get you out of here
(1 misisipi, 2 misisipi).

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.560
The roof spinning, but I'm fine with that
(3 misisipi, 4 misisipi).

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
Fresh, by the street, I'm smelling Mimosín (*babys' fragance)
(5 misisipi, 6 misisipi).

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.580
There is good weather today, move your anus from the couch
(7 misisipi, 8 misisipi).

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.120
What's happening?
I'm here with my sonatas.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.940
Why don't you come here and taste it?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.120
Let yourself be carried away by your espadrilles.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.560
Move your legs. Just in case you go to the "other hood" (you die) without leaving the hood.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.960
I flow like using 3in1 in rusty hinges,
in wet places.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.600
I'm the moss you slide off with, bastard.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.260
Looking in my beginnings/principles,
back to the uterus.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.680
Patient, by force, mom, bad manners.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.680
I smoke it until the letters.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.000
Each time is further away what I'm hidding behind.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.120
My silhouettes.
I don't pay attention to what's outside anymore.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400
3 years have past already without making the bed.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.900
I'm sorry mommy.
I left for tomorrow what I could have done today.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.200
Reluctance.
Beating around the bush.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.740
Making myself a house with few wood planks.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.560
At my rhythm, quiet.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.600
The die is cast,
and I'm lying with a liter.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.060
I take care of where I put my snout, boy.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.900
You take care of what you put in on your snout.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.720
I kneel down and I tie my Reeboks if necessary.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.300
In situ, I take a breath and I go for Brissus.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300
I write in the shade of a ficus.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.760
My voice is in every hood,
like a fella named "Pitu".

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.440
I give you 8 misisipis to get you out of here
(1 misisipi, 2 misisipi).

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.900
The roof spinning, but I'm fine with that
(3 misisipi, 4 misisipi).

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.260
Fresh, by the street, I'm smelling Mimosín (*babys' fragance)
(5 misisipi, 6 misisipi).

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.880
There is good weather today, move your anus from the couch
(7 misisipi, 8 misisipi).

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.900
(Lots of misisipi)

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.060
(Tons of misisipi)

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.600
(For everybody, dumbass, "La Caleta" click family)
