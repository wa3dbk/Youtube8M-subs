00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.100
Which game are you most looking forward to the most?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:23.900
Every game, everyone. Because I think everyone is going to be important for me. I have to do well in every game because I think this season can be a very good season for me, very important season for me.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.001
Who poses the biggest threat this season?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:39.001
Of course we have difficult teams to compete with us but we try to beat them and of course to win the league.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.001
Usually itís always Chelsea but this season I think itís probably going to be different. Weíll see.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.300
Competition for places

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Sometimes we get some players injured and then we can change the players and if the team feel the same, feel confident because we have a lot of quality in the team. Thatís important for one team.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.600
What targets have you set yourself?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:40.600
Of course I want to do much more and I want to help my team to win this time because last year we were disappointed and we want to do better in the Championís League and the league. But my target is of course, I know what I did so well in the last part of the season and I want to do better.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
Which league is the best to watch?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.300
Premier League first and then after Spain.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.700
Who will win Serie A?

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.700
Maybe Inter again, they have a good team.

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.400
Who will win the Milan Derby?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.100
We never know, itís always difficult to know the game.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.300
Who will win La Liga?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:18.900
I donít know, it will be very hard because Real Madrid want to win the league because they spent a lot of money on that team. But Barcelona is a very good team; they play unbelievable football. You never know, weíll see.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.600
Who will win El Clasico?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:36.001
Last year I was confident on Barca because the way they played was fantastic and then they show everything on the pitch, they win the both games. But this year maybe it can be different.
