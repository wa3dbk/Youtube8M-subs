00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.193
HERO LASS
So should we just start without her?

00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:16.280
FREAKY SQUEAKY 
I could run the meeting!

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:19.328
DASTARDLY DAN 
I could dazzle you with the 
dark arts while we wait!

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.101
NUNJA 
I support neither of those ideas.

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:23.689
FREAKY SQUEAKY 
Maybe The Reaper got her!

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:28.157
HERO LASS 
Come on, The Reaper's just made-up, 
like Superman or true love, right?

00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:30.442
FREAKY SQUEAKY 
Uh-uh.... I saw him once.

00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:31.328
HERO LASS 
You're shitting me.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.788
FREAKY SQUEAKY
No. I went down to the basement late one
night to drink some laundry detergent;

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.764
when I heard this noise like
SQUEE SQUEE SQUEE!

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:44.601
So I hid, and then I saw
his giant shadow

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:48.638
and I remember I thought,
I really want to keep all of my parts.

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:52.654
And then he turned and he
looked at me...

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:55.073
NUNJA 
Then what happened?

00:00:58.152 --> 00:00:58.814
FREAKY SQUEAKY 
I forget.

00:00:58.815 --> 00:00:59.976
HERO LASS 
Wait, what!?

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:05.750
FREAKY SQUEAKY 
Oh, no -  he said, "WHERE'S THE BEEF?"

00:01:09.513 --> 00:01:11.490
FREAKY SQUEAKY
Oh my God, that's so scary, right?

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.204
DASTARDLY DAN 
So where was it?

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:17.245
Where was the beef?

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:36.635
{MUSIC - THEME SONG}

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:37.729
Shelf Life!

00:01:38.923 --> 00:01:40.293
Shelf Life!

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:43.651
The world needs a team of
braver smarter faster heroes

00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:47.868
BUG BOY
Why isn't he trying to get out?

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.529
HERO LASS
I don't know. Maybe he's asleep.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.968
BUG BOY
Or dead.

00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:54.838
HERO LASS
You should talk to him.

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:56.650
BUG BOY
You really think so?

00:01:56.651 --> 00:02:00.120
I mean, he's your half-brother. Don't 
you think  it'd be better coming from -

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:01.904
Oh, you mean him.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:06.668
HERO MAN 
Yeah, the hammer was cold but c'mon, two hours 
and not even one "Nailed it!" Joke?

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:08.603
HERO MAN
Whoa, what's going on here?

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:09.854
BUG BOY
Nothing, I was just--

00:02:09.855 --> 00:02:12.525
HERO MAN
Who's the new guy, and what 
the hell's he doing in this box --

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:13.939
SAMURAI SNAKE
Hiiiiiiiyaaaaaaa!

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:20.312
ALIEN HUNTER
What have you done!? 
Get off me!

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:21.469
BUG BOY
He's just trying to help.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.442
Come back, buddy...

00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:25.901
It's gonna be ok. He's not a POW 
and you're not in Cambodia anymore.

00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:26.801
HERO LASS
Are you okay?

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:28.051
HERO MAN
I think he's diseased!

00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:31.816
ALIEN HUNTER
I'm not diseased. I'm mint!

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:35.331
At least I was until you came along.

00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:37.093
HERO LASS
What are you?

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:43.580
ALIEN HUNTER
I'm worthless, I am used, thanks to this 
subhuman fucktard!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.469
BUG BOY 
But you're a toy. Toys are meant to
be played with.

00:02:49.654 --> 00:02:55.144
ALIEN HUNTER
Maybe you're a toy. I'm a
collectible.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:57.398
HERO MAN
Oh-ho!  Well aren't you fancy.

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:01.764
HERO LASS
Wait - are you saying that because 
we're not in boxes, we're less valuable?

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:02.884
ALIEN HUNTER
Listen, Miss--

00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:03.489
HERO LASS
Lass.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.116
ALIEN HUNTER
 I don't have time for your 
existential crisis right now, Miss Lass.

00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:12.478
You! Reptilian vandal. 
Get to steppin and fetch me clear tape!

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.042
SAMURAI SNAKE:
{Hisses angrily}

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:16.927
BUG BOY
Hey, what's wrong?

00:03:17.048 --> 00:03:18.804
HERO LASS
I want to be fancy, too.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.911
BUG BOY
Come on, you didn't even know 
what that meant until a second ago.

00:03:21.912 --> 00:03:25.056
HERO LASS
It means we're worthless. 
I'm worthless.

00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:26.724
BUG BOY
You're perfect.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.452
Listen, The Kid doesn't care about 
that guy. He's just gonna sell him.

00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:32.635
That's why he's all boxed up.

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.389
HERO LASS
Like a cheap whore?

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.784
BUG BOY
The cheapest.

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:38.873
The Kid keeps us around because 
we're valuable...

00:03:38,874 --&gt; 00:03:41,885
Where it counts - in here.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.898
HERO MAN
Are we touching boobs? I call next!

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:51.692
ALIEN HUNTER
This is all very sweet, but I'm 
depreciating by the second!

00:04:02.094 --> 00:04:09.075
HERO MAN 
Your box made m'lady sad. 
Now are you staying or going?

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:11.555
ALIEN HUNTER
My box!

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:13.799
SAMURAI SNAKE
Racist!

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.672
HERO LASS
That was very sweet.

00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:19.995
HERO MAN
Well, HM would take an HJ 
as a thank you.

00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:20.758
HERO LASS
Oh...

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.886
HERO MAN: 
Okay...

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.875
HERO LASS
What's wrong, BB?

00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:26.241
BUG BOY
I'm just... not used to having
anyone up here

00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:28.157
who's a bigger dick
than your half-brother.

00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:29.669
It's kind
of weirding me out.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.051
HERO MAN
Who's dick is bigger than me?

00:04:31.052 --> 00:04:34.047
That son of a bitch ? 
I'll  fuckin kill him!!

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:35.595
Black Velvet jump!

00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:40.213
HERO MAN:
I found him!

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:42.588
Ha! Stupid Alien! Hunter.

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:45.785
His dick is not as big as mine.

00:04:46.538 --> 00:04:50.074
Oh God... Help.

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:51.527
HERO LASS:
Some things never change.

00:04:51.528 --> 00:04:52.906

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:55.757
Shelf Life!

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:57.815
Shelf Life!

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.948
Shelf!

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.867
The world needs a team of
braver smarter faster heroes

00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:13.233
THE REAPER
My minions...

00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:15.837
My precious smithereens.

00:05:15.838 --> 00:05:21.605
My reborn toys;
the day is almost upon us.

00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:26.751
You will have your queen - and 
your revenge

00:05:26.752 --> 00:05:33.193
Arise... Arise... ARISE!

00:05:33.194 --> 00:05:39.442
{Macabre laugh}
