00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.790
Well, how do you get dreads with dread perming.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.370
Well, first I would like to say that dread
perming can be done for a number of different

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.370
reasons.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.370
I'll give you two.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.529
The first is you can, depending on the texture
of your hair, if your texture tends to be

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.580
a little coarse, you can do this process of
dread perming to kind of even out and smooth

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.009
out your texture.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.250
Another reason to do dread perming is to promote
more lockage.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.620
You want the hair to really lock and when
you perm the hair and you do this dread perming

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.940
as you get the runoff, as you rinse out the
actual chemical, the hair and the chemical

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.030
kind of just lock together and that causes
you to get a tighter lock on a softer texture

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.960
of hair.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.360
But the process itself is sometimes not always
recommended and is not the best thing for

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.570
a dread lock style, because dread locks are
supposed to be natural.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.120
But there are some that like to have a more
polished natural lock, so this might be a

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.490
process for them.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.140
You first start out with using a relaxer known
as a thioglycolic acid.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.900
There are many different kinds of perms and
relaxers, but this one is particular is more

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.430
of an alkaline way of relaxing the hair.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.860
I like to refer to it as it is the step before
you perm with a permanent wave or the step

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:52.939
before smooth out of straighten or as the
step before you curl on a "jerry curl."

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.430
So what you do is you take the thioglycolic
acid and you do the first part of it which

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.240
is where it rearranges the bonds and it kind
of breaks the hair down.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.229
It swells the cuticle layer and breaks the
bonds of the hair down.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.120
Then once that chemical is actually smoothing
the hair and breaking it done, that's when

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.990
you go into your rinse out stage and you rinse
the whole thing out.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.010
In the process of rinsing, because with dread
locks the beautiful thing about them is they

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.950
don't shed, because you don't comb your hair.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.550
So all of that everyday shedding that you
would normally get when you comb your hair,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.670
it stays in your locks with dread locks.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.760
So with the dread perming as you're rinsing
out the permanent solution that shedding starts

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.800
locking in with the permed dread lock a little
more quickly.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.170
It gets softer, so now it's able to kind of
push its way down a little further into the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.000
lock.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.760
You think of that new growth that's closer
to the root starts sliding its way down further

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.020
into the lock and the lock gets a little thicker.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.650
It starts locking in a little tighter.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.130
After you rinse out the perm solution, you
neutralize and you either twist or dry depending

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.250
on what type of style you are doing afterwards,
but that is pretty much the process of doing

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.250
a dread perming.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.900
Again, it's for if you want to smooth out
the texture of your hair or if you want to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
get your dread locks to lock up a little bit
faster.
