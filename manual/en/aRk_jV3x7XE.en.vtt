00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.015
One more minute.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.718
You can really relax with this on but

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:13.205
wearing it for a long time is a bit... suffocating.

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:14.340
Ohh.
wearing it for a long time is a bit... suffocating.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.741
It's time! 

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:16.993
Three!

00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:18.127
Two!

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:19.095
One!

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:24.033
Pop!

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:25.901
So...

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:26.786
Ah! It's bright!

00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:28.688
You look like you've been sleeping.

00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:29.288
I didn't!
You look like you've been sleeping.

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:30.656
You look like you were just sound asleep.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.058
I didn't sleep!
You look like you were just sound asleep.

00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:32.742
8 hours?

00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:33.592
Yep.
8 hours?

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:34.243
8 down!

00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:36.312
8 hours down! That's Â¥8000!

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:38.764
Aimin is still...

00:00:38.764 --> 00:00:40.032
awake!!

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:41.317
You ready?

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:42.334
Let's do it.

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.235
Go for it.
Let's do it.

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:45.454
I don't like the Ostrich Pillow.

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:47.857
Let's try for anything other than that!

00:00:47.857 --> 00:00:49.191
Sounds good!
Let's try for anything other than that!

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.877
Please!

00:00:53.813 --> 00:00:54.430
Eight!

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.264
Eight!
Eight!

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:56.465
Sunbathing...

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.885
Oh no, you got that one!

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:02.121
You got sunbathing!

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:31.333
How are you enjoying the sunbathing?

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.701
There's no sun.

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:33.469
Yes there is.
There's no sun.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:34.320
No there's not!

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.571
It's radiant.
No there's not!

00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:37.823
Like, how? I'm holding an umbrella.

00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:39.820
Does it feel good?

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:44.780
It doesn't really.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.364
No?
It doesn't really.

00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:48.734
But compared to that weird little room...

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:50.920
It's much better than being cooped up in there.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.104
That's good.
It's much better than being cooped up in there.

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:53.139
Good to hear.

00:01:57.143 --> 00:01:59.128
Do you want to come to my place tonight?

00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:00.830
Huh?
Do you want to come to my place tonight?

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.881
Um...

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:03.582
What do you mean?

00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:07.820
I can't just let you leave like this. Come to mine?

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.424
I'm kind of doing this No Sleeping Challenge thing...

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.411
Forget about that and come back to mine.

00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:16.979
Really?
Forget about that and come back to mine.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.581
But...

00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:23.135
Then you'll be the one who won't get any sleep. Is that okay?

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:25.437
That's fine.

00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:31.844
That's all I've got.

00:02:31.844 --> 00:02:34.763
Oh.
That's all I've got.
