Hi! Now we're going to do the purl stitch.
The purl stitch is the opposite of a knit

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.070
stitch. When you knit and pearl, you end up
with that pretty little V stitch. You know

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.119
how knitting makes the V stitch instead of
just the bubbly stuff. If you just did all

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.019
the knit it would be all bubbly. If you did
all purl, it would be bubbly, but if you combine

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.720
knit and purl, then you get that chevron V
that knit looks like on the right side. So

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.970
now we're going to purl. So remember when
you knit you go in straight. When you purl,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.230
you're going to go and you're going to go
in the front of the stitch. See how I went

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.160
in the front of the stitch there. I kind of
hold on just so that I know I'm not going

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.710
to lose anything. You go in through the front,
around the front and back it out and slide

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.630
it off. I think purl is actually easier than
knitting. I knit in here and I look at the

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.650
stitch and it's done. I don't know. For some
reason it's like division is I think is easier

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.140
than multiplication, but anyway that's another
story. Now you put the needle in the front

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.760
of the stitch, your wrap it around the ball
yarn, and you pull it back through. We just

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.180
did 2 purls, easy. We're going to purl in
the front of the stitch, around the needle

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.710
with the yarn and back out. In the front of
the stitch. Purl means go around the yarn

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.670
and back out. In the front of the yarn, around
with the ball yarn, and back. In the front

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.990
of the stitch. See there's the purl. Wrap
it around and pull out. Front of the stitch,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:51.690
wrap it around, pull it through, front of
the stitch, pull it around, and wrap it through.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:00.020
Front of the stitch, wrap it around, and pull
it through. Front of the stitch, wrap it around

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.880
and pull it through. I brought little sample
of what the knit and purl all looks like.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.029
If you were to do completely all knit, it
would end up looking like this, like the bubbly

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:17.730
thing here. If you were to do a row of knit
and purl, then you end up...This is supposed

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.549
to be a blanket for a friend's baby. You end
up with this V, the chevron thing. This here

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.459
is a row of knit, a row of purl. This down
here is called popcorn stitch, which is usually

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.969
2 knit, 2 purls. We'll get to that eventually.
Alright.
