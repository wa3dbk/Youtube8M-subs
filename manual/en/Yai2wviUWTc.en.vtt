00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.901
- [Woman] Do it.
(coin dinging)

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.120
(typewriter keys clicking)

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.290
- [Versatile] Hey, guys, this
is Versatile from VST Power,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.640
now hosted on Project Phoenix Media.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.860
We got a really great
PS2 game tutorial today.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.930
I'm gonna show you how to play your games

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.700
from a PS2 flash drive or a
thumb drive, any thumb drive,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.960
that you plug into PS2 that
is modded, fat or slim,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.340
using Free MCBoot and OPM,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.130
and how does this work?

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.180
In past tutorials, just as a recap,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.000
in past tutorials, there's a
program called USB Extreme,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.780
and we would use this
program to rip your games

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.140
and convert 'em into
the appropriate format

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.310
for your external USB hard drive.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.320
For example, if I go to my computer here,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.480
my thumb drive is the letter D,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.450
but if I go onto USB Extreme
Hard Drive section here,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.560
letter D is not showing.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.720
How do I get my thumb
drive to show up on here?

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.930
Well, the bottom answer is you don't,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.220
so we don't need this
program for USB thumb drives,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.550
and I'll show you a
different way of doing this.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.360
So, what you wanna do
is go to your computer,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.010
plug in your thumb drive, go ahead,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.050
right-click your thumb drive,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.150
go to Format, and just make
sure it is the FAT32 format.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.770
I already did that, so we're good to go.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.300
Let me go into the thumb drive here,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.870
and I'll show you the file structure.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.930
So, ultimately you need
a CD and a DVD folder.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.640
I don't have any CD games at the moment,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.230
but if I did, I will put them in there.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.880
And then in the DVD folder,
you would have your ISOs.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.290
Just a recap, how do you get
your ISO of your PS2 game?

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.500
So, let's say, for example,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.770
that you had a PS2 disc
inserted in your computer.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.410
So, if you wanna make an ISO out of it,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.840
if you open up a program
like DVD Decrypter,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.080
or you could use a program like ImgBurn,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.570
but if you're using DVD Decrypter,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.090
just go to Mode, ISO, Read
mode, click on this button,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.830
and it's gonna rip the
ISO to your computer.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.340
Once you have done that, go
ahead, take that ISO file,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.070
and put it on your USB thumb
drive in the DVD folder.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.910
99.9% of the time, your PS2 game

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.023
is most likely going to be
a DVD image, not a CD image.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.150
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.530
I already did earlier today,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.070
and one thing you wanna do is

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.280
you want to rename the file format

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.110
in the very specific file
format for OPL to read it.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.943
So, how does this work?

00:02:02.943 --> 00:02:04.690
So, here, let me go over the structure.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.180
The first half of the file name is

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.760
like this SLUS nomenclature, right?

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.460
How do you even know what these
numbers are to begin with?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.360
So, if you mounted your ISO virtually,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.770
using like a DAEMON Tools
or a Virtual CloneDrive,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.410
or you had your actual disc inserted

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.130
in your computer disc drive,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.380
what you wanna do is just go into

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.030
the file contents of that disc,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.203
and look for the file
name that says SLUS_,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.720
and there's gonna be some digits here.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720
So, copy that, so we go back here,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.180
so that's what I did, SLUS_217.20.,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.210
and here you type in the name of your ISO,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.440
whatever you wanna call it.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.180
I decided to call it Arcana_Heart_2.iso.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.450
I could name it whatever I want to.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.150
And then also I had this other game here,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.380
Marvel vs. Capcom 2, so you sort of see

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.460
that the file structure is
very, very similar, okay?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.110
And then after you've done that,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.040
every time you add a new game
into your CD or DVD folder,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.270
every time you do that,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.090
you're going to have to
defrag your thumb drive,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.700
and this is the part that really sucks

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.380
because it is gonna take a
while to defrag a thumb drive

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.550
when compared to a USB
external hard drive.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.850
So, one program I like to
use is called Smart Defrag 3,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.120
and what you wanna do is go ahead,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.620
insert your thumb drive,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.530
and then what you wanna do is

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.850
go here, go click on the Analyze button,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.170
and then it's gonna
analyze your thumb drive,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.100
and ideally, it's gonna
say zero fragments,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.520
fragmentation rate 0%, which is great,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.330
but if it is fragmented,
then what you wanna do is

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.470
basically click on the Defrag button here,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.740
and then click on Defrag
and Fast Optimize,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.920
is what I do, and it's gonna
take like half an hour,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.410
an hour, depending on
how many games you got

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.740
on your thumb drive, of course,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.310
and then once all is said and done,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.980
you can insert it in your PS2,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.180
and you're ready to rock and roll

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.330
and have a lotta good times.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.700
If your game is fragmented,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.470
and when you insert it in your PS2,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.330
it may get stuck on those flashing colors

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.650
when you first start the game,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.833
so it's very important to
defrag your thumb drive,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.900
even though logic says

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.540
you're not supposed to
defrag your thumb drives

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.040
because it will decrease the length

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.460
of your thumb drive long-term,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.710
you got no choice here,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.810
and if you're on a budget,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.330
and you've only got like
four-gig, eight-gig,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.300
32-gig thumb drive, then that
is exactly what you gotta do.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.850
So, that's what you gotta do,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.090
and then that's pretty much it.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.510
So, to recap, get an
ISO, take that ISO file,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.060
put it on your FAT32 thumb
drive in the DVD folder,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.160
rename that ISO properly,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.700
and then defrag that thumb
drive, and you're good to go.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.680
So, with that said, let's
go straight to my TV,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.610
and show you living proof of this booting,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.680
and it's a lotta good
times, let's do this.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.570
All right, in this
portion of video tutorial,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.403
I'm gonna show you proof

00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:42.620
of loading the games
from the USB thumb drive.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.240
So here's my PS2 Slim.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.890
It's running Free MCBoot
1.94, so let's do this.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.580
Let's go back to the TV
here, go down to OPL,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.950
and let me show you a
real quick neat trick

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.743
that I did with my OPL settings.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.720
If I press the Start
button and go to Settings,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.230
go to Settings, press X,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.687
what I like to do is I like to have

00:05:02.687 --> 00:05:05.550
the USB device start mode as a Manual,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.190
so just press X, make sure
that Manual is selected,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.750
and then when I go to Default menu,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.890
I just make sure that
USB Games is selected.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.200
Press OK, click on Save changes,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.510
and then you're good to go.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.560
I press Circle.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.096
So now we just press X,

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:20.190
(controller button clicks)

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.730
and it's gonna recognize my
games off the USB thumb drives.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.950
That's awesome, and so
I've got two games here,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.610
and I'm gonna go ahead
and play the second game,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.730
which is Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.090
If your thumb drive is fragmented,

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.650
or defrag properly, for example,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.320
then you're gonna get flashing colors,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.610
it's gonna bypass this,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.803
and then you're gonna
have a lotta good times.

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:42.376
(tape whirring)

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.500
So one thing I do wanna
note is, obviously,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.260
using USB external hard
drives is the best,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.480
but if you are on a budget,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.630
and you only got thumb drives,

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.683
then that's the second-best alternative.

00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:55.718
(airy music)

00:05:55.718 --> 00:05:56.551
- [Male] Capcom!

00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:58.140
- [Versatile] All right, sweet, so we got,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.760
I will go ahead into the main menu here.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.840
- [Male] Marvel Vs. Cap--
(chord echoing)

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.673
- [Versatile] I'm just gonna go ahead

00:06:03.673 --> 00:06:05.010
and try to get into the
game real quick here,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.813
show you some quick performance.

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:12.986
(sci-fi whooshing)

00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:17.986
(rapid high-pitched swooshing)
(controller buttons clicking)

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:20.102
- [Male] All right!

00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:22.724
(metal clinking)

00:06:22.724 --> 00:06:24.724
- [Versatile] All right.

00:06:41.647 --> 00:06:42.680
(character speaking in foreign language)

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.055
All right, let's do this.

00:06:44.055 --> 00:06:45.927
(energetic battle music)

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:47.108
(character announcing in foreign language)

00:06:47.108 --> 00:06:48.560
(controller buttons clicking)

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.640
So anyways we can clearly see

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.290
that the game works fine
using a PS2 thumb drive,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.890
so if you guys have any
nit-picky questions,

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.610
then leave a comment
here on the YouTube page,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.990
and I'll get back to
you as soon as possible.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.380
Once again, thanks for watching.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.883
Take care, bye.

00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:02.162

(coin dinging)

00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:03.671
(coin dinging)

00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:04.944
