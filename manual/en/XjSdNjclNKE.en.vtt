Hi.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.280
It's Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.620
Today, we're going to show you how to change
the oven temp center on your range, and it's

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.170
a really easy job.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.919
All we're going to need is a #2 Phillips screwdriver,
or a #2 square-head screwdriver.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.889
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.670
To do this repair, we will need access to
the back of the range.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to have to pull it away from the
wall, disconnect the power, then we can remove

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.880
the back panel.Now that we've pulled the range
away from the wall and disconnected the power,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.430
we're going to remove these screws and hold
the upper back panel.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:37.440
There is typically five on each side, so using
either your #2 square-head, or the #2 Phillips

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530
screw driver will remove those screws.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.500
As you remove the final two screws at the
top of that panel, just take note how the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.190
panel tucks up in underneath the top of the
console, and then support that as you remove

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.100
the final screw.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:04.879
Just lift up in the bottom, pull it away,
carefully lower it down.This will give us

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.549
access to the temp center which is located
over the right hand side as we face the back

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.549
of it.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.450
First of all, disconnect the wire harness
connector.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.990
Depress the tap on the sensor side of that
harness.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.869
That will unlock it.Next, remove the two screws
that secure to the back, then pull the sensor

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.950
all the way through and discard it.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.240
Carefully, insert the new sensor into that
same opening.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.840
Reinstall the two screws, then reconnect the
harness, making sure that that locking tap

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.329
engages.Then we can reinstall the back panel.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:02:10.569
We take care that on those two taps, we'll
pull in behind the lip on that console.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:22.910
Then, while holding it in place, we reinstall
the two top screws.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.099
Now, with those two screws in place, we can
then probably locate the bottom of the panel.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.810
We're just going to lift that on it, set it
over the top of that center channel.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.670
Then, just make sure that it lays flat, without
any stress on it, and then replace the remaining

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.110
screws.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.379
We can now reconnect the power to the range,
then we'll push it back into place.Now that

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.401
we have the range back in place and the power
reconnected, our repair is complete.I told

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.650
you, it was an easy job.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.010
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
