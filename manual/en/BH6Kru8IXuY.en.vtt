00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.950
For this video, we want to get under the hood
so to speak of the Racepak Smart Wire and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.090
look at the technical specifications.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.850
The unit itself measures five inches by six
inches by two inches or twelve centimeters

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.490
by fifteen centimeters by five centimeters
and weighs about twenty five ounces or seven

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.160
hundred and thirty one grams.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.400
Looking first at the top of the unit you'll
see the quarter inch power stud.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.860
This is for the main positive power input
form the battery.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.590
Minimum operating voltage for the unit is
11.5 volts while the maximum operating voltage

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.980
is twenty volts.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.050
Next we have the mini USB programming port.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.900
We utilize this in order to program the Smart
Wire unit either as a stand alone unit or

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.770
in conjunction with Racepak V-net sensors.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.440
Next to the mini USB port we have two LEDs
one is the power LED and that is red when

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.680
the unit is powered on.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.710
The other one is the status LED which is green
when it is operating correctly or red when

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.310
a fuse event has been triggered.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.680
The V-net connector will connect the Smart
Wire to a Racepak data logger or other sensors.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.500
The switch connector will connect the unit
to the switch panel or switch module.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.580
Switch details can be found in the Smart Wire
switch options video found on the Smart Wire

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.580
website.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.050
At this end of the unit we find the two 23
pin connectors.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.390
Each connector contains fifteen outputs and
six inputs, that gives us a total of thirty

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.130
outputs and twelve inputs across the unit.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.530
The outputs are the actual output wires that
are routed to your accessories.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.210
The inputs are utilized for event monitoring
such as that of a transbreak event or external

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.590
manual switch connections.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.060
Now the difference between an actual switch
connection here and the switch connector that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.670
we pointed out earlier is that this one is
utilized for using the Racepak switching modules,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.909
while these are used for your own external
switches.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.880
Overall output capacity is 125 AMPs while
the current consumption is 180 milli-AMPs

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.650
in a typical wired operation.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.830
Now eight of the thirty outputs are twenty
AMP while twenty two of them are ten AMP.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.540
You can parallel wire like outputs to gain
wire AMP to a device, for example if you have

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.570
two 20 AMP outputs and you need a 40 AMP circuit,
you can go ahead and wire those two in parallel,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.849
but be careful, you should not wire a ten
AMP and a 20 AMP for example in the same output.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.439
Finally there are three ground pins and one
shut down pin located within the two 23 pin

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.439
connectors.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.060
That pretty much covers the technical specs
of the Smart Wire, thanks for watching and

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.719
if you have any other questions, remember
to take a look at the Smart Wire videos online
