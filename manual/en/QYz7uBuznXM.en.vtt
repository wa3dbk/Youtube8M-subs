Hi I'm Ann Myrick and today we are going to
talk about duplicating and kind of overkilling

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.050
a certain type of accessory. I'm a decorator
and I work with what people have and I really

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:23.670
like contrast. A lot of times a client will
find a sale on let's say blue and white pottery

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.410
and so instead of getting one great piece
they'll get eight of the same pieces and so

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.290
it just all the sudden too many pieces becomes
kind of overkill and it is not so exciting

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.010
any more because it is boring. It is like
furniture sets, the same type of furniture

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.309
in seven different pieces and after a while
it becomes very boring so what you want to

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.109
do is instead of duplicating and instead of
putting all your brass together and I don't

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:59.010
really, I'm not a brass person but a lot of
times people will use brass but don't use

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.360
it all in a big grouping together, use one
piece of brass but then different other materials.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.930
So over here I've just put a little vinuette
together of my silver and I love using silver

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.479
and I like using silver that is not polished.
I don't like that real shiny look I like more

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:27.570
of the dull old look. But it's fairly interesting.
I put some different greenery in the coffee

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.990
pot and then have a few pieces but what I
would say is instead of having all your silver

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:44.930
let's change it up and maybe just use one
great silver piece and then I have a piece

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:55.329
of McCoy with just some different dried moss
and pieces in it and then I have some fun

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:03.750
horns excuse me I'm going to grab these real
quick and I'm just going to kind of do an

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.380
interesting look over here and so you play
with it. You play with bringing, I have three

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.900
different types of items and instead of bringing
all one item or one type of material you have

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.970
the silver along with the foliage, you have
the pottery with the texture and then you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.000
just have horns that were found out in the
back yard so play with it and a lot of times

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.890
it will be much more interesting. You also
want to work with height. You want your item

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.750
to move up and down and so you want to have
good movement. This is Ann Myrick and that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.200
is how to decorate without duplicating.
