00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.870
There are somewhere around 100 billion galaxies
in the observable universe, so it might sound

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.570
hopeless to try to simulate all of them on
a computer.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.700
But that hasn't stopped scientists from trying.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.610
Wednesday, a team from MIT unveiled what's
being called the most detailed simulation

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.869
of the universe yet.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.880
In just a few minutes, you can watch dark
matter and normal matter evolve over billions

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.830
of years into a universe much like our own.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.349
The simulation, dubbed Illustris, required
enough computing power to keep the average

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.879
desktop busy for 2,000 years, but the team
managed to run it in a few months using multiple

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.019
supercomputers.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.440
The paper, published in Nature, explains how
the team modeled a small-scale universe 330

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.780
million light years across in such detail
that they could zoom in on individual galaxies.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.100
A letter from another astronomer published
alongside the paper says, "If this all sounds

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.780
somewhat complicated, do not be fooled: it
is extremely complicated."

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.719
A writer for Wired compares the task to "creating
a simulation of a person growing up that takes

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.030
into account the action of every enzyme and
DNA strand within their body."

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.119
But the result is so good, in a side-by-side
comparison with the Hubble image we showed

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.829
you earlier, it's hard to tell which universe
is the real one.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.750
The answer is the one on the left, by the
way.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.640
So why go to all the trouble to build a simulated
universe?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.640
Part of the reason is to test prevailing theories
of cosmology and see whether they work in

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.640
practice.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.790
And a Popular Science article from 2012 says
it's also to help solve mysteries.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.359
"Scientists hope these models will answer
some pressing questions about dark matter,

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.579
dark energy, and the overall structure of
the cosmos."

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.170
"It's a big step forward.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.750
It's going to be incredibly helpful to cosmologists
like me to figure out fundamental properties

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.750
of the universe."

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.069
Of course, the simulation isn't perfect.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.259
The team admits Illustris fudges the details
on supermassive black holes, the timing of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.609
star formation in early galaxies is a bit
off and, of course, it could always be more

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:55.609
detailed.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:56.609
How detailed?

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.299
Well, keep in mind a number of well-known
physicists and philosophers say we can't be

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.200
sure our own universe isn't a simulation running
on someone else's computer.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200
We could be living in the Matrix.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200
Weird thought, huh?

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.500
If you want to play around in the new simulation,
the Illustris Project's webpage has a tool

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.340
that lets you zoom in and explore their universe.
