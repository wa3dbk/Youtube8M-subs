00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.249
Today we are going to be installing wiring
harness part number 118451 on a 2008 GMC Acadia.

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:11.980
OK, we are here at the back side of the vehicle
and the attaching points for our wiring harness

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.670
are actually located directly behind the tail
light assemblies themselves on both sides

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.030
of the vehicle.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.170
So the first thing we want to do is to go
ahead and remove them.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.400
There are two black caps on each one of the
assemblies.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.440
You need to pop those back, and that will
give us access to the fasteners that are holding

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.540
the tail light assembly on.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.590
We are going to remove those fasteners and
pull the tail light assembly off to gain access

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.590
to the connectors themselves.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.190
We just take a little flatheaded screwdriver
and pop that right back.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.550
And as you can see, there is a regular hex
head screw in there.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.750
And you want to be careful when you are doing
that to make sure you do not break the locking

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.750
tabs.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420
And we are just going to take a little 7-millimeter
socket here and remove the bolts.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.570
With both screws removed, we want to go ahead
and gently pry away the tail light assembly.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.210
There are two aligning tabs here on the back
side.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.160
You want to make sure that those do not break.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.850
You just want to gently kind of wiggle it
back and forth until they release.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.999
And you can see here on the back side of the
tail light assembly the connector that we

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:13.390
are going to be plugging into.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.430
What we want to do is release the tab here.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.069
I am just going to use a little flathead screwdriver.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:22.899
And I am just going to gently pry back just
a number of releases.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.369
Our T-harness is going to plug directly in-line
here.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.369
Here on the drivers side, we want the connector
with the yellow and brown wires to plug in-line

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.369
here.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.149
We are just going to plug the black side into
the brown connector until it clicks and we

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.310
are going to plug the brown connector into
the back of the tail light housing.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.170
And again you want to push that in until it
you hear the click.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.529
All right, as you can see here there is an
opening in between the back of the vehicle

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:51.529
and the bumper here.

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:57.039
And we are going to feed all our wires down
below there and route it over the green wire

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.429
piece of the harness all the way over to the
passengers side.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.899
And as you can also see there is a ring terminal
that we are going to use for our grounding

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.959
point.

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:28.209
And there is a self-tapping screw that is
provided in the installation kit, and we are

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:44.799
just going 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:04:35.940
to screw that directly into the back 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:59.100
side 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:10.820
of the metal here.
