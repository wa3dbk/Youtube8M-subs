00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:10.356
Today we are gonna show you how to successfully install the LCD  filter screen guard.

00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:16.300
And it is one of the premium screen guard that we have available on our site at www.accessorygeeks.com

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:23.266
It is universal, comes with a nice grid, comes in three packs actually.

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:29.582
So if you messed up then you can always try another one or you can even have three phones share with a friends or stuffs like that.

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:37.756
It’s for all LCD’s screens special care for LCD screens universal. It’s removable. Anti dust and anti reflections.

00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:40.821
This is how you install it. I’m gonna do a little demo.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:49.319
First you wanna get the protector itself just measure it to where you wanna put it.

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:59.257
So you align this right here..actually I wanna mark this point you wanna cut this off at.

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:04.923
And see follow this gridlines right there.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:12.841
Let’s see, get a pair of scissors..

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.994
Get this cut part off..

00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:38.104
Let’s see now we gonna measure the width..

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.584
So wanna see what line it falls up on

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:51.804
See that is this line right there.. so I’m gonna get my scissors again and just cut that part off.

00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:58.329
The grid is very helpful and finding you know.

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:03.484
What kind of where you wanna put your hands on.

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:08.174
Then it comes with a nice little handy screen guard here for you.

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:16.789
So..or a little wiper, so wanna wipe it off before you put on anything, so it's clean and right.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:28.747
First...Take out one side ..the key is you don’t wanna touch your fingers onto that side of where you are gonna stick it.

00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:42.261
So line it up, let’s see, to that side so..

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:59.676
You wanna take it off. you need to be a little gentle with this.

00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:14.049
You really wanna try to get all the bubbles out, lets see here no bubbles

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:26.611
Then just give it a firm press, so you don’t have any bubbles left.

00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:35.249
Get rid off all the bubbles on the edges.

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:45.350
And boom there you have it, your screen protector.

00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:52.316
Wipe it off after, looks like the regular phones.

00:03:52.317 --> 00:03:57.494
For now it is protected, here it is you can see.

00:03:57.495 --> 00:04:05.574
