Hey there assassins, Gabe Graziani, your Community Developer on Assassin's Creed Unity, here with...

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.520
Ariadne MacGillivray, also your Community Developer on Assassin's Creed Unity.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.280
There's more than one now!

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.540
What are we doing here, Ari?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.460
I'm glad you asked, Gabe. We are here to learn the art of Parkour, Assassin's Creed style.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.340
Ohohoho YES!

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.460
Hi guys, my name is Steven, owner of The Spot and I'll be showing you a couple of Parkour moves today.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.500
First things first, we're going to do a warm up. It's important, y'know, get you guys ready.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.760
Get that blood flowing!

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.260
So, first technique, which is also going to be part of the warm up still, is learning how to jump.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.980
Knees high.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.240
WHOAAAAAHHHHH!!!

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.800
The Parkour experience has definitely given me a fresh perspective on the game.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.460
It made me understand the difficulties that the rigging and animation team would have to do...

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.520
to take such real life movements and integrate them into the game, because they're really not natural.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.204
To say the least.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.560
Getting really high on stuff was very... uhhh... the fear of heights, I guess.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.460
Once I actually jumped, it was a lot of fun and just... phew... releasing!

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.940
Keep going!

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.160
Arno does it so easily, it's hard to imagine how hard it really is when you actually do it.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.680
CHEERS!

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.560
LAUGHTER

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.080
Now you have to get out!

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.040
Yes Ari!

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.160
Like, the best part is, that's the most terrifying thing I've ever done, and then I'm trapped in the foam!

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.280
Still!

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.265
So many parts of me hurt!

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.100
And this here, this is never going to be okay...

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.917
This is never going to be okay!

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.820
I didn't twist it, I just... I pulled the Achilles tendon.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.820
It's like... because it was that jump thing. I wanted so bad to succeed.

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:05.595
Ow, it hurst to laugh!

00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:10.214
Well, thank you for bearing with us, Assassins.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.655
We want to thank The Spot for having us and teaching us this horrible art form.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:19.578
Uhhh, we want to thank UbiWorkshop for giving us these wonderful tank tops and t-shirts.

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:23.578
And I just want everyone to know that Parkour is garbage and no one should ever do it.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.760
It's the worst.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.377
We're never doing this again.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.400
This was a huge mistake.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.580
PARKOUR!!
