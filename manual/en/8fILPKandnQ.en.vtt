00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.665
(music)

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.598
&gt;&gt; WE'RE ABOUT A TWO HOUR DRIVE

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:06.031
FROM DALLAS.

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.265
ABOUT 13 MILES FROM

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.431
WICHITA FALLS.

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:10.398
&lt;i&gt;&gt;&gt; IN THE SPRING,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.631
&lt;i&gt;LAKE ARROWHEAD STATE PARK&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.365
&lt;i&gt;CAN BE A COLORFUL PLACE,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.531
&lt;i&gt;RIGHT DOWN TO THE WATER.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.431
&gt;&gt; WE ARE ON THE

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:18.931
LITTLE WICHITA RIVER,

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.265
A TRIBUTARY TO THE RED RIVER.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.198
IRON ORE IN THE SOIL TINTS THE

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.598
WATER TO THE REDDISH TINT,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.165
AND THAT'S WHERE THE RED RIVER

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.331
GETS ITS NAME.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.931
(bird singing)

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:31.665
WE'VE GOT QUITE A BIT

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.031
OF WILDLIFE.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.298
WE'RE KIND OF A QUIET GETAWAY.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.698
WHEN MOTHER NATURE SHINES ON US,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.665
PEOPLE COME TO SEE US.

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.698
&lt;i&gt;&gt;&gt; BUT EVEN WHEN NATURE&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.265
&lt;i&gt;ISN'T SO SHINY,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.465
&lt;i&gt;THERE'S REASON TO VISIT&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.231
&lt;i&gt;LAKE ARROWHEAD.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.198
&gt;&gt; THE STRONG PULL HERE

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.598
IS FISHING.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.865
IT'S AN EXCELLENT CRAPPIE LAKE.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.798
&gt;&gt; THEY LIKE TO BITE IN THESE

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.031
OVERCAST DAYS,

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.998
IF YOU CAN DODGE THE RAINDROPS.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.631
YOU'VE GOT TO CHASE

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.598
THEM SOMETIMES.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:57.265
...AND IT'S NOT LOOKING VERY

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.531
GOOD IN THIS SPOT.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.798
(laughs)

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.531
(fish flopping)

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.265
&gt;&gt; CATCH SOME BIG ONES,

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.498
CATCH SOME LITTLE ONES.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.265
&gt;&gt; VERY VERY LARGE ONES

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.465
IN THIS LAKE.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.298
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A BIG FISH.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.165
&gt;&gt; THIS IS ONE OF THE PREMIER

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.198
CRAPPIE LAKES IN TEXAS.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.398
&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT MONSTER!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.498
&gt;&gt; OKAY. NO, DON'T TAKE A

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.398
PICTURE OF THAT ONE.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.265
&gt;&gt; THEY GET BIGGER THAN THAT,

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.298
HUH?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.098
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING LOOKS BIGGER

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.298
ON FILM.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.031
&gt;&gt; THAT'S QUICK RELEASE

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.098
RIGHT THERE.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.798
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S EVERYBODY WANT

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.565
TO DO TOMORROW?

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.731
DAVID, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.765
&lt;i&gt;&gt;&gt; IN THE CAMPING AREA,&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.298
&lt;i&gt;THE WARBURTON FAMILY ISN'T&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.331
&lt;i&gt;LETTING THE RAINY WEATHER&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.098
&lt;i&gt;SPOIL THEIR FUN EITHER.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.865
&gt;&gt; DID YOU GUYS FIND ANY OF THE

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:32.731
HIKING TRAILS WHEN YOU WENT

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:33.698
FISHING TODAY?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.598
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.465
YES.

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.365
PAPA SHOWED US ONE.

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.465
&gt;&gt; WE LIVE IN DUNCAN, OKLAHOMA,

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.231
WHICH IS ABOUT AN HOUR

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.498
AND A HALF FROM HERE.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.031
DAD LIVES IN FORT WORTH,

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.831
AND A COUPLE TIMES OF YEAR

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.865
WE JUST PICK A SPOT,

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.565
PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS A STATE PARK

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.965
AND MEET UP.

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.631
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO. HA!

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:50.565
&gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD WAY TO

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.798
GET AWAY FROM IT ALL.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.565
YOU KNOW,

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.265
GIVE PEOPLE TIME TO VISIT.

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.031
AND THE PUPPIES LIKE IT TOO.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:56.798
ALRIGHT DAVID,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.798
DO YOU WANT TO LEAD THE WAY?

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.165
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.765
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW WE ARE THE ONLY

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.098
TEXAS STATE PARK WITH

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.931
A DISC GOLF COURSE.

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:04.798
YOU CAN TAKE A REGULAR

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.398
FRISBEE AND PLAY IT.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.198
YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF THROWS

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.931
LIKE STROKES ON A BALL.

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:11.431
&gt;&gt; YEAH!

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.365
(motor chugging)

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.898
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A WORKING OIL WELL

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.965
PUMP JACK IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:20.031
OUR CAMPGROUND, AND UH,

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:21.665
IT WAS HERE BEFORE WE BECAME

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.298
A STATE PARK.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.865
OUT IN THE LAKE THERE ARE

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.198
OIL DERRICKS STILL STANDING

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.631
OUT THERE,

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:28.765
WHICH MAKES EXCELLENT

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.365
FISH HABITAT.

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:31.865
NOW WE ALSO HAVE OUR

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:33.031
PRAIRIE DOG TOWN.

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.365
(prairie dog barking)

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:37.331
WE ARE ONE OF THE EASTERN-MOST

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.131
POINTS, UH, FOR THE

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.998

AND BARK AT YOU AND GREET YOU

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.965
WHENEVER YOU COME OUT.

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:49.665
A LOT OF FOLKS COME OUT

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:52.731
JUST TO SEE THE PRAIRIE DOGS.

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:56.031
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE NATURE A

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:57.131
LITTLE BIT CLOSER THAN YOU

00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:58.498
CAN IN SOME AREAS.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.431
(geese honking, flapping)

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:02.565
&lt;i&gt;&gt;&gt; ALTHOUGH THIS WEEKEND LEAVES&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:03.765
&lt;i&gt;THE WARBURTONS WITH ONE&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.265
&lt;i&gt;PARTICULAR IMPRESSION OF&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:06.798
&lt;i&gt;LAKE ARROWHEAD...&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.065
&gt;&gt; UH, WET?

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:10.031
(laughs)

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:11.465
&lt;i&gt;&gt;&gt; ...THEY PLAN TO RETURN ONE&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:13.498
&lt;i&gt;BRIGHTER DAY DOWN THE ROAD.&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.798
&gt;&gt; WE'LL BE BACK.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.898
REALLY INEXPENSIVE WAY TO HAVE

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.798
A GOOD TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.065
&gt;&gt; READY TO GO BACK TO CAMP?

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:22.898
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
