00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.020
Lovebirds do not need to live in a couple

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.020
... a human can be their partner

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.440
The name of these parrots

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.960
was translated into English as Lovebirds

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.900
and into Polish as the inseparable.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.500
Eventually they are believed

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.620
to be only able to live in a couple

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.220
with another bird of their species.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.160
However, as a matter of fact,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.040
the Lovebirds just as all other parrots

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.120
can be kept separately as companion birds.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.460
Just as in the case of all other parrots,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.260
they require a lot of our time and attention.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.660
All parrots are social animals

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.000
which can only live a satisfying life

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.380
when accompanied by other individuals.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.600
This is why

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.740
the Lovebird as well as any other bird

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.020
can’t allowed to be lonely.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.840
If we want to have a domesticated bird

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.360
which would be a part of our family,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.720
it must be kept separately, not in a couple.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.240
This applies to Lovebirds

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.860
as well as to all other parrots.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.940
But there is a very important condition –

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.440
as a parrot must always have a partner,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.980
this partner should be a human.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.560
One of the family members – a guardian.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.680
These ubiquitous, joyful

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.600
and outgoing little birds,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.600
always curious and ready

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.180
to discover the big world.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.380
If only they are hand-fed

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.420
and are accompanied by humans

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.860
since the very first days of their lives,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.740
they can become amazing companion birds

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.780
and are always great friends with children.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.400
Both little parrots you can see

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.280
belong to a species called Fischer’s Lovebirds.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800
The green and yellow Lovebird

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.600
has a natural color

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.740
and it looks just like a wild-type

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.380
in its natural environment.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.380
The one on my hand

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.900
is a human bread color mutation.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.900
It’s not an adult yet

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.660
and when it grows older

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.080
its feathers will have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.460
a more intensively blue color.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.820
While its beak will turn red.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.420
The natural habitat of these birds

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.960
are the African savannahs,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.960
where they live in big flocks.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.460
For over two hundred years

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520
different species of Lovebirds

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.660
have been bred by humans all over the world.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.040
Very often the breeders

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.920
are passionate about these birds

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.700
and thanks to this passion

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.980
many different color mutations were created

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.340
and new ones are still being created.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.880
In their natural habitat

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.260
the dominating color of Fischer’s Lovebird is green.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.680
The most popular human breed mutations are

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.700
yellow, white, blue,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700
cobalt, violet and grey.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.600
They're quite loud,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.340
but with their friendly disposition

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.280
they win the sympathy of their guardians,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.300
who often have a very close relation with them.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.580
Thanks to their small size

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.040
the Lovebirds are pets,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.220
which are satisfied with our apartments.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.740
Even with the very small ones.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.060
If you are interested in

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.400
having a little feathered friend like this,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.960
we invite you to the Parrot Shop in Warsaw.
