DADDY TROY: Welcome back to Gear Daddy. I’m
your host, Daddy Troy and today we’re looking

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:04.090
at nail clippers for babies.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:19.410
This one has a magnifying glass and this one
has LEDs.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.320
Right out of the womb a baby’s fingernails
are already growing and a bay can reach up

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.090
and scratch his or her face. It is incumbent
upon you, the new parent, from day zero, to

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.640
go ahead and cut your kid’s fingernails.
But cutting a kid’s fingernails is actually

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.679
very difficult. They’re small. They’re
hard to see. You can’t use adult sized clippers.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.019
Occasionally you’ll cut too close, maybe
even cause the child to bleed at which point

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:42.429
it will hate you forever.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.449
Today we’re looking at two tricked out nail
clippers. The first one is from a company

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.289
called the first years although it is branded
with American Red Cross. It has a folding

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.539
mechanism that allows you to engage the clippers
and the trick to this one is that it has a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.769
magnifying glass that clicks into place. Put
it over your baby’s fingernail and begin

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:11.759
to cut. The magnifying glass is a 4x so it
helps you see more accurately. I’m a little

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:19.270
bit worried about this particular one because
it is a little flimsy but it locks down nicely.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.700
The second one is from Safety First. When
you open the arm on this clipper a little

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:37.590
switch turns on two LED lights, which then
allow you to cut the nails. I know I’ll

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.119
be cutting my child’s nails and my head
is really close to their hands, which blocks

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.290
out a lot of light. You’ll also notice that
it is really sturdy. I can drop it and it

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.550
isn’t going to break. It also has on the
back of it this little plus sign where you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.290
can insert an emery board and manicure your
baby’s nails for that big night out. You

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.069
really want to do this because once they’ve
been cut infants and newborns can still scratch

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.069
themselves.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.820
Both of them are really cheap. This one is
about $2.50 and this one 5 bucks. They make

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.840
a great thing to put on your baby registry
for that cheap relative who may not be ready

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.340
to pony up for the monster crib.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.200
We’ll see you next week on Gear Daddy when
we talk about the Electric Food Processor

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.650
and making your own baby food.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.870
Thanks as always to our sponsor Baby Bjorn.
