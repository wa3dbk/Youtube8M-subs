We imagine a world where all the
surface of our skin

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:09.885
will become a chameleon.

00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:15.500
In time, the actual epidermis becomes
active and animated.

00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:19.690
We move from digital tattoos into
completely switchable skins.

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:24.333
We're Studio XO, we're a fashion
technology company based in London.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.531
I'm Nancy Tilbury and I'm
creative director.

[NX-MATERIALISED
BEHIND THE SCENES]

00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:36.391
We were sent four pages from
Lexus as we began the project.

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:40.190
For us it's a couture project where
we're able to really experiment

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:43.726
and in this instance push materials
and the thinking around

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.101
man and machine to the absolute
extreme.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:48.856
And we wanted to really explore the
human body

00:00:49.018 --> 00:00:51.858
with the facets of the carving merged
upon it.

00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:57.181
Almost as if the machine had taken
over the body for a period of time.

00:00:58.373 --> 00:01:01.690
Cars, they carry our motion,
so we design everything.

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:05.471
Motion is such a big driver in
everything we do

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:10.760
and the relationship between us and
our machines now, our technology,

00:01:10.923 --> 00:01:13.440
is a really interesting thing for us.

00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:16.241
The first image that we saw of the NX,

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:18.365
it sort of greeted us with this
real power.

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:21.416
It's framed itself as if a face.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.918
It's grill, the structure of the eyes.

00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:27.738
We really started to think about
the car as hero.

00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:32.923
This combination interface between
the car and human beings.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:37.291
The interior of the car was, for us,
really inspiring

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:40.286
because actually it resembles the
interior of the human body

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.930
and we had been talking a lot
about the relationship

00:01:42.093 --> 00:01:43.323
between man and machine.

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:47.570
It's this beautiful deep red, which
I'm utterly fascinated with

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.950
because of the relationship to the
human body.

00:01:50.113 --> 00:01:53.838
So each of these facets that are green
screened in the 3D printed nails,

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.093
in here the surfaces will animate,
so we're going to imply

00:01:57.256 --> 00:02:01.545
these structures of the body that have
almost digital skins attached to them.

00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:07.433
And through that I want to create a
running river of red accents.

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:09.670
And it's the same when you look in
the stitching,

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:13.003
it's got those accents here,
and that will come through

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.925
in digital stitching through the
surface of the nails.

00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:22.646
The starting point for the project
was,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.511
we start with a mood board,
theme board,

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:27.766
we took all the colors and angles,
and then we'll sketch.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.058
So we did a series of drawings and
we start to think about

00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:36.120
how we visualize those in three
dimensional data.

00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:39.951
We do a lot of work with plug-ins like
Grasshopper and Rhino,

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:42.878
so we would immediately move into
that space where we're mapping

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.248
the body so that the silhouette is
completely authentic.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.706
We'll then start to prototype in card
to get the right form and shape

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.508
so we will be moving between the
digital and the physical all the time.

00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.720
And that's inherent in everything
we do at Studio XO.

00:02:57.448 --> 00:03:00.076
And then we've been green screening,
so literally

00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:02.743
spray canning things and
using nail varnish.

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:05.438
We're like magpies, stealing things
from other industries

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:08.863
to create the end result which is
this big narrative.

00:03:12.563 --> 00:03:16.013
Then we moved it into the film space,
we've built our own set

00:03:16.178 --> 00:03:20.055
so we're using beautiful materials
like perspex where you can get this

00:03:20.218 --> 00:03:23.130
real resonance in terms of echoes
and shadows.

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:25.851
And that's inherent in all the things
that we're doing,

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:29.775
almost moving between the angles,
almost like a liquid interface.

00:03:30.378 --> 00:03:33.710
We love the idea that you wear a car.

00:03:33.873 --> 00:03:37.546
The interface between the body and
the machine becomes minimal,

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.628
or completely non-existent.

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:42.730
At the moment everything we live
with technology around us,

00:03:42.893 --> 00:03:44.693
but when we start living with
technology in us,

00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:48.541
then thinking about how that changes
our relationship

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.950
with the other bits of technology that
we have,

00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:56.421
who's to say that one day the car
might really understand how you feel,

00:03:56.585 --> 00:04:00.343
where you want to go, actually
have a synergetic relationship

00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:03.810
with such an important part about
our modern life.
