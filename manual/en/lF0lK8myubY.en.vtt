00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.600
Howdy! I'm Kendrick, also known as the Dapper Dan of Reman.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.000
But today, you can me sheriff as I mosey through the updates and upgrades

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that make the A618 and its posse, the 47RE, 47RH, and 48RE, 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.900
some of ETE Reman's most wanted transmissions.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.200
So saddle up and roll out because this is one bad buckaroo.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.600
Now, don't let its 4 speeds fool you. With updates throughout to improve function and durability,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.000
the A618 is one of the meanest transmissions this side of the Mighty Mississip.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A fully remanufactured valve body, with an updated throttle valve,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
manual valve, 4-spool switch valve, and pressure regulator valve,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
means the A618 has got some extra giddy-up without kickin' like a mule.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And further valve body modifications allow the torque converter to charge in park,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.500
increasing durability, enhancing gear engagement, and leaving all the other hombres in the dust.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
As if that ain't as impressive as a new pair of boots,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.000
the A618 has a new lockup lining on diesel and heavy-duty gasoline applications.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This gamblin' trans wouldn't be worth a lick if it didn't have more than a few clutch updates, too.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Fortunately, its got a few aces up its sleeve.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The updated overdrive direct clutch includes a 10-plate clutch with new thrust plate

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
for increased durability. And the high-reverse 4-plate clutch has been updated

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
on gasoline and diesel applications.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.500
And, with an updated 5-pinion overdrive planetary assembly,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.500
and an oversized low-reverse brake band strut to maintain correct band clearance,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.000
the A618 won't slip or buck you off.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And last but not least on this update bandwagon, 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the output shaft has been custom-machined to fit both late- and early-style driveshaft yokes.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So when you need a fully remanufactured A618 that's like new, only better – 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and will likely outdrink you in a sarsaparilla-swilling contest – 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
look no further than ETE Reman.
