00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.440
The crew of STS-131 returned home to Houston
following their fifteen days in space aboard

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.439
shuttle Discovery.
“Nice landing. Well done.”

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.880
A crowd of several hundred well-wishers greeted
the seven astronauts at Ellington Field after

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.599
their flight from the Kennedy Space Center
one day after their safe landing.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.930
“It’s a very special day and we’re very
happy to be back in Houston. We were very

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.503
happy to be back in Florida yesterday.”
The Discovery crew spent ten of their fourteen

00:00:40.503 --> 00:00:45.219
days in orbit docked to the International
Space Station. They delivered science racks,

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.510
new crew sleeping quarters, and several additional
tons of equipment and supplies. During three

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.800
spacewalks, the crew installed a new ammonia
storage tank for the station's cooling system,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.289
replaced a gyroscope for the station's navigation
system and retrieved a Japanese experiment

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.070
from outside the Kibo laboratory for examination
on Earth.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.270
Joining Commander Alan Poindexter on the flight
was Pilot Jim Dutton and Mission Specialists

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.690
Rick Mastracchio, Dottie Metcalf-Lindenburger,
Stephanie Wilson, Clay Anderson, and Japan

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.350
Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Naoko
Yamazaki.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.250
The first images are in from NASA’s Solar
Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, and scientists

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.009
who study the sun say they are a stunning
treasure trove of data about Earth’s star.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.320
“The first images are now in hand and these
are truly spectacular and they show the details

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.510
of our sun that have not been available to
us before in a comprehensive and multidimensional

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.859
manner.”
“Ignition and lift-off of the Atlas-5 with

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:54.020
the Solar Dynamics Observatory.”
Launched on Feb. 11, 2020, SDO is the most

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.960
advanced spacecraft ever designed to study
the sun. SDO’s images confirm an unprecedented

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.170
new capability for heliophysics to better
understand our sun’s dynamic processes and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.550
how and why these solar activities affect
everything on earth.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.470
“SDO is the first mission in the Living
With A Star program. It’s designed to study

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.500
the sun, and how the sun affects us here on
earth. Most of the affects come from the magnetic

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.360
field of the sun, and we’re going to see
today that, that magnetic field is never the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.330
same twice, it’s always changing.”
During its five-year mission, SDO will provide

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.280
images with clarity ten times better than
high-definition television and will return

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.530
more comprehensive science data faster than
any other solar observatory spacecraft.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.030
NASA helped celebrate Earth Day's fortieth
anniversary with nine consecutive days of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.750
activities and public exhibits on the National
Mall in Washington.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.450
The 'NASA Village' of three domed tents highlighted
how NASA science and technology has helped

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.250
advance knowledge and awareness about our
home planet with exhibits and hands-on demonstrations

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.550
of environmental technologies developed by
NASA, and multimedia presentations by NASA

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:15.400
scientists and others.
Robonaut 2, or R2, as it, or he, is also known,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.630
is scheduled to become the first human-like
robot to take up permanent residence on the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.480
International Space Station.
The 300-pound robot consists of a head, a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.760
torso, and two arms and legs. Developed under
a cooperative agreement by NASA and General

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.230
Motors, R2 was designed to assist and work
alongside humans, whether in space or at manufacturing

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.370
plants on Earth.
R2 will head into space later this year aboard

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.410
space shuttle Discovery. Once aboard the ISS,
R2 will be confined to operations in the station's

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.230
Destiny laboratory. However, future enhancements
and modifications may allow it to move more

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.290
freely around the station's interior or even
outside the complex.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:06.520
Discovery’s launch on STS-133 is targeted
for September 16.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.020
Hundreds of students from middle schools,
high schools, and colleges representing 20

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.850
states were in northern Alabama for the annual
Space Launch Initiative, or LaunchFest.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.910
Each year, NASA challenges young, aspiring
rocketeers from around the country to design

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.470
and build these launch vehicles complete with
a working science payload, then send them

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.810
aloft, here at LaunchFest, to an altitude
of one mile.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.760
LaunchFest is meant to inspire students to
combine engineering practices with high-flying

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.030
creativity and pursue long-term goals as professionals
in the STEM fields of science, technology,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.100
engineering and math.
Launchfest is organized by the Marshall Space

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.440
Flight Center and sponsored by ATK Aerospace
Systems.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.900
The STS-130 crew paid a visit to NASA Headquarters
where they played highlights of their February

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.070
mission to the International Space Station
for employees and guests. The six-astronaut

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.280
crew of space shuttle Endeavour was commanded
by George Zamka; Terry Virts was the pilot;

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.360
Mission Specialists were Nicholas Patrick,
Bob Behnken, Steve Robinson and Kay Hire.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.570
Among the number of other D.C. area events,
the STS-130 crew members talked about their

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.930
mission with local students at the Smithsonian’s
Air and Space museum.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:33.600
“3-2-1 and liftoff of the space shuttle
Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.240
 -- our window on the universe.”
On April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.940
launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery from
the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Since

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.170
then, the observatory orbiting 350 miles above
Earth has produced hundreds of thousands of

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.770
unprecedented images of different corners
of the universe.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:01.060
“Not many humans get to work on things that
a hundred years from now history will remember,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.639
Hubble is certainly one of them.”
Named after the American astronomer Edwin

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.650
Hubble, the telescope’s gaze has helped
determine the age of the universe, the identity

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.800
of quasars, and the existence of dark energy.
Hubble is one of NASA's most successful and

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.669
long-lasting science missions, shedding light
on many of the great mysteries of astronomy.

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.240
And that’s This Week @ NASA.
