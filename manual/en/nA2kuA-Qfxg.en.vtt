00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.520
Welcome to Railay beach on the Andaman sea
in Thailand.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.730
It's on a small peninsula accessible only
by boat due to the high limestone cliffs which

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:47.280
isolate it from the rest of the Southern Thai
mainland.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.170
Railay is a good destination for honeymooners
and families, but the dramatic cliffs make

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.750
Railay especially popular with rock climbers.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:06.680
Adventure travelers will find private beaches,
hidden caves and lakes.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:16.979
Other activities are accessible to anyone
like hiking, sunbathing, snorkeling, swimming

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.960
or kayaking in the warm emerald sea.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.070
Or just enjoy a walk on the beach.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.180
After a few hours here just about everyone
will have worked up an apatite.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.670
You don't need to worry about that.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.440
Railay may be isolated, but this is Thailand
and if you can't get to the restaurant, the

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.990
restaurant comes to you.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.230
Every day along the beach you can find these
long tail boats with self contained floating

00:01:48.230 --> 00:02:04.250
kitchens and a crew of cooks.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.979
It's not just sea food on offer, there's just
about everything: fruits and vegetables, grilled

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.701
chicken, hamburgers and sandwiches, kabobs,
cake, coke, shakes and beer, and ever type

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:29.620
of Thai dish.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.120
One favorite is listed as Thai Pancake, or
what the Thais call Roti.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.450
The cook starts with a ball of pastry dough
and spins, slaps and stretches it over a smooth

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.799
surface like this.

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:59.650
Then it's fried in oil.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.190
Roti is a term used for many types of flat
bread.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:22.579
This one is the most popular in Thailand and
it is a specialty of the Southern Thai Muslims.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.519
The burner is fired using propane tanks kept
in the boat.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:04:01.739
After one side has become golden brown she
flips and folds it over.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:13.319
A moment is taken to pose for tourist photos.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:26.860
At the same time, another crew member is making
fruit shakes in the aft.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.650
The blender is connected to a power inverter
which is connected to the boat's battery,

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.630
which is charged from an old automobile engine.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.410
It's this same motor with a propeller on the
end of a long drive shaft that gives the boat

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.690
its name and distinct appearance.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:57.070
The Roti chef has finished cooking and cuts
the bread into bite sized pieces.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:18.440
Sweetened condensed milk is poured over the
top and it's served.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.790
