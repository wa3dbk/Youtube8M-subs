00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.520
Welcome to my kitchen in London 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.760
It's Antonio Carluccio speaking to you

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.800
I want to show you how to make the dish that I've accompanied all of my life 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.911
It is called Tiramisu and is well known by now

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.400
and the translation means 'lift me up it's a
wonderful day'

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040
Tiramisu, this is vey simple

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.180
and what I want is the wonderful yolk of the egg

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.120
and then we have a sort of sugar. This is vanilla sugar.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.340
The vanilla sugar you'll do it in putting a vanilla pod into a vanilla bowl

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.350
unless you want to do it very short and then you use a little bit of vanilla essence.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.539
Which tends to be a good one. Just a little drop

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.999
Like this... that's enough and then we start to mix it together.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.120
because now is coming

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.930
to be very good it should be sour

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.400
and then you start to beat it together like this but I need a bit of milk

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.300
It is sometimes a little bit too hard

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.600
that should become a lovely, lovely cream which you don't cook

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.240
and now you start to...stir it.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.380
You can add cream if you like, but I prefer to keep it on the lower calorie side

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.920
because there's already a lot there

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.660
Wonderful. And you can do it by sitting down. You come home and you're tired in the evening

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.570
and you can do it but is it being down
is a lovely thing

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.600
it's starting to become smooth

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.880
So now is coming is the assembly

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.900
and for that I need the very famous espresso

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.900
Strong and nice. We add a little bit of sugar.  

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.880
and we add a little kahlua. Kahlua is a liquor. 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.119
Coffee liquor which adds a little bit of kick.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.079
Just fantastic.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.780
So you stir it well there

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.210
because now we're coming to the assembly. In single cups/

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.110
and the most important thing is now to dip this

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.880
spongy finger

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.720
it's very, very spongy and will absorb quite a lot of coffee. So very briefly 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.519
into the coffee, which is still hot. Then I break it two

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.140
now we put a little bit on top.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.320
and then this one as well. So you dip it very, very quickly

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.180
So it absorbs enough to become nice

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.000
it's a dessert, it's enough because you don't want to stuff your face

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.871
So the last bit

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.090
You see it shouldn't be super beautiful, because in Italy very often they say  

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.440
Brutto Ma Buono

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.100
Which means ugly but good. So I don't use very much time for the decoration

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.540
Yes, the only thing that I want to add is just a little cocoa powder

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.940
just the little cocoa powder sorry this
is the last the last bit of a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.480
So this is the last, last bit of decoration

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.720
Don't put too much cocoa powder otherwise it surrounds all your bars.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.320
and this is the Antonio Carluccio Tiramisu, which made like this is just wonderful
