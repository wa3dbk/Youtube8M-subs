Hi there, my name is Lars. Today we're going
to talk about how to draw a dragon. Dragon's

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.780
are really interesting shapes. I'm going to
take my marker right away with this one, because

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.390
I have a face painter that used to draw really
awesome dragons, and she always did real black

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.820
and white dragons, which obviously, those
are really, well, people get tattoos maybe

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:40.050
of dragons, and that's what I thought we'll
do on this one. You start with, and once again,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.730
it's like an S shape I've penciled in here,
and it goes like that. You take your line

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:56.600
down, get the front part of it, and then let
this other side just swosh out, because it's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:07.560
like spikes on it here in the back, almost
like a horse in the beginning. I've got a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.530
really good brush marker. This one's a good
brush marker. They have, dragon's have wings,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.310
almost like bats, bat wings. And this is great
fantasy art, I've always liked fantasy. Alright,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:37.229
comes out, tail, and you can continue the
stroke of the spikes on the back of it to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:47.780
give that good look. Here's the legs, the
feet. Where's the other one? We'll do this

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:56.750
leg right here. So, it's almost fun, you can
almost have, well my slogan always is, is

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.440
artainment. Try to have fun with it, try not
to get too up tight with things, and that's

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.289
what I love about art. And here's the other
wing. We can do a smaller one on this side.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:28.260
Looks like he's burning up his arm. Erase
the pencil marks, especially when you do on

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:39.290
ink, and maybe throw a little flame in there
real quick. Waaa. Alright, here's your dragon.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.300
Hope you enjoyed that. Gives you a little
explanation how to draw a dragon, s shape.
