Hi, my name's Pete. I'm an IELTS tutor and the company director of e-englishteacher.com.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What you're looking at here is the sample IELTS Academic Writing Task 1 chart

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from the official IELTS website.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It might be a good idea if you pause the video for a 
 minute at this point to have a look at the chart.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
As you probably know, in IELTS Academic Writing Task 1

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.500
you have to summarise the information in a chart, graph, table or diagram.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
You may also know that it's important to start your summary

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.500
with a sentence paraphrasing the introduction you are given.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.500
In other words it's important to reword the introduction rather 
 than just copy it or copy parts of it.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.500
and in this video I'd like to give you 
 three quick tips for how to do this.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:23.500
The first tip is to change the word 
 'shows' to 'illustrates' or 'provides information about'.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.000
The second tip is for introductions that contain the phrase 'the number of',

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to change this phrase to 'how many'.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.500
If the introduction contains the phrase 'how many' you 
 can change it to 'the number of'.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.000
The third tip is to look at the chart, graph, table or diagram

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and check to see if there are any words or phrases you could use

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to replace words or phrases in the introduction.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.500
In this example we could replace the information about the time 'in three periods'

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.000
with the three years given in the chart.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This now only leaves us with a couple of phrases to change.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.500
And here we have it, a paraphrased introduction.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.500
If you practice paraphrasing introductions to IELTS Academic Writing Task 1

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.500
charts, graphs, tables and diagrams,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.500
you should find it easier and quicker to write 
 an introduction in your IELTS Writing test.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500
