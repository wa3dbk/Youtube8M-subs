bjbj &gt;&gt; RYAN: Hey what's up guys? This is
Ryan from TheWorkoutCorner.com and today we're

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.150
going to do a basic overview of fat loss in
regards to getting you a six-pack and more

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.120
muscle definition. So kind of a basic formula
is that fat loss occurs when you consume fewer

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.249
calories than your body is burning. So that's
obviously a kind of simplified definition

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:34.180
one caveat being that just dropping your calories
by 50% is not going to mean you're going to

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.800
start hitting rapid fat loss. If you've got
your calories too much your body's going to

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.500
kind of go into starvation mode where it lowers
your overall metabolism and is going to prevent

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.770
you from burning fat. So you want to a slow
safe reduction in calories, nothing drastic.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.030
So a good analogy to think of when it comes
to fat loss is boiling a pot of water on a

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:09.390
stove. And think of the water as the fat and
we want to evaporate that and burn that off.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.930
Now you can't look at a pot on a stove with
water in it and say "Okay I want the water

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.440
in just this corner of the pot to get evaporated.
That's not how it works. The whole pot is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.520
going to boil water and the water level is
going to lower evenly for the most part as

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.800
the heat rises up. And that's very similar
to the way that you burn fat off your body.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.440
The burner underneath the pot that is going
to be equivalent to your cardio, so that's

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.200
what's heating up and that's what's evaporating
the water and for fat loss that's what's turning

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.130
on your body and getting the metabolism up
and helping you burn some fat. Weight lifting

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.090
is also important for burning fat because
that is equivalent to the conductivity of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.869
the pot that you're using. So if you have
a copper or a brass pot that's going to transfer

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.710
heat a lot quicker and heat up the water a
lot faster than if you had a pot made out

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.310
of wood. I mean eventually that would probably
catch fire but initially you put that on a

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.870
stove it's not really going to heat up the
water because the wood is just not going to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.380
transfer the heat. So it's important to realize
that both cardio and weight lifting used together

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.380
are going to help you get the fastest results.
