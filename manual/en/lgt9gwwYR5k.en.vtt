00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:01.117
- Well hello everyone.

00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:02.133
My name is Tyler Oakley

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.941
and I am just hanging out here in London

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:05.952
with the one and the only,

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:07.943
I don't know why I'm clapping, Tanya Burr.

00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:09.122
- Hi Guys.

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.727
- And we've just been hanging out.

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:11.986
We were supposed to film today,

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:13.185
but what did we do?

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.562
- Tyler slept all day.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.269
- I literally woke up at four pm.

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.057
- I had to go out for a bit,

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:20.154
and I explained the day before

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:21.779
how I had a three hour meeting,

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.836
then I had a gym appointment,

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.176
and I was like I'm gonna
go out for five hours,

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:25.822
I feel so bad leaving you all day.

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:26.818
I came home.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.910
Jim said he was asleep.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.698
- Still snoring, but apparently I snore.

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:31.491
- Snoring, yeah.

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.177
- Great, I'm glad to hear that

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:35.635
that I'm just a glamorous
nighttime human being.

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:36.306
How do you sleep?

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:37.586
I sleep apparently like this.

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:40.369
- I sleep on the side with my legs

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:43.559
one underneath and one (mumbling).

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.245
- OK, samsies-ish.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.119
- If it's really hot.

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:47.053
It's so hot in my room.

00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:48.557
- Well right now we are just having

00:00:48.557 --> 00:00:49.837
a little slumber party.

00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:51.259
We've just gotten dinner,

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:52.255
and then we came back.

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:53.535
We were watching "Modern Family".

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.611
- Yeah.
- And just chilling.

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:55.749
- Drinking red wine.

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:56.867
- Having some red wine.

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:58.228
- I can't believe that we're filming this

00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:01.031
because I just told Jim that
I was gonna put Tyler to bed.

00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:01.682
That sounds weird--

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:03.713
- Well I was like wait,
I have to make a video

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:04.973
because Friday's coming

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:05.806
and I was like you know what,

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:06.903
I need to say hey to the people

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:07.980
and just check in on them.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.134
So I was like I wanna talk and say hello.

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:11.170
Would you guys wanna be in it?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.246
And, Jim, where's Jim?

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:13.486
- [Jim] I'm in here.

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:14.420
- Jim's in there.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.578
- Jim, did you hear we're actually filming

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:16.960
a video for Tyler's channel now?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.874
(Tyler laughs)

00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:19.114
- At bedtime.

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:21.897
I've got no makeup on
and Tyler's being crazy.

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:22.669
- It doesn't matter.

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:24.782
This is a safe space.

00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:26.367
You can come in with no makeup.

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:27.626
You can come in...

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:28.967
Jim, come in, Jim.

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:29.597
- You have to--

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:31.162
- OK, so Jim is here.
- Hello.

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:31.670
- Hi, Jim.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.295
Jim and Tanya are letting
me stay with them.

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:35.266
I'm here in London filming a whole bunch

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.054
of videos and stuff, and hanging out,

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:38.394
and just travelling all around.

00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:39.735
But we were gonna have a slumber party

00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:41.279
and Tan wanted to put...

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.909
What is it?

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.047
- Facial.

00:01:43.047 --> 00:01:44.164
- I'm gonna come from behind.

00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:44.937
I'm gonna watch you in...

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:46.135
(Tyler laughs)

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:46.928
Oh God.

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:48.309
- (gasps) Oh, it's cold.

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:49.061
(Tanya laughs)

00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:50.178
Oh my God.

00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:51.743
- Should I do myself?
- Yeah.

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:52.698
- Don't worry. I wanna play.

00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:53.266
- OK.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.851
- This is gonna be so
good for your skin, Tyler,

00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:56.680
and I want you to start
drinking more water.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.310
- I know.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.565
She was lecturing me about
how much water I don't drink.

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:00.967
- What did I do when you woke up today?

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:02.348
- Got me a glass of water.

00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:03.831
- And me, it's every morning

00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.254
Tanya wakes up with a glass of water.

00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:06.493
- It's like I'm staying
with my mom and dad.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.703
Um so yeah, I'm here
in London, like I said,

00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:12.649
and staying here for a couple days,

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.416
and then I think I'm gonna go
to Brighton for a couple days,

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:18.907
and just film, and I got
a lot of fun stuff coming

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:19.800
your guys' way.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.198
Um so yeah, we're gonna go
enjoy our little slumber party.

00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:25.347
Tan just made me tea, which--
- It was good.

00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:26.932
- The first time she did
it, it was not that good.

00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:27.826
(Jim laughs)

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:29.045
- I was so offended.

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:30.955
- And I had to tell her, a couple hints.

00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:32.377
I was like, listen, I
know how to be British

00:02:32.377 --> 00:02:33.961
better than you apparently.

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.054
So yeah, we're gonna go have some tea,

00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:38.411
maybe watch some more "Modern Family".

00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:39.996
- And let our faces dry.

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:40.950
- Right, yeah.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.987
This is kinda burning.

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:42.737
Is it supposed to burn?

00:02:42.737 --> 00:02:44.851
- No. Are you OK?

00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:46.111
- Mine's not burning.

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:47.289
- Tyler, I should take it off.

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:48.305
- It's a little warm.
- How--

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:49.443
- OK, so we need to go.

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:50.682
(laughing)

00:02:50.682 --> 00:02:51.800
I will see you guys later.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.120

Yeah, bye friends.

00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:11.426
- Bye.

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:16.297
(bright music)

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:24.612
- You look good.

00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:27.375
- I have my glasses on.

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:28.188
- It's fine.

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:29.041
- You have glasses on too.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.483
- Yeah, I have glasses on too,

00:03:30.483 --> 00:03:32.917
and people accept me for who I am.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.411
I'm just gonna talk.
- OK.

00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:38.565
- OK, ready?
- Yeah.
