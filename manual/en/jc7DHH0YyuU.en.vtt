00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.069
iBlast Moki 2 HD has a problem.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.980
As with its predecessor, making the tiniest
of adjustments to the contraptions you’re

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.150
tasked with constructing can be a seriously
fiddly process - especially where ropes are

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.150
involved.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.870
So, iBlast Moki 2 HD has a problem. But that’s
a problem. Singular.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.070
In every other respect, this physics puzzler
sequel is approaching perfection. Refined

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.500
and sublime, it’s one of the most polished
and purely enjoyable games on the App Store.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.570
That’s not to say that it’s a huge departure
from the original concept. You’re still

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.449
transporting cute little creatures – the
Moki of the title - to a warpgate to complete

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:36.600
each stage.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.999
You still need to collect flowers along the
way to boost your score (although this time

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:43.480
you’re rated in stars rather than medals).
And you’ll still mostly achieve all this

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.359
via a mixture of bombs, ropes, metal bars,
and balloons, just as in the first game.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.829
With bombs remaining the primary method of
propulsion, you’d reasonably expect more

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.989
varieties, and that’s very much the case
here. Red bombs explode to leave a rubbery

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.190
residue, which can bounce Moki over gaps and
obstacles.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.600
Yellow variants, meanwhile, add a slippery
sheen to the surface they’re placed on,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.550
allowing Moki to accelerate up steep slopes,
or even travel rapidly around loops like a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.550
limbless Sonic.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.980
Then there are the green bombs, which apply
a glue-like substance to objects and environments,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.220
allowing Moki to stick to them. A well-timed
explosion from a standard bomb is required

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.210
should you need to unglue any of your diminutive
charges.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.910
Levels also contain more moveable objects
to interact with. You might need to attach

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.030
your buoyant Moki to a rolling boulder to
tug it underwater, or swing a barrel to knock

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240
a snoozing creature towards the exit.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.180
Cases of TNT blast your Moki higher and further,
and on one stage, you’re pulled across a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.560
body of water by a rubber duck-powered boat.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.450
The more elaborate solutions can take quite
some time to figure out, but Godzilab has

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.560
cleverly designed its levels to be more flexible
than before.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.020
On many occasions, the solution is more straightforward
than it seems, and while optimal times usually

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.700
require judicious use of all the tools at
your disposal, you can often finish a level

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.450
with but a single bomb and a little patience.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.250
Better yet: if you’re really, really stuck,
you can spend a Moki coin – earned by completing

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.960
a certain number of levels – to view solutions
from the top players on the game’s online

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.140
leaderboards.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.310
And if you’re desperately struggling and
you don’t have any Moki coins left to spend,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.110
then you can purchase five for 69p. Forking
out the same amount unlocks all the stages,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.900
if you fancy seeing the later levels, but
don’t have the skill to unlock them.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.170
It’s the perfect way to open the game up
to the widest possible audience and alleviate

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.280
the frustration wrought by the trickier levels,
while still rewarding the patience of those

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.280
who haven’t relied on outside help.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.310
Even without all these new features, the graphical
overhaul would be almost enough to recommend

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.680
an instant download. Its homespun feel evokes
LittleBigPlanet, though the game doesn’t

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.010
feel like a cheap imitation of Media Molecule’s
style - iBlast Moki 2 HD retains its own quirky

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.140
personality.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.500
If that wasn’t enough, there’s an expanded
level creator that feels more robust than

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.569
the original’s toolset. Sharing levels with
other users is a doddle, theoretically making

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.920
for an endless supply of fresh content.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.390
Those not interested in creating or sharing,
however, will be more than happy to simply

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.310
play. The 90 stages provided and the gloriously
freeform physics-puzzling are ample enough

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.920
reason to make this an essential purchase.
