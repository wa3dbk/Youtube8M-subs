00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.470
This week: Android at Mobile World Congress,
Nokia Music+, and more.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.100
This is the Mobile Nations Monday Brief!

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:21.080
TITLE GRAPHIC

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.720
Greetings mobile delegates, I’m Ashley Esqueda,
and you’re tuned into the Mobile Nations

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.720
Monday Brief.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.850
It’s time for Mobile World Congress, and
Android Central is in full force over in Barcelona,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.860
Spain, to bring the Android Nation news of
what devices, apps, and gadgets are coming

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.989
your way.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.750
Two big players made unveiling choices outside
MWC, with HTC already showing off the One,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.920
and Samsung rumored to throw their Galaxy
S4 event sometime after the conference, but

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.600
there’s still tons to see and talk about
on the show floor.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.809
Android Central has a full rundown up, letting
you know what to expect from the major players

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.290
at the show: Sony usually shows off its midrange
hardware, Samsung will reveal the long-rumored

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.720
8-inch Galaxy Note tablet, and LG will show
the Optimus G Pro.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.410
Those aren’t the only companies making a
splash at MWC, though, so keep your browsers

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.560
pointed at Android Central dot com this week
to keep up with all the shiny new Android-ness.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.510
iMore realized last week that the iPad mini
is a whole 4 months old!

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.070
To celebrate, each of iMore’s editors (and
our own Derek Kessler) posted their take on

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.790
how the iPad mini has changed their lives.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.810
Oddly enough, each editor had a different
case study, from Leanna Lofte completely replacing

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.130
her full size iPad with the mini, to Georgia
deciding there wasn’t any room in her life

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.130
for it at all.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.230
It’s an interesting read if you’re curious
to see longer term reactions to the iPad mini,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.680
especially because they’re pretty honest
about using - or not using them.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.700
Hit up iMore dot com for more details, and
while you’re there, read up on and enter

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.120
the contest to win a colorful iPad mini from
AnoStyle by clicking on that fancy “Contests”

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.409
button in the upper right hand part of the
screen.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.280
Crackberry’s story is short but sweet this
week -- if you’ve picked up a BlackBerry

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.620
Z10, and you’re coming from a BB7 device,
you probably want to transfer all that data

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.409
you have sitting on it to your new phone.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.830
Calendar, contacts, and other specific data.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.120
It’s pretty easy to do with BlackBerry Link,
and Crackberry dot com’s Adam Zeis has a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.849
tidy little tutorial walking you through the
process.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.980
There are also lots of good tips in the comments
from folks who have already done the transfer,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.409
so high fives all around, Crackberry Nation!

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.269
Windows Phone Central let its readership know
that Nokia Music+ is now available for all

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.430
Nokia Lumias in the U.S.A. -- it’ll cost
you $3.99 a month for a subscription, but

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.900
there’s a lot to love about what Nokia’s
offering.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.540
You’ll get everything the regular, free
Nokia Music app offers to Lumia owners, plus

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.969
unlimited downloads for offline listening,
unlimited skips, a sound quality boost, and

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:07.969
more.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.400
If you want to grab it, just open up your
Nokia Music app on your Lumia phone, and you

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.079
should see an option in the settings to upgrade
to Music+.

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.060
Fortunately for you Lumia owners who aren’t
sure if you want to subscribe, Nokia’s offering

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.629
a free 7-day trial so you can check it out.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.450
Head over to WPCentral dot com for all the
details, and let us know if you end up subscribing!

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.579
Lastly, a totally weird story from webOS Nation
-- one that was SO good, we saved it from

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.879
the week before last.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.109
Chubby Checker, the musician who popularized
the song “The Twist” back in 1960, is

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.870
SUING Hewlett Packard and...

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.870
Palm?

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.540
So it’s got to be some kind of image use
or copyright infringement, right?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.170
Well, kind of.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.220
You see, a long time ago, there used to be
an app in the webOS App Catalog called “The

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.319
Chubby Checker.”

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.250
It wasn’t used to teach you how to do the
twist, though -- it was an app that would

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.810
calculate um, a guy’s SIZE based on the
size of his shoe.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.470
Yeah, it gets weirder.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.989
Mr. Checker is suing for... get ready for
it...

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.230
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.570
Considering this app probably made less than
a couple hundred bucks while it was available,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.441
well, good luck there, Chubby, let us know
how it goes for you.

00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:25.870
If you want to read all of Derek’s hilarious
rant about the case and all the details, hit

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.690
up webOS Nation dot com.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.860
I promise it’s worth the visit.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.920
