00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:12.650
In this tutorial, I'll show you a way to add
an elastic band closure to your notebook.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.490
If you want to decorate your notebook before
you add the closure to it, check out this

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.590
video here.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.000
You can also find the link in the description
below.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.980
For the closure I'll be using this 3/8 inch
elastic band which I got from a local fabric

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.980
store.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.450
If you aren't sure where to find elastic band,
check out this video here.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.410
You can also find the link below.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.480
The tools I'll be using are an X-Acto blade,
scissors, stapler, ruler, something to write

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.960
with, and a cutting mat.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.280
On the inside back cover, in the top right
corner, measure about an inch in from the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.410
corner edges.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.129
And draw a line about the same width as the
band.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.369
Repeat this on the bottom corner.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:20.880
Now with the X-Acto, cut out a slot on the
line.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.189
And repeat on the other line.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.130
Then pull one end of the band through a slot,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:41.640
and staple the end twice.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.100
Now wrap the band around the front and estimate
the length by stretching it over the other

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.100
slot.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.000
You want it stretchy enough to pull around,
but not too loose that it just hangs off the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.159
book.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:59.799
Cut the end, and pull the band around to the
back into the other slot.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:12.430
And the last step, staple the end twice.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:25.870
And here's the same method on a spiral notebook
which I decorated from my previous tutorial.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.010
I hope you found this tutorial helpful.
