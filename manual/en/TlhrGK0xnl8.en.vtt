00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.860
Dr. Dona Schneider: About a decade ago, I
was asked to develop for the doctoral students

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.660
in public health, a course that would show
them the original documents for the things

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.430
that have happened in public health that are
key, that have made real changes in the way

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.430
we do public health over time. That effort
was so great that it really needed to be turned

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.390
into a book. Having students continue to do
these readings without having it in one place

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.390
and having it in multiple formats and everybody's
Xeroxing a copy, and it was just awful. So

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:53.609
I started with Hippocrates and moved forward.
The first volume of this, what is going to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.300
be a two volume set really only goes as far
as 1900 and then I've moved now to dealing

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.620
with the things have happened in the 20th
century. The two volumes then really will

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.690
be the capstone of the historical research
that I've done on the development of public

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.580
health over time. Volume one is different
in that each chapter is set up with an individual

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.750
who made a breakthrough, and you can tell
the story of their life and why they were

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.750
interesting. One of the things I learned from
Volume one is how important the printing press

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.090
was in being able to distribute information,
and what I take for granted now, I can pull

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.270
up PubMed on my computer and I can find all
sorts of references very quickly. That didn't

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.270
exist before 1960, we didn't even have Index
Medicus. Citation changes in the literature

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.750
over time, so the Hippocrates is telling you
about what travelers who went to China said

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.750
about disease in China. In the 16, 17, 1800's,
it's what the letters a doctor so and so or

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.690
the memoirs say, and you don't have published
medical literature to cite, the Jama, Volume

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.480
54. That doesn't happen until the mid 20th
century, so that citations, like we do now,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.980
we take for granted and it didn't exist. The
ability to search didn't exist, so I'm finding

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.980
that very exciting, because that's a learning
of how scholarship has changed over time.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.120
What happens after the beginning of the 20th
century is that science just explodes. The

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.350
development of synthetic vitamins and understanding
the importance of nutrition and trace elements

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:06.349
happens in those first 20 years of the 20th
century. The impact of the stock market crash

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.660
and the Great Depression on health and nutrition
is so severe that you have an entire generation

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.420
that we're exposed to disease such as rickets.
The Wonder bread of when I grew up, that is

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.110
the introduction of vitamin fortification
into flour. That happens during World War

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.569
II, because the cohort of men to fight born
during the Great Depression were seriously

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.250
malnourished between the rickets and the loss
of teeth from scurvy and other nutritional

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:00.489
disease. Many men were foreff and never did
enter the army. So, with the stroke of a pen,

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.879
the first executive order of Franklin Roosevelt
was to enrich flour for the armed services,

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.900
and today we all eat enriched flour and we
think nothing of it. What we learned from

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.500
having the students read the original materials
and then discussing them amongst ourselves

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.120
was how important those things really are,
and how we've forgotten how important those

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.720
things are.
