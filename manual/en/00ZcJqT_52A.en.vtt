00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.500
Hello.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Today I will show you how to setup a port forwarding on your Windows computer using a tool called PC Port Forwarding.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.600
You can get it from Verigio Communications.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.500
It works on your computer, and it does not need a router.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.400
I will start by going to their website and downloading the program.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.500
It takes only about half a minute to install it on Windows XP.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.300
Alright, now I have installed.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.800
It has very simple user interface.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.200
Right click, and I can add port forwarding rules.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.500
I can delete them.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300
Just as an example, lets say...

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.000
I want all outgoing TCP traffic with destination port 5555

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to be forwarded to the port 80, which is a standard HTTP port.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.800
What I need to do is to modify the empty rule that I just created 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.000
either by doubleclick or selecting an item from the menu.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.700
I am going to enable it.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.200
Traffic direction - Outgoing.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.200
Protocol - TCP.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.500
First port - 5555.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.000
Last Port is the same as the First one, because I am forwarding only a single port.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.500
Translate to First Port - 80. It is the port the traffic will be forwarded to.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
Translated coverage - Single Port.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.900
Traffic reflection, I am not going to use it.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.200
And Commit.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.500
For rules to take effect, I need to click Apply button in the buttom right corner.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Now I am going to verify that port forwarding is working by bringing up the command prompt.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.000
I will use the standard Windows utility called the Telnet, which is often used for testing of TCP connectivity.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.500
I will run the test against an Internet server.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.400
That is our port.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.500
And we have a connection to the server and notification that the port forwarding was performed.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Now I am going to Copy-n-Paste a simple HTTP request that I typed in before.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.500
And as you can see, the server replied with the webpage.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.000
To stop the port forwarding, you can disable all the rules and click the Apply button.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.000
or delete all the rules and click the Apply button.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
or simply close the program.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.400
That is it for today.
