00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.299
Thank you.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.299
Thank you.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.299
Students, parents, faculty, distinguished
guests.

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:17.240
I am so honored to be here at [Insert University]
To help you celebrate your graduation.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.609
Even though I didn't attend this school or
even live in the area, I'm delighted that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.119
you chose me to drone on for a few minutes
to fill you with fleeting inspiration.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.640
I look around and I see the young faces of
people ready to timidly step into the next

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.710
chapter of their lives with the will and determination
to keep the world exactly the same.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.149
To those people I say to you this: You are
done learning.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.870
Before I go on please let me mention a few
things to ingratiate myself with all of you,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.719
even though I've never met the vast majority
of you and will probably leave as soon as

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.510
I'm done with this speech.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.300
Local cafeteria food, am I right?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.750
Everyone hates homework.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.210
The local community.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.840
And finally...

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.470
School mascot.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.110
Go horses.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.660
Remember: Your school is awesome.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.970
Your rival school sucks.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.460
You know I'm often reminded of the story of
the fisherman who catches a shark.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.940
The shark says, "Why did you attack me?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.940
We're one and the same."

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.910
The fisherman says, "What are you saying?

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.210
I don't speak Japanese."

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.700
Then the shark shoots him with a crossbow.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.890
You know since cliche's are often the best
way to express yourself, let me tell you this:

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.790
As we go forth, let us look forward and also
back and to the left.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.150
After all, success and happiness is not a
destination, but a journey to the start of

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.330
an even greater wanderlust.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Time has flown by.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.240
Why, yesterday feels like it just happened
tens of hours ago.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.190
But remember, this is not the end.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.090
It is only the beginning of the first day
of the rest of your life.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.670
Because a journey of a thousand miles begins
with a single step and as one door closes

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.850
another chapter begins on the threshold of
tomorrow.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.040
Webster defines "Graduation" as the award
of acceptance of an academic degree or diploma.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.060
I find this extremely relevant, since that's
exactly what we're doing here today.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.170
Further, I can link this back to my earlier
joke about the shark.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.180
Only remember: that wasn't a joke.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.210
That was a true story.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:39.060
It's been a long time since i sat where you
sit now and looking back I am struck by just

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.950
how hungover I really was.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.210
My path after graduation was full of many
twists and turns.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.120
I begged for cash on the street.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.450
I was a towel boy at the gym.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.020
And I worked for President Barack Obama.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.530
Two of those were in fact the same job.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.160
During it all I was guided by the wise words
of Bill Cosby who said, "Never help others."

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.120
Which, incidentally, is the motto of [Insert
School] Bookstore.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.860
Am I right?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.450
Remember I tailored this speech specifically
for [Insert School]

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.070
You know they say that everyone is, at their
core, a liar.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.110
Therefore, let me impart to you some of the
best advice I've ever gotten by some of my

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.930
closest personal friends.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.930
From Steve Jobs I've learned that life is
extremely easy and fair.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.110
You will succeed in every aspect with little
to no effort.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.110
Mail in your coursework.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.380
Post your resume online and sit around and
wait for something magical to happen because

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.850
it will.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.620
More than anything life is an inner-tube ride
down an easy river so just sit back and enjoy

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.620
it.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.760
Do nothing with a sense of urgency because
everyone lives forever.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.110
Let me repeat that: Everyone Lives Forever.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.459
From Denzel Washington I've learned that failure
on any scale is the worst thing that will

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.870
ever happen to anyone.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.460
Your first failure will haunt and cripple
you for the rest of your days.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.290
Failure means, "It's time to give up."

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.209
That being said, everyone eventually fails.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.770
Like a black hole, failure is the Wile E.
Coyote that no matter how fast you run, it

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.260
always catches up to you.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.780
It was Denzel who famously said, "You will
fail at some point in your life.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.120
Accept it.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.819
You will lose."

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.020
Failure is unavoidable.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.500
All any of us can do is prolong the time between
now and our first failure and then give up

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.749
once it happens.

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:38.930
From Ellen DeGeneres, I learned that your
dreams are wrong.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.840
And you should embrace peer pressure.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.550
Eventually you will find a job, preferably
one in an office, where you will have to wear

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.180
casual business wear all the time, work every
day a little bit less than the day before,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.370
and be completely obsessed with how everyone
sees you.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.900
Don't forget for even an instant an instant
what others think of you because if you do,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.969
in that instant, you will instantly fail.

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.020
Remember [Rival School]?

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.080
They follow their passions and they ignore
what other people think about them.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.099
And we all know what's going on with them
am I right?

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.150
From Conan O'Brien I learned that life is
a standard checklist of acquisition and moderate

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.660
achievement.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.930
Do everything you can to conform to general
ideas of happiness: money, possessions, status.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.919
If you have a different idea of what makes
you happy, forget it.

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.379
Immediately.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.770
Everyone has the same path and should follow
it blindly.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.580
The lesson here is to never think for yourself.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:50.240
Lastly, from myself, and I cannot stress this
enough.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.020
I've learned: Don't Ever Laugh.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.389
Ever.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:03.740
If you only remember one thing I've said today,
remember this: Life is easy, and you will

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.300
never fail as long as you ignore your passions,
cave into peer pressure, and never even crack

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.439
a smile.

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:19.610
These have been the best of your life, studying
with Mr. [Teacher] and drinking at [Local

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:26.669
Bar], and every subsequent day after today
will be worse than the day before, so act

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:27.669
accordingly.

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:35.089
To today's graduates, I would wish you luck,
but remember there is no such thing as luck.

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:38.800
The grades you have gotten have already defined
the rest of your life.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.949
So follow along and never stray from your
rigidly defined path.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.400
As you head out into the world I offer you
the following challenge:

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.719
Please everyone you can.

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.400
Avoid any risk.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.110
And embrace mediocracy in every facet.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.589
Go forth, and make no difference whatsoever.

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:06.800
Thank you again to [Insert School] for having
me here to speak with you all, final repeat

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:17.199
of college bar joke, thank you.

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:25.780
Congratulations to all the recent graduates
whether it was grad school, college, or kindergarten.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.779
Watched a whole bunch of really excellent
graduation speeches I'll put them in the links

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:30.779
down below.

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:34.879
Ah they're really good, obviously not as good
as mine.
