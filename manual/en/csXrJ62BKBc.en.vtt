00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:12.567
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:21.600
Let me say Multinational Force
Iraq, Multinational Corps Iraq,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.300
Multinational Security
Transition Command Iraq First

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:39.000
Corps, America's Corp Band:
Thanks to all of you.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.700
Listen, I am so honored.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.567
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:50.266
THE PRESIDENT: I love you back.
(Applause.)

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.934
I am honored -- I'm
honored and grateful to be with

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:56.633
all of you.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:59.233
And I'm not going to talk long
because I want to shake as many

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:03.800
hands as I can.
(Applause.)

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.633
And I've been
talking all week. (Laughter.)

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.967
But there's a couple
of things I want to say.

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:12.900
Number one, thank you.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.333
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're welcome.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.533
THE PRESIDENT: You know, when I
was at Camp Lejeune I spoke

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:27.333
about what it means for America
to see our best and brightest,

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:32.266
our finest young men and women
serve us.

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:36.100
And what I said then is
something that I want to repeat

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.033
to you, which is: You have
performed brilliantly in every

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:44.000
mission that has been
given to you.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.600
AUDIENCE: Ooh-ah.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.900
THE PRESIDENT: Under enormous
strain and under enormous

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.400
sacrifice, through controversy
and difficulty and politics,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.967
you've kept your eyes focused on
just doing your job.

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:04.633
And because of that, every
mission that's been assigned --

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:08.400
from getting rid of Saddam, to
reducing violence, to

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.367
stabilizing the country, to
facilitating elections -- you

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:18.200
have given Iraq the opportunity
to stand on its own

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.767
as a democratic country.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:25.000
That is an extraordinary
achievement, and for that you

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.967
have the thanks of the American
people. (Applause.)

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:33.200
That's point
number one.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.000
Point number two is, this is
going to be a critical period,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.166
these next 18 months.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:44.834
I was just discussing this with
your commander, but I think it's

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:47.433
something that all of you know.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:55.166
It is time for us to transition
to the Iraqis. (Applause.)

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:59.333
They need to take
responsibility for their country

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:02.800
and for their sovereignty.
(Applause.)

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800
And in order for
them to do that, they have got

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.133
to make political
accommodations.

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.734
They're going to have to decide
that they want to resolve their

00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:14.400
differences through
constitutional means

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.200
and legal means.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.567
They are going to have to focus
on providing government services

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:25.300
that encourage confidence among
their citizens.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.233
All those things they
have to do.

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:30.266
We can't do it for them.

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:36.700
But what we can do is make sure
that we are a stalwart partner,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.166
that we are working alongside
them, that we are committed to

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:46.467
their success, that in terms of
training their security forces,

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:50.700
training their civilian forces
in order to achieve a more

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.000
effective government, they know
that they have a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.200
steady partner with us.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.100
And so just as we thank you for
what you've already

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.533
accomplished, I want to say
thank you because you will be

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:05.767
critical in terms of us being
able to make sure that Iraq is

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:10.967
stable, that it is not a safe
haven for terrorists, that it is

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:17.000
a good neighbor and a good ally,
and we can start bringing our

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.834
our folks home.
(Applause.)

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:25.033
So now is not the
time to lose focus.

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:28.233
We have to be even more focused
than we've been in

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:31.800
order to achieve success.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.400
The last point I want to make is
I know how hard it's been

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.000
on a lot of you.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.567
You've been away from your
families, many of

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:45.467
you for multiple rotations.

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:50.367
You've seen buddies of yours
injured and you remember those

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:54.400
who have made the ultimate
sacrifice.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.934
AUDIENCE: Ooh-ah.

00:04:55.934 --> 00:04:58.800
THE PRESIDENT: There are
probably some people here who

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.400
have seen children born and have
been missing watching

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.533
them grow up.

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:13.433
There are many of you who have
listened to your spouse and the

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:17.633
extraordinary sacrifices that
they have to make

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:19.567
when you're gone.

00:05:19.567 --> 00:05:26.433
And so I want you to know that
Michelle and myself are doing

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:29.967
everything -- (applause) -- are
doing everything we can to

00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:34.900
provide additional support for
military families.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.767
The federal budget that I have
introduced increases

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:42.934
support for military families.

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:49.633
We are going to do everything
required to make sure that the

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:55.834
commitment we make to our
veterans is met, and that people

00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:58.567
don't have to fight for what
they have earned as a

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:02.200
consequence of their service.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.800
The main point I want to make is
we have not forgotten what you

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.767
have already done, we are
grateful for what you will do,

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:16.467
and as long as I am in the White
House, you are going to get the

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:20.400
support that you need and the
thanks that you deserve

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.000
from a grateful nation.
(Applause.)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.567
So thank you very
much everybody. (Applause.)

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:26.867
God bless you. (Applause.)

00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:29.667
God bless the United
States of America.

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:32.300
(Applause.)
