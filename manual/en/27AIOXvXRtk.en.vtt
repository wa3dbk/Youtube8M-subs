Hi! I'm Laura from Youngwritersworkshops.com.
I'm going to talk about how to write a cook

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:13.150
book. I think, it's really important. Especially,
if you're a cook, you might be tempted to

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.179
include a lot of different kinds of food.
But I think, it's really important if you're

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.330
going to write a cook book to narrow it a
little bit. Focus on a food that you think

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.289
is going to be appealing. To an audience.
For example, Salsas or thirty minute meals.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.440
As opposed to just a bunch of good food. So
pick your topic and then really focus in a

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.460
little bit. And really create a range of recipes
that fit within that topic. Now as far as

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.160
writing a cook book. I think it's really important
to cook a lot. You might need to cook, each

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.620
of your recipes, five, six, seven times. To
make sure that they turn out the same, each

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.070
time. And that you've got all of the ingredient
measurements, exactly right. When it come

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.199
to the writing, once you have your recipes.
Remember that, it's pretty easy to find a

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.040
recipe on the Internet. Or you know, on the
back of a box, somewhere. So really what makes

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.049
someone reach for a cook book. As opposed
to just printing something out, is the description.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.170
And some of the experience and detail that
you bring to it. So when you write your descriptions

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:28.679
that go with the recipes. Try and be personal,
be expressive. Bring your own voice into it.

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.280
That's what's going to make a difference.
For someone to really want to purchase or

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.920
read your cook book. A photograph is maybe
not necessary for every recipe. But I would

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.659
use photographs. Because they really entice
the cook, the potential cook to try your recipe.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.369
And really also serves as a guide for what
they're striving to achieve. In making this

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.939
dish. So it's always good to have pictures.
So here's a little summary of what you need

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.810
to do, to write a cook book. Start with a
manageable topic, that's going to be appealing

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.720
to an audience. So that you'll be able to
create recipes that fit within that topic.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.799
Test them, field test them. Have people try
them and get them till their accurate. Then

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:24.500
write an interesting detailed or personal
description. To go with each recipe. Include

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.019
photographs and then you've got your cook
book. Pretty much, ready to go. So those are

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.090
some ideas about how to write a cook book.
