00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Amla and Triphala Tested for Metals

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.570
If Ayurvedic herbal preparations are
often contaminated with toxic metals,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.200
should we stay away
from amla and triphala,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.130
two of the three most
antioxidant-packed foods in the world?

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.550
Are we going to be forced
to go back to cloves,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.410
number four down the list?

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.280
In the Boston study, both amla and
triphala were repeatedly tested—

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.280
different samples,
different brands—

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.400
and not a single one had any detectable
lead, mercury, arsenic, or cadmium.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.529
Good news.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.040
And neither had any detectable
pesticides, either.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.480
But maybe that’s just Boston.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.050
If you want to do a broad survey
of the global market,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.980
you need to start shopping
on the internet.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.130
Published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association:

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.559
“Lead, Mercury, and Arsenic
in…Ayurvedic Medicines Sold

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.420
via the Internet.”

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.730
Once again, one-fifth of the medicines:
contaminated.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.610
When the Boston study came out,
there were calls for mandatory testing

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.329
of all imported dietary supplements
for toxic heavy metals.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.829
But this study found that the
prevalence of metals in

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.229
U.S.-manufactured
Ayurvedic medicine

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.709
was the same,
if not higher,

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:18.210
than those imported from India.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.119
They found lead levels violating safety
limits in products with names like

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.460
“Worry Free,” a pediatric preparation.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.040
Mercury in products like “Breath of Life.”

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.040
And arsenic levels exceeding
EPA limits in triphala.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.799
Mercury in triphala,
and lead in triphala.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.479
Okay, I guess we can
scratch that off the list.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.929
That’s why my smoothies have amla,
not triphala.

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.829
Just to put things in perspective, though,
Consumer Reports recently remeasured

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.489
mercury levels in canned tuna,

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:02.429
and while a serving of triphala
may have 46 micrograms of mercury,

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.860
the average can of
white tuna has 1,345.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.300
But as far as I’m concerned,
practically any mercury

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.790
is too much mercury.
