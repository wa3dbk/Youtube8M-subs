Hello, Tim here with my detox diet plan update!

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:09.433
This is Day 18, and I am still on track, doing quite well

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.667
I lost .5 of a kilogram since yesterday, which is about 1.1 pound

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:19.600
So, overall my weight loss is 9.5 kilograms, which is 21 pounds

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.567
And that is in 17 days, because today is the start 
 of the 18th day as I am filming this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.767
I have to say vegetable drinks: I am starting 
 to get into those a lot more now

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:33.367
I am finding that I think I need to do that

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:49.233
So if you are on this juice fast, juice diets, I think 
 you need to have more of a component of vegetables

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:53.900
So, yes, I have taken the plunge everybody, you will 
 be pleased to know, and I am using celery!

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:57.067
I actually used celery this morning in my drink

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.533
I am using a lot more spinach. I am using broccoli as well

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.567
I am still using apples and pears, but to a lesser degree

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:31.167
So I think by, what I’ve done, I actually did that 
 yesterday, I cut down dramatically on the amount of fruit

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:36.967
And I don’t think it is a surprise that I lost half a 
 kilo. So it will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.130
So, I am getting used to the vegetable drink

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.170
It’s hard to get used to for me because 
 I like the sweetness of the fruit

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.700
I am thinking that it is more important to do that, and obviously if it is going 
 to to help me lose weight, it would be silly of me not to do it

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.630
I have to say that the drink that I had this morning

00:01:55.033 --> 00:02:01.000
which was grapefruit, lemon, celery as I said, spinach, and 
 I had a few strawberries in there as well

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.200
and I am just trying to think what else 
 was in there as well, apple and pear

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.230
Was quite nice!

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:21.100
So I will keep you up-to-date. If I come up with 
 a vegetable juice recipe that I think really works

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:22.800
I will certainly let you know

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:33.000
I am also using carrot because I am aware that carrot juice benefits are pretty 
 well undisputed and they are a really great source of healthiness for you

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:40.800
So, other than that, I have not got a lot 
 else to report. I am still going well

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.130
Weight is still coming off which is making me feel fantastic

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:49.130
I can hardly believe that I have lost 9.5 kg, which is 21 pounds

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:57.530
So this is going to be an interesting test tomorrow 
 to see how much weight I have lost

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:02.970
Now that I am focusing more on vegetables. So I 
 look forward to presenting that update to you tomorrow

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:04.670
Thanks for watching, and I will talk to you then

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:05.670
See you
