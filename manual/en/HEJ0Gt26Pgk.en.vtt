00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.220
Hi! I'm Elisha, and welcome back to another
Kenco® webcast, your number one source for

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.270
information on labeling and pricing products.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.860
Today, I'll be showing you how to properly
load and maintain your Towa® APN-60 hand

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.190
held label applicator.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.730

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.169
Before we begin, let's familiarize ourselves
with several key components of the applicator.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.759
Let's pick up the applicator with our right
hand.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.810
Right away, you will notice the label housing
assembly.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.930
On the left, you will see the roll guard.
The roll guard will help secure your labels

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.980
when the applicator is in use.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.410
As the arrows indicate, turning the roll guard
counterclockwise will unlock it, while turning

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.559
it clockwise will lock it.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.730
On the label shaft, you will see a plastic
core. I'll be talking more about this plastic

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.719
core later on.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.379
Rotate the applicator and take a look at the bottom.

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.690
Here you will see the feed mechanism door
and a hinged latch at the bottom.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.109
This latch has a set of teeth to help tear
the liner, and a lip that helps bend the liner

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.949
away from the trigger.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.520
Let's open up the bottom by pulling the latch
toward the trigger, so we can take a peek inside.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.840
When you open the door, you will
notice the advancing mechanism.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.650
The advancing mechanism will grip the label
liner, pulling it along with every squeeze

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.690
of the trigger.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.650
Close that door back up and secure it
by closing the bottom latch.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.690
Towards the top of the applicator,
you will see the bending bars.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.980
These rollers separate the label from the liner.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.910
Above the bending bars, you will see the nip rollers.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.290
The nip rollers will help apply
the label to your product.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.780
Between the nip rollers and the label housing
is a clear plastic piece called the path guide,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.460
and above it is the mech sensor.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.860
The mech sensor will slide along the surface
of the labels and catch the beginning of each

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.650
label, stopping the trigger.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.470
Notice the mech sensor move slightly each
time the trigger is squeezed.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.170
Now that we are more familiar with the various
components, let's talk about choosing the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.530
labels you'll use with the
Towa® APN-60 series Label Applicator.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.820
The Towa® APN-60 series uses
labels with a one inch core.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.450
If your labels are not on a one inch core,
or did not ship on a core, a plastic one inch

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.640
core is provided with every
applicator for your use.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.099
You can learn how to wind your labels around
the core at www.Kenco.tv.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.019
Once your labels are ready, we'll learn
how to quickly and properly load your Towa®

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.329
APN-60 series Label Applicator.

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.189
First, remove the roll guard by twisting it
counterclockwise and lifting it up.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.909
I'm going to take off the plastic core,
since the custom printed labels I'm using

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.459
were made specifically for this applicator
and are available through Kenco® Label.

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.569
For a quick quote on custom printed labels,
call us at 1-800-86-KENCO.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.319
The APN-60 is especially suited to dispense
labels that measure between one and 2.33 inches wide

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.450
with a maximum outer diameter of four inches.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.909
If your labels are wider, you may wish to
use the APN-100 applicator, while for labels

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.389
of lesser width you may prefer
the APN-30 or APN10-30.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.959
Flip the applicator and open the bottom cover
by pulling down on the bottom cover latch.

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.030
Grab a roll of labels and place it on the
shaft of the housing assembly in a counter

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.599
clockwise direction.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.430
Next, run the edge of the labels under the
clear plastic path guide, and pull the labels

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.109
around the bending bars and down towards the trigger.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.090
You'll want to line up a gap in the labels
with the top of the door.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.049
Slide the labels through the latch, between
the teeth and lip, making sure the liner extends

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.180
past the latch, then close and lock the bottom cover.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.200
Let's slip the roll guard onto the label
shaft, and secure it by twisting the guard

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.389
clockwise until it locks into place.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.639
You'll want to be sure that there is at
least an eighth of an inch between the roll

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.299
guard and the roll of labels, so that the
guard is not applying any counter pressure

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.400
to the advancing mechanism.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.319
It's important to note that every time you
squeeze the trigger, the labels will only

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.099
advance between twenty and sixty millimeters,

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.870
or between approximately one and two and a
half inches, so some of the labels will require

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.560
more than one - even up to three or
four strokes per label.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.439
When applying a longer label, make sure to
stop squeezing the trigger when you meet resistance

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.029
from the applicator, as this indicates that
the mech sensor has stopped the trigger.

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:14.459
Forcing the trigger past the resistance point
may jam or even damage the applicator's

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.859
internal mechanism.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.670
Once your applicator is properly loaded,
you are ready to begin labeling!

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.760
To label an item, simply pick up the applicator
and squeeze the trigger until you meet resistance;

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.820
this indicates that you have
reached the end of a label.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.790
Hold the applicator directly over the product,
then just apply the label to your product,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.420
release the trigger, and you're all done!

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.190
