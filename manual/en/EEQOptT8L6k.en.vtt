00:00:16.063 --> 00:00:18.700
- [Narrator] Of our mold and
leak here, just as I thought.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.940
I took the scissors and
just dug it into the wall

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.720
and the wall just sliced away like butter

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.480
'cause it was saturated with water.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.230
Here you can see the problem
right here, it's dripping.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.920
See it right there, it's just
dripping inside the wall.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.260
The reason why this is
dripping is this is the,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.240
I forget the name, I think
it's called Polybutylene

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.810
or something, but everybody
knows it is the gray,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.310
plastic piping which
is illegal to use now.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.250
This is a banned material now for builders

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.080
but this unit was built
in the early eighties,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.590
I believe on the last year
that they were able to use it.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.120
So this Condominium
Association has a known problem

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.863
with it and we just found
out where it's happening.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.860
So here I've come around to
the other side of the wall

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.570
where we cut a little hole
in the living room there

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.900
to expose it and you can see

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.590
how it's just dripping like crazy.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.780
So it's a good thing they had

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.660
turned off the water last week.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.279
We turned it on right
now just to do this test,

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:16.587
but you can see just how
much water is dripping there.

00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:19.400
And see that wood right
there, it's soaking wet,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.930
the whole inside of this
wall is soaking wet.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.160
There's ants everywhere,
are attracted to it.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.030
The wall feels pretty soft, we can push

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.163
our thumb into the drywall here.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.900
Now on the living room
floor along the baseboards

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.050
you can see there's mold, it's small,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.110
it's not like a whole lot.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.760
I can breathe in here without the mask.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.180
I had the mask on earlier,
but it's really not

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.550
a whole lot of mold here.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.960
But certainly I would
say probably half-way up

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.350
both walls are gonna have to be replaced.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.130
And you can see, now we
had previous water damage

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.740
in here on these floors, okay?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.460
But now you can see the mold is growing,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.710
that wasn't even here
a couple of months ago.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.520
So, there it is, solved.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.480
Probably all this tubing's gonna have

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.360
to pulled out of here
and replaced with PVC.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.993
What I don't understand is why builders

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:21.380
in their right minds ever used
this garbage to begin with.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.940
It's just stupidity, how much cheaper

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.010
is this stuff than PVC?

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.800
I mean really folks.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.993
Just to save a buck.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.530
Okay, so we opened up the
wall a little bit more here

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.390
to see exactly where it's coming

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.230
and if you look really
closely, right there, see it?

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.750
See how it's like gushing up
against the back drywall there?

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.460
We're cutting a hole on
the other side right now,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.030
we're gonna walk around
and take a look at it

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.370
to see what's causing that.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.380
But you can see there's some mold spores

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.510
that are starting to grow back

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.683
in the corner there on the
stud next to this pipe.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.046
This is just garbage pipe,
nobody should ever use it, ever.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:04.620
(sawing drywall)

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.770
- [Man] I just made it
worse, I cracked it.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.170
- [Narrator] Okay, so here you can see

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.810
how it's just spewing right there,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.650
where we moved the
drywall on the back side

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.650
and it's just spraying
into the kitchen now.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.230
So essentially this is what was happening,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.813
it was spraying inside
the wall the hole time.

00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:22.480
(rushing water)

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.410
Okay, so here we exposed
the wall just a little more

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.420
to see all of the piping that's in there.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.820
We cut the water off now
so the leaking has stopped,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.060
it's not spraying anymore
onto the kitchen counter.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.630
But the good news is,
is all of this piping

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.570
is contained in this wall
so that the kitchen is there

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.900
and then there's the vertical
components that go upstairs

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.100
to the bathrooms and showers
and then the guest bathroom

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.540
is right here to the left of
it, so all they have to do

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.680
is rip out this one
wall, replace the piping

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.250
in there and put the drywall back.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.800
And they may have to fix the drywall

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.200
along the living room
floor here over here, too.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.910
Usually you wanna go about three feet

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.760
beyond where you see any mold.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.970
It all depends on how far up

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.713
the water whicked off the floor.
