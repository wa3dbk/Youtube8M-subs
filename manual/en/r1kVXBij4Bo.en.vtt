It's Tone It Up Tuesday, and we have a Tone
It Up in 30 workout for you.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.160
It's fat-blasting, and it's going to tone
up in 30 minutes.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.950
Now, pay close attention because at the link
below, we have a printable routine that you

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.980
can bring your trainers, on the go with you
or put on your iPad or iPhone, and on the

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.980
go.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.900
Alright, I hope you're ready to sweat.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.350
This is your workout: First, we're going to
warm-up for 8 minutes.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.080
That's 8 minutes of cardio -- whatever you
want to do: Run, dance, burpees, jump rope,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.080
bike.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.080
It doesn't matter.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.719
And then we're gonna meet back here and do
5 toning moves for 60 seconds each, followed

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.550
by 2 minutes of more cardio of your choice,
alright.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.240
You're gonna do everything 3 times.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:02:49.050
But first, we want you to pause this video,
run away from wherever you are for 4 minutes,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:03:49.410
and then run right back.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.410
Alright.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.410
Ready?

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.410
Let's workout.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.410
Set, go!

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.410
Whew, that was a good one.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.410
Hope you guys had a great workout.
