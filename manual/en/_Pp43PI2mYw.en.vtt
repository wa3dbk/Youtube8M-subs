00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.060
Welcome to how to cook that
I am Ann Reardon

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.720
Today we are going to make chocolate scrabble
which is heaps of fun because you can rearrange

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.870
the tiles to make it say whatever you want
it to say.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.100
To make this you are going to need a few things,
firstly you'll need some old style scrabble

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.480
tiles that have the letters embedded into
the tile, I got these ones on ebay.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.450
Give them a wash and let them dry completely.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.789
Next we need a food grade casting gel.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.460
Make sure you don't just use any molding gel
it needs to be a food grade one otherwise

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.360
it can have chemical in it that can leach
into your food.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.159
I like this stuff because it is reusable so
you can make a mold out of it and then remelt

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.300
it in the microwave and make something different.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.300
Take your tiles and put a small amount of
the gel on the back of each one and then push

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.690
them onto the base of the container with the
letter side facing up.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.409
Once you have all of your letters positioned
on the base then pour the rest of the gel

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:52.429
over the top.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:58.390
Then looking from the underneath of your container
push each of your tiles down firmly and make

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.959
sure they are not touching each other.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:06.189
You need a reasonable gap between each tile
so that it is strong enough to use as a mold.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.549
You will see air bubbles are rising to the
top which is why we have the tiles at the

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.259
base of the container.

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.030
If you put them on top you'd get bubbles in
the mold rather than a smooth finish.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.580
Leave it to cool and set this will take a
couple of hours but you can put it in the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.229
fridge to speed it up.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.280
Then take it out of the container, flip it
over and pull on each edge of the tile to

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.939
release it from the mold.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.850
And you can see there we've got the letter
imprinted on our mold which is what we want.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.630
Continue to release all the tiles and remove
them from the mold and if they've got excess

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.200
gel on the back you can just rub that off
using your thumb.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.210
Melt some white chocolate in the microwave,
if your chocolate contains cocoa butter then

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.869
make sure you watch the video on how to temper
chocolate, if it contains vegetable oil then

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.399
it is not real chocolate and does not need
tempering.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.160
Fill the letters then smooth off the top using
something with a straight like a ruler or

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.409
a palette knife.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.600
And allow that to set then flip it over and
bend the mold to get your tiles out.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.700
To make our tile rack you'll will need a skinny
container with tall sides, I didn't have one

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.970
suitable so I just made one out of foil, twisting
the ends together so the gel won't leak out.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.970
Put the tile holder into the container and
pour the molding gel over the top.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.340
If it starts to float just push it back down
and hold it for a moment until it stays.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.760
If it is hollow underneath like mine just
allow it to fill up because we can get that

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.530
out afterwards .

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.709
Once it is completely set peel off all the
foil and then run a knife along the top edge.

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.090
Pull out on each side to release it from the
mold and take the tile rack out.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.360
Then if you've got the gel in the back of
the mold like mine then you can pull that

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.220
out and put that back in your container to
remelt and reuse later.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.610
If you want your tile rack a wooden colour
take some white chocolate and add some milk

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.560
or dark and mix it in, once you are happy
with the colour you can swirl some extra milk

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.250
or dark chocolate to give it that wood grain.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.680
Pour it into the mold, squeeze or tap it to
get rid of any air bubbles.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.830
I am making mine solid chocolate if you wanted
to you could fill yours with ganache or put

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.909
popping sugar in it, to do that you just tip
it out fill it up and then put more chocolate

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:18.909
on top.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.790
Like we did with the chocolate truffle video
you can watch that one if you want to know

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.790
how to do that.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.280
Then wipe off the excess chocolate off the
top using a palette knife or a ruler.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.920
Once it is set simply peel off the mold and
you have your scrabble rack.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.970
To make the letters on the tiles stand out
melt some dark chocolate dab it on and then

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.719
immediately scrape across with a knife or
something with a straight edge.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.890
And this is why we wanted the tiles that had
the embedded letters.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.340
So that we have that little valley where the
letter is so that the dark chocolate can sit

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.340
in.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.090
Let them set and then have fun creating your
message.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.760
If you are giving it away as a gift I've put
mine in a clear plastic box.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.620
You could make just the individual tile racks
in a box and they would make great unique

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.120
wedding bonbonniere with each persons name
on it who's a guest at the wedding or you

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.519
could give it as a gift for valentines day
or just to a friend for fun.

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.810
