00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.550
This video is Gonna show you it around a number

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:04.630
to a

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.649
Certain number of sig figs, so let's say you

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.440
Determine an answer from an experiment, and you determine number of sig figs you need to round Trip well

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.170
this is Gonna show you how to adjust your number one of the more complicated things in chemistry let students have a

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.759
Trouble with this so for numbers where you're cutting off a decimal place

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.670
Round this sig fig up if you're cutting on the fiber greater. So here's an example one hundred Twenty point

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.419
four six seven eight so the five sig figs

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.809
Falls right here, so we're gonna call it up cut up to seven so we're gonna rate is 120

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.190
0.47 because the seventh greater than five we're gonna bring this number up now

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
1,009.00

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.129
one two three four five

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.430
six so right there, we're cutting out for six that number has to go up by one, so

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.989
1,009.50

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.229
These aren't sig figs

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.809
Four five, and I cut off two three seven and since the it's the three you don't do anything now

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.938
For numbers where you're cutting off a non decimal place so like the ones at tens column

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.449
You must replace these numbers with zeros you must also around the last sig fig up if you're cutting off a five or greater

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.500
So nine thousand 3701 sig fig so cutting off

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.889
These numbers, but we have to replace one zero, so it's gonna be nine thousand we want to hold the value

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.070
so twelve thousand three hundred fifty four

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.649
We're gonna cut off the five four

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.769
so twelve thousand four hundred remember if we cut off a five this number, I screw up by one and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.299
1 million two hundred Thirty-five thousand seven hundred and fifty to two two sig figs

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240
It's 1 million two hundred

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.670
Thousand

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.840
now

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.840
the Foolproof way to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.569
Always round correctly is to use scientific notation the number of digits in the tessa is the number of sig figs

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.238
so the mentis is the number in the front of the exponent, so if I want one nine to three sig figs

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.180
Well, I can't cut off

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.519
these numbers from a place where zeros are already zero so what I do is I print a scientific notation and

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.749
Since I have three numbers there, that's the least sig figs 10 to the sixth power

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.328
One hundred to two sig figs well can't do that unless you do it this way 1.0. A times 10 to the second and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.599
the same number up here to two sig figs

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.989
1.2 times 10

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.910
to the sixth actually all these numbers could just be put into scientific notation and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.790
given

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.640
You'd have the same number sig figs these are interchangeable

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.750
You know you hand this into your chemistry teacher they'll accept that to accept 1.2. 4 times 10 to the

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.589
fourth Power buck three sig figs three sig figs

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.699
Three numbers in front that's how your sig figs. I hope that helped you
