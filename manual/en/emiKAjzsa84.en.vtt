Eleven... twelve... thirteenâ€”

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.980

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.490
Fifteen...

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.970
Fifteen...&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[I'm sorry...]&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.110
Fifteen...

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.910

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.340
Three...&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Amber is getting confused]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.270
Eleven?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.120
We'll do nine reps of physical training. How many?&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[To improve Soldiers' concentration]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.500

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.970
Thirteen reps. Start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[The last call is the correct number]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.570
&lt;i&gt;[Unknown to Amber, there's trap on number call out]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.990
Last number was called out, isn't that so?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.140
How many reps did I tell you to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Last number isn't to be called out]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.030
&lt;i&gt;Timing and Subtitles brought to you by "Real Men Team" @ Viki&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Last number is not to be called out.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.530
&lt;i&gt;Timing and Subtitles brought to you by "Real Men Team" @ Viki&lt;br&gt;Um...&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.240
&lt;i&gt;Timing and Subtitles brought to you by "Real Men Team" @ Viki&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;She didn't understand what you're saying.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.040
&lt;i&gt;Timing and Subtitles brought to you by "Real Men Team" @ Viki&lt;br&gt;[Soldier #4 Amber, it's confusing]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.190
Ten reps, then fifteen reps.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.010
Fifteen reps, then twelve reps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Amber is confused]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.840
&lt;i&gt;[Amber is confused]&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.800
- Soldier.&lt;br&gt;- Yes.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.440
Yes.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.000
Last number I called for was clearly eleven.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.760
Rest of Soldiers, isn't it correct?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.250
- Yes, it's correct.&lt;br&gt;- We'll try again.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.690

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.930
Soldier #4 Amber, I still can't understand.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.840
Squad commander called for eleven reps last time.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.940
- Does repetition means last number?&lt;br&gt;- Yes.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.200
I understand.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.270
- We'll do five reps, understand?&lt;br&gt;- Yes.&lt;br&gt;- Three reps.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.230
Start.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.300
One... Two...&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;[For Amber, this numbering is more difficult than chemical training]&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.980
&lt;i&gt;[This time going to be really success?]&lt;/i&gt;
