00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.930
Hi I'm Christy Morgan on behalf of Expert
Village I have washed and soaked my rice over

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.720
night now we are going to cook it in the pressure
cooker. I use one cup of dry rice to one and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.810
one forth cup of water and I already have
all my water in this pot. You could either

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.519
add a pinch or sea salt or you could use kombu
and kombu is a dry sea weed it is full of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.579
minerals and B vitamins which a lot of vegetarians
and macrobiotics people aren't getting. You

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.590
could get this at any natural food store or
a Japanese market. So I like to use this for

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.670
the added minerals. I'm going to add that
to my water. Then I'm going to put the lid

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.780
on. I have weighted down the gasket to help
it seal better so you line up the arrows here

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.640
and you lock it in place and put it up to
number two. I'm going to put in a low flame

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.250
for twenty minutes. I'm going to set my timer
here. When the 20 minutes are up we are going

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.090
to add the flame tamer underneath and this
is going to distribute the heat evenly. So

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.909
lets stick this under or pot and turn the
heat up to high. To bring up to pressure.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.180
This little dial is going to pop up and you
want to keep the flame about medium so the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.380
air is not like spewing out of the pressure
cooker but, it should have a nice stream.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.130
Then when that 15 minutes are up you turn
off the flame. You let it come down to pressure

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.009
naturally and then you have a pot of boil
rice. So our rice is now done. I let it come

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.060
naturally come down from pressure and the
little dial has gone all the way down now

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.130
our rice is ready. This is a rice paddle.
Which is wooden which I'm going to use to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.590
take out the rice. There you go pressure cook
brown rice.
