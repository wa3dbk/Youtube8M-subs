00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.230
- [Narrator] 20 miles from Reno,
Nevada, in Antelope Valley,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.960
on the eastern slope of
the Sierra Mountains,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.300
an usual relationship has formed

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.510
between Annabelle, the
Wirehair Pointing Griffin,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.483
and a Eurasian owl named Louise.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.480
When Louise was a nine week old owlet

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.693
she and Annabelle made a connection.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.290
- We have more than one animal,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.730
we have quite a few animals,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.470
and she was immediately
drawn to Annabelle,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
and spent her time following Annabelle,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.070
and would snuggle up with Annabelle.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.500
We acquired Louise when she
was five or six weeks old

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.880
and we picked her up very late
at the airport one evening.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.750
It was a very long flight.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.280
I don't know that birds are designed

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.160
to fly on airplanes so well.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.380
It was kind of stressful.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.410
- [Narrator] In
anticipation of her arrival,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.790
Jim and Kathleen prepared a nesting area

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.840
for Louise in their living room.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.250
- I came out the next morning
and there was Annabelle

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.560
lying on the floor being a little mom,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.530
and Louise was snuggled up.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.320
It was a special moment
to see the two of them

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.540
together that next morning

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.270
after the worry that we had had.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.420
We were curious if they
would still retain that bond.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.340
Raptors naturally grow very fast,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.713
and develop and mature quickly.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.750
- [Narrator] A full grown
Eurasian owl is a powerful

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.310
and deadly bird.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.820
This species of owl is one
of the largest on the planet.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.710
Their grip is strong enough
to crush skulls and bones.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.910
As an adult, Louise will be
capable of killing animals

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.330
as large as full grown
foxes and young deer.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.340
- A lot of people would
like to know how an owl

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.290
shows affection towards a dog.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.400
- [Kathleen] Give her kisses.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.080
- Not in the same way that
we would think of affection.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.080
It's more like an acceptance
as part of her life.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.640
It's pretty evident to us
that there's some level

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.750
of relationship that goes a little bit

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.320
beyond what's normal.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.360
Annie can be coming up the driveway

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.200
and you'll hear Louise
hooting at Annabelle.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.530
And she just hoots at Annabelle
to say oh, there's my dog.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.280
And she only does it for Annabelle.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.240
In falconry we say that once in a lifetime

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.000
God or nature gives
you one special falcon.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.410
The same with the dog world.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.330
People think that they get one special dog

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.770
throughout a lifetime,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.823
and Annabelle is that special dog for us.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.910
- [Narrator] And for
Annabelle, it's Louise

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.733
who is a once in a lifetime companion.

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:38.519
(dramatic flourishing music)
