00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.330
My name is Ryan Hartigan from econtechnolgies,
the creators of ChronoSync and ChronoAgent.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.820
In this screencast we’re going to demonstrate
how to create a bootable backup of your ChronoSync

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.330
Mac to an external drive attached to a remote
Mac with ChronoAgent installed.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.439
The process is nearly identical to a local
bootable backup except your destination hard

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.249
drive is on a remote Mac with ChronoAgent
installed.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.919
To familiarize yourself with bootable backups,
take a look at the link to the screencast

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.619
explaining bootable backups below.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.470
This screencast assumes you’re familiar
with configuring a ChronoAgent connection.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.949
This screencast also assumes you’ve already
formatted your bootable backup drive using

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.780
Disk Utility on your Mac.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.629
If you have not done this already, click the
link below to watch a quick screencast detailing

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.420
this.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.700
Because this sync is going over a network
connection it will likely be slower than a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.140
local bootable backup.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.161
A good trick is to connect the hard drive
locally for your first bootable backup, then

00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:54.930
move it to the remote Mac for all subsequent
backups.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.499
The steps to follow would be the same except
you are not connecting a newly formatted,

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.980
empty hard drive to your remote Mac.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.059
Begin by launching ChronoSync and opening
a blank sync document.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.630
We’ll start by creating the connection profile
to connect to the ChronoAgent Mac.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.110
If you’ve already created a concoction profile
to connect to your ChronoAgent Mac you’ll

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.009
need to create an additional one for this
bootable backup.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.880
Begin by naming the connection profile, selecting
the appropriate ChronoAgent Mac, and entering

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.369
the username and password.

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.979
Click ‘next’ and configure the security
panel if you wish.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.159
Finally, click ‘next’ to continue to the
mappings panel.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.649
Normally you would map the users of your ChronoSync
Mac to the users of your ChronoAgent Mac,

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.659
but here we want to have the file ownership
on the backup volume to match that of our

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.820
startup disk.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.280
To do this, set the mapping mode to ‘none’
so none of the file ownership settings will

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.420
be modified during the sync.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.570
Click ‘save’ to save the connection profile
and close the connection profile window.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.270
Now it’s time to set the sync operation
to ‘bootable’.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.350
In choosing the bootable operation, ChronoSync
pre-configures the sync document, so it’s

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.920
best to set the sync operation first before
choose any targets.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.800
This is done by clicking the operation pop-up
and selecting ‘Bootable Left-to-right’.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.470
When you choose a bootable operation ChronoSync
will prompt you for admin access because it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.840
needs full access to all files on your hard
drive.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.830
By default, deletions are synched and moved
to the archived items folder at the root of

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.030
your destination target.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.640
If you need to restore any items, you can
do so via the archived panel of your saved

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.150
sync document.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.530
Now it’s time to select the targets.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.030
Because this is a left-to-right sync operation,
I’m going to select the startup disk of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.050
my ChronoSync Mac as the left target.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.980
Then I’m going to select the connection
profile I just created in the ‘Connect to’

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.590
pop-up in the right target pane, and select
my external drive connected to the ChronoAgent

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.350
Mac as the right target.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.620
Just as in performing a local bootable backup
an ‘ignore permissions’ warning may appear.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.120
Just click ‘ok’.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.160
With the sync configured it’s time to save
the sync document.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.850
It’s now time to run the actual sync by
click the ‘synchronize’ button.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.311
Note: It is not unusual for the sync to take
over an hour the first time it is run, but

00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:11.150
it will be quicker when run in the future
as only changed files will be synced.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.720
To save time, the synch in this screencast
has already been run once before.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.400
However, while it will not take as long as
an initial sync, it will still take some time

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.080
to finish, so we’re going to skip ahead
in this screencast.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.220
Finally, when the sync finishes a ‘synchronization
complete’ sheet will appear with details

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.560
of the sync.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.840
If you’ve encountered any errors during
the sync you can check the sync document log

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.050
file by clicking the black log button in the
toolbar of your saved sync document.
