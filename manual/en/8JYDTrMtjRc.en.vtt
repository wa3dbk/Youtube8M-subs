00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:01.755
- Hi, guys. How's it going?

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:04.634
So, how many of you guys
out there are getting ready

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:07.304
for the summertime, you want
to look good for the beach,

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:09.594
or, you know, you just want to feel fit.

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:13.544
I certainly do, and I am really motivated

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:18.124
to start eating healthy and
clean again for this summertime.

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:19.982
Ever since I moved to California,

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:23.163
I've just been indulging
myself with boba tea

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:26.297
and all these delicious baked
goods here in California.

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.802
There's just so many temptations around!

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.913
So, I am motivated to get healthy again,

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:37.551
and today's video I want to
share with you a few delicious

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:40.442
and very, very healthy snacks

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:43.531
or breakfast recipes that
you can prepare for yourself.

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.549
These are really easy, and
they're really, really delicious.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.194
I love to make these as a daytime snack,

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:50.427
or eat them in the morning.

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:52.540
So, let's get started.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.631
So, the first thing we are going

00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:55.767
to be making is the acai bowl.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:57.532
It is so delicious.

00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:00.016
Now, if you're not familiar
with the acai berry,

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:03.545
it is a berry that is grown
in the Amazon rainforest,

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:05.983
and it's also known to be a superfood.

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:10.302
It's full of antioxidants,
vitamin A, B, C,

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:13.093
magnesium, calcium,
and all that good stuff

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:16.641
to keep you looking radiant and beautiful.

00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:19.102
This also makes a great
energizing breakfast,

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:22.283
and also a nice, cold, and
refreshing healthy snack

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.419
for during the daytime.

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:26.307
So, to make this, you're
going to need a packet

00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:27.879
of frozen acai berry.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.574
I found this from my local Sprouts.

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:32.080
You can also find this
at health food stores,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.496
or also your local supermarket.

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:37.236
Granola, I am using organic hemp granola

00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:40.535
that I found from Sprouts,
my local supermarket.

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:44.202
Milk, you can use dairy, soy, coconut.

00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:48.474
I like to use almond milk. It's
delicious, and it's healthy.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:52.793
Fresh and frozen fruits,
I love to have a selection

00:01:52.793 --> 00:01:56.020
of bananas, blueberries, strawberries.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.667
You can pretty much use anything.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.477
OK, so we're going to make
enough for two servings,

00:02:01.477 --> 00:02:03.984
and I'm going to start with two packets

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:06.817
of these frozen acai berries.

00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:09.255
Now I'm going to put some
frozen bananas in here.

00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:11.432
And this is where you can customize this

00:02:11.432 --> 00:02:15.710
and put any other frozen
fruits, or whatever you like.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.311
Now I'm going to add in just
a little bit almond milk,

00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:22.863
like about 1/3 of a cup
to loosen up the mixture.

00:02:22.863 --> 00:02:25.462
Once you have everything
in, go ahead and blend this.

00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:27.389
It might be a little bit
difficult for you to blend,

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.013
because this is going
to be a thick mixture,

00:02:30.013 --> 00:02:31.522
and it should be thick.

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:33.776
So, every now and then, just
take a spoon or something

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:35.121
to loosen up the mixture,

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.117
and then go ahead and
turn on the blender again.

00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:39.417
Once you are done blending,

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:44.349
go ahead and pour that
deliciousness mixture into a bowl.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.506
All you have to do now is top this off

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:48.087
with any toppings of your choice.

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:52.291
I like granola, bananas,
strawberries, blueberries.

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.055
It's so, so delicious.

00:02:54.055 --> 00:02:56.771
I actually took a break
from editing this video

00:02:56.771 --> 00:03:00.302
and made myself another
bowl of the acai berry bowl.

00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:02.460
So good!

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.968
Alrighty, guys, so are you
ready for this next recipe?

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:06.753
We are going to be making some yummy,

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.914
delicious fruit sandwiches.

00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:12.909
I love to eat this before
going out to the gym.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.164
It's not too heavy, but yet
it gives me that extra boost

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:18.218
and energy to work out hard.

00:03:19.118 --> 00:03:21.696
To make this, you will
need some peanut butter,

00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:25.550
granola, some banana, or an apple.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.085
To start, peel your banana,

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:29.056
and then cut it into half like so.

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:32.516
Next, with the apple, cut
the bottom and the top off,

00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:34.931
then I'm going to cut this into fourths.

00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.894
As you can see, I made
this into circular shapes.

00:03:37.894 --> 00:03:41.432
And then I just cut out the
core, so that way, you know,

00:03:41.432 --> 00:03:44.432
I don't have to choke on
it or anything like that.

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.693
Next, take out your peanut
butter and apply that

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:50.917
and spread that onto your slice of fruit.

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:53.449
Then sprinkle on some granola.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.699
And then place the other
half of fruit on top.

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.858
So, that is snack number two.

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:02.318
It is so simple to make, but also yummy.

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:06.219
I love making this as a snack
while I'm watching a movie,

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.262
or before and after a workout,

00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:10.491
so I hope you will enjoy this too.

00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:12.371
So, for this last healthy recipe,

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.484
we are going to be
making a yogurt parfait.

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:17.317
This is a tasty breakfast treat to prepare

00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:18.572
if you're always busy.

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:21.079
I like to prepare this and
store this in my fridge,

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.563
so if I need a quick breakfast,
I have this for on-the-go.

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:27.116
And it's always good to
have a healthy premade snack

00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:28.417
in the fridge for you.

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:31.221
To make this, you will need
a yogurt of your choice,

00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:34.467
some fruits and berries, and granola.

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:36.265
I will also be using some Mason jars.

00:04:36.265 --> 00:04:39.991
You can find this at your local
craft store or supermarket.

00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:45.761
So, first add about two to
four tablespoon of granola.

00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:47.688
Then add in the same amount of yogurt.

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:49.894
Now, you can add in more
or less if you like.

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:52.425
This is just something that I prefer.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.749
Next, add in the fruits.

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.965
I love, love fruit, so I'm
adding half of this jar

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.923
with all the yummy fruits that I like.

00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:04.035
And then, lastly, drizzle on some honey.

00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:06.124
It's optional. You don't have to do it.

00:05:06.124 --> 00:05:10.448
But I like to have that extra
natural sweetness to this,

00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:13.328
and honey just makes this so tasty.

00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:15.668
All right, guys, so that's it.

00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:18.198
Aren't these all so easy to make?

00:05:18.198 --> 00:05:20.776
They're delicious and they're healthy.

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:23.075
I love knowing the fact
that I can easily prepare

00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:24.920
and make myself a healthy snack

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.906
when I'm feeling snackerish (laughs).

00:05:26.906 --> 00:05:28.903
Let me know which one
you guys will be making,

00:05:28.903 --> 00:05:32.108
or which one looks like it's
going to be your favorite.

00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:33.549
Comment below.

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:35.288
All right, guys, that is it for today.

00:05:35.288 --> 00:05:36.589
I hope you enjoyed this video.

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.725
If you do, don't forget
to give it a thumbs up.

00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:40.433
I would so appreciate that.

00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:44.136

And I will talk to you next week.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.400
(kisses) Love you, ciao!
