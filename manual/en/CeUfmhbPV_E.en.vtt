Hi, I'm Jay French, jayfrenchstudios.com,
today I'm going to show you how to draw an

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.210
Anime style. Alright, drawing Anime is mostly
about people and robots. What we're going

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.790
to do with people? In this case, we'll draw
a little guy. Anime heads tend to be, the

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.899
Anime style tends to be a little more exaggerated
especially in making the heads larger on young

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:32.500
characters and the head smaller on older characters.
So we're going to do a young kid here and

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.120
maybe I'll real quick show proportions on
an adult. And this will show a more prominent

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.020
cheekbones and prominent brows ridges. In
a male, it's going to be a little sharper

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.150
like this. The chin can be as sharp as you
like, there's a variation of styles in Anime.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:01.490
You almost want your eyes, or your hair and
eyes, 'cause that is very common Anime style.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.570
You also have pretty wild hair, that's common
for Anime, so we're going to keep that up.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.710
Noses are very minimal, usually just pretty
much a shadow of what is under the nose, the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.310
shadow under the nose. You don't actually
see any of the lines of the nose itself. Mouths

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.940
are very small and simple; your little shadow
of that lower lip, that's all about you're

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.610
going to see that. Now, one of the odd things
about Anime is that, you will get overlap

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.990
from the bangs that are very commonly, as
I said, in the face and they'll, or it get

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.600
overlap between that, in the eyes and eyebrows.
Now the sidelines on the eyes are probably

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.601
not going to be actual incline, you probably
just want to do another division between the,

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:55.970
if you're doing this in color, between the
flash tone and the widesly eyes, just do the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.680
top and bottom lines as black lines. Irises
are very large in Anime, you get a large highlight

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:15.879
line in the pupil, I guess, that's part of
what just Anime sets character. Eyebrows are

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.549
usually fairly thin in male characters or
sometimes a little thicker, can break the

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:30.950
bounce, it's more stylished versions especially.
Break the bounce of the, of the face edge.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.529
And that's your basic young character in Anime.
The big difference from doing a, an older

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:44.239
character or a more muscular character; I'm
just going to draw some quick shoulders here

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.109
to give you an idea, is that they will show
a smaller head, it's one of the few times,

00:02:50.109 --> 00:03:02.749
as in heroic characters or in villains and
you'll often see a very pointed chin,

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.939
sometimes even then you'll actually going
to broad the mouth than you'll actually see.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:13.219
It's still very minimal in the nose and even
though the eyes will be very wide, they might

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:28.889
be very narrow horizontally and probably a
little box here. You may still have big irises

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:37.120
and you can still have some crazy hair. So
now we know what this kid's going to look

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:46.319
like grown up.
And there's a couple of subjects in Anime

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.390
style.
