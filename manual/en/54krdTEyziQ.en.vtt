What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.379
Let's talk about how to get bigger biceps
by understanding what this glove has to do

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.580
with it.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.939
And no, it has nothing to do with actually
putting it on your hand.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.019
It's about understanding how this relates
to the different types of contraction, understanding

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.420
those contractions,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.279
and more importantly, implementing them into
your workouts so that you can get the most

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.789
out of them.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.660
I'm going to show you exactly how to do it
on a bicep exercise in 1 minute. First of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.760
all, the types of contractions that we have.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.000
If you guys have been training for any length
of time you understand there are concentric

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.989
contractions, isometric contractions, and
eccentric contractions.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.320
But ideally, you don't want to just understand
the difference, you want to implement them,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.210
like I said, into your workouts.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.790
The isometric contraction we know, that's
just when we have force-generated tension

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.930
in the muscle but without movement at the
joint.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.239
Secondly, we have the concentric contraction.
That's the one we're all familiar with where

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.539
we actually shorten the muscle as we move
through the range of motion, k.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.360
So, you're shortening as you're contracting
and generating tension in the muscle. And

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.789
then an eccentric contraction is tension in
a muscle with lengthening

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.810
because the exterior load is greater than
the force that we can generate in the muscle

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.560
so we have an elongation of that joint.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.310
Now, here's the deal. I have this glove here
to sort of show you why there's differences

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.659
in your strength levels in each one of these.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.389
This here is going to represent sort of our
shortening, our concentric contraction, and

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.310
the amount of force that we can generate is

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.719
really equal to the amount of force and the
recruitment abilities we have of our body

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.159
to be able to shorten that muscle, alright,

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.439
the amount of muscle fiber engagement we can
generate to shorten that muscle. There's a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.149
good amount of force there for sure.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.349
But what happens when we start to get into
an isometric and eccentric version of this

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:50.560
is we get help,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.779
mechanical help from the muscle itself and
how it's structured and the crossbridge is

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.929
formed. So, when we look at a piece of velcro,
if we put this on top now,

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.409
this is an isometric contraction. We have
the help of the crossbridges being formed

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.190
to allow us to actually hook on and stay in
that position.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.970
Our isometric strength is therefore about
20 percent stronger than it is our concentric

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.700
strength. Eccentrically, if I actually tried
to start grabbing this and pulling it really

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.019
hard,

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.530
but of course I can pull it that way, but
if I try to drag it across there, it's really

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.610
hard and I'm a lot stronger there.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.420
And we are in real life, 40 percent stronger
eccentrically than we are concentrically because

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.719
we have that friction generated by the crossbridges.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.260
So, what does that all mean for us here? It
means, if you want to take a set to true failure

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.640
and promote muscle gains in your biceps,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.950
you're going to want to go through concentric
failure first, isometrics failure second,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.079
eccentric failure third.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:56.079
You do it right here very simply. We get up
here, we set up for a Cable Curl, ok.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.349
The Cable Curl is, our arms are up high. Again,
we can promote shoulder flexion by having

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.379
our arms elevated which is part of a bicep
contraction.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:12.379
So, we're here. We're going to pull in, k,
and we're going to work to concentric failure.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.450
Keeping those elbows high.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.150
Til I can't really execute another good rep.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.150
Now, right into our, right into our isometric
failure. So we can bump up the weight just

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.769
a little bit more because we're a little bit
stronger there.

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.349
We're going to flex-generate tension, walk
back, and hold them up now.

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.409
And we just hold it there isometrically. Again,
this is a heavier weight.

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:12.409
And even though I went to failure concentrically,
I still can maintain a contraction here, but

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:19.410
not much longer.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.410
And now, isometric down. Now eccentric. We
bump up the weight even more. Again, already

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.220
to failure twice.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.220
Get back in here. Flex 'em at 90 degrees here.
Walk it back. And it's pulling me out. Come

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:39.560
in.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.560
There. Walk it back, and it lengthens. Here.
You can even lean back. And down.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.099
Set it up.

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.520
Couple more.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.810
One more.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.810
Until you really can't decelerate that anymore.
Now, for any of you that say, 'Well, I don't

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.030
have a big machine to do that with.'

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.690
All you've got to do is hook up your bands.
Again, single them up, work on them.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.710
Do here for your first ones. And then if you
have to go for the eccentric, just double

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.370
them up so you have extra tension, alright.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.319
Guys, it could take you about 2 and a half
minutes to do one of these sets, and theoretically,

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.289
some would say,

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.199
'You've gone to concentric failure. You've
gone to isometric failure. You've gone to

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.949
eccentric failure. What else is left?'

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:54.250
Not much. Do it a few times. I guarantee,
if you haven't trained all 3 in the same workout,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.300
you're certainly going to be sore.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.629
You going to certainly feel it for a few days
afterwards, and most likely you're going to

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.000
start to see gains by doing that.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.229
Guys, start putting muscle science and physiology
back to work for you so you can get better

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.310
gains in a shorter period of time.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.159
It's about doing more work, doing more effort,
and getting better results.

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.080
ATHLEANX is a program that puts all this into
one step-by-step plan.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.629
I say it, guys, you've seen me say it before,
'Someday is not a day of the week.'

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.250
Ok. Get started. There's no better day than
now. Head to ATHLEANX.COM.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.360
Start putting science back into your strength
and see what it can do for you.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.919
Guys, if you found this video helpful, make
sure you leave a thumb's up below and I'll

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.500
bring more of them to you.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.319
See you guys back here soon.
