00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.970
The people that Jesus sends as prophets are
not going to be persecutors; they're not going

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.970
to be beating people; they're not going to
be hurting people. Yes, they operate with

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.619
authority, but they are not going to be persecutors;
they're going to be persecuted.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.760
Listen to this: Jesus said, Woe to you, experts
in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites!

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.640
You build tombs for the prophets and decorate
the graves of the righteous. And you say,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.350
If we had lived in the days of our ancestors,
we would not have participated with them in

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.450
shedding the blood of the prophets. By saying
this you testify against yourselves that you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.100
are the descendants of those who murdered
the prophets. Fill up then the measure of

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.340
your ancestors, you snakes, you offspring
of vipers. How will you escape being condemned

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.440
to hell? For this reason I am sending you
prophets and wise men and experts in the law.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.969
Some of them you will kill and crucify; some
you will flog in your synagogues, and pursue

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.430
from town to town so that on you will come
all the righteous blood shed on earth; from

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.539
the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of
Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.259
between the temple and the altar. I tell you
the truth, this generation will be responsible

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.800
for all these things. Jesus said that he's
going to send them wise men and prophets and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.480
experts in the law — he's going to send those
people. And who is going to be persecuting,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.590
who is going to be persecuted? Jesus said
I'm going to send these people to you, and

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.009
you — the evil people that I'm calling hypocrites,
that are going to be judged guilty on judgment day —

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.170
you will be persecuting them.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.849
Jesus set up this stage right there.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.580
So if you wanna have success, you need to
learn to read for the right part in the Bible.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.380
It's already been lined out for you; this
whole drama has been lined out for you.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.530
But when you read for the part of the Pharisee,
then you are going to come under the judgment

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.950
of the Pharisee. You think that you're doing
God a service by pursuing people, by slandering

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.539
people, by threatening people, by harming
people you believe are wrong — that are teaching

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.020
false doctrine, or they're wicked, or they're
pagans, or they're politically wrong, or whatever

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.650
it is — you think you're going to be the one
who's going to do God a favor by taking that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.239
person out? You can't kill a spiritual entity
by killing the person that it's taken captive

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.659
to use; they'll just go find another host.
You're not doing God a favor — and in the process,

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.120
you destroyed the one thing that mattered
to God the most, and that was that person

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.730
that was in captivity. Congratulations. That's
not a good thing to do.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.959
I'm being a little hard with you because some
of you just have these little areas of your

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.959
life where you think there are some people
that you can talk bad about, and some people

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.530
that you can throw in the garbage, and some
people that you can discount. These are people

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.069
made in God's image. There are different ways that we beat the servants, aren't there? Sometimes

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.489
people do it physically, but more often than
not, a person that is killed is killed with

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.780
slander. That's how the Pharisees killed Jesus — 
they didn't have to lift a finger,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.050
they did it with their words.
