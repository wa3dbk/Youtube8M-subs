Radio 538 live from Tomorrowland with standing next to me Robert a.k.a. Hardwell!

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.780
How are you?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Can't get any better, we're at Tomorrowland!

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.320
What a party right?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.140
For me, seriously, this is the highlight of the year.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.760
How many times did you come here?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.334
Sixth time.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.600
This is my first time and I still can't handle it.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.240
Yeah this place is awesome. It's hard to describe backstage for viewers. All DJ's are just walking around.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.880
You bump into friends all the time. It's just awesome, such a great experience.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.360
I can only describe it as Disneyland, but now with a ride. Uh I mean stages.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.320
Yeah it's some kind off fairytale world. Like even on the toilet there are flowers

00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:56.586
Talking about Disneyland and Efteling a Dutch themepark.

00:00:56.586 --> 00:00:58.806
You wrote the soundtrack of their latest ride Baron 1898.

00:00:58.806 --> 00:00:59.866
Yes your right.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:03.886
Is it different from making a regular song?

00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:05.891
It's completely different.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.100
Off course they ask me for a new sound. We wanted something modern.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.720
I worked on the original song for the ride, but also created a Hardwell remix.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.400
Which you also get when you get into the ride.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.060
I really liked it, the theme park is around where I grew up. And being part of something like that is really great.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.880
You are also launching a new 360 degrees video clip from which I saw a teaser on YouTube.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.860
Yes, you're right.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.788
How does that work?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.020
It's really bizar, 360 video's are appearing everywhere.

00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:47.407
Yes to be used with those VR glasses.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:50.020
Yes, but also for your iPhone and iPad.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.440
When you hold your device and turn around you are in the middle of everything, you're there. It's bizar.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:06.060
My Miami aftermovie is now online in 360 degrees. So don't watch it with your laptop but with your iPhone.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.940
It's so awesome, you see me at the Miami music week. One week in 7 minutes.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.120
You're walking with me and can look wherever you want to look at. If you want to look at my shoes? Just watch.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.020
I got one question from a listener.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.300
Yesterday Afrojack parked his brand new Rolls Roys on the parking lot starting at â‚¬ 466.000 just a small detail.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.800
But where are you spending your money on?

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.269
My studio and beer!

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.349
Is that it?!

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.369
I'm afraid so. [laughing]

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.680
I don't have a fancy car, well a nice Audi. But not a supercar.

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:47.725
I don't take a jet from Amsterdam to Vegas.

00:02:48.424 --> 00:02:50.424
So there is still some money on your bank account?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.620
Yes, I have a lovely house, a nice studio and I'm happy with what I've got.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.160
I don't need expensive cars, because I can only drive one at a time. And I'm traveling a lot.

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:02.844
He stayed so normal, gotta love him.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.080
Have fun and see you soon.
