00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.110
Bike and the Bagger, part two of three.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.769
Kyle from Cruiser Customizing here with part
two of your three-part Bike and the Bagger

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:08.769
tip of the week.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.790
Here in front of me I’ve got the leaders
in the industry when it comes to farings on

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.960
the front of you motorcycle, whether it be
Metric or Harley Davidson. We’ve got Memphis

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.190
Shades, Sport Tech, KuryAkin with their Air
Master Faring, and today we’re going to

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.180
show you the features and benefits of each
of these specific farings, and then towards

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.540
the end we’re going to show you the install.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.160
The features and differentiators of these
three farings.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.480
I have Johnny here from Memphis Shades and
he’s going to show us the features and benefits

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.230
of the Memphis Shades Batwing Faring.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.760
[Johnny] Thanks a lot, Kyle. Basically when
Memphis Shades designed this faring we had

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.800
three things in mind. It was function, it
was to push the wind more efficiently, style,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.260
which it’s our own unique shape, and then,
of course, value, which in this case, we’ve

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.010
utilized the mounting system that we’ve
previously used for the bikes to keep the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.010
costs down.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.800
[Kyle] Now probably one of the most neat pieces
or neat features about your particular faring

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.340
is that it’s the only faring on the market
that’s truly equipped disconnect.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.030
[Johnny] Yeah absolutely Kyle. Basically what
we’ve done here is we just locate the mounting

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.249
plates, just as on the Memphis Fats windshields
or any of our other windshield lines. Just

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:20.170
locate the mounting plates right on the back
of the faring and it just rocks right onto

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.740
the existing docking hardware if a person
already has a trigger-lock setup on their

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.740
motorcycle.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.069
Now on the display faring here we’ve got
a little shorty five-inch windshield, which

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.320
a lot of them come with, a lot of them will
offer that up right out the gate, but then

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.369
we’ve got the 7, 9, and then the 12 inch--if
you look at the shape of the faring, you’ll

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.400
see that the wind has quite a bit more time
to change its mind where it wants to go. And

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.130
by the time the windshield actually releases
the wind back here closer to the rider, it’s

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.939
already going around and creating a lot large
pocket.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.679
[Kyle] The Sport Tech Faring here is definitely
the middle of the road. It’s a little bit

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.840
more expensive than the Memphis Shades. The
Sport Tech faring is a super-generic model

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.950
of the KuryAkin Air Master Faring. Here’s
the AirMonster faring over here, and this

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.869
is definitely the premier faring.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.969
You’ve got your glove box already wired
for your iPod, so it charges and plays all

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.480
at the same time. You’ve got your CD changer,
stereo, and motorcycle specific speakers.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.190
So the installation of the Air Master is identical
to the installation of the Sport Tech, which

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.489
we’re going to show you today.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.520
Alright, now we’re going to remove this
screw right down here that holds the turn

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.469
signal on as well as this one right here at
the top of the triple-tree. And then we’re

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.440
going to install the bracket. So now that
we’ve got the left and right brackets installed

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.770
up front, we’re going to go ahead and re-install
this nice little chrome piece right here,

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.951
and then we’ll get to the faring.

00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:50.180
So here we just removed these nuts from these
four bolt points here inside the faring and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.000
now we’re going to take the brackets, install
the brackets, and we should be about done.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.500
We’ve got about 3/4 of an inch off the down
adjustment here. We’re going to start with

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.549
the plates all the way in the down position,
making the faring all the way high, at which

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.519
point you can mount the ones we’ve mounted
on the motorcycle, we can adjust it accordingly.

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.820
Now that we’ve got our trigger lock plates
mounted to the faring, it’s just like this,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:22.230
the faring drops right onto the docking hardware,
bottom first, down, and then the top rocks

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.530
right back in, latch, and you’re good to
go.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.209
This week we’re going to be installing the
Sport Tech faring, which installs identically

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.769
as the Air Master Faring from KuryAkin. Come
take a look at these different brackets.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.689
Here are the brackets from KuryAkin for the
Air Master Faring. And these are the black

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.150
Sport Tech brackets. Now, the black brackets
and the chrome brackets can be used on either

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.180
faring. But take a look: I like the Sport
Tech faring. The nuts are actually welded

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.329
to the bracket, so it’s one less thing you’ve
got to hold onto as you’re installing the

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.329
faring.

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.889
Installation is so incredibly simple. Take
a look. The brackets are going to be up here.

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.920
We’re going to remove this bottom bolt and
top bolt, slide this bracket in place, and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.439
replace those two bolts and then the faring
attaches to the side here.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.230
Now that I’ve got this tall bolt removed
and this bottom nut removed, I’m going to

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.200
bring my new bolts and new bracket over. Now
this new bracket is going to go underneath

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:27.390
the headlight mount just like so.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.370
Alright, so I’ve got these snug now. Now
we’re going to want these brackets to be

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.060
able to move so that we don’t bite into
the faring. And we also want to make sure

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.250
that we’re not binding or pitching any of
the other lines in the farings.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.750
So we’ve got the faring brackets mounted,
we’re going to bring the faring over here.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.780
We’re then going to line it up on these
two brackets and just like so and thread in

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.780
our bolts.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:58.600
And here we are the Memphis Shades Batwing
faring. And the Sport Tech Faring by KuryAkin.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.250
Thank you for watching this Bike and the Bagger
Part 2 of 3 tip of the week. Join us next

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.260
when we show you the ease of removal and installation
of both of the bagger, faring, and saddlebags.
