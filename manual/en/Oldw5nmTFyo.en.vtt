00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.871
- Don't worry, you look tired

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:11.831

00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.171
- Matias, how was the school today?

00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:39.771
- very well in science. but I have problems in mathematics.

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:42.731
good, but we must work to improve.

00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:45.671
and I'm here to help you.

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:49.051
- Thanks, Daddy, I'll leave ready notebooks.

00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:56.131
- Forgive me, because of me you have to eat very burnt bread.

00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:58.244
I'm so tired.

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:02.951
- Do not worry my dear, I sometimes like burnt bread.

00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:07.171
and now as I can see you're tired.

00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:12.191
Please to sleep, to rest, because tomorrow will be a better day.

00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:13.106

00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:26.211
- Look son.

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.531
Your mother had a hard day at work today.

00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:34.351
and...

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:37.591
She serves us here at home.

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:41.451
a bread, a little burnt, it does not hurt anyone.

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:47.651
we must know that life is full of imperfect things.

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:50.111
imperfect people

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:58.511
and we must accept those differences in other people.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:03.271
it will help us have a healthy and lasting relationship.

00:03:03.271 --> 00:03:06.331
a burnt bread does not have to break the heart of someone you love.

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:12.771
understanding and tolerance are the foundation of a good relationship.

00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:16.091
you have to be more friendly than you think necessary.

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.071
because people have problems

00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:21.271
we all have problems

00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:23.651
we are all learning to live

00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:27.451
and might not reach this life to learn what it takes.

00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:30.851
the way to happiness is not right

00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.331
there are curves are called mistakes.

00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.851
There are traffic lights are called friends.

00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.951
there are signs of caution are called family.

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:43.311
and for all of this work.

00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:48.071
we have to have a tire emergency, called decision.

00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:51.171
we need a strong engine called love.

00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:56.071
we have to have enough fuel called patience.

00:03:56.071 --> 00:04:01.431
and above all, we must have an excellent driver that is called God.

00:04:01.431 --> 00:04:04.591
this is how we will fly our lives. my dear son.

00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:07.891

00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:12.151
