Welcome to Lazydays, we're inside the new 2014 Winnebago Tour 42QD.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.820
So here in the cockpit area, in addition to the standard features we've got some really nice stuff that make

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.810
this Winnebago Tour extra special, dual dash
monitoring system that's extra special because

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.259
you can control what goes back and forth between
these two screens. These custom seats are

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.410
absolutely amazing wit built in bolsters,
massage and heat. Here in the living room

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.640
of the new 2014 Winnebago Tour, they have
custom L-shaped sectional sofa, and then it

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.760
also turns into a king bed if you fully extend
the ottoman. Looking around at this beautiful

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:01.960
cabinetry, this is all solider cherry. Then
you look at your 47 inch LCD 1080P HD Television

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.710
with 5.1 surround sound and an electric fireplace
underneath it. So here in the galley we have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.670
what we like to call the chef's kitchen. As
you look around, you'll see that there's drawers

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.409
on the backside for spatulas, under cabinet
lighting, the very latest and greatest in

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:33.670
technologies as far as appliances. Then you
come over to the Whirlpool refrigerator with

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.829
ice and water in the door just like at home.
Across from the refrigerator and pantry you

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.520
have a half bath, which is a really nice feature
to have. This bed here in the master bedroom,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.359
I like to call the ice cream bed, and what
makes the bed so special is it is on an electric

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.990
lift where you can tip it so that you can
eat your ice cream at night while you watch

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:03.429
the news. Another high definition television.
So moving back into the large rear master

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:12.720
bathroom, this is a very very large shower
with a very large medicine cabinet. With the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.280
residential sized stacked washer and dryer,
it sure makes it nice to do a week's worth

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.260
of laundry at once. Up front here we have
the largest windshield in the industry. Going

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.650
down on the side here, to be able to have
all of the wonderful features inside with

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:39.050
the full wall slide and all of the big furniture,
you've got to have the right foundation.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.060
Thankyou for touring the Winnebago Tour 42QD. If
you have any other questions about any of

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.140
the models here at Lazydays, feel free to
give us a call.
