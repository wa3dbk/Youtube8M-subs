00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.220
Ok, This is a review on CPS 2000

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.820
It is the most wanted water gun in the world

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.300
It holds a record since 1996

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.700
as the most powerful water gun 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.060
Ever made

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.640
This water gun is a "Bad-Ass" water cannon

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.960
with length of 90cm

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.420
Weight 1.5kg without water

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.080
Add to this a 3 liters of water in its reservoir

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.240
And almost 1 liter of water in its pressure chamber

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920
Hmmm... CPS 2000

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.740
Also known for its legend story

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.800
In the 90's, some kids were playing with it, and someone received a pretty bad eye injury

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.480
And since then - it's production line stopped

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.580
And from then, all productions are less powerful and less danger then this one

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.520
So, from what has left of it

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.580
As I was said

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.420
You can't find it in stores

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.880
And you can find it in eBay and collectors

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.900
It shooting range is up to 15 meters

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.660
Output power of almost 1 liter per second

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.920
This is not a toy for kids

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.960
It is actually a weapon
