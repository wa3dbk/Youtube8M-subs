Hi, I'm Jay from Real Street Performance. Today,

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.539
we're going to talk about doing a boost leak check, and why it's important on your forced inducted vehicle.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.768
On a force inducted engine, boost is power.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.439
So you want to make sure that the system is not leaking air because if it's losing boost, it's going to be losing power.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.849
Depending on the system

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.869
and how its set up, having a boost leak is detrimental in a few different ways. On a

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.559
turbocharged car, if you have a boost leak, the turbocharger will just speed up to meet the same boost target most of the time.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.878
And that's going to increase back pressure and the workload on the turbocharger. In addition to that, if you have a mass airflow sensor car

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.069
it's accounting for a certain amount of air.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.850
And if that air doesn't

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.870
pass through the entire system and leave the tailpipe, then the fueling is going to be off. On a map sensor based car,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.230
the boostics will typically make for an

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.350
erratic map signal which will change

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.960
injector pulse width and

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.769
the timing. And make that an erratic situation which is harder to tune, making for an engine that doesn't run as well.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.189
So in order to do this test, you're going to make yourself a tool or

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.809
if you could probably purchases through a vendor online. But the idea is to

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.249
cap the inlet of the turbocharger and fill the system with air. And then start fishing around for air leaks. So

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.249
you can use a spray bottle full of soapy water. You can use the smoke machine if you have access to that.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.259
Or just use your ears if it's quiet.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.499
So unless you have an engine that has a tremendous amount of overlap where both valves are open at the same time,

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.869
you can just feed air into the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.259
turbocharger, and

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.820
just listen.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.949
If you need to use a spray bottle with some soap in it you can do that and spray around.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.439
But generally you can hear the leaks and go chase them down. Whether it be a

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.700
coupler or a vacuum line or maybe the intercooler core is split. But if you just beat air into the system,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.960
and then just take a listen. You can generally fish out where they are.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.770
This car has these

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.220
quick couplers on the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.160
boost control solenoid with a nylon line. And one of the seals is leaking on that. So that'll be the first thing

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
we address. This is something you want to do

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.950
before tuning.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.720
