00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.180
cornell university and u_c_l_a_ decided
to figure out

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.049
are not people with college degrees are
more likely to get married

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.699
and what they do

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.709
is a specifically looked at people who
have a disadvantaged backgrounds so they

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.510
come from low income families

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.800
but they've managed to go to college and
get an education anyway but what's

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.470
interesting is among these groups of
people it's very unlikely that they get

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.300
married while not unlikely but it's
actually the rates are lower

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.019
when it comes to that getting married

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.039
because it's difficult for them seal
marry someone that comes from a

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.609
privileged background because usually
people from privileged background don't

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:36.690
want to do that

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.500
and they don't want a married down
people who are from disadvantaged

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.440
backgrounds but did not get a college
degree so it's a really interesting

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.370
finding and you know there was

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.399
another study done by depute research
center back in twenty ten

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.389
and they claimed that if you get a
college degree you're more likely to get

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:54.120
married

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.020
but it's obviously not the case for a
every group of kurt people brown talking

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.680
about going up ten percent less likely
for a firm and borders and then you go

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.289
to college

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.400
it's forty percent less likely which is
huge

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.470
so it's like he said that i mean the
people who are well off forgotten be

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.790
less likely want to marry them and also
they don't have a lot of people of the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.160
same class in college with them because
difficult for those people to go to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.540
college so

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.610
i mean i know from my own

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.830
point of view i come from a somewhat
this abandoned my family's very

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.689
lower-middle class at best uh...

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.329
it is up with something that i think
about

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.750
the people go to college you know from
the zijn dissidence background so they

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.009
want with the american dream they want
the money they want the job they want

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.520
the stereotypical family and with the
economy being bad it's difficult to get

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.280
some of the economic portions of that
but at the very least you want

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.380
that idea of like the family did some
sort of better in some ways in your own

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.049
was and it's really difficult because
this is harder for men than it is for

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.240
women clearly look at the numbers and
you can tell that with women there

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.230
twenty two percent less likely compare
it to those

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.820
who out came from

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.210
uh... i guess wealthier background check
though ekeus x-men

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.420
and at a higher rate because

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.880
i think society expects men to have a
lot more when it comes to have to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.590
financial stability exactly so i think
someone who comes awam in for instance

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.810
who comes from a wealthy background even
if she has the same education as a guy

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.500
she'll probably look at his background
and be like and i know he comes from a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.060
poor family i don't know if i would
consider that her bring that into my

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.849
family which is absurd but that's just
the way society is we don't talk about

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.700
art class anymore you know which last
year in and how really fancy but it does

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.869
affect you and it's it's horrible it
that's the case

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:33.860
yeah i think

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.870
uh... the lesson from this is if your
guy and college don't talk about your

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.950
family man nine save up the girl down
already i have seen wishes got the money

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.890
wait that's so funny and marion mcintyre
make sure there's no pre-nuptial

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.500
mentality was clearly not we'll really
have any your data from our own

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.840
experience is that that's really applet
wilder this i'm wondering what the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.469
audience things did you ever have a
relationship that

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.679
in received a lot of pressure from your
family or from your friends this in the

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.099
fact that you look at your partner

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.959
wasn't well off i'm really curious about
that yap definitely you sent us a video

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.290
if how you experienced anything similar
to that

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.940
itself one of the intense

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.900
we actually get into this video has no
intention you click on a escaping a deal

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.440
with some of you with instructions for
us in the hank
