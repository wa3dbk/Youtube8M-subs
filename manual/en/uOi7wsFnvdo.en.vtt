00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.833
My name is Lucerito Ortiz.
I’m from North Hills, California.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.000
My parents are
two of the hardest-working people.

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:16.500
My dad works in gardening.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.267
My mom found work as a housekeeper.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.533
We have a big family.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.667
We have to find ways to save
as much as we can.

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.100
I learned to sew.

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:32.333
We have chickens, so that way
we don’t have to buy eggs.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.467
They’re very, very delicious.
Much better than store-bought eggs.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:40.100
And we cook at home.
It’s different ways to save money.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:42.900
They’ll sacrifice anything and everything
for their children...

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:46.767
and they’ve worked incredibly hard
to get us to where we are.

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:51.633
My daughter is a very, very
responsible person...

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.733
and she loved school.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.733
But I ended up applying
sort of as a joke, as a dare.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.700
A couple of friends and I were
out on the track one day, just chatting.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:06.367
We just said–
We were laughing–

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.833
“It would be so funny
if you applied to Harvard.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.400
We could frame your rejection letter.”

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:12.367
One day, Lucerito called me...

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:15.833
and she said,
“Mom, guess what.”

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.000
The letter was there.
I was on the phone with my mom.

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:19.567
I said, “Mom, hold on.”

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:24.467
And then she said,
“Mom, I was accepted at Harvard.”

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.200
I ran all over my house,
just yelling and screaming...

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:28.867
and told my whole family...

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.067
and we were all just in utter shock.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:35.133
My husband and I talked about,
“We don’t have the money.”

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.067
I found out that for a family like ours...

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.167
we wouldn’t have to worry
about affording Harvard.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.000
Harvard has such an amazing
financial aid program...

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:47.733
that for us, in reality,
it was much more affordable...

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.467
than attending any of the state schools.

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:54.800
I really, really admire her,
and I’m so proud of her.

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:58.033
For me, Harvard wasn’t just for me...

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.800
it was for my whole family...

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:04.100
and I think my whole family
has benefited immensely...

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:06.667
from our experience at Harvard.

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:10.200
It’s an incredible feeling...

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:14.267
to feel like I was finally able
to give something back to my family...

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:17.733
after everything they sacrificed for me.
