00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:06.587
I'm fisheries specialist…

00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:09.055
I'm the one that primarily 
operates the hatchery.

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:11.174
Over the years we've lost

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.087
a lot of our
natural spawning habitat, 

00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:16.267
so we've found that
one thing that we can do

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:20.394
is take northern pike eggs 
from a few adults, 

00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:25.215
and harvest the eggs,
and hatch those eggs inside, 

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:28.361
and stock those fry 
into wetlands in the area,

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.370
and we've been having
pretty good success .

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.667
[sound of water splashing]

00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:35.971
The first thing we do is 
go and collect brood stock. 

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:41.074
Should be a good female.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.287
We do it a couple 
of different ways, 

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:45.448
we've got traps 
that we set in ditches.

00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:50.819
Another way is to go into 
the lakes after the ice goes off 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:53.147
and set trap nets…

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:57.281
[sound of fish 
being dumped into tub]

00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:00.699
and collect the adult pike
that way.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.133
Once we have the pike harvested 
out of those bodies of water, 

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.036
we bring them back
to the hatchery, 

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:10.387
and we take the milt 
from the males,

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:11.933
and we aspirate that.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.627
We want to keep the water as 
much out of it as possible,

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:17.661
keep everything dry, 
so that the semen

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:21.820
and the eggs don't get water 
until we want that to happen,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.820
collect about three to four cc's
into a vile,

00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:28.486
and then take the eggs 
from the females…

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:31.057
and then we use a solution 
of sodium bicarbonate. 

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:34.403
By doing that, when you
add the semen to the pan,

00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:38.228
you can get the sperm cells
spread throughout the eggs 

00:01:38.228 --> 00:01:41.180
before you activate them 
with water.

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:43.550
You want to make sure that
that sperm cell is able

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:45.620
to come in contact 
with one of those eggs.

00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:49.500
Once you activate that semen, 
they will only live for about

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:52.400
30 seconds to a minute and a half.

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:54.820
Once they're activated, 
we leave them in the pan 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.940
for approximate 
three to five minutes, 

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:59.640
and then they are 
put into a basket

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:01.830
and water-hardened overnight. 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.190
After they're water-hardened,
they're put on the battery, 

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:11.890
and incubated in those jars
for approximately 7 to 14 days.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.920
We keep them in the hatchery
until they start swimming.

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:18.550
Once they start swimming,
they need to find food, 

00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:21.160
so that's when we stock them 
out into the natural…

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:24.960
either natural wetlands, or
artificial wetlands that we have.

00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:30.280
I have people come in 
and tell me that,

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:33.480
'I've been fishing on 
such and such a lake', 

00:02:33.475 --> 00:02:35.980
say Jefferson Lake,
'and for some reason 

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:38.750
the pike population 
is tremendous, 

00:02:38.747 --> 00:02:41.020
and we go over there 
and we can catch fish'…

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.550
that's the satisfying 
part of this job.
