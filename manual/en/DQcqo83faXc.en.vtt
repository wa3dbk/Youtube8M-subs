00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:04.123
What up people, it is your homegirl Shameless, all up in your building.

00:00:04.123 --> 00:00:07.013
This is gonna address the buzz.

00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:10.268
I did a video explaining why I buzzed my hair.

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:13.398
I did a video of me actually buzzing my hair.

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:17.868
And I'ma do a video on my thoughts after the fact.

00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:22.308
I shaved my hair off 2 months ago, so I guess that's enough time for me to process everything,

00:00:22.508 --> 00:00:28.238
and also finally answer the questions on all social networks concerning my buzz.

00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:34.898
I did an interview with naturallycurly.com. Make sure you check it out, it was a 3-part series; how I felt before, during and after.

00:00:34.898 --> 00:00:38.068
So read the description box. It's a really interesting article. 

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:42.558
And for all my curly girls--and boys--check out the website. Okay?

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:44.628
How do I feel about my buzz?

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:51.338
I love it! I mean, I'm used to it, I feel more comfortable in this haircut than I do with the big, bushy hair.

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:56.898
And that's because I've had that big, bushy hair for like, over 15 years.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:01.838
So I can gladly shave it off and give it to someone else who needs it.

00:01:01.838 --> 00:01:06.118
FYI, I did donate my hair to Locks of Love.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.200
That's my choice. For all you guys wanting to be like, adding your 2 cents.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.790
Yes, they do have a sliding scale for their patients who pay for their wigs, but it is an expensive process to make a wig.

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:27.548
Really and trully you can just buy a synthetic one for $10, $20. But it costs thousands of dollars to make a custom wig.

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:28.548
That's that.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:34.307
You guys are asking like, why I was crying--I don't think you watched my Draw My Life video.

00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:37.737
I have been going through a divorce off camera.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:43.938
It is the most painful, heart-wrenching thing on the face of the earth, and I never wanna go through that again.

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:49.588
I was crying because of the experiences that were associated with that and I was actually letting it go.

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:59.678
You guys love the beautiful locks, thank you. Too many memories, negative thoughts, experiences, that I just don't need to hold on to anymore.

00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:01.368
So I'm more than happy to cut off all my hair.

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:04.823
That's what I was going through during the head shave.

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:09.543
In terms of after, I felt free. Very light.

00:02:09.543 --> 00:02:14.913
I could feel the wind on my scalp girls, I was taking showers in slow motion.

00:02:15.523 --> 00:02:19.513
I forgot I shaved my head--so I went about my business as usual.

00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:25.863
And then I woke up the next morning to go brush my teeth, and I saw my bald head.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.800
It was the most visually jarring thing on the face of the earth.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.950
To go from long, curly hair, to an immediate, drastic change, I no longer recognize the reflection.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.110
Because my hair is such a big part of me. Not having it, not seeing it was very weird.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.950
I also felt very vulnerable, and exposed.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.200
It's just something I've always had, and... I have a new found respect for people that have alopecia,

00:02:56.584 --> 00:03:01.824
that are going through chemo, any sort of hair loss.

00:03:02.174 --> 00:03:09.014
It's an interesting journey. For me at least. I just had all these insecurities even though I talked about it.

00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:12.684
Talk is cheap. And being about it is completely different than talking about it.

00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.751
And at least my personal experience--I know some girls just shave it and they're like, 'woohoo!'

00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:24.283
Yeah, that's how I was but internally, I have all these questions like, 'oh my God, how do people perceive me and what do I look like?'

00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:28.283
And even thought I'm all about like, you know, doing you, those thoughts still enter.

00:03:28.543 --> 00:03:32.913
I gotta get over it. But those thoughts entered my mind--I felt very vulnerable, very weak.

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:41.353
Because the idea of baldness, for me I learned, is a sign of vulnerability and weakness.

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:45.636
When you have a newborn, they're vulnerable. They're bald.

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:48.986
When you're aging, when you lose your hair, that's like a sign of aging.

00:03:48.986 --> 00:03:52.996
And when you're going through chemotherapy, that's a sign of vulnerability.

00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:59.456
It's just all of these things that the brain, for me at least, naturally associates with balding ... it was just like...

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:06.166
I adjusted. And I still--despite those thoughts--I still went out and lived my life. 

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:09.406
Like, I still... work it out, you know what I'm saying?

00:04:11.394 --> 00:04:18.804
It's so important to just be so in tune with who you are and knowing who you are and embracing who you are.

00:04:18.804 --> 00:04:21.824
Anyways. Okay, that's a very long-winded thing.

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:23.054
What did my mom think?

00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:27.534
My  mom thought I was crazy. She like, got worried sick. Literally.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.570
Despite me calling her every month, reminding her, 'Mom, I'm gonna shave my hair.'

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.670
When it finally came she just couldn't deal with it.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.880
She called me all anxious and like, 'oh my godness, what is going on are you crazy?! What is going on with my daughter--

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.050
oh my goodness, you are so skinny, you need to eat!'

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.960
She didn't like it. I got really annoyed and mad, I hung up the phone and thank goodness that I live in New York and she lives in Toronto.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.170
But a week later, she like, warmed up to it. And by the time she got here to New York, she actually prefers my hair short.

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.229
Am I a lesbian?

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.429
Just because I have short hair, doesn't make me a lesbian.

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:05.779
I am not a lesbian. FYI.

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:07.509
Do you think hair is important?

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:14.715
I think it is. I think confidence is important. I also think family is important.

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:19.665
I also think reading a book is important. So I think a lot of things are important.

00:05:19.665 --> 00:05:28.495
Businesses, advertizing agencies, corporations, salons, all of that don't make millions of dollars because it isn't important. Okay?

00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:31.915
But if you don't have any hair, that's okay too.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:36.575
Because what's important is what's on the inside.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.930
Is hair more than just hair?

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.520
Is a wedding ring more than a ring? Yes.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.310
It's just the meaning that you give. It's an extension of who you are.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.320
You can be so expressive with your hair--you can bleach it, you can put extensions in it, you can put weave, you can wear wigs.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:01.800
So yeah. But if you have no hair, that's okay. I think a bald, confident man is attractive.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.000
Jean-Luc Picard. Star Trek. Okay?

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:09.461
He's bald! But he's so like... stoic. I think that is so attractive.

00:06:09.461 --> 00:06:13.921
I'm not saying I wanna date Jean-Luc Picard, but I'm just saying that as a kid, 

00:06:13.921 --> 00:06:20.471
seeing him and his bald head but he's still like, strong... that's admirable to me.

00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:29.771
When I see people who look different than the norm, and just wear it really fierce, they wear confidence really well,

00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:31.281
that's so attractive.

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.001
Grace Jones? Hello?

00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:38.381
Bald is fierce, okay? But I think confidence is even sexier. 

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:41.671
So whether you have hair or no hair, as long as you're confident...

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:46.431
Any regrets? No, I don't have any regrets.

00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:48.941
When I see myself with the long hair, I'm just like, wow.

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:54.499
I don't recognize her anymore, like I've now done a complete 180.

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:57.709
But I think, embrace, do you.

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:59.679
How long will I keep my hair short?

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:02.719
Indefinitely for sure--I'm gonna keep it short for the summer.

00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:07.955
I'll probably grow it in a little bit for the winter/fall, 'cause it's gonna be cold.

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:13.853
But I'm gonna keep this short hair for a while. I don't see myself going back long.

00:07:14.344 --> 00:07:17.904
I keep it shameless. I be shameless, yo.

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:19.124
That's it right?

00:07:19.124 --> 00:07:24.054
I wanna know what you guys think about hair. And I wanna know what you think about your own hair.

00:07:24.304 --> 00:07:27.874
Or let me know what not having any hair means to you. Okay?

00:07:28.544 --> 00:07:30.694
I just wanna know!

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:32.114
See you guys soon, okay? 

00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:34.564
I love you!

00:07:35.514 --> 00:07:39.654
And of course I got my homeboy Jay Elliot's beats all up in this!

00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:43.034
