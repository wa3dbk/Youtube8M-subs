00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.379
Well we've come in for another update of the
200, the All 4 Adventure 200. And they've

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:18.270
got, they've put in all the supports now for
the canopy that's going on the back. The back

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.710
window's in. See the back window in there.
All the reverse camera, the standard reverse

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.480
camera that was on the back where the tailgate
used to be that doesn't exist anymore. 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.690
We've got all the wiring, the wiring's done. It's
starting to, it's really coming together now.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.149
The suspension is in. If you have a look over
here, you can see the suspension.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.510
So there's the suspension sitting in there.
The coils and airbags.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:53.170
And of course, the XTR EFS shock absorbers
are in. And I think they've put 'em in the

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.800
front. Have you put 'em in the front yet?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.799
Yeah, mate. Yeah, they're all done in the
front as well.

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.839
Oh sweet, so they've got the new XTR struts
in the front.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.050
And see, let's have a look in the cab here.
Oh look at that. Look at that. Get a load

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.050
of that. Probably turn the light on. You might
be able to see it.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.760
It looks like it came, it looks like it just
came off the factory floor at Toyota.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.790
Lookin' pretty sharp. Very sharp. Very sharp.
Oh here's those little tool boxes.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.190
Oh look at that. You gotta love that.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.630
You gotta love that. You don't get that storage
in the wagon. Because that's where the wheel

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.170
used to be.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.170
All we need now is-- oh yeah, it's got all
that on with the lift kits in place. 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.789
And there's the big gap. That's where the 
long-range tank's gonna go.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.789
And of course, we just need some rubber now.
Some, some tyres. Some off-road tyres. 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.540
Starting to look pretty good. So, she's 
nearly there, mate. Nearly there.
