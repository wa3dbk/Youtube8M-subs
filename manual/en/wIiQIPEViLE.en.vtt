00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.200
Hi, I'm Soojin Kwon, director of
admissions at the Ross School of

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.840
Business

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.379
we hear from prospective students all
across the world who tell us how they use

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:09.160
spreadsheets and

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.950
meticulous note taking to compare
business schools. Well that's really nerdy...

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.800
and I love it! Taking a critical approach
to such a big decision is important to

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.900
making sure you're finding the right
school for  you.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.300
So, in that spirit, I'd like to take
you through how

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.140
I would build a business school
comparison spreadsheet, to give you an

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.269
idea of what to look for as you're evaluating schools.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.700
There are a bunch of ways to go about this. There are rankings, of course,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.280
and while they do have a place in
helping us understand schools, they miss a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.690
lot of the qualitative data that's
really important for making a decision.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.340
Those prospective students who've built their own spreadsheets to evaluate schools on a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.469
more personal level

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.550
are really onto something. So here we go. I'd start by making the top row

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.739
a list of the schools I'm interested in. I'll put Ross first.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.690
I might have a bit of a bias already. But I'll follow it up with some

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.519
other schools I'm considering

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.929
Down the first column here
I'm gonna put the qualities I think are

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.429
important in selecting a Business School
and evaluating fit.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.830
You may already have your own
personal criteria

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.400
but I encourage you to consider these as
well, if they're not already

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.369
on your list. The first thing I'm gonna
list here is one that all MBA's will

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.979
agree is important, and that is access to the careers and companies that interest me.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.439
Do the companies I want to work for
recruit at this business school?

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.350
If your goal is less traditional does
the school have alums

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.939
working in that field you could talk to?
Each school will fair differently

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.280
depending on your individual career
goals,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.049
so make sure you check out employment
reports, and talk to students and alums

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.549
in your desired industry. I'll link to
ways to help you do both those for Ross

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.670
in the video description. Next I want to
look at the experiences the school

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.030
will give me. Will I primarily sit in class and listen to professors talk and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.020
discuss cases, or will I get to do things,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.780
get my hands dirty so to speak. I don't
know about you, but I learn more,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.870
and pay more attention, when I get to do
things. At Ross, we do this through

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.250
action-based learning. From the moment
you arrive on campus until you walk

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.220
across stage at graduation,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.360
you're doing things. Whether it's
helping 400 of your classmates launch a startup to

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.960
encourage youth

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.800
entrepreneurship in Detroit, or running
a venture fund, or working on a map

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.190
project in Brazil, there are so many
opportunities it is impossible for me to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.100
point to just one.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.820
So check out some of the links in the video description for more.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.960
Next, I'll look at the school's culture. I know I'm going to achieve more

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.780
if I'm surrounded by people who inspire and motivate me. So I should be looking to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.020
see if those kinds of people will be at the
schools

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.990
I'm interested in attending. You can do this by evaluating a few factors.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.430
First, the Alumni Network. Where are they,
geographically

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.680
and industry-wise. Next, chat with
current students. Are the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.320
passionate about their program, because
if they are, the school must be doing

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.540
something right.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.790
Finally, meet with and network with other
applicants

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.130
to these schools. Could I see myself working with them during business school

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.709
and potentially beyond? There are more
qualities to consider of course, but

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.860
this will help you get started on the deep
dive we hope you're doing

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.489
as you consider your business school options.
We'd love for you to visit us here at Ross

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.570
to meet our students and help you gain
the insight needed to fill out

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.380
your own evaluations spreadsheet. Links to register for one of our visit days can

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.080
be found in the video description

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.459
along with the link to my complete
spreadsheet. Thanks so much for watching.
