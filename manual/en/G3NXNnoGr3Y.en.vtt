[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.119
ANDREW ALDRICH: The way we
communicate is changing.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.240
It's getting faster,
and we're optimizing

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.640
for the smaller screen.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.900
And the written word
just can't keep up.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.280
HANNAH BEECHER:
Can a word smile?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.150
Can it roll its eyes or
say sorry, not sorry?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.210
People use emoji because
it provides context.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.130
EMILY MEE: If somebody were
able to just explicitly say,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.820
hey, I'm flirting with you,
or hey, I'm mocking you,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.220
that would just make my
life a lot more efficient.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.575
HANNAH BEECHER: And that's
exactly what emojis do.

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:34.700
ANDREW ALDRICH: That's why
here on the Chrome team,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.020
we're excited to announce Google
Translate support for emoji.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.300
With the click of a button,
our translation algorithm

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.390
interprets the context
and tone of words

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.510
and distills them down into
clear, articulate meaningful

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.820
symbols.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.320
Fancy gentleman.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.680
Cut a rug.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.923
Shy snowman.

00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:54.090
DANIEL ZIMNEY: When we build
the translation system,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.500
we need to understand how
people are using language.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.040
So in building Translate for
Emoji on Chrome for mobile,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.380
we looked at lots of
users and how they express

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.993
different things using emoji.

00:01:02.993 --> 00:01:04.410
HANNAH BEECHER:
Emoji is processed

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.540
in the occipital
temporal sites, which

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.100
is the same part
of our brain that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.000
processes facial recognition.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.950
So basically emoji is a language
that everyone already knows.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.130
EMILY MEE: This is the next
phase of linguistic evolution,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.605
and we want to provide
this to all of our users.

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:21.480
ANDREW ALDRICH: Our
expert team is constantly

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.688
evolving the language so it
stays fresh and relevant.

00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:25.230
LOUIS-PHILLIPE RIEL
What we're really

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.120
looking towards
improving emoji support

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.600
for very complex emotions like
laughing so hard you're crying

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.070
and your cat.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.570
EMILY MEE: The
Chrome team is really

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.670
excited about being
able to translate

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.920
the entire internet into emoji.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.650
ANDREW ALDRICH: URLs emojified.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.430
E-commerce emojified.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.680
Medical journals emojified.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.750
Legal documents emojified.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.810
Subtitles emojified.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.410
Some of our engineers have
even started to code in emoji.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.830
People spend 80% of their
processing power recognizing

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.865
and reassembling these little
symbols we call letters.

00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:01.240
Here at Google,
will we're giving

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.340
the 80% back to the user.
