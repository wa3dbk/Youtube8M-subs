00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.910
Today we are going to be installing Magnaflow
Performance Exhaust system part number 16641on

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.470
a 2005 Infiniti G35 Coupe.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.020
Before we get started we want to go ahead
and disconnect the negative terminal off the

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.020
battery.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.270
The battery is located behind this panel here
on the upper left-hand side of the engine

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.270
compartment.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.730
This going to allow the computer to reset
so when we get the new exhaust system on it

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.930
will reconfigure itself to the new exhaust.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.420
And we will go underneath the vehicle and
start disconnecting the old exhaust.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.892
This is a Cat Back system so we will be moving
the exhaust tips all the way up to the disconnect

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:36.649
point behind the catalytic converter.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.800
So we need to unbolt the flange here from
these two bolts and we are also going to need

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.269
to remove the exhaust off all its hangers
as well.

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.879
The rubber hangers we are going to be using
are located right here, right here, right

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.719
here, and right here.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.559
Using a spray lubricant on the rubber hangers
will make the removal of those a lot easier.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:17.610
You are going 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:02:05.870
to want 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:03:41.379
to 
save 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:04:15.389
the rubber hangers because we 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:43.090
will be reusing those 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:05:04.350
for the 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.440
re-installation.
