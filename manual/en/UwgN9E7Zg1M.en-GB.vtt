00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.010
In the greenery of Cape Cod, an auspicious
black tie affair, appropriate for those who've

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.800
never been able to tie one of the things.
At last, a bold new collection that celebrates

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.750
artistic flops, failures and foul-ups, brought
to you by the Museum of Bad Art, known to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.790
its affectionate followers as MOBA.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.790
This is MOBA's Mona Lisa. It's the first painting
in the collection, and the one that we are

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.300
the most, obviously the most proud of.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.190
The museum's curator, antique collector and
art school drop out Scott Wilson, found 'Lucy

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.360
in the Field with Flowers' in a rubbish bin
one night four years ago.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.880
She seems to be hovering in these daisies,
not necessarily sitting.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.370
So this particular piece has set the standard
for bad art?

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.509
Yes, most definitely. Well, it definitely
just was, at that point, it put it in our

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.509
minds that there must be more stuff out there
like this.

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.320
It appears to me one of those haunted house
paintings, where the eyes follow you around

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.170
the room.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.170
This is 'Sunday on the Pot with George.' And
obviously, a stunning pointillist work.

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:30.539
It is definitely bad.
The other thing that's remarkable is, he's

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.660
got no feet.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.490
Ryan: The Museum of Bad Art, complete with
cheap wine and savouries, is now even listed

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.110
in the Boston phone directory.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.110
The friends of MOBA proudly present The Virtual
Museum of Bad Art.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.910
And like other museums of high repute. It's
also available on CD Rom - a tour through

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.289
the cyberspace of bad art for followers who
can't seem to get enough.
