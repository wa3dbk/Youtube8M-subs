00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi everybody

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this video I will demonstrate the refining
of gold from old karat jewelry.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:37.270
Here's our scrap gold, 36.12 grams of 18 karat
and 33.05 grams of 14 karat.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.340
The first step in this process is to calculate
the amount of silver that should be added

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.320
in order to make the alloy into a 6 karat,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.930
meaning, one quarter of the alloy is gold
and the rest is silver or copper or other

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.810
elements that are soluble in nitric acid.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.860
For inquarting, I always use scrap sterling
silver. This basically gives the opportunity

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.570
to hit two birds with one stone as I also

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.970
get to refine the silver from the scrap sterling.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.970
For the amount of 18 karat scrap i have here,
I'll need to add 72.24 grams of sterling silver

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.539
and for the amount of 14 karat scrap I'll
add 44.03 grams.

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.920
All in all, the result is 185.44 grams of
6 karat gold alloy.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.770
You can calculate it yourself... Or you can
simply use the calculator on my website...

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.039
it's pretty self-explanatory... here's the
link. I'll leave it here in the corner for

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.340
a while..

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.340
Alright... The next step is to melt everything
together.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.929
Keep in mind that the alloy needs to be homogenous...
so that means to stir the liquid metals thoroughly.

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:51.929
Of course, if you are melting the scrap with
an induction furnace, stirring is not necessary.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.459
To granulate the metal, I will pour the molten
metal into a bucket filled with water from

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:05.310
a height of about a foot and a half. The water
depth is about 14 inches.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.300
OK... here we go...

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.239
Pouring the molten metal from this height
produces shot which has large surface area,

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.200
quite similar to corn flakes.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.790
The metal granules are placed in a reaction
vessel and placed on a hot plate. Here you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.739
can see the addition of the 50/50 nitric acid
solution.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.400
That means half of the solution is 70% nitric
and the other half is distilled water.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.829
The nitric leach usually takes about 2 to
3 hours at near boiling temperature.

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.680
The acid will dissolve all of the silver and
other base metals such as Copper, Nickel and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.000
Zinc into the solution.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.000
Here, I have decanted the solution which reveals
the gold sponge.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.569
As you can see, the structure of the corn
flakes is still intact. This is exactly what

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.200
we want because it is easier to wash this
way. Keep it intact as it is very brittle.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.599
By the way, some refiners would choose to
perform another Nitric leach at this point

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:55.599
using a slightly more concentrated acid, meaning
1 part distilled water and 2 parts 70% Nitric.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.300
I find it useful as well.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.680
The next step is to clean the gold sponge
from the silver and base metals solution.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.139
To do that, we will wash the sponge several
times with boiling hot distilled water.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.430
Repeating these washes three to five times
would be enough. The wash water is kept separate

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.200
so it could be re-used on the next batch.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.390
Time to dissolve the gold with a hot Aqua-Regia.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.530
Two things happen immediately as the Hydrochloric
acid is added: first - Some Silver Chloride

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.810
forms and re-dissolves, we will deal with
it later on in the process.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.110
Second - Some gold starts to dissolve and
give color to the solution.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.290
As the solution heats up, you can clearly
see the gold being dissolved before any Nitric

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.440
acid addition.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.160
I have time-lapsed the gold dissolution, though
even at this speed you can clearly see whenever

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.890
a small increment of nitric acid is added.
Every addition is allowed to react until it

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.180
is exhausted.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.820
The point is, to add just enough nitric acid
to dissolve the metals. That's it.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.820
Please, do NOT follow recipes that calls for
pre-mixing the Aqua-Regia.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.190
Just in case you are wondering, here's a little
behind the scenes snapshot of the setup. If

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.100
you have any question about it, just leave
it on the comment section below.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.730
When the dissolution of the gold is done,
the solution is diluted three times over with

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.890
water to precipitate the traces of Silver
chloride that was previously dissolved.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.670
Again, I forgot to film it, but a few milliliters
of Sulfuric acid were added carefully to the

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.120
dilute gold solution to precipitate traces
of Lead just in case there was any in the

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.880
solution.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.520
The gold solution is left to stand overnight
to cool down and precipitate Silver chloride

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.940
and Lead sulfate.
