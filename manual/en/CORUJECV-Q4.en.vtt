00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.650
very silly june nineteenth david axelrod
i was of course a senior katheryn

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.690
operative for president of online has
been a senior political adviser

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.709
throughout was on c_-span let's find out

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.309
if he learned any lessons about wearing
little

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.990
my belief is that when the president
wins in november

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.270
will liberate these republicans of
goodwill that they're gonna point into

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.320
the light of a pregnant and they're
gonna turn to the grover norquist of the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.369
world path frankly is jeb bush has
recently and said you know what we do if

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.190
you're aware and that was uh... a
failure failure for the country and also

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.830
a failure for the republican party and i
want to work together there may be

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.840
issues on which uh... we're gonna fight
disagree because that's what we have two

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.140
parties but where we can agree we're
gonna find a common ground i think that

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.140
uh... that was the message that his
reelection will send

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.490
uniqlo

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.660
meant now the press is starting this
they are a second term for those

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.950
republics are going to be very agreeable

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.900
but looked let's be fair nominee if
history is any guide remember uh... runs

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.700
were very tough on bill clinton this
first term but in a second term they

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.920
impeached

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.370
all but it was a really serious issue
about who had oral sex where

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.850
these clowns are both birth

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.210
but the republic can

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.150
easier on them nice and then

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.109
combines more than in the same time

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.220
and as i've told you before scientists
axle running just haven't saved

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.320
you know within the last week but
president baba send over and over he

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.969
said

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.999
they recently as well i believe that if
we're successful in this election well

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.409
win were successful in the selection of
the femur may break because there's a

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.340
tradition the republican party of more
common sense than that that is simply

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.600
not true

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.460
you're talking about nineteen sixty-five
it might be close to try and you're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.339
talking about

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:54.029
ninety seventy five the probably is true
nineteen eighty-five again when we have

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:55.920
a conversation if you're talking about
today

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.280
think what tradition of common sense

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.870
which planet

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.430
what you have a compromise with you or
when they did when they were not use it

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.740
against you

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.170
come on man and then of course he also
said

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.869
my hope my expectation is that after the
election

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.800
now that in terms of the gold b_d_o_
bala doesn't make much sense

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.839
because i'm not running again

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:20.119
that we can start getting some
cooperation again

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.439
now look final say on this is that it's
not

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.099
that these guys who just the sickest
people you've ever seen like that and

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.350
idea cannot penetrate their head

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.260
even if the x_-rated in unity within
those two same issues we have to put

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.730
your hands up like this idea so couldn't
penetrate the thick heads out father

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.689
there that darn

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.980
it's that they want to be deals

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.560
where they pretended

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.820
there on your side in the republics are
against him and there is some sort of

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.009
compromise

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.610
i've told you a million times in a way
undock session

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.429
even if president obama wins they're
gonna do a quote unquote grand bargain

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.049
where they're getting in the house away
to the republicans and they're gonna say

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.749
i want to see

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:58.679
we now

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.349
either way why do you want to work with
a little bit

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.570
yes after you made everything they want
which is cutting so strict

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.009
cutting medicare

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.700
and cutting taxes for the rent and for
corporations

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.279
present all of us are you now sir

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.120
do you know that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.799
that doesn't get any press either he's
already announced that he thinks a

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.719
corporate rate should be reduced

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.460
from thirty by the seven twenty eight
percent

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.970
he says he's going to take away

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.219
some locals which walks has a name

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:24.839
and i cannot take away that many
loopholes and again take away a couple

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.930
of symbolic was bike for the corporate
jets and sarah

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.179
and then essence cuban shiny a tax cut
the corporations

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.179
make them well class pay for it

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.509
there on the same team nobody's this
stupid

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.800
becca look at what happened last reenact
the resisted all nano

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.459
either the republicans are going to
totally be on our side

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.309
on the side of the american people very
soon

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:48.509
come on

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.690
sociology in their plan on earth

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.280
so they can do this to be grand bargain
which is gonna be the greatest robbery

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.799
in american history

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.669
if you want absolutely sure

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.860
whether republicans

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.889
are going to be topper easy on president
obama second term

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.549
look at the word they have already
started mentioning while they're

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.250
quote-unquote not mentioning it

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.269
let's go to senator john kyle republican
of arizona

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.869
looks to me like there's a backup from
the federal government

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.879
so once you find that wall

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.250
all cases court did

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.360
uh... go ahead and proceeded to the
proceeded in a brick wall and make the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.039
fed's co-op people make reactor approx

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.820
attitude that about

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.810
action aniket simple responsibility but
i don't think at this point

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.239
uh... anybody's talking about that

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.039

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.819
that i'm not saying impeachment you know
i say rules allow asst

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.400
in the senate

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.919
so even if we lose don't where you live
so threatened with a decent for no

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.319
reason whatsoever

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.349

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:57.990

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.270

know what the republicans

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.179
yeah sure are so you be able to have in
