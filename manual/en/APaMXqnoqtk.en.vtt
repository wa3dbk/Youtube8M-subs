00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
Deadlift - correct starting position

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:11.933
This video is about the correct starting position during deadlifts.

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:18.133
It's not, however, about everything and more about the deadlift

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:22.633
because this would obviously be too much and just plain boring after some time.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:28.767
So there will be several deadlifts video in the future 
 too - what you should know about them.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:35.767
At first I want to make clear that 
 the deadlift is a so-called compound exercise

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:41.667
which means that two or more muscle groups get worked and 
 that two or more joints are moving during the execution.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:48.467
During deadlifts some of the stimulated muscles are: the legs

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:52.467
lower back, the whole upper back, forearms and many more.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.367
Not only can you usually lift the heaviest weights during deadlifts

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:03.567
you also get to benefit from them in your everyday life

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:06.667
from practicing lifting heavy weights.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.333
Your lower back gets stronger

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:14.200
and so lifting things like

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.600
your laundry, a crate or a heavy package becomes much easier.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.133
I would classify the deadlift as easy to learn, but hard to master.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:32.300
By this I mean, that pretty soon one can lift 
 a barbell in some way or the other

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.479
he might even have the correct form, but it takes a lot longer

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.630
to perfect ones technique in order to

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:44.900
maximize your efficiency and minimize the risk of injury during deadlifts

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.670
which is the difficult part when doing this exercise.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.930
Another important point I want to point out is that during all repetitions

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:58.270
the bar should touch and fully rest on the ground during 
 all reps - you're not holding it anymore at all.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.200
During variations of the deadlift - the romanian deadlift for 
 example - during which this is not the case

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.330
are a lot different from the original exercise.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:12.800
Also from the effectivity and efficiency the deadlift is without a doubt

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.470
the best exercise there is.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:21.770
No other exercise can compare to the deadlift, except the full squat.

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:28.300
These two exercises are, so to say, competing for the pole position

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.830
when you're trying to find the best and 
 most powerful exercise in powerlifting and bodybuilding.

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.430
The deadlift is: one of the heaviest exercises of all time; an exercise 
 that stimulates numerous muscles; easy to learn, but hard to master

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:45.770
like squats - irreplaceable for serious trainees; also useful in 
 everyday life; healthy and strengthens the lower back enormously

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:48.070
Deadlift: Starting Position

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:54.570
Now it's time for the correct starting position during deadlifts, which 
 should look exactly the same for every trainee, right?

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:57.270
Obviously, this is not the case.

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:03.670
The three criterias in this video are actually pretty vague ones.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:10.370
because the correct starting position does not look the same from 
 trainee to trainee - it is just not like that.

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:14.700
Characteristics of a certain trainee, like torso length,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.200
the length of one's arms or legs - such features influence

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.170
the starting position, depth and so on.

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:27.030
There are only very few people who actually have the same starting position

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:30.070
so it usually differs from trainee to trainee.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.370
Basically, as previously mentioned, there are three important criterias for a correct starting position

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:40.430
Firstly the lower back and the position of the lower back

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:45.270
secondly the position of the barbell and the feet of the trainee

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:51.470
and thirdly the position of your shoulders or the scapulaes

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:57.400
The (lower) back has to be contracted before 
 and during every repetition at all times.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.400
This is very important to reduce the stress on your spine

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.000
and to stabilize the whole body and the weight of course.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:11.200
Because the lower back gets targeted during deadlifts

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.070
it gets strengthened enormously

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:19.270
which means that you won't have any discomfort anymore

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:23.400
when picking up the laundry or heavy packages.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.770
Lower back pain should be a thing of the past.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.100
Many trainees struggle to find the correct bar position.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.670
Basically the barbell should touch your shins

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:41.430
in order to be as close to the body 
 as possibly to minimize loss of force.

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:48.100
This means that just before every rep the bar touches the shins

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.430
and also gets placed above the middle of the foot.

00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:54.830
By doing this the loss of force is the smallest.

00:04:54.833 --> 00:05:00.230
Some barbells are lower than others, because the weight plates are smaller

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:06.900
Such a scenario leads to a slightly different starting position

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.870
because, if the weight plates are smaller, the barbell is slightly smaller too

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:16.400
and might not touch the shins, but it should 
 still be above the middle of the foot.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.930
and as close to the body as possible.

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:23.500
If the barbell is too close to the 
 floor the range of motion gets lengthened

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.100
because you're obviously starting lower and

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.800
whether this might be good or bad or whatever 
 will be explained in a future video.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.530
For now you should know that the bar is as close 
 to the shins as possible - ideally touching them

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:40.300
and placed above the middle of the foot.

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:44.900
Many experts claim that during deadlifts the weight is hanging from the shoulders

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.570
and thus the shoulders should get positioned right above the bar.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:53.370
This is not correct. If you approach this topic more precisely

00:05:53.367 --> 00:05:56.430
one should notice that the weight isn't hanging 
 from the shoulders, but from the scapulaes

00:05:56.433 --> 00:06:02.430
and so the shoulder blades should be right above the bar

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:09.170
which leads to the shoulders actually being positioned slightly in front of the bar.

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:12.000
I want to mention something for a second.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.370
The depth during deadlifts has little to nothing 
 to do with the correct starting position

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:18.570
because - as previously mentioned -

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:23.630
the depth is depending on the length of one's arms, legs and torso

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:27.000
and looks different for everyone.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.470
It might be the case that one person, because of certain characteristics,

00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:36.430
almost reaches the depth of a squat, while somebody

00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:42.300
else's thighs are 45 degrees to the floor.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.830
This is simply different for every trainee.

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:48.700
Starting position - comparison

00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:51.200
For me the starting position looks like this

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:58.900
For somebody with shorter arms and legs it might look like this.

00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:09.300
I've made quite some effort to make this video 
 so I would appreciate any feedback and comments.

In the future there will be more videos about deadlifting

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.230
namely, what to be careful about, what equipment one might find useful

00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:35.070
if gloves are good or bad, how you can improve 
 your grip, which grip to take and when.

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:39.970
Halting deadlifts and rack pulls are also an important matter.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.430
So these videos await you in the future.

00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:46.600
Now the only thing left I can say is thank 
 you for watching and hopefully until next time!

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:58.830
It's your responsibility to evaluate the contents of this video 
 and consult a doctor before starting a workout regime.
