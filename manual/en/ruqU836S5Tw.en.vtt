Dan Glickberg, Fourth Generation Owner, Fairway Market:  My great-grandfather started 

00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:07.641
Fairway about 75 years ago on 74th and Broadway.  
 It actually was a small produce stand, 

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:13.347
it was not this big..and he passed the business 
 down to my grandfather who turned it into

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:21.021
more of a super, he had some groceries.  When 
 my father took over, that is really when

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:26.927
the business exploded.  When all is said and told, it will 
 be over 300 jobs.  So it is just 

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:32.299
great to be able to help some people out 
 who are in need in times like this.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.070
Good morning everyone.  I am Dan Glickberg.  
 I am a fourth generation owner of 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.241
Fairway Marketâ€™s founding family and I would like to welcome everyone to Fairway

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:47.147
Paramus.  Paramus has such a great reputation, it is 
 really the shopping Mecca, I think of 

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:51.785
the Northeast, if not the United States.  You 
 know we are book ended in the shopping

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:58.692
center by three national companies and each one of those 
 stores is a top 5 store in a 

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:03.019
national company.  For us to hear that, it 
 was really a no brainier for us. 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.164
Howie Glickberg, Third Generation Owner, Fairway Market:  We were told that New

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:10.356
Jersey, and Paramus specifically, were a regulatory nightmare.  
 I am very happy to say, 

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:17.415
thank you Governor, thank you Mayor, you made this process 
 so easy for us.  It was a 

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:18.979
pleasure working with everybody in New Jersey. 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.151
Dan Glickberg:  You know for us it was relatively easy. 
  I think when you do the right 

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:30.001
thing and you are good people, New Jersey will 
 absolutely work with you. I do not see

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.561
why anybody should come in here intimidated, you 
 know, wondering whether or not it is

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:39.753
going to be difficult, the process.  But you 
 know, for us, we were given unanimous

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:45.040
approval.  Everybody really, really wanted to work 
 with us because they understand not 

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:50.810
only are we providing 300 jobs in this type of 
 economy, but this is also a service industry, 

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:53.410
it is a service business, we are here for our customers.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:57.220
Governor Jon S. Corzine:  Howie and Dan, thank 
 you all for having the confidence in, 

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:07.660
certainly Paramus, certainly New Jersey and making an investment in inviting 350 people

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:14.000
or more to get jobs in a very, very tough time. 
  We welcome you, we are thrilled you are 

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.040
here and congratulations.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:21.540
Dan Glickberg:  You know after well over a year 
 of getting everything going in the store, 

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:28.920
there is a lot of pride, a lot of emotion today. It 
 is a very emotional day for us.  We are so

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:33.550
happy, we are so excited.  It has really been a 
 long time coming for us in New Jersey.
