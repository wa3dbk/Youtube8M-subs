00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.370
A few have asked, now
that I have this metal

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.730
Pantorouter built by Kobe

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.500
do I still need my wooden one.
Well I'm keeping it because

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.667
I like having more machines
and I built this one.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.598
But I thought I'd do a
quick comparison, just to

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:16.333
show you the differences
between the two machines

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.070
What struck me when I put
the machine side by side is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.471
how similar these two
machine are. Even though

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.309
they're built actually
complely differently.

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:28.950
So the homemade one is
46 centimeters wide.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.080
And on the aluminum
it's 45 and a half.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.634
Depth-wise this one is at

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.064
34 centimeters and the
aluminum one is at

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.500
30. The Pantograph
on the aluminum one

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.660
has the main link at
24 centimeters long

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.060
and on the homemade
one it's exactly

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.450
24 centimeters long as well.
So the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.820
Pantograph essentially is about
the same size which means it has

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.987
the same reach. And it's
primarily limited by

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.440
bumping into the template frame.
So the size of the template

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.680
frame on the homemade
machine is 33 centimeters

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.216
and on the metal one it
is also 33 centimeters,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.970
In terms of height for
the template frame

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.637
On this one it about 6 inches.
Unfortunately

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.540
I don't have a metric square.
And on the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.100
aluminum one it is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.862
also about 6 inches. So there's
about

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.501
the same range of motion for
the router on both of these

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.523
which means they can both
cut the same size stock.

00:01:33.297 --> 00:01:35.900
The clamp on my homemade
Pantorouter is this clamp

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.020
which I can adjust in many
ways and add more blocks

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.561
to change the height.
And it works

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.360
fairly conveniently
together with this

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.610
stop. On the aluminum
Pantorouter, there

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.279
is a rail here and two
Bessy toggle clamps.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.893
and these toggle
clamps are really

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:53.451
nice because they're
self-adjusting.

00:01:53.854 --> 00:01:57.209
But I do need to tell
you, these clamps are not

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:59.830
included by default. You
have to pay extra for those

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.317
for the metal Pantorouter. For
clamping really tall stock

00:02:03.363 --> 00:02:05.669
I added this riser
block to bring this

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:07.802
clamp way up so I can
even clamp a 2 by 4

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.382
on it's side. But
on this Pantorouter

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.250
the toggle clamps just
don't have the right

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.965
kind of reach. So
for the large stock

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.210
I don't use the toggle clamps
and I just use the stock

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.352
right there and I
clamp it to the edge

00:02:23.373 --> 00:02:25.430
of the table, just
with a bar clamp.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.911
And that works fairly well.
I was afraid that I

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.267
might actually route into one
of my clamps with the router

00:02:33.684 --> 00:02:36.219
But if I'm mortising into
one of these things,

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:39.876
I've always got the follower
inside the mortising template

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.556
So I actually
am very restricted

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:44.236
with how far the
router can move.

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.647
So there's no risk of
accidentally routing

00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:49.014
into one of the clamps.
I thought

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.318
clamping over the edge actually
was a really cool idea

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:53.490
given that you're not likely
to route into the clamp

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.910
So, I just cut a slot into
the part of the table here on

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.825
mine, so I can now use
clamps on here as well.

00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:03.351
I really like the
way the follower

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:05.078
bearings are mounted
on the shaft here.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.734
Where if I'm cutting a tenon, I
just follow around the template

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.371
and then to cut the
mortise I pull

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:13.135
this out and put
it in the other

00:03:13.136 --> 00:03:14.450
way around and
put that inside

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.750
the template to
follow it for mortise

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.760
and if I want to cut different
sized tenons, I can

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.919
change the router bit or I
can swap out my follower

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.047
for one that has a much
smaller thing on the end

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.470
And that will cause the router
to follow the template closer

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.332
which will cut a smaller tenon.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.440
On my homemade
machine, I have some

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:36.890
of these blocks
with different

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.516
size bearings mounted on them.
And

00:03:38.537 --> 00:03:39.910
I have to swap
these out when

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.640
I want to cut different size
tenons. And I don't have

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.780
a slot inside the tenon template
because I don't actually

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.220
have anything that goes in here.
It's been suggested to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.490
make something like this for
the homemade one. And I could

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.630
conceivably drill a hole through
here to put one of these in

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.070
but without having
metal working ability

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.340
I wouldn't know how to mount a
bearing on the shaft like this.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.949
So, I decided to stick
with these ones here,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.350
because they're because
they're just much

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.530
easier to make. So,
the more differences

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.644
the metal Pantorouter
actually has a considerably

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.940
greater depth of plunge,
especially after I tweak the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.460
design a little bit. And that's
really useful if you're cutting

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.222
a long tenon because
you want to be able

00:04:21.243 --> 00:04:22.770
to cut that off the
end of the table

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.996
and you want to be able to back
the router away from it. On the

00:04:25.017 --> 00:04:26.883
homemade machine I can only get
this far away from it so I

00:04:28.784 --> 00:04:30.814
really should have used
longer drawer slides

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:32.436
for the plunge mechanism.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.257
I like how the plunge stop
on the metal

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.010
Pantorouter is a
little bit easier to reach

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.310
because with the
stops right here I can just

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.340
put the calipers in here and
measure what my actual plunge

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.231
depth is. And that
is useful for tenons

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.321
Because when I'm cutting tenons,
I'll typically use the front

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.411
of the router bit
as my depth stop

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.345
with the router
all the way back

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.660
and then that tells
me exactly how far forward

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.730
I can go. Because otherwise it's
very hard to have a front side

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.140
depth stop on this machine.
On my homemade

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.360
Pantorouter machine the depth
stops are underneath the table

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.390
which unfortunately makes them
a little bit harder to see

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.550
and that means I can't
really get in there

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.710
with a caliper as well and
read off what the number is.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.290
At least not while I'm
actually holding it on there.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.865
The template holder on
the metal Pantorouter

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.561
has got this scale on both
sides which is very useful

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.058
for making sure this template
is on there vertically

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.892
when you slide it up
and down because it's

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:32.550
easy to get it just
a tiny bit crooked.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.440
And if this scale is set to zero

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.979
then that slot will
correspond to the level

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.225
of the table. So if you
want to put the tenon

00:05:42.235 --> 00:05:43.930
in the middle of something
you just set this

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.325
to the thickness of
your stock right here

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.530
and because the Pantograph
scales it by a factor of 2

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.132
that means the router
will cut in the

00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:53.760
middle of the stock
on the table.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.001
On the homemade
machine, I don't

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.060
have any convenient
scale like that.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.158
So, I added these two
blocks here. And on these

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.405
I can clamp a set-up bar

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.284
And when that set-up
bar is properly

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:08.830
set-up that lever
represents

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.090
the level of the table.
So, if I want to

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.120
be say 10 millimeters above
the level of the table

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.962
I know I need to go
twice as far above the

00:06:17.007 --> 00:06:18.730
set-up bar because the
Pantograph, of course

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.380
will scale it down
by a factor of two.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.086
But the biggest difference
between the two machines

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.861
is one of time and money.
I probably

00:06:26.893 --> 00:06:28.772
spent about 60
dollars in material

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.010
on this one, using a lot
of used materials as well

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.444
Whereas if you buy one of
these, it'll cost you over

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.368
10 times as much. But, then
again, it will take you

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.743
less than a tenth
of the time to

00:06:39.764 --> 00:06:42.604
assemble this one
than it will this one

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.128
and this one,
especially with the

00:06:45.227 --> 00:06:46.922
Pantograph already
assembled

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.462
you can be sure the
machine will be accurate.

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:49.591
Whereas
on this one you

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.734
have to be on the
ball and make sure

00:06:51.764 --> 00:06:53.607
you work precisely
when you build it.
