00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.420
Hi!

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.420
Welcome to Lachlan Likes A Thing.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.170
a show where I take a thing and see whether
or not I like it.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.750
Now the thing we're looking at in this video
is the Logitech UE 900 quadruple balanced

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.920
armature in-ear earphone.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.750
Now before we go into the review there's something
really important that needs to be said right

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.140
at the beginning of this video, and it's this:
there is a quality control issue with these

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.690
earphones.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.410
Over at the audio forum Head-Fi a number of
people in the UE900 have reported issues with

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.820
these earphones.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.979
The first and biggest issue is that on some
of these earphones the sound will cut in and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:39.579
out, and this seems to be due to some residue
being left on these detachable cables coming

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.160
out of the factory.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.039
Now if your earphone has this issue some users
have reported that you're able to solve this

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.769
problem by getting some kind of device, perhaps
an earwax removal tool, and brushing at the

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.679
connectors until the residue is removed.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.889
Now my pair of UE 900's has this problem and
I've tried different things.

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:05.950
I've tried brushing at the connectors, I've
tried connecting and disconnecting the connectors

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.799
and despite all of this the situation has
improved slightly but they still cut in and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.189
out occasionally.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.189
Now a lot of users have said that this issue
only pops up with earlier units of the UE

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.369
900 with serial numbers starting with 123.

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.740
Well my unit starts with 124 which means that
it is a later unit and this problem still

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.450
has not been solved.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.979
Now Logitech has been good apparently about
replacing units with this problem.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.609
That said I still think for a $300-$400 earphone
this is really unacceptable for it to be coming

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.040
out of the factory with this issue and if
this issue has been widespread these should

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.359
have been recalled.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.009
Now another issue with this earphone is that
a lot of users have reported the black faceplate

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.609
on the plastic will very quickly wear away
to reveal the underlying silver plastic colour.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.500
Now my pair thankfully hasn't had this issue
but honestly this is something that should

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.009
have been identified and it should have been
fixed before this earphone even went onto

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.110
the market.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.700
Now there's another issue with this earphone
and it's basically a design issue.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.640
There's a very tiny pinhole in the nozzle
of this earphone and if that pinhole becomes

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.209
blocked by earwax or any other material the
sound of the earphone will change.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.260
Now a lot of people have said that they prefer
the sound of the UE900 with the pinhole blocked.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.290
And, you know, they've done modifications
to deliberately block the pinhole.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.659
I haven't done that myself because I kind
of want to sell this earphone after making

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.551
this review but basically if you like the
sound of the earphone out of the box and you

00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:49.670
don't want to change it's only a matter of
time before that pinhole gets blocked by earwax

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.650
and because it's such a tiny pinhole it might
be very difficult to clean.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.780
Now again, apparently Logitech has been good
about replacing earphones with these issues

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.920
but it still takes time and it's still a hassle
and it never should have happened in the first

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.530
place for such an expensive earphone.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.530
Now if anything comes up, if there's any updates,
I'll update the description of this video

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.439
to give you some more information, otherwise
you can follow the link in the description

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.970
of the video to the UE 900 thread over at
Head Fi and you can read about some of the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.049
issues yourself.

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.159
Now I hate to start the review on such a negative
note but I do know that a lot of people only

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.650
watch the first 3-4 minutes of my videos so
this is something that's really important

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.530
for you to know before you buy these earphones.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.620
Now here's what I can say about the UE900's.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.122
It's very light weight, it's very comfortable,
the noise isolation on this earphone on this

00:03:37.122 --> 00:03:40.739
earphone is very good if you are travelling
in noisy environments.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.629
The design does stick out more than some other
designs like the Westone 4R so you do get

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.879
a bit more wind noise and you can't necessarily
sleep your side with this earphone but all

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.469
in all it's quite ergonomically designed.

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.329
In terms of the accessory selection it probably
has one of the best accessory selections I've

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.689
come across with an earphone.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.390
You get lots of different eartip sizes, you
get this really nice carrying case, that.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.239
you know, lets you put an extra set of eartips
and an airline adaptor, and it snaps tight

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.430
- you know, this is really nice stuff.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.060
You get two sets of cables, you get the blue
cable with an iPhone remote and you get a

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.080
black cable with no remote, and you know,
this cable is very high quality, it's a braided

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.380
cable, and it feels real nice.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.480
You know, all in all it feels like Logitech
really pulled out the stops to give you a

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.530
really premium feeling package so it's such
a shame that there's so many problems with

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.800
the UE 900.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.470
Now in terms of sound I've heard three quadruple
balanced armature earphones.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.950
The UE 900, the Westone 4R which I've borrowed
from a friend, and the Sony XBA-40 - and out

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.230
all of them the UE 900 does sound the cleanest
and the most coherent.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.060
So it does sound like Logitech has done a
good job of making sure all the four drivers

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.260
in the earphone are quite coherent and aligned
properly.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.360
Now that said it still doesn't sound as coherent
as something like the VSonic GR07 or the Sony

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.850
7550 where they just use one single dynamic
driver so they don't have any issues there.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.530
But one thing that the quadruple balanced
armature earphones have over dynamic drivers

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.140
is that the soundstaging is quite amazing.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.920
In terms of instrument separation and layering
of the sound and the way they paint a picture

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.300
of what's happening in the soundstage, these
are really amazing and the UE 900 is especially

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.910
good in this regard if you listen to a lot
of electronic of synthesised music.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.540
Now in terms of sound signature the UE 900
has quite a strong bassline and then a really

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.710
quite severe scoop in the lower mids that
means that male vocals and a lot of vocals

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.930
lack a little richness.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.300
And then the treble, with the high frequency
sounds, is very fast and very clean.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.960
Now what that means is that sometimes the
UE 900 sounds a little unnatural and to my

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.730
ears, at times, it sounds a little tacky almost,
because the kind of timbre or the way things

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.760
really should sound don't quite sound right
on the UE 900.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.350
So I think it sounds better with synthetic
instruments than it does with natural vocals,

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.210
and if you particularly love your vocals,
you particularly love to engage with a singer's

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.470
voice, perhaps the UE 900 is not the best
earphone for you.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.880
But it's still a pretty good all-rounder and
most music does sound pretty amazing coming

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.240
from the UE 900.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.380
Now overall the UE 900 is a good earphone
apart from those issues and it is a really

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.270
nice complete package.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:43.060
It is quite an expensive earphone though so
for $299 dollars which is what I paid in Australia

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.320
for it I do think you can get better bang
for your buck in terms of audio quality.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:55.410
So something like the HIFIMAN RE-400 or the
Vsonic GR07 or the Sony 7550 I think all offer

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.270
a similar degree of sound quality, on a same
kind of tier as the UE 900 without costing

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.590
nearly as much.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.960
The thing with the UE 900 though is that you
do get all these fancy things, you get detachable

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.450
cables, you get the really good noise isolation
on these earphones so if that's really important

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.710
to you you pay more and you get something
quite good.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.480
Now if you prefer a warmer sound I would direct
you to the Westone 4R, I do think that they're

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.410
a bit more of a better all-rounder than the
UE 900 but particularly in terms of very very

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.240
densely layered music, very densely layered
electronic music I do think the UE 900 really

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.240
shines.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.410
Now if you want more bass punch, if you want
something more visceral I do think you should

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.710
also have a look at the Sony XBA-40 and I
do have a review up of that.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.470
I'll have a review of the Westone 4R soon
so if you want you can subscribe to my channel

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.470
and you'll be updated when that comes up.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.840
