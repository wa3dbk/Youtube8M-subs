Squibbles: *making noises*

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.960
Stuffy: "What is that?"

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.080
Squibbles: *making noises*

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
Stuffy: "What is this thing? It won't leave me alone!"

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.480
Doc McStuffins: "What's wrong Stuffy? You look so upset"

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.620
Stuffy: "This thing won't leave me alone. Everywhere I go he follows me."

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.240
Lambie: "Oh he's cute Stuffy."

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.200
Doc McStuffins: "Yea, Lambie you're right. He's so cute. He's a cutie patootie."

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.560
Stuffy: "I want him to go back to his owner. He won't leave me alone and he won't give me any space."

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:49.319
Doc McStuffins: "Oh Stuffy, he's a toy pet, I don't think he can understand you."

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.160
Stuffy: "Well I don't know what to do."

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.660
Doc McStuffins: "Maybe we can go around the park and see if we can't find his owner."

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.200
Doc McStuffins: "Hi there, is this your toy pet? I've been looking all over the park and I can't find his owner."

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.960
Peppa Pig: "Hmm, oh no, that's not my toy pet. I don't know who his owner is, but he's been here for days."

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.700
Doc McStuffins: "Oh no. Hopefully I can find his owner. I'll keep looking. Thank you."

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.780
Doc McStuffins: "Oh excuse me, I see you're digging in the sand box, but is this your toy pet?"

00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:30.648
Rubble: "Rubble on the double. No, I've never seen that one before. I don't know who his owner is."

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.840
Doc McStuffins: "Oh no. I'll keep looking. Thank you."

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.720
Rubble: "No problem"

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.300
Doc McStuffins: "I've looked all over the park and I can't find his owner anywhere Stuffy."

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.660
Stuffy: "Ohh"

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.800
Doc McStuffins: "Let's take him back to the pet clinic."

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.620
Stuffy: "Do we have to?"

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.720
Doc McStuffins: "Well we can't just leave him out here all alone."

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.820
Stuffy: "Why is he hiding behind my leg like that, is he alright?"

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.460
Doc McStuffins: "I don't know Stuffy, but it's a good thing I'm a pet vet too. Let's give him a checkup."

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.380
Doc McStuffins: "Alright, you cutie patootie, let's go to the vet clinic, come on."

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.460
Doc McStuffins: "Come on"

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.320
Doc McStuffins: "You can do it, come on...come on"

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.380
Doc McStuffins: "You're not going to follow me."

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.040
Doc McStuffins: "Hmmm, I know who you'll follow."

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.000
Doc McStuffins: "He won't follow me to the vet clinic, but I have a good feeling he'll follow you Stuffy."

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.700
Stuffy: "Who me? Oh yea, I know he'll follow me. Come on boy."

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.720
Stuffy: "Come on boy, let's go"

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.120
Doc McStuffins: "Stuffy, he doesn't know that getting a checkup is good for him, so you'll have to hold him still."

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.960
Stuffy: "Ok, I'll hold him."

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.060
Doc McStuffins: "Wow, this cutie patootie has a great heart beat, and his height and weight are perfect."

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.460
Doc McStuffins: "He is in great shape, now we can find his pet owner."

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.680
Doc McStuffins: "I went and got some paper and markers so we can make some posters to put in the park to find his owner."

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:04.327
Lambie: "That's a great idea Doc"

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.500
Doc McStuffins: "You guys did a great job on the posters. I'm going to the park so I can put them up."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.180
Doc McStuffins: "But I need someone to watch Squibbles while I'm gone."

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.660
Stuffy: "I can watch him."

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.640
Doc McStuffins: "Ok Stuffy, I'll be back in just a little bit."

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.560
Stuffy: "Squibbles, do you want to play catch?"

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.980
Squibbles: *making excited noises*

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.760
Stuffy: "Oh Squibbles, I didn't mean to throw the ball up so high it landed in the tree."

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.000
Stuffy: "It's a pet emergency Doc!"

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.060
Doc McStuffins: "Well what's wrong Stuffy, when I left Squibbles was fine."

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.680
Doc McStuffins: "Oh, I see what it is. He has a bent antenna. I can fix that up in no time."

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.160
Doc McStuffins: "There we go little buddy. It's all better."

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.520
Stuffy: "Oh Squibbles, I'm so glad you're ok. That makes me so happy."

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.820
Doc McStuffins: "Stuffy, I just got a call that a boy saw one of our posters at the park and he is coming to pick up his lost toy"

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.720
Stuffy: *upset* "Oh well that is just great."

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.840
Stuffy: "You be careful out there and don't break your antenna again"

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.740
Stuffy: *sad* "Bye Squibbles"

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.740
Doc McStuffins: "Stuffy, the boy came and this isn't his lost toy after all."

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.280
Stuffy: "WOO HOO!"

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.340
Stuffy: "Uh Doc I was just thinking. Maybe since Squibbles doesn't have a home maybe we could adopt him."

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.500
Doc McStuffins: "Oh that would be great Stuffy. You just have to remember that pets are a lot of work."

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.220
Stuffy: "Ok, I'm so excited!"

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.640
Doc McStuffins: "Welcome to the family Squibbles."
