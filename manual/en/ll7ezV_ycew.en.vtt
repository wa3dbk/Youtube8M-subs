00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.740
When I turned thirty,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.740
I toured around Italy in my camper van
cooking everywhere I went

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.130
I did some amazing things which changed
my life forever

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.130
and I'll never forget it. Thanks to FoodTube I can now share these things with you

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.660
guys

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.070
and I'm really excited. I was on this tiny little island just off the coast of Sicily

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.890
a local fisherman told me the morning
catch are coming so I went down

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.090
to check out what they'd got. Fresh squid. Brilliant.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.770
So I'm going to do a fantastic squid salad, okay. 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.489
I've got super, super fresh squid. Pan on
down here on my little camping stove.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.440
So I've just pulled the wings off, then I pull

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.059
the skin off. You can pull the body literally
out of the squid. It's not unpleasant but it's

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:53.329
not

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.780
the most beautiful thing in the world. Pull the little feather out of the squid

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.660
and that's like it's spine I guess, and then with the body, erm, you can keep the bottom bit, but

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.780
you don't really wanna eat the eyes. They aren't very nice. 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.200
Look at that. Half digested fish I think. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.900
See the eyes here, cut that off and these long bits just trim them off.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.820
We've got the tentacles here. 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.320
And then all I do is get my knife inside here and slice it and there's normally a little bit of gunge,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.320
and you scrape that away.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.500
So you get a nice lovely bit of white meat like that. 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.100
For a salad for four people, two medium
large sized squids like that. Fantastic!

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.280
These dogs are always hanging about. Go on, munger you don't like fish.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.500
I just want to put a knife, no weight on it at all, no pressure at all

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.540
at a slight angle, and just lightly brush it across

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.670
the squid flesh one-way when you get to
the end

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.290
turn the squid that way and do it the
other way. The thinner you can

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.729
get it the better to be honest. One, it
cooks quicker,

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.470
Two, it goes into a pretty shape. Three most importantly

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.590
if your gonna flavour with dressing,
flavored oils, or squeeze a lemon

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.320
it can get in it not just go on it I
wanna season there, before I get them

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.100
in the pan. Pan's red hot,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.259
you know, squids sort of just been scored

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.509
you get these little them red chillies

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.169
two little ones like this will give it a nice
little kick up the backside

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.740
Bit of salt. Always season from a height so it's sorta nice and even.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.310
Bit of pepper, and then

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.490
olive oil in the pan down here and get these legs in

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.580
first. Legs always take a little bit longer

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.740
to cook. Now I've got some beautiful

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.160
fennel, take the stalk off, cut it in half, 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.270
by the time that cooks, I'm going to get the salad together. 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.460
Finely slice the fennel. I'm going to put that into the bowl here

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.660
Keep a bit of that on the side.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.630
Look at these lovely little things that tomatoes come in. Now I've got a few different

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.710
varieties of tomatoes

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.520
Just gonna slice this. So this goes in

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.990
to the bowl. Put the two lovely white

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.250
bits of squid in here, lovely. Now squid legs, three or four minutes.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.590
Body, two minutes. Maybe two and a half minutes. This has been cooking for

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.450
three or four minutes now, turn it off. Now look at that. That's

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.810
absolutely beautiful right. We're going to put them together and slice it at a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.410
bit of an angle. About a centimetre thick, into here.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.470
Right. 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.840
I'm gonna get a bit more salt, 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.120
cos you got tomatoes in there and tomatoes need salt. Fennel needs salt.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.210
Nice bit of olive oil, right, and they're using

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.240
more olive oil here than i've seen used
normally. About 4-5 tablespoons

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.260
Right, swig of vinegar, white wine vinegar.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.370
So basically if you got four/five tablespoons of oil

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.620
One/One and a half tablespoons of vinegar and then I
want to use that beautiful lemon

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.150
right you could use any grater, but on the
fine setting you know that that the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.370
zest is so good

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.670
and it tastes so fantastic everyone always
takes the zest off

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.330
Get that in there and then I'm just going to serve it up

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.480
And one of these, squid on top. 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.300
Look at that. Look at the colours though. Absolutely beautiful. Juice. Don't forget the juice.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.690
Those little, erm, fennel tops, don't forget
those. These are like the best bit, yeah.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.490
Nice flavour.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.560
And there you go.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.240
They are nice and light, colourful.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.150
Mmm, just got to clean up all this mess now.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.590
