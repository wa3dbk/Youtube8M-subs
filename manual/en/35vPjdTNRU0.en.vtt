00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.389
I see trees of green

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.446
red roses too

00:00:15.412 --> 00:00:20.140
They reproduce in a way different than you

00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:30.041
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world!

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:40.359
Haploid spores grow into gametophytes 

00:00:41.796 --> 00:00:47.412
Gametophytes make gametes to fertilize 

00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:56.947
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world!

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.873
Sperm and egg make a zygote when they fertilize 

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:13.874
The zygote grows into a 2n sporophyte

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:20.823
I see sporophytes grow, I give them C02

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:27.510
They photosynthesize for me and you!

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.354
Through meiosis sporophytes make spores 

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:41.020
Then we continue the cycle once more

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:52.950
And I think to myself what a wonderful world!

00:01:54.207 --> 00:02:04.470
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world!

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:12.600
Ohhhhh Yeaaaaaa!
