00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:11.314
Hello, I am Todd Yohey, Superintendent of the Oak Hills Local School District.  We have

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:14.616
partnered with the Green Township and Delhi Township Police departments to make every

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:20.515
campus in our school district a safe place to learn and grow.  However, sometimes bad people

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:25.315
do bad things.  Although it is very unlikely to happen, should you be caught in the middle of an

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:30.114
active shooter event you must be prepared.  The police will arrive quickly however you must be

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:35.440
prepared to take action to protect yourself until the authorities arrive.

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:48.489
"Hey John, put us down in lockdown mode we need to go to lockdown mode I see an intruder coming in in front of the commons."

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.975
"Ok Mr. Bruns I got it."

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.624
"911 emergency Dispatcher Tolke… "

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:05.324
"Attention teachers we’re in lockdown, there is a white male in camoflauge shorts and a black hoody

00:01:05.324 --> 00:01:08.925
carrying a black handgun entering through the commons. "

00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:17.524
(911 Dispatcher) "OK that is Oak Hills High School at 3200 Ebenezer in Green Township right, Commons area

00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:21.818
school is lockdown, OK we are getting the police dispatched."

00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:26.902
Today we would like to discuss the program called A.L.I.C.E. The acronym A.L.I.C.E. stands for Alert,

00:01:26.902 --> 00:01:30.721
Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate.

00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:36.772
With the proper use these 5 steps you could save your life and the lives of others. Although the

00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:40.964
letters in the acronym A.L.I.C.E. may appear to be sequential steps,

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:45.539
the letters are just a way for you to remember key options in order to stay safe. Your decisions should

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.505
be based on the situation should you find yourself in danger you may choose to run, lockdown or

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:55.228
you may have no choice but to fight back.

00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:03.305
Alert refers to the way you learn about the threatening situation and how you communicate the

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:09.671
danger to others. You may hear a public announcement on the intercom or you may personally observe the aggressor,

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:15.205
hear gunshots, screams or other loud noises. Once alerted to the danger you

00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:21.572
must take action. Follow the directions of your teacher. He or she may direct you to evacuate if

00:02:21.572 --> 00:02:27.072
they know it is safe to do so.  If you are unable to get out quickly and safely you may need to

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:32.370
lockdown by locking and barricading the door therefor trying to prevent the aggressor from getting to you.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.326
"He has a gun, he has a gun!"

00:02:47.528 --> 00:02:52.496
Once you are secure in a safe area, you or someone in your group should  dial 911 and give the

00:02:52.496 --> 00:03:00.495
dispatchers as many details as possible. This will help others be notified about the danger and help police get to the aggressor faster.

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:07.161
( STUDENT PANICKED ) "911, we’re at Oak Hills High School in Room 405, there is a shooter in the building,

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:13.894
he’s in the hallway, I don’t know what he looks like, we need help!"

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:20.943
If you choose to lockdown, move quickly into a room or area that can be closed off by a door or other barrier.

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:28.017
Quickly lock and barricade the door. Remember that time is a factor for both you and the aggressor.

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:34.284
It is best if you are able to stack chairs, desks, tables or other items against the door or entryway to

00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:38.950
block the threatened person, he or she may likely move to another area instead of wasting time

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.662
climbing over or moving the objects in an attempt to get to you.

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:47.819
The aggressors goal is to do as much harm as possible before the police or

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.286
someone else intervenes.

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:55.486
Every door can be barricaded regardless of whether the door locks or the direction in which the

00:03:55.486 --> 00:04:00.677
door opens, you may need to be creative don't just give up. Once you have locked and

00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:05.454
barricaded the door, quickly move to an area out of sight and start coming up with a plan for how

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:12.886
you'll respond to the aggressor. Coordinate your actions and start gathering several items that you can use to protect yourself. Every room has

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:16.702
something you can use to distract and defend the aggressors attack. Communicate with

00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:23.030
those around you and tell them your plan, don't wait until the aggressor gets into your safe area

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.493
to have a plan of action.

00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:29.956
( SIRENS ) The police are trained to respond immediately remember you called

00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:33.419
them and they are on the way.  Police are not there to care for those injured or to stop and try to

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.017
get people out of the building their mission is to stop the aggressor from harming others as

00:04:38.017 --> 00:04:43.461
quickly as possible. Because of this quick response by the police we continue to emphasize that

00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:50.515
every second really does count.

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:55.516
Staying informed is also very important if you see or hear something that can help the police

00:04:55.516 --> 00:05:01.215
arrive sooner you or someone in your room should immediately dial 911 and tell the dispatcher the information.

00:05:01.963 --> 00:05:07.010
( STUDENT PANICKED ) "I don’t know what he looks like, we need help."

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.255
Telling the 911 dispatcher what you've heard or seen and where the aggressor

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:16.187
may be located is key to helping the police respond to the threat. Your information may direct the

00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:23.987
police quickly to the aggressor and could save lives.

00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:30.753
If the aggressor surprises you or makes it into your safe area you should consider taking some

00:05:30.753 --> 00:05:34.287
type of action. Although locking down and barricading is one option, don't just lie down under a

00:05:34.287 --> 00:05:40.441
desk or hide in the corner if it is obvious that the threatening person is able to cause you harm.

00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:45.624
If the aggressor is intent on coming into your safe area and you're able to you may choose to leave

00:05:45.624 --> 00:05:50.987
through another door or window. If there is no way to keep the aggressor out ­of­ the ­room or to

00:05:50.987 --> 00:05:56.320
evacuate to safer place you may decide is best to defend yourself.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.787
If it is necessary to counter the aggressor's attack you may be able to distract and disrupt the

00:06:01.787 --> 00:06:06.987
aggressors plan ( 2 Gun Shots ) by putting him on the defensive, possibly even disarming him by swarming him

00:06:06.987 --> 00:06:14.487
into subdue him until police arrive.

00:06:14.487 --> 00:06:19.119
Once on the floor, try to separate the weapon from the aggressor ( 2 Gun Shots ) but never pick it up or handle it

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:24.652
If possible hold the aggressor down on the ground until the police have arrived.

00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:29.253
Once again do not pick up the weapon as you may then be mistaken for the aggressor. if you're

00:06:29.253 --> 00:06:35.355
staying in the room carefully place a trash can or large item over the weapon and guard it until police arrive.

00:06:36.487 --> 00:06:41.419
If you know it is safe to do so, you may evacuate, you may be in a common area or a hallway and

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:48.253
unable to lockdown. Evacuation may be your best option. While leaving if you encounter the police,

00:06:48.253 --> 00:06:51.464
make sure your hands are up near your head with all fingers spread apart and yell

00:06:51.464 --> 00:06:54.675
"We’re coming out!"

00:06:54.675 --> 00:06:57.887
Always follow the commands of the police officers as they arrive.

00:06:57.887 --> 00:07:01.454
The Oak Hills Local School District and our local police departments are committed to provide

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:06.283
information and resources to keep our schools safe. We encourage you to always be prepared

00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:12.253
and never think that it can’t happen here. With the right actions you can save your life and the

00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:15.353
lives around you.
