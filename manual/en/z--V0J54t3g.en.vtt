00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.900
 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.920
I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.470
about four years ago we saw the Cadillac
Converj concept which suggested a sleek

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.730
coupe using the same plugin technology
as

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.539
the Chevy Volt well here it is where the
other should check it out

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.960
the all-new Cadillac ELR styling is
very similar to the Converj concept is

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.500
basically a sleeker take on

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.879
the existing CTS Coupe actually
two-and-a-half inches

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.420
shorter bumper to bumper then the coop
but bigger

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.970
then the four-door Chevrolet Volt about
nine inches longer bumper to bumper in a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.890
little bit wider

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.230
as well you look up front here pretty
much a very closed off

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.059
real there's another lot openings here
on the engine doesn't need that much

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.540
in terms of openings up there in the
lower portion the grill your got active

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.540
shutters and so they close up at higher
speeds

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.760
to improve aerodynamics there's a little
bit love

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.830
a bumper guard underneath here it might
help with aerodynamics as well

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
looks a little bit dorky on an otherwise
sporty car

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.660
the dimensions are pretty compelling
other apart from that

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.590
um you got things details along here
turn signal indicators long sides Kadlec

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.100
says

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.810
that these are actually charge
indicators as well so when you plug in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.740
to this outlet overnight on having a
plugin they let you know how much

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.040
battery charge you have left let's take
a look under the hood

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.900
now like the Volt the EL R has an
electric motor for

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.180
electric propulsion with a small
four-cylinder turbocharged

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.549
engine as the backup generator for the
system

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.590
so it works like this you plug it in I
about 35 miles in total electric range

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.640
than the engine kicks in

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.240
for a maximum electric and gasoline
range around

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.869
300 miles %uh plugged in overnight it
takes about 12 hours to recharge

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.829
on you see in your household 120 volt
outlet about four hours

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.550
on a level two work 240-volt outlet

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.750
now unlike the mall which is a true
four-door car

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.270
the you la raza two plus two Cooper got
to sit up front two seats in back

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.990
um lots love leather and word and carbon
fiber and aluminum going on inside

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.790
us some cool touch is here this
journal's actually trend in love thats

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.080
usually not a touch you see it so you
get to very very expensive

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.660
cars a kelex as urs leather on all the
areas that hellier

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.660
arms and elbows fall here along the
upper dash there's faux leather

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.670
everything's kinda stitched up their
sway as well definitely a lot of high

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.360
quality

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.650
materials there's even leather along the
cup holder cover

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.810
which Kadlec says is motorized see just
press this silver

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.080
no break here that powers back this car
the outer doesn't have power to do that

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.790
right now but

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.850
that's gotta be some feature that your
passengers were either

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.920
who are now over or laugh at think it's
ridiculous one other thing that kinda

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.470
ridiculous

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.410
the electronic door handles here a same
door handles as you get in the Chevy

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.070
Corvette

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.820
we've never been big fans to them and
they're right next to where you need

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.720
leis and so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.580
if you're just sitting here and you
accidentally touch them doors gonna

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.260
open up on you accidentally the gauges
are really in sync there's a

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.340
physical ring here with basically a
simulated numbers inside for the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.459
speedometer there's also

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.610
um screens on either side to tell you
things like how officially you driving

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.750
other screens can show things like
navigation map

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.760
um carries over a lot of information
from the center screen but puts it there

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.790
if you need it but there's also
cadillacs touch-sensitive

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.830
cue system had like user experience we
have could have

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.739
mixed feelings about that it works
better than some other touch sensitive

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.440
systems we never been wild about

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.510
touch sensitive buttons a in a car in
general

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.800
kelex have always been those big cars
you take your friends golfing and

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.380
that you are maybe not so much um so
about nine cubic feet have Carter room

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.430
back here that's actually about a
foot-and-a-half less

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.519
the CTS Coupe then even the Volt which
has a pretty small truck itself

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.420
a small opening to now that I hear throw
things in

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.970
better hope its many Gulf sharp styling
enhancements your ear

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.090
are yell our strengths but we don't know
the pricing yet

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.289
and it's probably going to be a lot more
than the Volt which without a federal

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.340
tax credit starts

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.330
at around forty thousand dollars so stay
tuned to cars dot com

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.800
will let you know pricing closer to the
e a large on sale date

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.210
late in 2013
