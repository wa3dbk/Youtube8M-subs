Actual cool guy Theodore Roosevelt once said
that “A man who has never gone to school

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.440
may steal from a freight car; but if he has
a university education, he may steal the whole

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.340
railroad”.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.820
hello, welcome to nerdyandquirky

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.920
Recently, I asked my viewers what they thought
of school, and the answers were very similar.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.710
School is stressful but it provides education,
a vital tool used to improve one’s life.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.800
Now I don’t know if my school is anything
like yours. With Scantron sheets that have

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.479
way too many Bs in a row. Comparative essays
to write in less than an hour. Irregular verbs

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:32.840
to conjugate. Countless bohr rutherford diagrams.
The list goes on. But for all the stress that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.160
the school year brings, the HB #2 pencil stands
strong in our pencil case and in our heart,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.910
call it a key to enlightenment..

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.120
But there are countless kids around the world
who don’t have one of these glorious pencil and

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.670
the doors to their education remain locked.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.370
That’s where Pencils for Kids comes into
play. They are a Canadian charity that have

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.060
partnered with Liboré, a community in Niger
- one of the least developed countries in

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.520
the world. Together they have started so many
cool programs including: scholarships for

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.869
girls - which encourages women to continue
education by paying for books, uniforms, food,

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.979
and tutoring. Then there’s farmers of the
future which aims to help multiple generations

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.469
escape the poverty trap by cultivating the land. And there’s

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.950
even a micro credit program that provides
small loans to help people start a business.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.189
If you want the full list of the programs
Pencils for Kids runs, you can check out their

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.869
website. They update their progress so that you can keep track.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.420
Pencils for Kids provide them with the tools needed to help

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.319
stimulate their economy. It’s personal,
self-sustaining, and allows the people of

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.539
Liboré to improve their lives through their
own hard work.

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.209

for Kids, I’ll leave their website link
