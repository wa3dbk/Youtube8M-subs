00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.560
Hi Food Tube. My name's Bryony and today I'm going to show you how to make a super simple, 3 ingredient

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.060
cookie.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.480
Nutella, eggs and flour.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.211
Mix it all together. Put it in the oven for about 8-10 minutes

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:17.230
and then put a bit of white chocolate icing over the top just to finish.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.976
My favourite thing to do is baking, and especially cookies.

00:00:19.976 --> 00:00:22.845
And these are one of my favourite things to make, cos they're so, so simple.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.120
Right, let me show you how to do it.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.779
First of all, I'm going to need 280 grams of Nutella. I'm just going to add 140 grams of plain sifted flour.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.220
And then all we're going to do is mix it all together.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.882
So you just want to make sure

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.360
that most of the flour is mix in together, cos you don't want white lumps of flour in your cookies at the end.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.014
So this dough is going to be a bit stiffer than normal dough. Don't be alarmed, it's fine. At this point

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.060
put in our one egg,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.540
and then just mix it so that it's all fully incorporated with each other.

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:07.248
So the eggs going to act as a binding agent for your flour and Nutella, and it will go

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.940
a lot harder to mix.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.140
So all your flour is fully incorporated. You can't see any white bits.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.780
Just gonna take it all out.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.520
Pop it onto a board.

00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:22.167
And just with your hands you want to try and form it into a big ball of dough.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:23.436
So it's quite glossy.

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:28.413
You can make your cookies any size you want to. I'm going to make mine golf-ball size.

00:01:28.413 --> 00:01:32.263
You get about 8 out of this. So if you do it that way it makes them more gooey in the middle.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:40.019
The karate technique is definitely not traditional, but  you can use a knife to be more exact.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.500
Get a ball, and we're just gonna pop that straight onto the baking tray.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.133
So now I'm just going to split up the rest of my dough so it's all evenly sized.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.700
My cookies are now ready for the oven.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.696
I'm going to pop them into a pre-heated oven at 180 degrees centigrade. Which is 350 Fahrenheit.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.520
For about 8 to 10 minutes.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.340
The cookies are all cooled now. We need to make sure that they're nice and cooled down, so when

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.197
we put our chocolate icing on it doesn't just splurge everywhere.

00:02:19.197 --> 00:02:21.722
We want to make nice and delicate lines across it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.880
So for this I've just got a disposable piping bag

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.924
and I've put white chocolate cubes in, and I've popped it in the microwave for ten second intervals

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:32.635
Just keep checking it, cos you don't want it to burn.

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:35.476
And then just play around with it. So it's not hot,

00:02:35.476 --> 00:02:39.247
it's quite cool. So it'll dry quite quickly across the cookies.

00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:45.615
So for me when I do it I always put a bit of greaseproof paper underneath the wire rack.

00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:49.176
Just means you can be as messy as you like and it doesn't really matter. It won't go anywhere.

00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:50.693
Cos you can just throw it away afterwards.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.440
Once the icing's on it'll take about 10 minutes or so to set.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.698
And then you can do what you like with them really. You can eat them straight away. Take them into the family

00:02:58.698 --> 00:03:00.047
Pack them up as a present.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.891
What I'm going to do is probably eat them right now.

00:03:05.824 --> 00:03:06.324
Good.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.220
Really good.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.660
Five minutes of this.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.840
So they are my really simple three ingredient Nutella cookies.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.049
