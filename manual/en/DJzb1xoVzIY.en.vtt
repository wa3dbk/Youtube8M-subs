00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.099
Hey dudes!

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:03.879
I am Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking we
are making chicken and waffles.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.180
This is something that is really pretty new
to me.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.810
I did not grow up eating chicken and waffles.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.910
I am not exactly sure who did, but anyway,
it's a waffle with fried chicken on top, and

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.150
it's great for lunch or brunch or breakfast
or dinner or any one of those times of day,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.550
and I am going to show you how to make it
right now at this time of day.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:33.989
For the chicken I am going to use some boneless
thighs, boneless, skinless thighs.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.929
I know traditionally chicken and waffles is
made with bone in chicken, but A, I already

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.090
showed you how to do that so if you want to
do it with bone in chicken, you can go watch

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.089
that video, but also B, it's just way easier
to eat if there's not bones, if you're putting

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.519
it on top of a waffle in my humble opinion,
but maybe that's just because I did not grow

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.679
up eating chicken and waffles, and maybe I
am just kind of idiot and I don't know how

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.679
to feed myself.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.350
Anyway, we're going to use some boneless thighs,
and I have had them marinating in some maple

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.920
syrup, Tobasco, salt and pepper, and a little
bit of thyme for a couple of hours now, just,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.360
and then we're just going to fry it like you
do regular old fried chicken or like I do

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:18.250
anyway, so I've got my egg and yogurt buttermilk
kind of mixture here, get in there, and then

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.760
I've got flour, cornstarch and some salt over
here in this bowl.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.810
So yeah, like, I didn't really start seeing
chicken and waffles in Austin anyway until

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.130
like, just the last couple of years.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.689
I am not sure where they originated.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.979
I always assumed it was like a Southern thing,
but then I was reading something that said

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.079
it actually may have come out of Harlem, so
I don't know, but it's tasty.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:50.409
Okay, now for real, so I am just gonna place
this on a plate over here, and keep dredging

00:01:50.409 --> 00:02:01.390
the rest of my thighs until they are all dredged.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.789
Okay, so that was a mess.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.860
Anyway, I am just gonna set these aside now
to let that batter adhere.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.280
I am just gonna leave them on the counter
for maybe 10 minutes while I get my waffle

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.800
batter mixed up together, and I already did
a video on that.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.280
If you want to watch that video, I'll link
that at the end too for that recipe.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.890
Okay, catch you in a sec.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.720
One you've got your homemade waffle batter
mixed up, you can just set it aside.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.570
I've got about a half-inch of peanut oil here,
whatever you like to deep fry with is fine.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.460
You've got to heat it up to about 350.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:52.170
I am just gonna lay my chicken thighs in here,
and these are gonna cook for about three minutes,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.520
three to four minutes on each side until they
are nice and dark, golden brown and really

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.560
crispy and the inside is cooked.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.830
Okay, I have adjusted the heat, turned it
down a little bit just to make sure that it

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:12.300
stays in that 350 range while they are cooking,
and it's been about three minutes, so I am

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.480
gonna flip these guys.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.530
Yay!

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.780
Okay, these are looking perfect, perfect,
perfect.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.280
I am just gonna keep it maintained at 350
for another three minutes or so.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:38.660
Another three minutes, the chicken is done,
and I am gonna drain off oil, and one of the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.270
cool things about fried chicken is that it
will put your eye out, that it actually stays

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.610
really hot for a nice, long time just sitting
here.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.780
So I am gonna let these sit and cool to an
edible temperature while we just make some

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.780
waffles really quick.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.800
You want to pre-heat your waffle iron and
I am gonna drop in my batter and close it,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.720
and then pretty much when it stops steaming
it will be ready to go.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.240
When your house is filled with the aroma of
butter from your homemade waffle mix or the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.690
little green light goes on like that, that
means that your waffle is done.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.700
So there, we're going to put that down, oh,
and this thing is hot, and put a little chicken

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.940
on there, and then maple syrup, I like maple
syrup.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.000
Some people will serve it with a white cream
gravy, but I like maple syrup and then also,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.100
I have this peanut slaw recipe, peanut cole
slaw that I put on my website that I make

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.550
a lot, and it actually is super, super badass
on chicken waffles for whatever reason, because

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.600
I am a genius I guess.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.690
So do a little like that.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.440
Now you can eat this with a knife and fork,
but it's also really fun, don't judge me,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440
this is delicious.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.940
If you do like that, and then you fold in
half, and you pick it up, and you just eat

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:03.730
it like a chicken and waffle sandwich, so
this is how you eat a chicken waffle sandwich.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.700
That is incredibly delicious.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.290
Oh, my God, the chicken is so juicy and crunchy,
and the sweetness and then the spicy slaw

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.570
that I put on there, a little Hilah twist
from me to you.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.620
Okay, there you go.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.810
There's how to make chicken and waffles, or
a chicken and waffle sandwich if you prefer.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.270
I hope you try this.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.810
If you have any chicken and waffle stories
about growing up and eating them or whatever,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.810
please share them.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.150
I would love to read all about your experiences
in the comments below, so thanks for watching

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.260
