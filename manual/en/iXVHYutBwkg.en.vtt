Hello Everyone!

Are you one?

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:12.467
As a Kid my mom used to take me to a toy store
and I always demanded for Hot Wheels

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:16.647
Even today when I visit a toy store
My first preferred brand is Hot Wheels

Over the years I have collected over 200 Hot
Wheels

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:36.407
And My obsession is still growing
I am going to take you
