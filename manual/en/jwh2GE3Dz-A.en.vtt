Okay JR, so we're first going to remove your
makeup. Okay. All right. And then I'm going

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.759
to see what's going on underneath there. Ah,
all right, let's do it. All right, I'm going

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.829
to use a gentle eye makeup remover first.
Okay. All right. What I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:19.570
just going to dampen a couple eye pads. Okay.
And I have a question. Yes. If someone has

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.510
tattooed eyebrows... Mm hmm. Is that a problem
in getting - I don't have tattooed eyebrows

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.970
but some people do, so, is that a problem?
No that's not. Okay. I'm going to cover your

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.590
eyes. Okay. All right. It's real soothing.
Doesn't that feel nice? Very nice. Kind of

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.220
has a cooling effect to it. It does, doesn't
it? Yes. It has cucumber in there and aloe

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.260
vera and some other really nice things. All
right. Then I'm just going to use a gentle

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.580
makeup remover and I'm going to mix a little
bit of my lavender cleanser with that. Okay.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.940
All right. And I'm just going to remove your
makeup here. Now I see that you're kind of

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.470
going in a clockwise way. Mm hmm. Is that
the way to remove makeup at home? I like to

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.070
do it that way because that way I know where
I've been, okay. And this we're just going

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.370
to wipe off here, even though you have such
nice eye makeup on. Ah. This is probably the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.930
hardest part of the facial, seeing the makeup
that you put on being taken off. Especially

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:35.190
when someone just puts it on, and then they
go and take it off. Okay. It feels very nice

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.320
though. It's nice and soothing isn't it? Yes.
Oh, great. Okay, I've noticed that you've

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.210
used the makeup remover and did a little bit
on the neck. Mm hmm. At home would someone

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.870
take it and go all the way down to the neckline
as well? I think so, yeah, you can go as low

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.380
as you apply the makeup. Okay. And then a
cleanser's just going to remove the rest of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.390
it. So I'm going to use a lavender cleanser
on you today, and it's best to use cream cleansers

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.139
on dry skin. Okay. 'Cause what it does is
it emulsifies the dirt, makeup, and the oils,

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.879
and it makes it much easier to come off. Remember
in the old days when women used to put cold

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.980
cream on their face? Yes. Well the reason
they did that is because the cold cream emulsified

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.779
the makeup and it made it come off much easier,
and this sort of has the same philosophy,

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:30.049
but this is cleansing your skin and it's not
clogging the pores, it's just making it nice

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.689
and clean. How does that feel? It feels wonderful.
Doesn't it feel great? Now, some women look

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:40.359
for products that don't have soap in it...
Correct. None of my cleansers have soap. They're

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.489
all facial cleansers, but they're non-soap.
Soap is an alkaline, which is going to dry

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.040
the skin out a little bit more. And you don't
want to do that, you want it to be nice and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.629
soft and hydrated. Doesn't that smell good
also? Wonderful. The essential oils of lavender

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.260
in there are antiseptic so...as well as cleansing,
they also help to kill bacteria and make the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.049
skin nice and clean.
