[jazz piano music in background]

00:00:01.303 --> 00:00:02.736
--(Waitress) Thank you so much for coming in;

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:03.951
Let me know if you guys need anything;

00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:05.501
and your waiter should be here shortly.

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:06.394
--Thank you so much, Gina.

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:07.177
--It's &lt;i&gt;Jai-nuh&lt;/i&gt;.

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:10.012
--Oh. Interesting name.

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:11.509
--So... What's up?

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.232
--The ceiling, lights,..

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:16.082
You could probably see for yourself if you looked.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.610
--No, I meant "What's new?" .

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.000
--Developments in technology, medicine,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.710
probably more iPhones, I dunno.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.457
--Still the same old guy, huh?

00:00:22.747 --> 00:00:23.537
--Yeah.

00:00:23.537 --> 00:00:25.557
--Look, let me just be frank with you.

00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:28.141
I'm really confused. I mean,

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.881
we haven't spoken in years,

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:31.318
you don't return my calls,

00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:34.219
and the last time I saw you was right before you left

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.209
and you were so mad...

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:38.399
[wind] [sentimental music]

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.946
--Do you have to go?

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:42.926
--[Sigh] You already know, though.

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:45.631
--Well, have a safe flight.

00:00:47.572 --> 00:00:48.712
--Have a safe flight?

00:00:49.222 --> 00:00:51.201
How dare you put that kind of pressure on me!

00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:52.726
--What? --I'm not the pilot,

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:54.244
I can't control the safety of my own plane.

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:56.024
--No, I... --Let alone the entire flight! [scoff]

00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:01.177
You know, sometimes you can be really insensitive.

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:02.576
[music ends] [door slams]

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:04.756
--Huh. I used to look a lot different then.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.284
Anyway, why did you leave? [sentimental music]

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:09.264
Why were you so mad?

00:01:09.264 --> 00:01:10.041
Why?

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:14.779
[music stops] --Who's Frank?

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:16.756
--What? --You said "Let me just be Frank with you."

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:18.547
Who's Frank? --Frank?

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:21.541
Frank is not a person, it's a figure of speech.

00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.742
--Oh. --God, you really are still the same!

00:01:23.742 --> 00:01:25.036
--Look, Lana, I'm trying here.

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:26.176
You know I have literal disorder.

00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:27.399
--I know. I'm sorry.

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.370
--That's part of the reason why I invited you here tonight.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.398
'Cause I wanted to talk about...

00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:31.529
--(Waitress) Can I get you guys something to drink?

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:33.149
--I'll have a water please. --Just ice for me.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.104
--Okay, and I'll be right back.

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:35.105
--Thanks, &lt;i&gt;Jai-nuh&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:38.735
My disorder... It can't be fixed. --What?

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:41.531
[epic music] 
--When I left that day I went all over the world to find a cure.

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:46.610
I went everywhere. From China... to Thailand... to Russia...

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.278
[music pauses] --I don't get that one.

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:50.508
--(Man) Yeah, can I get a check? I'm rushin' here. --(Lana) Oh.

00:01:50.508 --> 00:01:53.118
[music resumes] --to Turkey, Chile, Greece, Hungary,

00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:55.664
I even went all the way over to Iceland. [music ends]

00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:57.380
--(Waitress) And, your waiter should be here soon!

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.973
--What about here in the U.S.? I mean,

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:00.846
We have great medical technology...

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:02.504
--The first place I checked was the &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;!

00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:04.280
--So you brought me out here to this random restaurant,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.810
to tell me that not only is the problem that broke us up still here,

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.472
but it's getting worse?

00:02:09.472 --> 00:02:11.501
Frankly, I don't even understand why we're still...

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.555
--What Frank are you talking about? --There is no Frank!

00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:16.843
--How do you even know him? --I don't know any Franks!

00:02:16.843 --> 00:02:18.375
And even if I did, it's not like we're dating.

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:20.677
--That's not the point! --Stop it.

00:02:20.677 --> 00:02:22.585
--[Sigh] I'm &lt;i&gt;saw Wii&lt;/i&gt;. [melancholic music]

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.679
You know it gets worse when I'm flustered.

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.198
--What? --Fluh... &lt;i&gt;floss turd&lt;/i&gt;.

00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:29.643
I know it's a bit of a stretch, --I'm not dating anyone.

00:02:29.643 --> 00:02:33.023
--&lt;i&gt;Sew&lt;/i&gt;, you don't know a Frank then? --No. Okay?

00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:36.402
Look, this is where I draw the... [pen on paper]

00:02:36.402 --> 00:02:38.208
Please stop finishing my sentences.

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.378
Do you even know how hard it was for me to get over you?

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:42.933
--I mean, I'm only like 5'8", it can't be that hard. --Not what I meant.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:45.543
--Look, I know you never got over me, because I...

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.446
[music ends] I was never under you.

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:50.630
--I can't do this. I gotta go.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.911
--Lana, wait. --What?

00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:53.654
--Look, I'm just gonna break the ice,

00:02:53.654 --> 00:02:55.544
'cause there's something I need to get off my chest.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.156
--Why did you have a hammer there?

00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:00.153
--I know it's been a ti......me

00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:01.199
--Yeah. A long time.

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.379
--Right! But I still~

00:03:04.624 --> 00:03:06.696
--Stop being still and finish your sentence.

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:08.366
--But I still really care about you.

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.563
[inspirational music] --Are you pulling my leg right now?

00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:11.563
Yes.

00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:13.533
But I'm not lying.

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:16.355
I'm sitting. I'm standing up for who I am now.

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:18.575
--You're serious? You're being real now?

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:19.839
--&lt;i&gt;Four reel&lt;/i&gt;. --Really?

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.148
--&lt;i&gt;Four Rio.&lt;/i&gt; --'Cause if not...

00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:22.490
--&lt;i&gt;Four Wills&lt;/i&gt;!

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.583
--I never stopped caring about you.

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:26.910
I don't even care about your stupid disorder;

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.884
as long as we're together we can do anything.

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:30.178
--Whoa, what? [music stops]

00:03:30.178 --> 00:03:32.018
--What, what? --We can't be together.

00:03:32.018 --> 00:03:33.967
--You just said you still care about me.

00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:35.442
--Yeah, I care about you.

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:38.052
That's why I invited you all the way out here to tell you that...

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:40.111
Well, I have a boyfriend now.

00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:41.951
[shattering glass] --What?

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.790
--Well, after travelling the world trying to fix this thing

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.290
I met a guy who accepted me and my disorder

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.865
and whenever I'm around him my symptoms go away.

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:52.118
And the reason we came all the way out to this restaurant

00:03:52.118 --> 00:03:54.208
is because he works here and I wanted you two to meet.

00:03:54.642 --> 00:03:56.061
--Whaaat. [wind] [cello music]

00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:57.803
--Let me just be frank with you. --Who's Frank?

00:03:57.803 --> 00:03:58.842
--Frank is not a person.

00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:00.172
--You said "Let me just be Frank with you." Who's Frank?

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:01.430
--Frankly I don't even understand.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.568
--What Frank are you talking about?!

00:04:02.568 --> 00:04:03.917
--I don't know any Franks!

00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:06.375
[wind] Wooow... --(Frank) Ryan! Hi!

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:09.055
You must be Lana. I'll be your waiter.

00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:09.823
I'm Frank Lee.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:14.086
[^]

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:16.490
--So you two really are gay.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.464
You're not just saying that to try get rid of me.

00:04:18.464 --> 00:04:19.710
--Yep. --Mhm.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.110
--Alright then, prove it.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.792
Kiss. [shattering glass]

00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:26.012
--Fine. We kiss all the time.

00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:27.094
--Oh, you kiss all the time.

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:29.643
--Yeah. I mean, we dress up in costumes and...

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:30.753
--Makeup and everything.

00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:32.923
--Go ahead then. Kiss. --Okay!

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.310
We're just not used to doing this in front of people, that's all.

00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:38.514
You ready?

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:40.864
One, two, three, four...

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:47.253
â™ª I wanna rock and roll all night â™ª

00:04:48.193 --> 00:04:49.503
â™ª And party every... â™ª

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:50.463
--Gay!
