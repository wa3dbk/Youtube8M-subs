ERIKA WASSER: Hey guys,
it's Erika.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.390
And we have more of the
professional series from

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.150
Glynallen Castle.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.870
I'm here with Fun House
Furnishings and Design.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.510
They're actually two
sisters-in-law.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.680
So how did you guys come
together to create Fun House.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.980
JENNIFER CONNELL: For some
reason, I knew that Jane would

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.059
be the perfect partner.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.100
We come in as equals.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.855
She has four children,
I have three.

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:21.230
We're married to brothers.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.890
She has great taste, and I knew
she would be the best

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.295
complement to me in
a design studio.

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:29.190
ERIKA WASSER: Well clearly,
it's gone well, 'cause the

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.990
space is sickly beautiful.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.100
Tell me a little bit about the
single suite and where your

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.500
inspiration came from and why
you made some of the choices

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.590
that you did.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.340
JANE CONNELL: When we looked at
different rooms, we thought

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.960
this would be a great
space for twin beds.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.970
And apparently, no one had done
twin beds in one of the

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.960
mansions before, so the design
group, the committee, really

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.930
liked that idea.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.920
And the mantel is actually
original to the room.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.280
And it was so stunning that
we wanted to keep it.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.920
The fireplace needed to be
resurfaced, and that's how the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.400
tile came to be.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.185
But we really liked the mantel,
because you just don't

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:57.120
find things like that anymore.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.915
And then we talked about,
we have so many kids

00:00:58.915 --> 00:00:59.850
and they get older.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.110
And even as couples, your
friends want to come stay.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.330
But unless you have a 60 room
mansion like this, you don't

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.110
always have two beds.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.820
So it was a great way to have
multiple guests share a room

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.630
without having to share a bed.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.150
ERIKA WASSER: So you really
thought about this like moms.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.970
JANE CONNELL: With seven kids
among us, it's hard not to

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.100
think like moms often.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.115
So I think that happens.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:18.410
JENNIFER CONNELL: And just
having visitors come, we

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.180
wanted to create a gender
neutral guest room that would

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.210
really accommodate anyone
at any age.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.010
ERIKA WASSER: I think that's
something that is a great

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.830
goal, but is sometimes
hard to define.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.510
So what are choices that you
made that made this a gender

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.365
neutral space?

00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:34.890
JENNIFER CONNELL: Keeping with
the furniture, still having

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.710
that traditional
mahogany color.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.580
Using the reds and the browns,
versus a lot of the paler

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.020
colors that really make it
a little more feminine.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.330
And using the pointillist
style wallpaper.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.300
There's nothing in this
room that says--

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.200
JANE CONNELL: That's
so feminine.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.140
JENNIFER CONNELL: This is a
woman's room or this is a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.950
man's room.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.138
ERIKA WASSER: This is a
hermaphrodite room.

00:01:57.138 --> 00:01:58.730
JENNIFER CONNELL: Well,
anyone's welcome.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.650
So really--

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.910
JANE CONNELL: We don't
discriminate at Fun House.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.890
JENNIFER CONNELL: We
don't discriminate!

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.565
ERIKA WASSER: What is your
favorite part of the room?

00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:07.900
JENNIFER CONNELL: My favorite
part is the beds.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.050
I love the beds.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.380
I think they're really
special.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.800
I love the horizontal stripes.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.440
They're clean, they're up
to date, they're modern.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.680
I think they're timeless.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.390
As soon as we walked in the room
and saw this as a guest

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.070
room, those beds immediately
popped into our head.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.660
ERIKA WASSER: What is a tip for
someone who wants to make

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.720
the most of their space?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.600
JANE CONNELL: Plan.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.400
A good plan.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.740
Sometimes people get a little
caught up in the quick buy

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.570
without a plan, and
then you're sorry.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.370
Why did I get--

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.120
JENNIFER CONNELL: Take accurate
measurements.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.750
Don't be so quick to
just purchase.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.490
Make sure you have
enough room.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.040
You should really have a good
three feet between each piece

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.300
of furniture, so you can walk
around comfortably and you're

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.760
not bumping into things.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.540
ERIKA WASSER: Thank you so
much, Jane and Jennifer.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.930
It was so nice to
have you guys.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.480
JENNIFER CONNELL: Thank you.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.085
JANE CONNELL: Thank you.

00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:55.850
ERIKA WASSER: Keep watching
for more.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.470
We have some great interior
design interviews, some

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.680
amazing, beautiful spaces.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.474
A lot more to see
on Spaces TV.

00:03:04.474 --> 00:03:06.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey guys,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.290
