Welcome to Expert Village, this is Kim Brown.
In this segment, we are going to show how

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.120
to do a low ponytail. You just want to have
the hair nice and prepped like we do, with

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:18.100
product. Use your rattail brush and smooth
it using just the edge of the brush. I have

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.100
a diagonal part in her hair, just because
I like the way that looks on her face. So

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.840
you want to kind of figure that out. If you
are going to take all the hair back at one

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.949
time, you want to decide where you want the
part and what you want this to look like.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.530
I can have a little section coming to either
side and then the crown going straight back.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.900
There’re a lot of different ways to do ponytail,
but I just find just doing a single ponytail

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:50.469
with ponytail holder, just works best for
me. Just hold on tight to it trying to keep

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:57.739
your section smooth. With the back combing
comb, with the wire, you can just smooth this

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:08.020
down using those edges. So from the front
she just has nice smooth all the way around.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:16.590
Then she’s got the ponytail in the back.
As with the other up do that we did, leaving

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.429
some pieces out, you can also do that with
one single ponytail. You can leave out just

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.280
the top section, so you can have a little
something to do a design with if you want.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.079
Otherwise, if you are in a hurry you can just
do the single ponytail in the back. We are

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.150
going to hide the ponytail holder with some
hair coming from underneath. You just take

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:49.940
a section, comb it out nice and smooth, spray
it really good, smooth it out, and this is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:59.710
going to be ponytail wrap. It just takes a
simple ponytail and makes it really fancy.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:12.849
Do that a second time and the hair disappears.
There’re hair clips you can use, right in

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:23.670
the center. A lot of different options for
adding jewels to the hair. You can just stick

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:44.239
it right in the top hanging over the ponytail.
If you want to put into the side... For more
