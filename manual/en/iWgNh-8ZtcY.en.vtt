00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.040
What we do here at Texas Back Institute
is a combination of things. We consider ourselves

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.629
to be experts at the evaluation and treatment
of all spinal disorders, from top to bottom,

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.609
whether it's an acute episode of back pain
all the way to complex deformities, tumors

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.820
of the spine, infections, and other, more
serious conditions. So when a patient comes

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.339
to see us, they're going to be evaluated from
that perspective and from that breadth of

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.719
experience and knowledge. What we will do
in general is review with the patient their

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.680
history, what their symptoms are, and what
their complaints are, and what their goals

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.670
are, try to get to know them a little bit,
what their life is like, and how they would

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.760
like to proceed in terms of their workup of
treatment. And we will also examine them,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.570
review all of their previous records, and
try to formulate together some kind of plan

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.700
to meet their goals and expectations. And,
if possible, exceed their expectations whenever

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.930
we can. This sometimes involves elaborate
testing, sometimes it involves something as

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.010
simple as a conversation or some reassurance,
we try to maximize a conservative style of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.780
treatment, such as physical therapy, injection
treatment, exercise, and so forth before we

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.270
consider more invasive modalities like surgery.
I really try to approach each patient as though

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.640
I were in their shoes. I try to recommend
to people what I think would be appropriate

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.020
for me, based on my own knowledge of spine
problems. I don't try to simply tell people

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.930
what they want to hear, but rather try to
do my best to educate them about their problem

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.920
and get really to the core of what it is that
they're trying to get out of their interaction

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.210
with the Texas Back Institute, and provide
that for them. There are some situations where

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.470
we can do miraculous things for people without
necessarily expending a lot of health care

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.869
dollars or a lot of energy on the part of
the patient, simply by having a good conversation

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.109
and having them understand better what their
problem really is. Very often, patients that

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:20.010
come to see us have seen lots of other doctors,
and actually that is often helpful to us to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.969
understand exactly what happened before that
patient came here. So bringing along records,

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:34.629
MRI scans, any other tests that are relevant
to the complaint is really the most important

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:42.569
thing that you can do in preparation for an
evaluation here. I'm Dr. Ted Belanger, M.D.,

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.239
an orthopedic spine surgeon with the Texas Back
Institute.
