cars dot com auto reviews

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.969
hi I'm joe Weisenfelder for cars dot com
I'm here with the

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:15.750
2009 Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart now the
lancer came along a few years ago kinda

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.119
down here entry level and then they jump
right up to the evolution which is their

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.490
super performance when leaving this area
in the middle kinda empty this area here

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.789
where

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.919
this is now this is the ralliart

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.220
which is in the middle ralliart used to
mean just cosmetic differences now

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.220
performance upgrades to Mitsubishi says
that the ralliart is not a detour

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.239
devolution

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.120
more of a up tuned Lancer but the engine
the famous the evolution of the two

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.710
liter

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.730
four-cylinder except as a single
scroll instead of a double scroll

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.260
turbocharger it has smaller diameter

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.340
plumbing and a smaller intercooler

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.750
now the nose is

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.510
distinctive here on the ralliart it's
more like the evolution in that it has a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.460
large grill as an intake in the hood
here up but it is its own front and the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.450
body itself is space more on the Lancer
than the evolution

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.180
and the all-wheel-drive system which is
standard comes from a ninth generation

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.579
evolution instead of the 10th

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.729
it has front rear and center

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.020
limited slip differentials real one it's
not just this

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.820
anti-lock brake stuff it makes it a much
more durable system

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.200
and 18-inch wheels are standard on the
ralliart  to 16 now here again with

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.930
the rear end

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.280
a little more aggressive looking the
regular Lancer not as full-blown as the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.320
evolution though the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.570
dual exhaust pretty much come from the
evolution the wing here

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.840
kinda big to my eye but it's actually
the smaller of two wings

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.860
available and the trunk but the real
answer is

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.289
a little bit bigger it's about 12 cubic
feet this one is about 10 cubic feet and

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.390
the evolution is seven is basically
because I've

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.219
the bracing that they use for the
performance a while the car once again

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.909
right in the middle now here's a problem
I have with car

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.530
these recaro optional recaro sport seats

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.330
they are how do I describe this terrible they're  terrible

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.620
everyone that's been in this car from
cars.com doesn't like them it's hard

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.550
to get in and out

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.349
just because the bollsters are so high
not comfortable you can adjust the

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.760
height

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.290
but again fortunately because it's an
option

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.959
you can get a more adjustable more
comfortable seat again in terms of the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.629
driving experience they're not messin
around this really is different

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.629
between the regular Lancer Evolution it
has slightly stronger brakes on the

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.560
regular Lancer

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.900
it has a firmer suspension then

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.970
the Lancer but not too firm like
the evolution

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.840
a all good stuff  one bummer about the
ralliart you can't get 'em

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.230
regular stick transmission what you do
get though is

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.459
be twin clutch automated manual instead
of the regular

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.610
which is nice it has been really
quick upset and downshift

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.379
but you can do it with the house if
that's your thing but what impresses me

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.060
about this one months and drive most it
seems to read to mymind knows based on

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.659
when you're breaking when you're
showering with you what up ship to

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.269
downshift

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.250
does it for you just like so many other
aspects when it comes to price

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.299
the Ralliart right in the middle you
start with the Lancer

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.790
then you've got the ralliart and then
the evolution and for the money

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.590
you're getting a lot of real difference
is it's not just cosmetic anymore

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.159
you got breaks you got suspension you've
got a different engine with different

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.909
horsepower

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.319
different interior basically everything is
right in the middle

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.319
