DADDY CLAY: Welcome back to the lab, I’m
Daddy Clay.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.030
DADDY BRAD: And I’m Daddy Brad. You know,
Daddy Clay it’s starting to get warmer which

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:11.040
has me thinking about the pool, the beach,
and healthy young lifeguards in red speedos.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.820
DADDY CLAY: Yes and if you have kids under
five and you’re not a perv like Daddy Brad,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.680
you’re probably thinking about swim lessons
for the little ones.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.690
DADDY BRAD: Here is Austin the swimming season
is long and if you throw a rock at UT you’ll

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.109
probably hit a gold medalist in the breaststroke.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:36.640
DADDY CLAY: Or a swimmer. So we decided to
hit the road to find out what parents should

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.039
know about swim lessons.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:58.899
DON: My name’s Don Crowly and I’m in charge
of classes at the university with UT swim

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.400
and diving teams. I’m the aquatics director
for this team called summer sports school,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.520
the parent and infant program. Ages from 6
months to about three or four. After that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:20.270
they move up to independent lessons.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.630
Our program for ten weeks for 30 minute lessons
is about $99. They go all the way up to $500

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.540
depending on if you want group or private
lessons. Private lessons range from 25 to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.200
$75 per hour.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:45.470
On the first day of lessons show up early,
make sure they have suits, don’t eat before.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.310
Parents usually aren’t as nervous as the
kiddos. Be there so they can see you on the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.360
first day and the next day try to be out of
their eyesight so they’ll gain more trust

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360
with the teacher.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:11.110
The Humpty Dumpty board is the best game ever
invented. They crawl on the board, we sing

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.060
a song and then we knock them in the water
so they get used to going in the proper way.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.460
DADDY CLAY: That’s all for us from the lab,
see you back here tomorrow for the lounge.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.790
DADDY BRAD: Be safe around the pool, and we’ll
see you next time.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.780
DADDY CLAY: When did you learn to swim?
