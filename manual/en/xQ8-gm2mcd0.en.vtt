00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:17.890
This is the River Ganga, sacred to a billion people, 
running through one of the oldest cities in the world, Varanasi, 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.890
that bursts with all the vibrant colors and rhythms of India.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.890
The exquisite handcrafted rugs of this region are as much a part 
of this ancient rhythm as the river itself,
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.739
interweaving the history of a rich and complex civilization, 
with the lives of the local community. 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.739
Rug making has been the defining activity of the community for 
hundreds of years.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.739
Skills have been passed on over generations, and each of these master weavers

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.430
has a rich heritage of designs and techniques to draw from.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.430
The locals believe that washing the rugs in the 
sacred waters of the holy Ganga 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.430
makes the creation truly special.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.430
This type of rug making is done using a tool called 
a hand tufting gun,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.430
which holds the yarn to push through the primary backing.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.430
Once the tufting is done, the finishing of the 
rug is a painstaking process,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.430
it requires a high level of craftsmanship to accurately portray 
the intricate designs.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.430
The journey of each rug, from yarn to finished work, 
is guided along

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.430
by hands that have inherited the legacy 
of creating beauty.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.430
It reflects the timeless culture of a land 
which is more than just a place.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.430
It is a feeling, a living tradition, pulsating 
with ancient rhythms.
