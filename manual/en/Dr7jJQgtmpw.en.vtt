00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.110
Hey, what's up guys?

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.900
Sean Nalewanyj, of EliteImpactLabs.com, with
the muscle in minutes Q&amp;A, where I answer

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.190
your bodybuilding and fitness questions in
two minutes or less, today's question is a

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.190
pretty simple one.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.269
It's on the issue of creatine supplementation,
and more specifically on the loading phase.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.660
So, whether or not, it is necessary to load
your creatine and perform the -- the five-day

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.840
loading phase as opposed to just taking a
standard dosage each day.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.230
So, the recommended daily study dose for creatine
monohydrate is about 3grams to 5grams per

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.580
day for most people, which is equal to about
a teaspoon.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.110
And the goal of creatine supplementation is
to achieve full creatine saturation of the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.110
muscle tissue.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.980
So, you can go about this in a couple of way,
you can either just start off from day one.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.960
And take 3grams to 5grams creatine per day
continuously.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.420
If you do that you will achieve full creatine
saturation after about 20 days, or you can

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.190
get those results quicker by performing a
loading phase.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280
There's no single loading phase protocol.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.010
But a pretty standard method is where you're
going to take in 20grams of creatine for the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.460
first five days.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.040
So, four servings of 5grams.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.280
And then just follow the 3gram to 5gram per
day maintenance dose after that.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.950
If you do that, you're going to achieve full
creatine saturation after the five-day loading

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.950
period.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.430
So, that's really all there is to it.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.280
The end result is exactly the same.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.460
The only difference is that if you perform
a loading phase, you're going to see those

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.590
results after -- sorry, the full results of
creatine usage after five days.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.120
And if you just follow the 3gram to 5gram
per day dose from the get-go, you're going

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.610
to get the full benefits after about 20 days.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.159
So, it's really as simple as that.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.660
There's no super benefits to loading.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.440
It doesn't give you enhanced result as opposed
to the standard maintenance dose.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.650
It just let's you saturate your muscles at
a faster rate.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.810
Now, if you need to obtain those full creatine
benefits quickly, maybe you have an athletic

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.479
event or something that you're competing in
or you want to -- you need to boost your strength

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.920
quickly or get that increased water in the
muscle cells quickly.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.200
For some reason, then, go ahead and load.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.670
But if you can be a little bit more patient,
and wait like an extra two weeks, just go

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.750
with standard 3gram to 5gram per day dose,
because you're going to get the same results.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.260
And you're going to end up saving somewhere
between 60gram to 80grams of creatine powder.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.870
So, that's that question answered.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.150
