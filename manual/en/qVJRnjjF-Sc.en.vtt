00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.420
If you ever run into a hardware
issue, they can

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.410
sometimes be difficult to
troubleshoot, especially if

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.620
it's a problem with
bad memory.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.120
And occasionally you'll find a
part of a memory module that

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.170
isn't working quite as
you might expect.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.219
The system might boot up.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.900
It might work for
a little bit.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.230
And then when you really start
using it, you happen

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.390
to get an odd error.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.760
So it might be useful to run
a memory diagnostics.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.880
You might also be notified
automatically in Windows that

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.780
there appears to be
a memory problem.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.330
And Windows will prompt you
with an option to run the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.170
Windows memory diagnostic.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.840
You can also launch this
manually as well.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.170
And it's going to go through
and look at all of your

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.350
memory, test all of it, even
run multiple passes through

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.770
the memory to try to get
something to break.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.095
You really want to stress test
your memory and make sure that

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:49.120
it's working properly.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.210
It's such an important part
of your computer system.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.530
It really has to be running
at top notch.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.910
You will find this tool
available in both Windows

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.610
Vista and Windows 7.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.540
You can launch it from your
installation media or find it

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.260
right inside your Windows
environment by going to the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.740
Administrative Tools and finding
the Memory Diagnostic

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980
icon right there.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.920
This is a relatively easy
utility to use, because it's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.960
doing all of the work.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.190
And usually a memory
diagnostic takes a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.560
bit of time to run.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.350
To start one in my Windows 7,
I'm going to go up to my

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.870
Control Panel under
Administrative Tools.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.670
And you'll find the Memory
Diagnostic Tool is right here.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.510
Notice it has a shield next to
it, which means if I try to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.150
start it, it's going to
require that I have

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.850
administrator rights, an
elevated rights to

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.290
be able to run this.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.960
I can choose to restart now
and check for problems.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.190
Or I can simply check for
problems the next time I start

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.840
my computer.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.100
Well, let's demonstrate
this now.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.030
I'm going to restart my system
and have it run the memory

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.850
check right now.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.460
When your system starts up, it
immediately goes into the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.720
memory diagnostics.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.190
And you can also change some
of the settings that are in

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.250
here by pressing F-1.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.480
You can choose a basic,
standard, or

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.480
extended set of tests.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.700
And you can change the cache,
whether you're going to turn

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.310
the cache on for all tests or
the cache off for all tests,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.190
and then set the number of
passes that you might want.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.720
Maybe you'd like to have
this run through

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.930
10 different passes.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.620
Maybe you'd like to set it for
infinite number of passes so

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.010
it continues to run until
you decide when to stop.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.900
So in this case I'm going to set
the test mix to extended.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.100
We'll turn the cache off.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.480
We'll run a two pass.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.970
And when I'm done, I'm going
to press the F-10 key.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.260
And it's going to start going
through the memory process.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.020
Now, as I mentioned, there's
not much for you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.270
as a user to do.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.750
You can see that Windows is
checking for problems.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.780
It tells you it's going to
take several minutes.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.180
It will tell you what pass it's
on and what percentage.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.340
And if it has any problems that
it runs into, you will

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.920
get a notice on the screen
telling you this is the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.730
problem that we identified.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.130
And you'll get a bar that goes
across the top of the screen

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.780
that gives you an idea of just
how much has been done in this

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.390
overall test status.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.080
This built-in Windows memory
diagnostics makes it very easy

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.490
for you to test your memory.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.920
That way you don't have to rely
on third-party tools.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.140
You simply click an icon,
restart your computer, and now

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.280
you can make sure that your
memory is working

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.530
exactly as it should.
