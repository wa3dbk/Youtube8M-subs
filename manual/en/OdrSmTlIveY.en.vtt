00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.820
in oil canned wild boar salamis, welcome
to italian cuisine at home for the recipe

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.699
today very easy

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:19.699
of canning dried wild boar
salamis in olive oil, is a Tuscan

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.369
very old recipe

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.480
they made it for makinig
salamis soft and flavored

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.009
the recipe is very
elementary, it consists

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.490
simply

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.040
of removing the salamis ropes

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.790
and then to put them into a
pot very close to each other

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.270
control how many salamis
can be contained

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.740
in the pot

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.950
here only 6

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.370
for your safety

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.640
althought they will be
stored in the fridge

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.960
but it is always better
to keep the botulism away

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.940
I sterilize again
the pot using some

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.240
alcohol for food or also
that for making syrups

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.390
obviously without to
forget the pot cover

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.390
I had already sterilized the pot by boiling
it, the same we make when canning jellies

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.260
now I put salamis inside

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.520
in a useful

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.010
position

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.010
with laurel leaves which
will give salamis a better flavor

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.600
gently

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.500
put inside

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
wild boar salamis

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.080
as soon as the pot is full fill
it with very good extra virgin

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.190
olive oil

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.800
which will preserve and
make tender the salamis

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.520
obviously when the pot will have no more
sausages inside you can use this oil again y

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.840
for cooking

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.019
or seasonning meat
dishes as steak

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.989
you can store this pot for several
months, I made it until 1 year

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.679
in the fridge

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:18.099
and with a bow it could also
be a good idea for a present
