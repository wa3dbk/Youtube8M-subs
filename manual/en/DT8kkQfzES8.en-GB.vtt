00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.262
The event itself, it's massive,

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:12.698
you don't really appreciate
how big it is,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.200
until when you do arrive
at the venue,

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:18.291
the scale of the buildings
and the size of the track.

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:27.134
It's good to have engineering
students actually get out

00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:30.558
of their office, and design, build
and test something and make it run.

00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:36.018
My name is Robert Camilleri,
I'm team manager for Team EPG.

00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:40.230
Part of my role is to try to set the
agenda to see what we want to achieve

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.603
and try to push forward
to get that done.

00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:47.260
We have been described
as more of a cooperative

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.081
rather than a hierarchical structure,

00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:52.270
and as a team from
a prestigious university,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.880
we'd like to try to map out

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.555
what sort of innovations
are being put into things like this,

00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:00.322
and to see how such innovations
will actually be diffused

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:03.356
into real vehicles
in the near future.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.063
Hi, my name's Nathan,

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:09.356
my position on Team Peggie
is motor control and drive expert,

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:10.883
managing the maxon meter

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:12.740
and integration with
all the other circuits.

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:17.907
We've done some back to back testing
of two different types of motors

00:01:17.907 --> 00:01:20.033
so we're trying to determine
which is the most efficient,

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:23.510
then programming that to take
signals from throttle

00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:25.342
and control the clutch.

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:30.280
Hi, my name's Pete Armstrong,
I'm 27 and I'm the technical manager

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.525
on EPG's Team Peggie entry
for this year's Shell Eco-marathon.

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:37.880
We got around 360 kilometres
per kilowatt hour

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.710
which is about equivalent to going
from Oxford to Athens

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.494
on ten pints of petrol.

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:45.107
We're hoping to improve on that
by around ten to twenty percent.

00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:50.444
The technical manager is looking
at the system integration issues

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.980
that arise as you're trying to load
the vehicle

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.392
with all the technologies
of reconfigurable PV,

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:59.602
phase control of the clutches
and the driver application

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:02.174
so we're adapting all this
from the inception

00:02:02.174 --> 00:02:05.543
all the way through to manufacturing
and testing.

00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:09.234
This year PV is on board the vehicle.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:13.314
The PV guys were thrilled with
the energy that was harvested.

00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:16.379
We've still got about ten percent
of our propulsion coming off the PB

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.074
which is really impressive.

00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:22.004
I'm Lucy Mahoney, I'm 29

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.899
and I'm the driver for EPG's eco-car,
Peggie.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:28.151
I'm looking forward to getting
a valid attempt,

00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:30.310
I need to do ten laps
within forty minutes,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.854
averaging about 25km an hour.

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:37.412
Some teams have
incredible sponsorship

00:02:37.412 --> 00:02:40.061
and they're able to make
these incredible cars

00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:41.985
that are just efficient in themselves

00:02:41.985 --> 00:02:45.684
but Peggie was donated to us,
so everything that we've added

00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:48.321
is our own innovation and technology,
and things like that

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:50.582
so the boys really need
to be commended for that.

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:59.014
We've kind of introduced
new strategies to try and improve

00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:00.347
our efficiency on last year.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:03.819
So, I'm accelerating and then when
I'm approaching a corner,

00:03:03.873 --> 00:03:07.228
I'm regenning to bring braking energy
back into the motor.

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.974
On average, we need to be
25km per hour,

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:12.868
that means hitting 30 and then
at corners, where you brake,

00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:14.168
it reduces the average.

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.978
It's actually a
very stressful experience,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.824
it's very warm in the car,
it's very claustrophobic,

00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:25.274
you've got a very heavy safety belt
which is right on your chest,

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.335
so you're sucked in
and strapped into the car

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:29.109
which is, of course,
incredible for safety,

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.071
but it's not really a
very comfortable forty minutes

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:33.227
out on the track.
