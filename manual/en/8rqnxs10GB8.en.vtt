Hi I'm Evan from Gregg's Cycles and I'm going
to show you how to change a tire on your bike.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.490
The first thing that you want to do is go
ahead and release the brake. That will enable

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.939
you to get the wheel out of the bike and then
let the majority of the air out of the tube,

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:30.279
not all of it, just most of it. Once you have
got most of the air out you can kind of feel

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.949
the tire release, just kind of go around and
knock it off the edge of the tire there or

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.810
off the edge of the wheel and then take your
tire lever and just insert one right there

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.840
and then it just kind of pulls the bead of
the tire over, the bead of the rim and then

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.379
once you have got that over just push and
then take it all the way around and then what

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.750
you want to do is you want to pull the tube
around starting from the opposite side of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.350
the valve stem and that way you are sure not
to break the valve stem off in there. Then

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.119
get around to where the valve stem is, pull
the valve stem out, set your tube aside and

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.990
then go ahead and remove the tire again using
your tire lever, just pop the bead of that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.350
tire right over the edge of the rim there
and then again same thing just kind of work

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.320
it around until the tire comes off and then
to reinstall a new tire you would again put

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.159
the bead of the tire over the bead of the
rim. You can use your tire lever to kind of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.579
string it along there and then once you have
that first edge of the tire over the rim,

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:57.930
take your tube, find your valve stem hole,
get that valve stem in there first and then

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.409
just kind of tuck your tube inside the tire
first. Then once your tube is in the tire

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.840
go ahead and put the tire on the rim and start
at the valve stem again and that way it is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.871
easiest because the valve stem is kind of
the hardest part to get on the tire and then

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:23.890
just continue to go around the rim. You may
have to continue to tuck the tube into the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.170
tire and it may want to kind of pop out on
you every now and then, then just go around

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.211
with your thumbs and push that guy on there
and then make sure it is all on there evenly.

00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:49.720
Then you can go ahead and fill your tire with
air and put it back on the bike. Then always,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.010
always, always remember to reattach your brake
at the end. Probably the most important part.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.459
That is how you replace a tire on your bicycle.
