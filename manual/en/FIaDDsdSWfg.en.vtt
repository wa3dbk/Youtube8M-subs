00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.840
Alright.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.160
They say "There's someone out there for everyone".

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.600
Of course that's not necessarily true

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.560
for example, if you're Peter Stringfellow,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.640
there are SIX THOUSAND someones out there for everyone.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.280
But sadly, unless you're the leopard-skin-clad owner of a table-dancing franchise,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.640
you might not find it that easy when it comes to attracting a mate.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.960
But, with the aid of technology, things have got easier.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.760
These days, five million people in the UK regularly "Internet date".

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.240
And thanks to the huge growth of the Internet, there's now a dating site for everyone. 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.280
Like ‘FarmersOnly.com'.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.120
Its stated demographic is that old favourite

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.160
"farmers, ranchers, livestock owners, cowboys, cowgirls and rodeo fans".

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.760
Which makes it the perfect dating site for people who are single, adventurous

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.160
and live in the Wild West in the 1880s.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.640
For folk who are interested in finding a pale and pessimistic mate,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320
there's ‘Gothic Match'. 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.240
This site promises you will find

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.920
"the perfect darkchylde to bring back to your lair".

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.160
I'd imagine most of the folk on there are primarily looking for

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.960
someone with an NSOH - that's non-existent sense of humour.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
Or how about ‘SugarDaddie.com',

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.600
a site which claims to be the place

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.480
"where the classy, attractive and affluent meet".

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.920
So it's basically the online equivalent of a Yates's Wine Lodge.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.520
It's just as popular - look at these testimonials...

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.200
"Although I'm by no means wealthy - $120k a year

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.400
I was able to find on your site an amazing, beautiful, kind, bright and tolerant

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.640
woman who is 14 years younger".

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.160
Dear God, I hope that man's AT LEAST comfortably in his thirties.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.280
And here's another one:

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.080
"Thanks for eliminating the time consuming courtship rituals

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.760
and focusing on the more sought after prerequisites in most relationships."

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.160
Interesting use of language there.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.600
Some people call it "the more sought-after prerequisites",

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.640
whereas I find it easier to just use the word "cash".

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.120
If you're looking for something a bit less superficial,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.600
 why not digitally wend your way to the dubiously-titled ‘MustLovePets.com'.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.240
It's a great place to go if you're keen on hooking up with people who like animals.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.280
It's a terrible place if you're keen to hook up with

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.200
that lady who put a cat in a wheelie bin.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.160
She won't be there.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.280
And finally, there's ‘Trek Passions',

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.440
a site aimed at science fiction fans looking for relationships.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.960
There's a rarity - you don't often hear the words

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.960
"science fiction fans" and "relationships" in the same sentence.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.760
Unless it's a sentence like,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.800
"You don't often here the words 'science fiction fans' and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.720
'relationships' in the same sentence".

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.920
Then, you do.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.800
So, there you go.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.040
Whether you're a cowboy, a goth, an animal-lover or a Trekkie,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.280
modern technology can sort your love life at the click of a button.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.440
Beam me up... Barry.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.720
They're not...

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.080
Oh, hang on...
