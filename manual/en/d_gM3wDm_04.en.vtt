00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.200
Wow!

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.900
Jaystepher has finally found

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.400
Lego Movie: Series 12 Minifigure mystery pack.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.900
Set number 71004.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.700
Contains an undisclosed amount of pieces.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.700
Recommended building ages are 5 and up.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.000
So apparently there is one of sixteen in this package.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's see what I got.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.400
Okay!

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.400
Get a variety of parts.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.200
So this is the 16 we can possibly get.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.000
Let's see which on I have.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.000
Well apparently I have the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
"Where Is My Pants Guy".

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You can see he's possibly in his undergarments.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Nice print work on the shirt.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.300
Fantastic hair piece.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.000
Looks like he's pretty happy
he's missing his pants.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.400
Although I couldn't get him
to hold on to his pants.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.000
Oh there we go ... kind of.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.000
Put him on his stand.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400
Really cool minifigure!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.100
So this "Where Is My Pants Guy"

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.300
from the Lego Movie: Series
12 Minifigures collection.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.900
Set number 71004.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.000
