in which we will show you how to use the heart

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.080
rate monitor of the Galaxy Gear 2 device.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.330
Please note: you first need to connect the
Galaxy Gear 2 to your Galaxy device.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.490
If you have not already done so, please watch
our video 'How to Connect the GALAXY Gear

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.420
2 with a Samsung Galaxy Device'.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.390
First, please ensure you are wearing the Gear
2 device properly, to help the heart rate

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.650
monitor effectively.
For accurate heart measurement results, avoid

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.520
wearing the device over the wrist bone.
Wear the device so that it firmly fits over

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.520
your arm, just below the wrist.
Now swipe across the Gear 2 screen right to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.780
left until you see the Heart Rate app.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.170
Then tap start
and the device will begin measuring.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.890
Once the measurement has been made the heart
rate will be displayed.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.040
If the device has any difficulty in measuring
your heart rate a popup will appear.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.189
Tap on retry to do the measurement again.

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.270
To see your heart rate history,
first tap on the menu icon,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.159
then tap history and the recent heart rate
measurements will be displayed.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.880
If you have set up the S Health app on your
connected Galaxy S5 device,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.579
tap on the heart rate icon to display the
last measurement made using the Gear 2.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.840

on your Galaxy S5,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.750
please see our video ‘how to set up the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.380
Please follow this advice to get the best
from your Galaxy Gear device.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.799
Humidity and liquids may damage your device.
Keep your device dry.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.600
Do not use a screen protector - This causes
sensor malfunctions.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.789
Do not allow water to contact the touch screen.
The touch screen may malfunction in humid

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.060
conditions
or when exposed to water.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.700

heart rare monitor of the Galaxy Gear 2 device.
