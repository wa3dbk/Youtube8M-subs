00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.180
Matt is, had this prepped and we're ready
to work. We've cleaned out the lint out of

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.719
his belly button and now we're going to start.
We're going to begin, I'm going to look at,

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.840
now the hair is growing most of it is growing
this way. The way you would insert is this

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.790
way and a lot of this hair is kind of flat
to the skin so I'm going to taunt the area.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.600
I'm going to slide in and we're going to see
how deep these follicles are. This is sexual

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.160
terminal hair they call it which is deeper
than a lot of the body hair. So let's see

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.670
if this does it, no there's still a tug so
we're going to need to go in a little deeper.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.950
A lot of times I might have to adjust my machine.
I think we're going to need a little more

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.560
power to do this where we'll come up on the
high frequency a little bit on the electrology.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:57.550
K there we go, now I'm going to taunt that
skin again, I'm going to try that again. See

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.690
if we need to go just a touch deeper, I can
usually feel my way to the depth of a follicle.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.710
I've been doing this so long I know from touch
how deep is deep enough on most cases. Well

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.979
that, there we go we got it we got, the hair
is releasing. It gives a little bit of a feeling

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.850
but that's not under treatment. That is just
because it's a big follicle, a big papilla

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.749
I mean not follicle but it's got a big papilla
on the end that causes that suctiony feel

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:41.100
to the hair but it isn't truly a, resistant
to pull comes right out so I can really move

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.969
on this area because it, like I said it's
not a painful area to treat. Once I get the

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.969
settings what I want them to be that's it's
a matter I call a Rock-n-Roll, off we're running.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.749
We'll just keep going and keep going and keep
going until I get that area clear. If he wants

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:01.520
a half hour I do a half hour if he wants an
hour I do an hour. Whatever he's come in and,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.149
and booked the time with me to do is what
we, we do that afternoon.
