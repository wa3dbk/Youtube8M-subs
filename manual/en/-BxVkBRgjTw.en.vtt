Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.990
[pause]

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.819
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.950
A viewer on DermTV this week asked an important
question: is it safe to use

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.730
exfoliants on your face if you have broken
capillaries? And the answer is,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.849
with one exception, yes it is safe. So if
you are using gentle, chemical

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.269
exfoliants like glycolic or salicylic acids,
that’s fine and if you’re

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.009
doing gentle physical exfoliation like microdermabrasion
or even shaving,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.440
that won’t break capillaries. But, the one
exception is retinoids. Now

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.340
usually retinoids are used for acne, but they’re
also used for facial

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.539
rejuvenation because they are good exfoliants.
But when you use retinoids

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.949
for a prolonged period of time, they can cause
mild broken capillaries.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.469
However, there’s a catch and the catch is
that while exfoliation by and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.760
large doesn’t cause an increase in facial
capillaries or broken

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.329
capillaries, it does make the ones that you
have more apparent. Let me

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.590
explain. Here again is our favorite skin diagram.
This is the epidermis and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.299
this is where your chemical exfoliants work.
It’s also where physical

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.730
exfoliants work. They take away this layer
of dead cells. However, the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.540
broken capillaries are down here in the second
layer in the dermis and it’s

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.880
these blue lines and the red lines. Well,
the dead cells that are being

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.119
removed by exfoliation are opaque; they sort
of obscure the appearance of

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.479
what’s below it. If you take these dead
cells away, it’s a little bit like

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.631
dusting off a painting; it reveals all the
details below. So, if you

00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:47.289
regularly exfoliate and get rid of this opaque
layer up here, you’re really

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.289
going to be able to see into the skin better
and therefore anything below

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.340
the surface, like the capillaries that are
broken and enlarged, are going

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.149
to be more apparent. So while exfoliation
by and large doesn’t increase the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.820
broken capillaries you have, it can make the
ones you have more apparent.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.030
Usually it doesn’t, but if it does, then
rest assured that those broken

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.880
capillaries that your now seeing a little
bit more clearly can easily be

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.420
removed by lasers which are painless and don’t
leave any marks.
