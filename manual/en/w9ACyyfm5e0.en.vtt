Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[pause]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.879
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.250
When I was a kid, we used to have a joke amongst
ourselves. You’d walk up

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.249
to another kid who hadn’t heard this before
and say, “Your epidermis is

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.100
showing” And really what it meant is, your
skin is showing, but kids at

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.700
that age didn’t know what an epidermis was,
but everybody’s skin is

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.530
showing. But why do we have skin? What does
our skin do? Well, it’s really

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.330
kind of interesting. Our skin has a lot of
different, very important

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.140
functions. First of all, it’s our sealing.
It’s what keeps the inside world

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.080
in and the outside world out. It keeps all
of the germs and all of the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.829
bacteria out of our system so we don’t get
infections. It keeps all of our

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.579
inner fluids, our blood, our chemicals, all
of the important things that

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.890
belong in our body, it keeps them inside.
And that’s really what the outer

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.140
layer of skin does, the epidermis. But then
there’s a second layer, it’s

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.850
called the dermis, and that’s where all
of the machinery is. And the dermis

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.759
has things like hair follicles and sweat glands.
That’s where the blood

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.049
vessels are, that’s how we control our temperature.
That’s how we perspire.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.909
That’s how we feel things with nerves. And
lastly, on the very bottom is

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.749
the subcutaneous layer, which is really the
fat layer. That’s there to

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:24.350
store energy and it also helps with regulation
of temperature and it also

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.270
helps buffer us against injury. As we get
older, it gets thinner and that’s

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.909
one of the things that’s responsible for
the appearance of an aging face.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.460
The fact that the fat is thinning out. So
the next time you take your skin

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.490
for granted, just remember, it’s a very
versatile, multifunction organ, and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:57.789
without it, we couldn’t live.
