00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.970
I wanted to tell you a couple of different
ways that you can trigger your flash. Now

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.889
this particular flash fits right on to my
Cannon and it is also a Cannon so it is made

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.000
to work really well with it and it can just
slide right on there, this flash is triggered

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.550
when you press the shutter speed as long as
you have got the flash turned on. However

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.180
if you were using an L-bracket like this,
this would actually attach to the bottom of

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.290
the camera and then you have got a flash up
here but you still need to connect your flash

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:40.079
to your camera and the way that I do that
is with this hot-shoe adapter, the hot-shoe

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.960
adapter connects to the hot-shoe on your camera
and also makes the same connection on the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.920
bottom of your flash so that only works if
your flash is at a very close distance to

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.930
your camera. What if your flash is even further
away? In that case you are going to need a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.390
synch cord and this cord will run all the
way to the PCM port on your flash from your

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.040
camera and as you can see this is a pretty
long synch cord. The third way and the way

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.320
that you have the most latitude is with these
things called a Pocket Wizard, now they sell

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.469
these in, you don't have to buy the Pocket
Wizard, the Pocket Wizard is probably, you

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:28.240
know the most well known of the brands and
also probably the most expensive, so you can

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.189
go online and find different transmitters
that are a lot less. Each one of these transceivers

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.819
is about two hundred apiece and you need one
for your camera and then an additional one

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:46.229
for each flash that you have. So if you can
find some of the more affordable transceivers,

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.869
sometimes the less expensive ones actually
have a transmitter and a receiver where these,

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.380
you know they can be either one, but a lot
of times you can get away with that, especially

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.859
if you are not trying to transmit far distances.
Where these really come in handy is if you

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.479
are doing something portable, like for example
I just shot a wedding on a beach, so I had

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.050
one Pocket Wizard attached to this camera
and then I used my small strobe on a stand

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.970
with an umbrella light a few feet away from
me and it worked great because I didn't have

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.349
any cords for anyone to trip on and I was
able to fire my flash. These also work through

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.000
walls so if you are trying to do a very intricate
setup you could fire your flash remotely using

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.650
your Pocket Wizard and if I wanted to do a
self-portrait I could actually have one connected

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.939
to my camera and fire the camera remotely
or one connected to the strobe and the camera

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:48.040
on the self-timer and fire that way. So there
are a lot of different ways that you can trigger

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.110
your flashes and they can be beneficial depending
on your exposure or if you are trying to create

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.229
a certain effect.
