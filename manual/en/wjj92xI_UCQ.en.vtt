I'm Boris Galuzin and it's clutch cable repair

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.910
If the clutch cable has torn tendon, it must be replaced immediately, because complete break on the move is very dangerous

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.350
For repair clutch cable should be removed with the braided wire

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.600
To remove the cable it's required to cut the fitting

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.610
Remember the length of the cut piece - it should be considered when determining the length of the new cable

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.580
Before installing a new cable braid should be washed with kerosene

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.910
It's easy to do using a syringe

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.320
As you can see there is a lot of dirt in the braid line, which makes it difficult to move and increases wear 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.540
Before assembling the new cable pick the right size of nipple in repair kit

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.560
Determining the length of new cable it is important to consider that a piece was cut when removing old cable

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.570
Next new cable is thrust into a braid line

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.200
Nipple is fixed on the cable with screw connection

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.440
Lubricate the cable

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.640
Installation in reverse order

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.170
After installation, you need to adjust the clutch lever free stroke, it should be a couple of mm

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.440
It is a temporary solution, replace the cable with a new one as soon as possible

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.590
