00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.690
What if you had a book...

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.670
that was just a whole bunch of...

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.060
 awkward and...

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.440
slightly embarrassing...

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.740
titles? Gotcha titles.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.110
Then you could discreetly plant this
book...

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.960
in a place where it would soon be
"discovered"...

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.900
by an unsuspecting friend.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.470
Our "victim" might at first feel...

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.150
a little surprised...

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.940
maybe even a little awkward...

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.610
but only for a few seconds...

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.210
almost certainly followed by

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.800
some light-hearted laughter.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:50.150
Brighten Up a Friend's Day

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.110

A special shout out to 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.220
the very talented Joel Helander

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.380
who graciously composed 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.610
and performed

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.440
this Waltz
