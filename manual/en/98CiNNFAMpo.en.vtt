00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.435
-One word?

00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:02.350
-I'll go with bigger.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.280
You say?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.810
-Bigger.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.760
How about sexier?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.610
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.620
-We're the Avengers.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.730
We can bust arms dealers
all the live-long day,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.958
but that up there,
that's the end game.

00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.050
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.500
-Together.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.410
-I love that we get to know the
Avengers a little bit better

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.340
in this movie.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.770
What do we learn about them?

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.400
-Well, hopefully we get
to learn a little bit more

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.890
about what makes them tick.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.520
Some of them have their
own movie franchises

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
and so I can't really change
their lives that much,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.670
but I can dig into them
and sort of give them

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.335
a little insight
into who they are

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:54.151
and give us a little insight.

00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:56.400
And with the characters who
don't have their own movie

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.160
franchises, I can really play
around and really explore.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.140
And that's why I came
back in first place.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.760
-Our family is finally
functioning-- well, somewhat.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.810
And so it's just about
time that you kind of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.720
get to see our
characters' dark pasts,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.170
or rather it's the right
time for these pasts

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.080
to catch up with
these characters.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.950
And you learn a lot about
our characters' weaknesses,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.730
I think which is
kind of a driving

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.940
force behind this final fight.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.810
I think our characters
facing their weaknesses

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.470
is really the truly
heroic part of this film.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.470
-You get to see the superheroes
just being super human,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.820
I think, for the first time.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.660
Right?

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.805
-Yeah, for sure.

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:54.305
-Thanks.

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:55.513
-You coined that, didn't you?

00:01:55.513 --> 00:01:57.690
-Super humans being--
you see how I did that?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.190
-Yeah.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.403
I like that.

00:01:58.403 --> 00:01:59.278
-Put those two words.

00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:00.701
-A word play there.

00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:01.200
-Thanks.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.440
-The character
relationships do deepen.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.880
And there are new goodies and
there's new great baddies.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.590
And everything that was good
about the first "Avengers"

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.690
is exponentially, I think,
bigger and broader in scope

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.690
and probably maybe more
interesting in this one.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.930
There's a lot more going on.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.700
But speaking to the
character stuff,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.990
there's a lot of new
relationships deepening

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.290
and also splintering.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.760
-Somebody says in the movie
about your characters,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.630
he's fast and she's weird.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.140
What are your superpowers
and how do you use them?

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.260
-What are our
superpowers in this?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.390
-As opposed to our
everyday lives.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.160
-Right.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.670
-Well, I have telekinesis
and mind control.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.420
And I can manipulate
objects with my mind.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.430
-And Quicksilver has supersonic
speed so he runs faster

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.850
than the speed of sound.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.330
-Who is this Vision guy?

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.380
-Well, he's purple.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.650
He can change his density.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.900
And he is supremely powerful and
omnipotent, and yet incredibly

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.010
naive because he's
about a day old.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.240
So it was a lot of
fun playing him.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.740
And he's figuring out who he
is and what his purpose is

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.740
in the world, and
what his powers are

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.320
and what he's going
to do with them.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.382
So that was fun.

00:03:29.382 --> 00:03:34.030
-There are no strings on me.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.850
-This Ultron guy is
a sweet, you know,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.125
well-meaning, insane robot,
and I love him very much.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.881
He'll probably kill
everybody but, I don't know,

00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:52.380
when he talks about the Avengers
and what's wrong with them,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.470
I'm kind of on his side.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.070
-Hey big guy.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.990
-One of my favorite
parts in the movie

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.220
was actually the
relationship between both

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.810
of your characters.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.220
What is happening there?

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.240
What do we get to see with
Black Widow and the Hulk?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.070
-Not much, unfortunately.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.570
-Yeah.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.230
Not enough.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.100
-You don't get to
see really anything.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.805
-Not as much as you'd
want to see really.

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:20.305
-Yeah.

00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:21.519
There was just so bad timing.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.630
-You'd almost want to
see a whole other movie

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.610
with just those two characters.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.310
Hint hint.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.150
-Hint hint, Marvel.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.950
No, it's not happening
this time around.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.120
-I guess not.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.010
-But maybe we're laying the
groundwork for something

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.770
later on.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.620
-For our friendship maybe.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.490
-Yeah.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.710
-Friendship plus.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.050
-Yeah.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.720
-The Avengers are pretty
chaotic in this movie,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.070
probably because everybody
wants to get a say.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.685
Who would you vote as
their class-representative?

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.930
-Well, let's see.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.500
Tony's the class clown.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.570
Steve's the class president.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.890
Thor's most likely to
succeed the throne.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:14.490
I think they're all extremely
noble and extremely damaged,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.920
and that's what I like.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.690
-If you would have one word
to describe the new movie,

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.850
which one would you choose?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.660
-Oh, man.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.738
-The new movie?

00:05:23.738 --> 00:05:24.237
-Mm-hm.

00:05:24.237 --> 00:05:26.572
-Oh.

00:05:26.572 --> 00:05:27.305
-One word?

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:28.180
-I'll go with bigger.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.110
You say?

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.680
-Bigger.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.650
How about sexier?

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.640
-Bigger and sexier.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.721
-Sexier?

00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:34.220
-Yeah.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.240
-That's a good choice.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.740
Thank you.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.520
-I went for it.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.722
I went for it.

00:05:37.722 --> 00:05:38.930
-Thank you for the interview.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.330
-You got it.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.620
-It was great to talk to you.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.490
-Thank you.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.390
Cheers.
