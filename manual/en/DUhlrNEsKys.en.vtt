00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.840
Hi guys, welcome to Steve's Kitchen. The
fourth of July is upon us again

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.540
and at Steve's Kitchen I'm going to be showing you all sorts of wonderful treats you can make

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.480
to celebrate fourth of July. Today we're
going to be making those jello shots

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.610
 that every one loves but we're going to making them with a 4th
July twist on them

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.140
they taste wonderful, they look fantastic. You can make them

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.539
with or without alcohol guys. This is
great for any sort of party

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.730
let me show you how 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.330
 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.320
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.280
 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.670
Now we're  starting with a 3 ounce pack that's about 85 grams

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.080
of this Jelly mix,the jello premix that you can buy that's already flovoured

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.560
we're not going to follow the instructions
on the packet I want a slightly thicker 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.160
jelly than what they recommend

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.360
Empty the pack into a bowl

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.730
and then we're going to add 1 cup of boiling water, straight from the kettle

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.770
just mix that

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.989
through we want to dissolve that jelly in
there and when you're comfortable that the geletine

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.180
is completely dissolved

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.470
here's where you decide if you want an alcohol based shot or not 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.460
we're going to take 1/2 a cup of  either vodka or just plain water plain water

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.270
and pour that in to cool that down a little bit
and give it a mix through

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.550
so at this point got guys

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.610
I'm going to want to put a third of this into a shot glass now if you use the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.810
previously filled shot glass you can 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.220
use that as a sort of measure to make
sure you've got similar

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.640
or very close to the same amount in each glass

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.640
so there I've got

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.240
six little shot glasses with my blue

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.460
jello in  there alcohol or alcohol free

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.360
your choice and  I'm going to leave those on a
tray in the fridge

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.420
just to let them set completely

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.399
Now when you're comfortable your blue jelly is set and I'll take least maybe three hours

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.780
we going to take one cup of cream into a
saucepan

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.410
and 25 grams of superfine sugar that's
caster sugar

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.519
that's about 1 ounce. Just start to mix that 
through

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.650
over a heat and I'm just going to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract in there as

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.970
well for a little flavor

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.430
so this is very similar to the way you
make a panna cotta

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.860
it's not really a Panna cotta because I'm
going to set it a little bit firmer with

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.840
extra gelatine

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.549
but very similar and the principles are the
same. Now as this creamy sugary milk

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.019
comes up to a boil when it's near a simmer
I'm taking two

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.380
teaspoons of unflavored gelatin and you
could use

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.360
2 of the gelatine leaves and I'm just going to sprinkle that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.530
over the top of the cream and then

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.530
let it mix in and you want this gelatine to
completely dissolve in the cream

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.670
actually you can turn the heat off now this is quite hot enough

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.290
and when you're happy the gelatine  is
complete dissolved into cream

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.459
I want to set this aside in a cool area
for about 15-20 minutes just to let it

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.400
cool down before I it poured on top

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.500
of our blue Jelly. Now I've allowed my cream

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.829
to cool down but it's still runny and I've
poured it into a little

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.350
pouring glass and we've just  got to very
carefully now pour it in

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.440
on top of the blue and again we're
looking for about a third

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:33.500
of the way up another third and now they're
ready to go back in the fridge for another two

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.700
to three hours until that's set firm.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.000
Okay once your white jelly has set
that takes two or three

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.239
hours we're going to now take a strawberry jelly a red jelly 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.269
again that's a 3 oz packet that's about

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.819
85 grams and into that I'm going to

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:58.379
add 1 cup of boiling hot water and once your much certain that the gelatine is

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.790
completely dissolved

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.840
we're going to take half a cup of
water or vodka depending on whether you use

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.780
the alcoholic version of the shots

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.170
just add that into there and stir it around

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.209
so we're going to set this jelly aside now
and let it completely cool down

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.609
we want it to be quite cool to the touch
not set

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.259
but when we pour it on top these of jellies
if its warm

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.990
is going to destroy the actual white jelly
so we've got to be careful

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.949
okay this is completely optional but I
want to decorate my shots with a little

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:29.599
cherry

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.970
now I want the cherries on the stalk like this and I've got one of  these cherry

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.990
pitters I don't know if you've got one and
as I say this is optional

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.539
but I pop the cherry inside sideways into the pitter and just

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.690
push the pip out 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.650
Now you didn't see that there as it flew over the
other site but what's happened is that

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.570
taking the

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.760
pip out of the center of the cherry and then
I'm just going to take

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.669
the cherry itself and I'm going to slice a
little tiny bit off the bottom

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.229
so the cherry stands like that OK

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.400
and I'm going to use that inside my
jelly as a little decoration

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.080
right now I'm just going to finally
assemble this I've got my

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.099
little cherry and just stand it in the middle

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.930
there and I've allowed my red strawberry jelly to  cool a little bit now

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.020
I'm just going to pour it over the top of the
cherry

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.440
let it sit there on top of the white

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.099
there you have it guy's

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:33.099
I'm going to  set these aside for a good
couple of hours to let them set

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.750
and there are my 4th July jelly shots
whether you have them with alcohol

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.780
or you have them without they look fantastic

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.760
and they going to taste absolutely
wonderful, I'll give one of  these a try now

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.810
they've completely set they won't come out
and

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.590
if I pop my cherry pull the stalk off 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.440
like that you've got a completely edible
fourth of July celebration

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.540
and they do look a ittle bit like the french flag as well so

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.890
viva La France my French friends let's
give this a try

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.060
OK I'm going to take the

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.080
cherry a little bit of the cream as well

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.400
all in one shot and it's delicious

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.870

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.930
