Hi my name is Shana Siegel here at Just Scenic
creations in New York City. I will now show

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.190
you how to faux finish using the technique
of ragging. It's very, very simple. All you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.089
need is a rag and the glaze that you desire.
Or you can use a full strength pigment. It's

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:26.990
up to you. You can vary the kind of effect
you'll get based on, you can also dip your

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.920
rag in water before you use it. And that will
give you a more subtle less defined effect

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.969
but then you have to be very, very careful
of drips, especially if you are using, if

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.829
you are painting something on a vertical surface
drippage beware. So what you do is you kind

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.649
of smoosh the paint around a little bit, see
gloves because you get so messy. So when you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.940
put your rag down you want to make sure you
are not dragging it on the surface. You want

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.420
to just kind of roll it around because that's
what is going to give you these defined shapes.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.290
That's what ragging is. This is kind of interesting
texture, sometimes they can kind of come out

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.790
looking a little bit like stone, especially
if you layer it with a different bunch of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.801
different layers of tones. You can come out
with all kinds of different effects. Using

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:25.070
this very simple kind of just rolling around.
You can also use it subtractively too if you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.860
want to cover a surface with a brush. Maybe
use a paint extender so that you can work

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.770
with it for longer so that it doesn't dry.
But then you can then rag off the paint that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.939
you just put on. Alright so this is what you
are going to end up with, with a ragging technique

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.180
while you are using similar tones. It's kind
of a subtle interesting texture. It's kind

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.539
of a nice finish. Not difficult to do. It
has a little bit of spatter from one of our

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.250
other projects so I mean if you are working
on two things close to each other you are

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.960
going to want to keep them separate from each
other. Unless you like a little spatter on

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.409
it. Yeah so this has been how to faux finish
using ragging technique.
