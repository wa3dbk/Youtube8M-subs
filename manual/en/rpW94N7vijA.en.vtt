00:00:10.957 --> 00:00:14.461
In this very small self-portrait by Goya,

00:00:15.918 --> 00:00:23.665
painted three or four years after the illness which left him completely deaf,

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:29.463
we are looking at a man who has seen death,

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:35.181
who has been very very close to death, who has lost his hearing,

00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:38.318
who will never hear again for the rest of his life.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:44.582
He has come back through a slow convalescence

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:55.768
and is really now back to pretty good health but is beginning to remake his career.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:01:02.328
And he had been of course an extraordinarily important figure at the court.

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:09.099
He had spent many years of his life painting huge preparatory cartoons

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:21.499
for tapestries and suddenly at a blow he was reduced to a very weak and ill individual.

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:26.394
But the strength of his character, which I think shines through him in this portrait,

00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:31.013
and together with a deep sense of tragedy,

00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:37.710
a tragedy which he managed to overcome by his willpower

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.406
and by his desire to continue his work as an artist.

00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:48.318
It is a very very powerful portrait in spite of its small size.

00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:55.067
It’s not exactly a miniature, which would be maybe one quarter of that size,

00:01:55.267 --> 00:02:01.007
but it is a very very long way from any of his face to face

00:02:01.207 --> 00:02:04.394
self-portraits on canvas which are normally larger size.

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:08.162
If we look at this work in detail,

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:12.286
we see that it is painted almost like a watercolor

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:23.318
shows the artist looking rather like Beethoven with a romantic dishevelment of his hair

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:30.013
and this incredibly intense gaze which shows to my thinking a symbolic moment

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:34.049
where he knows that he is back on track his painting.

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:40.402
He has a canvas on an easel in front of him, we can’t see his brushes,

00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:46.913
we can’t see what he is painting but his arm and hand at the end of it have moved

00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:49.681
in front of the surface of the canvas.

00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:56.880
What we see is the back of the canvas and it is on the back of the canvas

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.218
that he has signed his name in very small letters

00:03:00.418 --> 00:03:04.363
down in the lower right hand corner: “Goya”. Simply.

00:03:04.563 --> 00:03:10.377
He painted this portrait during a year or a year in a half

00:03:10.577 --> 00:03:14.136
where we knew very little about his movements. He went to Andalucía.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:19.007
There is no record of him having been commissioned to leave the court,

00:03:19.207 --> 00:03:24.507
but everyone knew that he was ill and he stayed away recovering.

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:30.987
And During this year he visited the Duchess of Alba on her estates

00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:35.076
at Sanlúcar de Barrameda and it was no doubt

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:38.051
that is what there that he had painted this portrait and gave it to her.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:45.000
So at this time Goya is in fact preparing his drawings

00:03:46.551 --> 00:03:49.617
and the preparatory drawings directly for engravings,

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:55.002
he is preparing his great project for the prints of "Los Caprichos".

00:03:56.356 --> 00:04:02.016
This portrait in a way symbolizes his move from the earlier 18th Century,

00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:08.656
a period when things may not have been perfect

00:04:08.856 --> 00:04:12.390
but there was a sense of innocence and joy.

00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:19.319
But the Enlightenment and the French Revolution and the things

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.430
that were to come are all foreshadowed in this small work.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.478
It is interesting but some years after was the publication of the Caprichos in 1799,

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:37.888
so about three years after Goya painted this particular portrait.

00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:47.825
Now 1811 is of course a year after Goya began to engrave the "Desastres de la guerra"

00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:54.577
and I think what is going to happen is also symbolized in this portrait.

00:04:54.777 --> 00:05:02.762
This incredibly serious artist sitting at his easel and in the background

00:05:02.962 --> 00:05:06.911
in his studio we can imagine all his etching materials,

00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:13.443
his drawing materials spread out around him and he is going to throw himself

00:05:13.643 --> 00:05:17.445
into making another great series of prints

00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:26.390
the "Fatales consecuencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Bonaparte",

00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:33.799
all this is seems to me is summed up in this very small and very moving work.
