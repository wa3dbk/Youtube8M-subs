00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.020
they eat dogs don't they?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.800
Let's go exploring the food.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.640
We just passed some dog meat &amp; cat meat restaurants.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.660
this episode is about strange food

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.040
what's for dinner?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.880
Elephant, rabbit &amp; tiger restaurant.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.600
when I say strange,  I mean strange!

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.700
fish is a staple in Asia

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.100
so I expected lots and lots of fish

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.920
but floating pigs I didn't expect

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.420
and so our coconuts but you won't catch me up in
that tree

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.760
now that's much smarter

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.540
Wow, a pig on a motorcycle

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.380
did someone ask for ice cubes?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.020
oh wow look at that, beetles &amp; grasshoppers

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140
Want to try a grasshopper?

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.460
No thanks.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.060
anyone interested in crunchy bugs?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.160
I prefer a good stir-fry

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.140
or some dessert

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.060
you guys again

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.420
let's head north into the countryside

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.800
for less glamorous food

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.380
market stalls are my favorite

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.420
rats!

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.380
let's forget about breakfast

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.760
the Catholic Church, another source of food

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.300
they gave away free rice after the Vietnam War

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.960
but you had to be a convert

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.840
let's go further out into the
countryside

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.080
remind me to rewash the vegetables

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.720
Bac Ha market on a Sunday

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.140
now this is a real farmers market

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.180
I have no clue what this
is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.140
whatever it is I'll pass

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.960
no idea what that is

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.720
turns out there really are pot-bellied
pigs

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.700
we're in the dog food aisle now

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.240
and I mean dog food!

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.920
young dogs are preferred

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.600
yes they do eat dogs

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.440
they say here, eating cats cost us 3 yrs of
poverty

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.460
but dogs are okay, no problem.
