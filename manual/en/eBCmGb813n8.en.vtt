00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi there.
Hello.

00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:07.539
Alright. I‘m Jeff. 
I‘m the chief engineer.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.740
This is Lars.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.580
I‘m Lars. I‘m the assembly operator.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.219
Novak got in touch with me 
about three months ago.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.780
He said he had this idea. 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.699
Instantly we got  bit scared, didn‘t we. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.219
Because he comes up with 
these random ideas.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.420
But I gotta say, I‘m quite 
taken by it actually.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.180
It‘s been really good fun.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.738
He thinks it‘s easy. It‘s not.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.699
He'll just say: "Do that". 
And we're like:

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.379
Well, hang on a minute, 
that's gonna take time.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.299
But we‘re gonna do that.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.459
Hey guys.

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:04.419
Hi.

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:05.660
How‘s the experiment?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.059
Good, looking good.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.699
It looks great. Do you really 
think it‘s gonna work?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.580
Yeah, absolutely. Look at this.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.660
Just like yourself on the court. 
Nice and smooth.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.059
I‘m happy that the process of 
machine making is going really well.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.100
And I‘m very confident, 
that we‘re gonna succeed.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.580
HOORAY!

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.899
Ya know, we‘ve got 
our start position.

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:46.940
He hits the first ball, it goes all
the way round finishes up here.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.739
Go, go, go!

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.250
What's that?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.000
Jeff? Jeff?

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.820
It‘s going on. It‘s going on again!

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:26.619
Right. Get down there. 
Get down there 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.060
It‘s been going now for 
four hours and 35 minutes. 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.540
 It wasn‘t supposed to do that.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.260
So we‘re gonna set a camera on it 
and you can watch it on the Internet. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.899
Enjoy it, I am.
