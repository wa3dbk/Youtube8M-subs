00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.000
-So the first thing we need to do is
figure out what type of crime fighter you are.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.700
-I'm a righter of wrongs. A righteous...

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.300
...BOLT of justice for those that are frightened and preyed upon.
-Obviously.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.400
But you're not Superman. You're a vigilante.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.100
You're a Batman.
-Sweet.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.000
-Minus the inherited fortune, the badass gadgetry, the prolific history of hot women.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
-But I have my Alfred.
-I'm not your Alfred.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
-So, you're my Robin.
[Sighs]

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.200
-So, are you a Jeph Loeb Batman or are you a Frank Miller Batman?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.000
-What's the difference?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.300
-Well, Jeph Loeb's Batman, for worse or better, still kind of an upstanding citizen.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.000
Frank Miller's Batman, at least in the last book, is like a rampaging id.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Guy's like one missed breakfast away from being a walking nightmare of violence and sex addiction.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.900
-Do you have that book?
-Yeah, it's pretty cathartic.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.090
-Can I borrow it?
-Sure.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, based on your description of the way that you MURDERED that purse snatcher, we're gonna call you a Frank Miller.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
-Dude, he's alive. And he was coming at me with a straight razor.
-And you were dodging it?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
-Yeah.
-Sounds awesome.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
-It was.
-You know, your reflexes might be preternaturally fast. We'll look into it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now...

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
How much have you experimented with your powers?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
[Phone rings]

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
-Hey, Roxy.
-This is a Code... a Code Bad.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Why didn't we come up with any emergency code colors?
-What's going on?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.500
-This is a Code Red. From now on, an emergency is a Code Red.
Roxy, what's happening?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.100
-You need to get over here now, I can't keep hold of him.
There he is!

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.000
-What are you talking abo--
[Eerie silence]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[Breaking out of stopped time noise]

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Come on!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
-This is unbelievable!
[Time start noise]

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.100
Roxy?

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.429
ROXY: Just get over here!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
-Okay, now, we know that you can do that double barrel, like,
Emperor-looking, KRAKOW thing.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.400
-My double barrel bolts.
-Nice.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.300
-Of fury.
-Okay.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.000
Over there, you have a group of bad guys.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600
-Those don't look like bad guys.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.800
-Well, I don't collect...For our purposes these are bad guys.
And what I want from you is a tiny burst of energy.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.500
Like, we know you can do the big lightning storm thing, hurts people.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.000
I want a tiny little burst of that, like you're shooting a bullet of lightning.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.200
-Can I do that?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.400
-We're gonna find out.
-Okay.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Sorry.
-All that and you didn't even get one.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
-Yeah. Sorry about that.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
-Try, like, pointing, like, two fingers. Like you're playing guns.
Like POW POW.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.600
And remember...

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.000
-Determination, deliberaton, detonation.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500
Pow!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
-That was pretty cool. Now do it smaller.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
-Control.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.600
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.500
BOTH: YES! Yes!

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.800
JONAS: Now, you weren't able to actually control your powers when you were up against those two muggers.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.100
Why do you think that was?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.300
-It was the first time I ever had to use them for real.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.000
Performance anxiety, maybe?
-Or was it that cheap champagne you were wino'ing?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.500
-You think my super weakness is alcohol?
-We have no idea.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.000
-DUDE! That would suck.
-There's only one way to know for sure.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.300
-Science.
