hi, I'm Brad Bear on behalf of Expert Village.
In this clip I want to talk about the difference

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.580
between HD DVD and Blu-ray. Which go do you
go with? Well both are high definition disk

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.490
players. So when you get your movies or t.v.
shows in High Def, either in HD DVD format

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.470
or Blu-ray format, they're both high definition
signals that'll go up to your t.v. and display

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.380
in true high definition on your true High
Definition television. Now the problem is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.790
they're both different formats, so you're
not going to be able to take an HD DVD disk

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.940
or a Blu-ray disk and put them in the different
players. Such as a Blu-ray disk into an HD

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.850
player will not play. So take that in consideration.
You've got to choose one or the other, unless

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.760
you get the player that is rather expensive
that plays both. There's kind of a format

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.210
war going on between the two and actually,
different Hollywood studios are doing different

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.210
things. Some studios such as Warner Brothers
are putting out both high definition DVDs

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.410
and Blu-ray DVDs of their titles. Disney and
Sony decided to go Blu-ray only. A handful

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.540
of other studios are doing either HD DVD only,
or they're doing both. So take into consideration

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.220
that first when deciding high definition DVd
or Blu-ray. What movies or what t.v. shows

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.540
do you prefer, do you like, or do you want
to have? And then decide on which player to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.710
go with based on who's carrying the most titles.
The other thing to consider is budget. Blu-ray

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.270
cost a little more. However, the quality is
supposed to be a little bit better. I personally

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.790
can't tell much of a difference. There is
a little bit of a difference, but not much

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.130
of a difference. I think if you consider yourself
an average viewer you're not going to notice

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.140
much of a difference. So price points are
considerations as well. However different

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.640
gaming systems such as XBOX have an HD DVD
version, or drive for that. Whereas the Playstation

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.740
3's come with a Blu-ray unit built in. So
if you have a Playstation 3, you may actually

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.860
have a Blu-ray player sitting right there
already. Both of them have an interesting

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.880
thing in the back. Both HD DVDs and Blu-ray
disk players, that's an Ethernet connection.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.860
So we're finally seeing Internet connectivity
to our disk players, to our DVD players. And

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.430
what happens is as technology progresses,
as the high definition standard evolves, the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.390
drivers in the machine, the computer in the
machine runs just like a computer that you

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.340
have that you do your Internet surfing on
needs to update itself in order to allow the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.010
newer disks that are coming out with the newer
options of navigability and games and functions

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.980
like that. They have to update themselves
to be compatible with those. They're always

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.230
going to be compatible with the disks you've
already bought, but the Internet connectivity

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.610
allows you to update the drivers. The other
cool thing about both Blu-ray and HD DVd sets

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.610
is that they up convert standard def movies.
So if you have movies and t.v. shows that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.670
you've already bought on DVD, you don't have
to necessarily buy them all again unless you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:19.270
want that extra quality. Because the Blu-ray
and HD DVD players will line double everything

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.650
and make the image fit perfectly on your HD
set and give you the best viewing experience

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.959
of what you already own and what you're about
to buy.
