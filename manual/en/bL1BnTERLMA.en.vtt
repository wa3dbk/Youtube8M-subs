00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.680
Andrew: Hello, and welcome to Xtreme DIY brought
to you by 80/20.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.060
My name’s Andrew, and today we are going
to use 80/20’s profiles, panels, and parts,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.730
to get those disorganized and messy areas
cleaned up, just like this one.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.430
Now whether it’s tools, bolts, nails, or
cans, we’ve got a simple solution to get

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.430
you organized.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.000
Now as you can see we’ve got Phil joining
us today, he’s going to help us get this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.130
project together.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.430
Phil, what can we expect?

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.590
Phil: Thanks Andrew, today we are going to
build a simple storage cabinet that will help

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.050
us take care of some of these organizational
issues that were just mentioned.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.000
Now what’s interesting about this application
is that it has adjustable shelves, and a peg

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.690
board front, that will help us easily hang
some of those tools we access on a regular

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.690
basis.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.230
Andrew: Great, so what are we doing right
now?

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.500
Phil: Well, what we have right now, is we
have everything laid out, we verified that

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.860
we have all of our parts and pieces, we have
our profiles, we have our hardware, and we

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.860
have our panels.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.910
So our next step is going to be the preloading
process.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.509
Andrew: Right, the preloading; it not only
helps speed along your build, but can prevent

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.610
frustrations and backtracking later on.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.109
Phil: That’s right, we recommend that anybody
who builds with 80/20 preload first to help

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.299
save that time and effort.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.200
Now, what we’re going to do is continue
preloading, and then we will be ready for

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.619
our build.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.439
Andrew: Now that we’ve got everything preloaded,
and ready to go, what’s next?

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.009
Phil: Now we’re going to start actually
assembling our frame, or what we’ll refer

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.790
to as the body, of the cabinet.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.020
Now, the door and the body of the cabinet
are virtually the same, so I’ll go ahead

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.420
and start working on the body, while you start
working on the door.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.280
Andrew: Okay, sounds great, let’s get started.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.819
Phil: Alright, as you can see, we’ve left
the top two bars off of our frame.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.929
We’ve done this to allow us to slide in
our shelves, our panels, our hinges, and our

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.929
handle.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.290
Now, what I really like about these is that
they’re adjustable.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.440
I can position these shelves wherever I want,
so I’m ready to fit whatever I need.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.050
Andrew: Alright, so while he is finishing
that up, I’m going to finish up the door

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.910
with one last panel here.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.960
Now we’re going to use a PVC peg board that’s
stronger and more durable than your typical

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.100
peg board.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.060
So all we’ve got left to do is slide it
into this open T-slot, and then we’re ready

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.450
for our top bar.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:49.920
Phil: Alright, now that we have our shelves
in place, and Andrew has his door finished,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.040
we’re ready to join the two together.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.570
Andrew would you help me with this please?

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.950
Andrew: Sure thing, what we’re going to
do is line up the T-nuts with the open T-slot.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.280
That’ll allow the door to slide right on.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.150
We’ll go ahead and do the same thing with
this hinge.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.040
Slides right into place.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.930
From there, were just ready to tighten down
our hinges.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.250
Phil: That’s right, and now that we have
our hinges being tightened down, we’re ready

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:23.870
to add this final top bar, and then we’ll
be ready to mount our cabinet to the wall.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:34.540
Alright, we have our cabinet mounted to the
wall, and are wrapping up.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.240
Another great advantage of the 80/20 T-slotted
framing system, is the possibilities are endless

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.680
when it comes to mounting your project to
any surface.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.400
If you need assistance, please seek a professional’s
help.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.930
Andrew: It looks like we got everything ready
to go, now all we have to do is organize.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.990
Phil: Let’s go.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.080
Andrew: Now we designed this shelving option
from 80/20 for a few reasons.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.620
It’s durable so it won’t dent, it’s
made of materials that don’t rust, and best

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.150
of all, it’s adjustable.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.389
So when you have those supplies you need to
add later on, we can make sure that they fit.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.880
Alright Phil it’s starting to look pretty
organized around here thanks to this simple

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.880
solution by 80/20.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.870
Phil: That’s right Andrew, we went from
clutter with bolts, nuts, and cans lying around,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.600
to a nice clean application that has everything
in arm’s reach, and looks great.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.440
Andrew: It certainly does.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.930
