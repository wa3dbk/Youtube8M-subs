00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.840
Hey, guys!

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.110
Jeff Cavaliere from athleanx.com.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.940
Standing next to me once again is Adam Jarvis.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.440
You probably have seen Adam already on the
athleanx.com website, his unbelievable transformation

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.900
in just 90 days from partying rockstar to
pretty much a ripped specimen here, following

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.070
the 90 day program.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.580
Now the first thing you notice is that obviously
he's still keeping up the program and staying

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.440
in shape, which is great cause I want you
guys not to just follow this for 90 days,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.149
but to make it a lifestyle change.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.230
Secondly, Adam has some pretty neat things.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.979
He had a pretty messed up shoulder, he had
a 2 to 3 inch shoulder surgery.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.990
Adam, tell me a little bit about why this
program seemed to work for you and what made

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.290
you kinda get into it.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.670
&gt;&gt; Adam: Looking at not being able to workout
properly because of my shoulder surgery...

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.290
&gt;&gt; Jeff: What did you have done?

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.830
&gt;&gt; Adam: I had my supraspinatous torn off
my shoulder, and my rotator cuff totally rebuilt.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.510
Looking at your profile, as you are a physical
therapist, which I had to go see for a while

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.899
after my surgeries, I knew that I would get
a workout that would build up my shoulder

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.899
and be able to build more muscle mass as I
progress.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.780
With other programs I was unable to build
any muscle mass, plus the programs, due to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.840
my poor shoulders, I was unable to do them.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.649
&gt;&gt; Jeff: You were following P90X, weren't
you?

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:03.649
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yes.

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.249
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Did you have some problems with some
of the exercises there?

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.239
&gt;&gt; Adam: I could not do a lot of the exercises
because of my shoulder.

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.190
&gt;&gt; Jeff: But this workout, the athLEAN-X workout,
you're able to do everything?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.190
&gt;&gt; Adam: Yes.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.030
&gt;&gt; Jeff: I mean, you have to be a little bit
surprised yourself about the amount of the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.200
muscle mass that you've put on, because again,
all it takes is one look at his picture before

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.700
to realize that he wasn't in great shape,
but now he looks fantastic.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.240
But what we're gonna do is now we're gonna
add a little component to your upper body

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.000
training that you may not have been doing.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.110
It's my "Upper body cross training", sort
of like let's see how agile you are from an

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.110
upper body stand point.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.920
Everybody always talks about how they can
be agile with their feet, but again you wanna

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.940
look like an athlete, you gotta train like
an athlete.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.239
So let's get down, come out on the ground
here, I wanna put you through a quick circuit.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.520
You're gonna shuffle to your left over there,
perform 5 push-ups.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.220
1, 2 nice and quick, 3, 4, 5, shuffle back.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.500
Good, there you go.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.299
1,2,3,4,5, go back the other side.

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.239
You go 4 rounds of 5 here, guys.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.510
[pause]
&gt;&gt; Jeff: OK, go back one more time.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.830
Good, 5.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.159
OK, now bring yourself into the center, right
in the center of the floor.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.239
What we're gonna do here is called the "clock
taps".

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.030
We're gonna hold a really tiny medicine ball
right here.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.219
Now imagine...sink back a little bit, come
back, you can rest for a second.

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:33.810
From this plank position, you've got this
clock right here: 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 2

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.849
o'clock, 3 o'clock and you've got 11 o'clock,
10 o'clock and 9 o'clock over there.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.750
Now if I call out numbers, you're gonna touch...if
it's 12, you've gotta touch with both hands.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.890
Right hand touch, left hand touch.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.819
If it's 3 o'clock, you're gonna reach with
your right hand out to the side for 3 o'clock

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.819
over here, ok?

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.560
Now for the guys at home, you can make up
your own patterns, with the point here is

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.099
you're going for upper body agility, quickness
and stability.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.040
For this guy with his shoulder, these are
excellent exercises.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.510
Alright, get yourself up into a plank, engage
your core, grab the ball with your right hand,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.159
let's go 12 o'clock nice and quick.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.150
Good, 3 o'clock.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.480
9 o'clock.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.810
2 o'clock.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.139
12 o'clock.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.470
11 o'clock.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.459
9 and 3.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.790
That's it.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.780
3 and 9.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.770
2 and 10.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.000
Good guy, we've got a smart guy here.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.510
12.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.590
Last one, 3-9.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.050
Ok, that's good.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.050
Now bring it down.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.800
So you do a little pattern here, you kinda
keep it about 30 seconds of switches in there.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.110
Now we're gonna do what we call the "staggered
push-ups".

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.289
10 seconds of these, I know it's your first
time through this circuit.

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.500
If I wanted to, I would increase this to like
20-30 seconds.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.800
Staggered push-ups are with your hands staggered,
jump, you know...explosive ply push-up into

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.250
your other switch position.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.250
Alright.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.940
One down, up and switch.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.840
That's it.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840
5,6,7,8,9,10.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.690
Good work.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.979
Now last one, you're gonna stand down there,
side plain switches.

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.630
You're gonna work your core, you're gonna
work the side of your pillar strength.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.759
I'd like to do these fairly quickly, so 8
each, alright?

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.970
You're gonna stay there, then rapidly switch
up to you right side.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.610
Now down and switch to the left.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.001
Good, keep that core up, engage, pull up hard,
that's it.

00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:31.001
All the way around, there you go!

00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:32.001
Good.

00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:33.001
8 each.

00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:34.001
Come on, up!

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.001
Pull yourself.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.001
Come on, hold this up.

00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:37.001
When it gets hard, this is the time when you
have to dig in.

00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.001
That's it.

00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:40.900
[pause]
&gt;&gt; Jeff: I lost count.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.930
What have you got?

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.970
&gt;&gt; Adam: I don't know.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.520
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Alright, go one more each.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.039
Alright, cool.

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.039
That's it.

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.690
Now one real quick hard-hitting circuit for
your upper body, but not static stuff, but

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.490
stuff we are actually moving around, getting
a little bit more agile, work your muscles

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.640
obviously, so it's a strength and conditioning
circuit and really just combining that to

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.169
being more agile, athletic.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.960
We want that athlete's body, so that's what
you're going for, that's what you've got right

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.790
now, that's what you wanna do to keep it.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:24.580
Guys at home, if you haven't already, if this
guy doesn't inspire you enough, go to athleanx.com,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.080
get your copy of the new athLEAN-X breakthrough
new training system.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.500
As you can see, a lot of this stuff can be
done at home.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.160
There's two versions, there's a strip down
version, where every single thing can be done

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.120
in a little space like this or you can get
the complete version.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.099
They both come complete with the purchase
of the program.

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:50.389
You can print it out, grab it and go, take
it to the gym and follow these exercises.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.490
Adam, you're an inspiration for a lot of guys
out there.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.570
Keep up the good work, we'll have you back
here again soon.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.570
&gt;&gt; Adam: Absolutely.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.570
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Alright.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.740
And take it easy, man.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.139
Guys, take it easy.
