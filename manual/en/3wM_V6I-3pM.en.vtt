00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:09.641
Canada is home to an endless array of winter destinations and activities.

00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:13.124

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:18.418
From dog sledding to powder shredding and everything in between we've got it covered.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.619
With Doc Pow as your guide rest assured that any snow seeking mission will be fulfilled.

00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:33.762
Welcome to Snowseekers T.V.  I am your host Doc Pow. Whether it is through our efforts online at Snowseekers.ca through our video efforts or

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:41.192
through our new mobile applications with iphone. Snowseekers works to bring you the best options to maximize your next winter vacation. 

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:45.055
Welcome to Castle Mountain Resort in the great Canadian Rockies.

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:51.223
Tucked away in the southwest corner of Alberta. Castle Mountain allows you to chart your path to a powder filled heaven.

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:57.591
Home to an uncrowded and action packed atmosphere, Castle plays host to adventures that will satisfy any snow seeker.

00:00:57.846 --> 00:01:00.846
Located along the continental divide and its collection of the highest mountains in North America

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:08.220
means any precipitation just happens to hang over this destination, translating into a wealth of white gold.

00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:14.241
Featuring Alberta's only drive-to on mountain accommodation, Castle makes for a convenient getaway.

00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:21.393
Hey dude. Hey Wassup. How's it going?
Good
Nice Doc Pow
Davis Clament

00:01:23.543 --> 00:01:29.350
Hey Davis. What's shakin. 
Nothing much.
Hey now you are going to take me for a tour today, no.
Yep

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.459
This place you call home, how lucky are you?  You been rocking this place for how long?
Almost eleven years

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:39.456
For somebody that has never been here before, how do you describe it. Why does somebody need to come here

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:49.412
Uhh, there is great terrain I guess. A lot of people love it and it is not quite a popular place yet, so everybody gets always fresh tracks. It's top.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
Oh yeah, I am pretty stoked to get out here and check it with you man. I think we should go hit it. Let's do it.

00:01:56.936 --> 00:02:02.252
We’ve got some fantastic terrain, we have terrain for everybody in the whole family to have some fun and be comfortable here.

00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:09.563
We still got an infamous long, continuous fall line stuff in the south shoots and on the big mountain.

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:15.419
They can also, hopefully expect to get a good powder day here as well to so it's terrain powder

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
and then we also try to be pretty  friendly and have a laid back atmosphere here as well. 

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:28.382
It's awesome terrain with a lot of different features in it. A lot of tree runs and groomers if you want.

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:37.013
It's really good to go down through the tree and just rip down and build some features out of them.

00:02:56.425 --> 00:03:01.719
From the downhill slopes of Castle, you might also want to explore this area by snowmobile.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.486
We've been joined by my buddy Al.
Tell us a little more about what awaits those that want to take to the machines.

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:14.630
Just about anything you can imagine on a snowmobile, there is terrain here that will challenge just about everybody and trails to ride from here to Fernie.

00:03:15.048 --> 00:03:20.295
up into the Crowsnest Pass and north of there. You can go to the border, you can north of Waterton.

00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:27.726
It's a very vast area that you can ride. The traffic is up also in the ski hill as well as in the backcountry here.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.608
It's a super area to come and explore.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:39.720
Part of any healthy snow seeking diet is, of course, you have got to keep yourself fueled. Here at Castle there are a lot of great signature spots that will just do exactly that.

00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:43.032
There is the T-bar Pub, and then as well there is the Barnaby Steakhouse.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:48.495
We have been joined by our good buddy Andrew. Tell us a little more about what is going on behind these doors.

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:56.658
The Barnaby Steakhouse we built it just a couple of years ago. This past summer we did a little bit of renovations to the place, we changed the menu a little bit,

00:03:56.658 --> 00:04:03.041
a little more western theme to it, and we have live entertainment here every Saturday, so there will be an après set and usually have a couple of sets in the evening too.

00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.041
It's getting to be a real hot spot to be at.

00:04:07.107 --> 00:04:11.704
You guys are about to take it up another notch. There is a whole new adventure that is coming to Castle.

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:18.902
We have been planning this for a while but we are going to launch it January 28th. We are getting Alberta's only cat skiing operation ...

00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:27.587
and one of the few resort based operations in western Canada. It's going to make it more accessible to everyone to go out there.

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:34.074
You've got to have a great place to stay to fuel up for these adventures, and Darryl you have put in a lot of the accommodations here at Castle, no?

00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:45.838
Uh, yes. We built this hotel here several years ago, so we have rents reasonably priced here at the hotel

00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:53.593
with larger units where people stay in condos. Large up to sixteen people per unit down to two.

00:04:53.593 --> 00:05:01.023
Fits two three families one family or a couple but each year we are getting more and more units on hill.

00:05:01.023 --> 00:05:09.661
