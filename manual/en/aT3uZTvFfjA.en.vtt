00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.900
Sometimes when thinking about space we just
use the word star in general and we just think of

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.880
stars, but there are many different types
of stars.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.700
We're going to take a look at some of those.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.800
One is the main sequence star.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.660
Most stars are a main sequence stars, and
so the majority of stars are main sequence

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.680
star so that's just your normal star.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.000
You may not know that the sun is actually
a star, it just happens to be very close to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.860
Earth so it provides us with heat.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:45.600
The sun is a main sequence star and then we
have red supergiants, that's another type.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.160
A star that you're familiar with that's a
red supergiant is Betelgeuse.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.080
(Which isn't really spelled like you think
Betelgeuse would be spelled,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.220
but it has the same pronunciation.)

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.760
To give you an idea of how big these types
of stars are, I'm going to kind of provide an analogy.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.380
Some other types of stars I didnâ€™t get to
are the White Dwarf and the Red Dwarf.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.220
Right here I have sun, which is an example
it's kind of representing main sequence stars

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.230
in general.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.220
If the sun were the size of a dime, then Betelgeuse
would be about three meters short of being

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.330
the size of a football field including both
end zones.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.110
Since it's only three meters off, we'll say
it's the size of a football field.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:39.930
Now, White Dwarf would be the size of a small
bacterium, and Red Dwarf would be about the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.430
size of a sesame seed.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.160
I can kind of just number these in order right
here.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.980
Football fields obviously the largest, then
we go to the dime, then the sesame seed, and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.980
then the small bacterium.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.280
You've got an idea of the relative size here.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.940
A sun and a white dwarf, or excuse me, the
sun and the Red Dwarf are somewhat similar

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.880
in size but the small bacterium is extremely
small, and then a football field is extremely

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.040
huge even compared to a dime.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.980
To kind of attach some actual number of figures
to this, the sun is about 1.4 million kilometers

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.980
in diameter.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.799
Then Betelgeuse is about 825 million kilometers
in diameter, located about 640 light years

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:28.799
from the sun.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.659
In fact if Betelgeuse were located in the
same place as the sun it would extend past

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.800
the orbit of Jupiter.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.640
If you think about where the sun is and then
you think about the other planets and you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.870
know Jupiter is, Betelgeuse would take up
all of this area.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.019
That's how large it is, it's huge really.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.610
Now, the largest known star, which is the
hybrid giant VY Canis Majoris, is over three

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.579
billion kilometers in dynam- diameter.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.920
Remember earlier I said the sun is 1.4 kilometers
in diameter, well VY Canis Majoris over 3

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.670
billion -with a b- kilometers in diameter
and is located about 4900 light years from

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.670
Earth.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.900
Now, most red giants are considerably smaller
than Betelgeuse or VY Canis Majoris but are

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.440
still 25 to 50 times the diameter of the sun.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.639
You think about the sun being really huge
to provide all that heat to the earth, but

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.200
really the sun is extremely small when compared
to most stars.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.540
Or maybe not most stars because main sequence
stars are a large kind of star, but the sun

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.650
is extremely small when we compare it to other
stars that are out there.
