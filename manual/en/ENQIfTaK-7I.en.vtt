Hey, what's up guys?

It's Jacob.

post-apocalyptic beat down,

00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:09.118

-Hmm.

Something classical.

JACOB SOBOROFF: This
is the brand new,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.304
live action trailer
for "Destiny,"

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:33.970
one of the most highly
anticipated video

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.095
games of the whole year.
"Destiny" cost around $500

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.730
million to make, earning it
the title of the most expensive

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.550
video game in history.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.390
Took over six years to develop,
and today it finally arrives.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.030
The story centers
around a small team

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.880
of humans on an
interstellar road trip

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.990
to take back our solar
system from hostile aliens.

JACOB SOBOROFF: "Destiny"
comes from the same people

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.280
that brought us "Halo."

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490
And it features the voice of
everybody's favorite Lannister,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.340
Peter Dinklage.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.220

LIZZIE: The female body's
ability to produce a baby

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.650
was already pretty bad ass,
but now I just found out

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.380
that while preggers, we can
also regenerate our own organs.

The latest from "Life
Noggin" explores

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.220
all the crazy superpowers that
humans are actually born with.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.780
-When a pregnant woman suffers
organ damage, such as a heart

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780
attack, the fetus
sends over stem cells

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.570
to the damaged organ
to help repair it.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.540
The same thing holds
true for other organs,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.244
including the brain,
lung, and liver.

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:40.160
LIZZIE: "Life Noggin"
is a super- new addition

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.549
to Discovery's TestTube Network.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.590
The channel animates
everything from pop culture,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.672
to history, to art.

00:01:44.672 --> 00:01:46.380

videos every Monday.

how to lift cars off people.

JACOB SOBOROFF: The massive
celebrity nude photo

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.590
leak last week and the Ray Rice
domestic abuse video yesterday

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.511
have been all over the
news, and some people

00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.760
have been blaming the victims.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.010
Thankfully, Laci Green
just released this reaction

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.240
to the victim blaming
phenomenon and as always,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.865
offered an incredibly
smart reaction.

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:07.364
LACI GREEN: This is how bizarre
victim blaming sounds to me.

00:02:07.364 --> 00:02:08.600
Your identity was stolen?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.845
Why were you using
a credit card?

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:12.737
OK, enough bad acting.

00:02:12.737 --> 00:02:13.570
Do you get my drift?

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.030
The problem with
blaming the victim

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.310
is that it's the predator
that caused the crime.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.727
Crimes happen when perpetrators
choose to violate someone.

Laci's built the largest
sex-ed channel on the platform.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.050
You should head on
over to her channel

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.227
because she leads important
discussions and answers

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:29.560
questions that a lot of people
have a tough time talking

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.850
about.

better than being in love,

love with someone who

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.880
