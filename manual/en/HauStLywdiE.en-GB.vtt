00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.420
The OMEGA Seamaster Bullhead

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.010
To meet a long-standing request from Seamaster
Bullhead enthusiasts, OMEGA has reissued a

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.330
limited-edition version of the iconic chronograph.
While the new model, with its characteristic

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.820
symmetrical case and bezel, has all of the
charm of the original, there are some modifications

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:32.399
that give the new Bullhead its own personality.
With a case and dial configuration unlike

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.590
any other OMEGA; the original 1969 Seamaster
Bullhead that inspired this wristwatch is

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.000
among the rarest, most collectable and most
recognizable chronographs ever produced and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.900
the new model gives aficionados a chance to
own an instant classic.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.260
The Bullhead's shield-shaped brushed and polished
case, the inner revolving bezel and the unusual

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.510
placement of its chronograph pushers and crowns
had made it a favourite among watch aficionados.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.940
Its winding crown at 12 o'clock was flanked
by two chronograph pushers and it was this

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.740
unique configuration that gave the watch its
nickname. There was also another crown at

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.640
the 6 o'clock position that controlled the
internal rotating bezel.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.600
The pushers on the new Seamaster Bullhead
are still mounted at the top, of course, but

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.780
the round pushers on the original watch have
been replaced with flat ones. Perhaps the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.159
most significant change has been in the movement.
The new Bullhead is powered by an automatic

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.520
Co-Axial calibre 3113, which replaces the
manually-wound calibre 930 found in the vintage

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.950
model. The movement is equipped with a column-wheel
chronograph mechanism.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.630
The new Bullhead's dial design captures the
strength of the original, with its distinctive

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.581
inner bezel and the sub-dials at 12 and 6
o'clock. As with the original Bullhead, there

00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:52.409
is a date window at 3 o'clock. The white dial
is visible through a sapphire crystal with

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.080
anti-reflective treatment on both sides. The
screw-in caseback is stamped with the familiar

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.490
polished Seamaster Seahorse. Its white bi-directional
rotating inner bezel has a 24-hour scale.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.590
Its day/night display with white numerals
contrasted against blue and black backgrounds.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.700
The striking timepiece is presented on a brown
leather strap. The chronograph is water resistant

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.990
to 15 bar (150 metres / 500 feet) and has
been produced in an edition limited to 669

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.810
pieces. The OMEGA Seamaster Bullhead has a
full three-year warranty.
