Hi I'm Travis Corpening, and we're going to
have a little fun here at Carolina Beach Recreation

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.009
Center. I'm going to try to teach you how
to dunk like Michael Jordan. First of all

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.619
depending on whether you are a two footer
jumper or a one footer jumper, Mike had the

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.749
option in the legacy he left he jumped off
either one whenever he needed to. So let's

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:32.960
show the two handed the dunk off of two feet.
One thing that Mike always use to do is if

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.010
you really want to ham it up and really be
like Mike, you can stick that tongue out before

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.090
you take off, because that always showed that
he was really concentrating. But as far as

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.199
actually making the dunk, what you want to
do is when you're jumping off of two legs

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.410
what you want to do is you want to take off
somewhere close to the basket. Because it's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.219
a lot harder to actually take off from a distance
jumping off of two feet, that's really hard.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:07.440
So what you want to do is you want to take
off really close to the basket, and you plant,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.620
if you're right handed you plant with the
left leg first, then come through follow through

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.330
with the right leg, and take off after you
plant and once you rise, one thing Michael

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.070
Jordan use to do is a tomahawk dunk. He use
to bring it back here and tap his numbers.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.750
That's what the call it tapping his numbers,
the numbers on the back of his jersey. And

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.710
then he would bring it down with authority
once he got above the rim. Now something else

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.600
Mike use to do off the one handed dunk is
Mike use to love to lean. If you watch some

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.670
of his old dunk contest, Michael Jordan would
lean into the basket. And the way you do that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.100
is that's got to be pretty much it got to
be off of one leg, but if you got the talent

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.640
you can do it off of two. And you come in
from the side, and once you take off you plant

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.750
and you turn your body at an angle to the
basket. So your shoulder is actually pointing

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.530
to the basket, and you want to lean. You lean
into the basket with your shoulder, and your

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.000
upper body, and once the ball, you've got
the ball above the rim, then you can bring

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.859
it down with authority. There you have it
dunking like Michael Jordan.
