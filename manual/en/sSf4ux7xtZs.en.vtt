00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.060

This is the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.360
Iron Man Edition.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.400
These are incredibly limited and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.160
pretty expensive right now biatch

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.760
'cause there's not many of them out there, so

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.920
they're pretty much only on eBay now,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.040
for WAY too much money.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.140
But,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.200
since I'm always bringin' you guys

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.280

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.440
right here!

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.820
So, it starts with the packaging,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.320
as you can tell.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.320
You have this red finish

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.260
with the gold, Iron-Man mask

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.120
or helmet.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.340
In the corner, here, you can see:

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.120
"MARVEL: AVENGERS: Age of Ultron

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.400
in cinemas now".

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.000
You have the LTE-A3 band,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.140
64-bit octa-core processor,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.460
Quad HD display,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.400
16-megapixel camera,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.920
64 gigs of memory.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.240
This also comes with

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.400
a clear cover

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400
and a wireless charger included.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.180
So let's go ahead and open it up.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.180
Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.540
Would you look at that, already?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.180
Very special.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.760
Black on the inside, here.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.340
What is this?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.260
*knocks*

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.920
Look at that.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.420
Solid.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.220
Oh, my goodness.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.540
So, the S6 Egde, over here.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.760
In this beautiful gold

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.140
and red.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.160
The Iron-Man logo on the back.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.760
And over here,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.760
is the wireless charger.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.320
'Little USB connector.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.320
Now this box is no joke.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.220
This is, like

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.220
velour foam.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.040
Never seen

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.460
velour foam before.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.380
And a little badge.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.800
"We are greater than I."

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.820
Woah!

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.980
How 'bout the deep

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.560
statement there

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.140
from Marvel and Samsung.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.280
That's like us!

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.360
"We are greater than I."

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.640
As a group.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.660
Whaddya think Jack?

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.360
Next up,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.400
there's a little, clear case included.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.380
Along with the gold trim,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.680
if you wanna use it.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.180
(Just like that.)

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.580
We have a SIM tool.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.720
And this box here, we have our power brick.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.840
And last up,

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.520
'have some headphones.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.460
The same as the standard S6

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
or S6 Edge.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.540
How 'bout the unboxing experience here though?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.560
This is the stuff that unboxers' dreams are made of.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.000
What a great way to keep all of your

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.500
accessories together.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.440
Look at that...

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.080
It's like when you open up a box

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.940
for a fine

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.320
scotch,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.060
or,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.100
uhh

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.620
*Snaps*

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.840
cognac.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.440
A fine cognac!

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.780
But even when the bottle is empty, you put it back in there,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.580
you hold on to it.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.840
(Which way am I going to peel this off)

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.220
*Peels off plastic*

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.140
Just like that.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.200
Now I do have a regular

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.680
S6 Edge here

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.800
for comparison.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.060
There's the standard S6 Edge versus

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.060
the Iron Man edition.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.600
The limited edition badge down here,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.340
which identifies this as number five-hundred and thirty-four.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.440
And also,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.820
the specialized wireless charger,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.100
where you just drop the device on there like that.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.520
And booyah, your charging.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.780
Now the case, it has an even

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.560
glossier looking gold finish on it.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.920
*Blows*

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.620
*Peels off screen protector*

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240
*Plastic Shaking*

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.340
Okay, so now we're booted up, and as you can see,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.140
'completely customized theme.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.940
You have a customized clock,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.500
these buttons down here,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.700
as well as the background. Obviously?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.740
"Avengers: Age of Ultron in theaters now".

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.500
Look at this!

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.500
Your apps,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.320
's all themed up,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.880
Iron Man style.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.080
Yeah, so, here you can see the Iron Man limited edition theme is installed.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.900
'Course, you can switch

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.820
to other themes if you like—

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.240
why would you spend all the money on the Iron Man edition

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.220
and then use a regular theme?

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.720
(I dunno)

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.880
But, here you can see:

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.940
the home screen, the lock screen,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.200
the diallier, contacts, and messages, ofcourse.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.080
I wanna see that dialler real quick.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.060
Look a' that.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.460
Look a' that!

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.340
Feel like Iron Man making a phone ca—

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.340
does Iron Man make phone calls?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.980
(doesn't matter)

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.620
Anyway, so there you have it, the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.380
Iron Man edition S6 Edge.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.780
Very cool.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.560
Limited edition, obviously not a lot of these out there.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.120
And, the exciting part about this video is

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.000
I'm not gonna keep this.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.880
Actually, I'm gonna give this away to one luck viewer,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.240
'cause that's just how we do it!

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.860
But, it's even more special than that.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.380
It's a collaborative giveaway—

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.300
a three way, if you will.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.140
Myself, Marques, from MKBHD, and John, From TLD, today

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.100
are all combining forces.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.360
Like the Avengers, sort of.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.380
(Like how they combine forces.)

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.380
Well, anyway, the three of us are gonna giving away three separate devices,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.980
three separate Iron man phones

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.820
and they've all got videos on their channels right now, with the phone featured.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.860
So, all you need to do is head over there, subscribe to their channels,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.660

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.760
in order to increase your chances at winning.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.880

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.860

limited edition, Galaxy S6 Edge Iron Man version.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.540
This is number five-three-four, as I mentioned before.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.200
Very exciting unboxing experience, as you can tell.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.360
And a very unique look.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.160

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.740
(Man, it's always the case isn't it)
