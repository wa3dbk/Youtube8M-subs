00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.540
you probably heard in the past that
there are a number of countries in

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.710
Africa and that are there not
particularly tolerant are welcoming up

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.820
homosexuals gambia is one of them

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.410
their president ya hear jamais is
perhaps one of the most

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.710
anti-gay individuals on earth right now
and he was speaking recently about gays

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.680
who have been trying to get some sort of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.789
political exile because the persecution
they face in Gambia

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.400
by going to countries like the UK and he
has some quotes about that

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.260
he says some people go to the Westin
claim they are gays and that their lives

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.820
are at risk in The Gambia

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.360
in order for them to be granted a stay
in Europe if I catch them

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.040
I will kill them they claim their lives
are at risk

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.760
I'm gonna kill them it seems like their
lives might actually be a trend that

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.840
suggests that maybe there's some risk at
it there's something to it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.700
but now he is talks about how the
British began conducting tests on

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.030
travelers from damage

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.719
to confirm their sexual orientation
which is not literally true apparently

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.960
according to

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.149
that BBC in the past the past year so

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.289
they have sometimes asked for evidence
ok persecution but my either physical or

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.559
legal persecution

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.250
and but he says in extreme cases
claimant had handed over photographic

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.080
and video evidence of highly personal
sexual activity

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.600
an effort to persuade officials that's
according to the Home Affairs Committee

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.119
and now really fast here some other
things he said because he has a history

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:19.770
going back

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.200
a number of years I've the worst
anti-gays statement I've ever heard my

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.580
life

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.320
LGBT actually stands for leprosy
gonorrhea bacteria and tuberculosis

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.909
just for the record that's not true yeah
I looked it up it now it's not according

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:32.520
to Wikipedia

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.900
we will fight these vermin called
homosexuals are gay is the same way we

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.250
are fighting malaria causing mosquitoes

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.520
if not more aggressively and fight the
mosquitoes worse

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.700
they're they're killing many people in
your comment those who promote

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.020
homosexuality what happened and the
human existence it is becoming an

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.700
epidemic

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.740
and we Muslims and Africans will fight
to end this behavior

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.049
he also at one point had said that any
homosexual e find fuel cut off their

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:56.729
head

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.829
and then he will burn down ins and
motels that allow them to stay there

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.869
that means he takes it very personally
you know

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.729
a we just it earlier in the show we
found out that the airport in Ghazi is

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.410
close so I can travel there

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.270
I'm not I think I'm I don't wanna go to
the Gambia I don't think they'll

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.480
now I I had a little girl is spreading
across going up now perhaps if they can

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.170
get you ready to be out by Jim and I

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.030
planes a little bit culturally I might
consider it important thing to take it

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.060
to take note of my life final point on
this when we talk about

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.319
this I extremely violently homophobic
rhetoric and behavior in Africa

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.420
this is not something culturally that
has existed back through the last few

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.340
thousand years

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.410
according to human rights and gay rights
campaigner

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.470
prior to Western colonization there are
no records have any African laws against

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.550
homosexuality

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.040
the real important Africa was not
homosexuality

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.180
but homophobia referring to Western and
in many cases

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.269
American evangelical leaders who have
been traveling to Africa

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.470
to promote these these anti-gay laws
including the death penalty for

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.200
homosexuals

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.470
a modern Christianity for you in a lot
of ways
