00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.860
Compact SUVs seem to be the latest trend in
car design.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.980
They make sense, you get a lot of the benefits
of a supermini yet bags more practicality!

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.800
This is the Renault Captur, which is essentially
a larger Clio - and that went down well in

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.279
the CarBuyer office aside from a few tiny
complaints.

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.169
The Captur has an increased ride height and
is slightly longer than the Clio yet features

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.480
the same attractive styling features including
the slimming side glossy detailing and a different

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.809
bumper design incorporating daytime running
LEDs.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.989
Those larger dimensions also mean extra practicality
as I promised at the beginning.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.840
The boot is not only bigger than the Clio,
it's also slightly larger than in the Peugeot

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.310
2008 crossover, which is handy if you have
lots of shopping bags or luggage.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:15.640
You can fold the seats on a 60:40 split or
with the seats up the entire 2nd row can be

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.460
moved with this handle to give more room in
this already large boot.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.670
Although this will impact on passenger space,
not an issue for 5 foot 4 and a half me, but

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.210
6 footers might have something to say about
it.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:43.549
Move the seats back individually and regain
your leg room, head room is very good as well.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.640
While we're on the subject of seats, there
is so much adjustment in the driver's seat

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.890
and steering wheel that no matter whether
you are really tall or really not tall you

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.560
will find a comfortable driving position,
we are not ready for that just yet though,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.500
que pan of dash so I can talk to you about
spec!

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.310
The same smart dash that appears in the Clio
is also found in the Captur and spec is very

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.310
generous.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.550
Even the entry-level model comes with electric
windows, cruise control, hill start assist

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.950
and 16" alloy wheels.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.519
But before we drive off, let me show you some
of the Captur's clever storage...

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:44.620
It's a very easy car to drive because visibility
is good and the increased ride height gives

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.230
a more commanding view of the road so you
can work your way through traffic without

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.760
any dramas.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.440
This is aided further by the light pedals
and slick gearbox.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.720
Engine choice is between two petrols and one
diesel, however the most economical is the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.000
1.5-litre diesel which returns an impressive
76 miles to the gallon and emits less than

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.820
100 g/km of CO2.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.260
All cars come with an Eco button on the dashboard,
too, which limits engine power and improves

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.610
fuel economy by 10% - very handy for driving
around town.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.930
Sadly that brings me on to its negative points!

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.080
One of the reasons it is so good on fuel is
because it only comes in 2 wheel drive.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.959
So it's a bit of a cheat to call it a compact
SUV really, 4 wheel drive would increase its

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.560
capabilities and keep it line with its competition
- like the Nissan Juke and Vauxhall Mokka.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:50.560
It's also not that much fun to drive and it
is quite a bit more expensive than the Clio.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.732
However it is still one of the best-value
options in its class and comes with loads

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:56.030
of equipment as standard.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.579
What's more, the low running costs and decent
practicality all help to be a serious contender

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.779
in the compact SUV market.
