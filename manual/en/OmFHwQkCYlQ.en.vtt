00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.660
Hey everybody, it's me, Ben.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.860
So today's question is, how
do satellites orbit the earth.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.950
You'll see, we're
using this prop globe

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.120
that we use for everything.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.640
But let's pretend there's
a satellite around it.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.520
Satellites are, to some degree,
mysterious objects, right?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.710
Orbital mechanics can
also be mysterious,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.750
because there's
no easy way for us

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.880
to experience orbital
mechanics personally.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.990
However, with a little
bit of imagination,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.160
we can understand the idea
behind orbital mechanics

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.210
very easily.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.840
So imagine what happens
if you throw a ball--

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.190
[CRASHING]

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.020
--and it goes 100 feet or so
and then it hits the ground.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.390
That ball was actually orbiting.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.380
It's just that the ball's orbit
is very, very, very short.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.880
So let's say the
ball doesn't do it.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.170
And you're like, Ben,
I've got this rifle.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.180
I'm going to shoot that.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.900
So you grab a
rifle, you shoot it,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.800
and you fire it
straight and level.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.690
A bullet might travel a mile
before succumbing to gravity

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.911
and hitting the ground.

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.660
So let's imagine another
thing, all right.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.150
And we're just imagining stuff.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.395
Let's say you had a very
large, powerful cannon,

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:10.670
and it's able to give
it's shell an extremely

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.140
high initial velocity.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.375
So you're shooting this
cannon straight and level,

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:17.920
and the shell's going to
go many miles-- far enough

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.640
to actually follow the curve of
the earth for a period of time

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.220
before it hits the ground.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.020
So one thing that gums up these
examples is air resistance.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.880
Imagine if we took
this powerful cannon

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.510
to the moon, because
where else would we

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.090
take our imaginary
cannon, and we mounted it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.220
on top of the biggest
moon mountain.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.530
Well, the moon has
no real atmosphere.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.050
It's completely surrounded
by the vacuum of space.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.550
If we adjust the speed of
this cannon shell just right

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.580
and shoot it perfectly,
then the shell

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.040
would follow the curve
of the moon exactly.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.950
It would fall at
exactly the same rate

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.980
that the curve of the
moon falls away from it.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.230
So it would keep falling,
but it would never

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.490
actually hit the ground.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.125
In fact, eventually, it would
curve all the way around

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.840
and, boom, ram right back
into the back of the cannon.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.820
Now on the moon,
you can actually

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.130
have satellites in extremely
low orbit like that--

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.930
just a few miles off the
ground to avoid the mountains.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.620
On Earth though,
it's not so easy,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.020
because satellites have to
get above the atmosphere

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.300
and into the vacuum of space to
orbit for any length of time.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.540
So 200 miles up is
about the minimum

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.820
that we'll need to avoid
atmospheric interference.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.200
Let's take the Hubble
Space Telescope, right?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.250
That's a popular one.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.310
The Hubble Space
Telescope orbits

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.460
at an altitude of
about 380 miles.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.130
But the principle here
is exactly the same.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.320
The speed of the
satellite is adjusted

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.440
so that it falls to Earth
at exactly the same rate

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.450
that the curve of the earth
falls away from the satellite.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.395
To put it in the most
simplistic terms,

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:53.640
it is perpetually falling.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.040
It's just never managing
to hit the ground.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.520
Thank you so much for watching.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.080
We appreciate it.
