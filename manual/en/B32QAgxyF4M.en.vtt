Hi we’re Nick and Valerie Wisniewski on
behalf of Expert Village.com. We would like

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.540
to show you some American mink tracks and
how to identify them in the field and for

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.640
more information, you can check our website
at www.walnuthilltracking.com. We’ve got

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.739
a plaster cast here of some mink tracks. These
2 foot prints are actually 4 feet landing

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.930
in the same 2 places. The mink like other
members of the weasel family has 5 toes on

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.379
the front foot and 5 toes on the back foot.
Its foot is very hairy which often times obscures

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.100
the finer details of the tracks. Like other
weasels the claws are well developed for catching

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.210
and holding prey and those will often times
register in their track as well. We would

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.510
like to show you one of the most common patterns
that the mink makes when it is moving around

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.120
the landscape. The mink like other weasels
can move in a variety of ways and it can walk

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.680
around a landscape and it could bound in 3’s
and 4’s but most commonly the mink likes

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.500
to travel in what we call 2-2 bounds where
all 4 of the feet actually land in almost

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.220
exact same spot as 2 feet. So you will have
a front hitting the ground and then a hind

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.320
hind hitting the exact same place. The mink
when traveling in 2’s is very very consistent

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.470
and that is one of the features you look for
to identify mink as opposed to some other

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:48.570
weasel; a smaller or larger weasel. When it
gets into a 2 bound it will travel a stride

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.680
anywhere from about 11 inches to up to 38
but once it gets into that bound, it will

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.450
be very consistent and that is what we’ve
tried to show you here. It’s about 20 to

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.340
21 inches in between each of these groups.
If it was a mink moving in a 2-2, it would

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.330
continue in that pattern very consistent even
bound for a long long distance.
