00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000
It can't be...It's impossible! 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I told you this impostor wouldn't stand a CHANCE against Vegeta!  

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Vegeta is INCREDIBLE! Where did he get this power from?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Damn it...

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Are you finished so soon? You don't even have any energy to STAND, much less fight

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Kakarot would have never been so foolish and reckless to use that attack in battle

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.000
No Instant Transmission for YOU...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Let GO, you bastard! 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Don't kill him! We still need to bring my father back!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
His last attack was just as powerful as a Spirit Bomb. He risked TOO MUCH 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
My body...how's it still able to stand up?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'll kill you, yet...

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Ready to talk? One more hit from me would certainly kill you, and DON'T THINK THAT I WOULDN'T DO IT

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.500
I'll tell you everything you want to know...

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.000
He did it!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.500
Yeah, it looks like they didn't need our help after all

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.500
Now go make me a coffee 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500
Sure

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.500
I have 2 sensu beans left, and if I can't destroy this fool, then at least I'll have the power to escape...

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500
I'll tell you...right after I eat these...

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Vegeta! If he recovers his strength, then he'll no doubt try to escape! 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
There is NO ESCAPE from the agony that awaits him...

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.000
Damn you, Vegeta! Your foolish pride may have just doomed us all!
