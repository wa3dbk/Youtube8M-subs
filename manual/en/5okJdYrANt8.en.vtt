00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.730
I was asked by one of my subscribers how to

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.240
measure chain wear using

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.330
a method other than using like the
little gauge.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.230
Now my personal preferences using like the little gauge. This one's is by Park Tool It's a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.630
CC-3. There's also a CC 3.2. Which is a little
longer.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.340
And it's so easy. You just put one in
there. You drop down. If it drops down...

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.199
the .75, that means it's a
three quarters of a percent of wear

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.899
if it drops down. And if you drop it down the other way

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.410
that means it's 1 percent of wear.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.030
In either case, if it drops down you
want to replace the chain.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.300
If the 1 percent drops down

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.930
then the chain is really worn then you probably want to replace

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.690
the freewheel and the chain rings.
But I am going to show you how to

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.860
measure chain wear with a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.730
ruler. They call it chain stretch
but the chain really doesn't stretch.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.840
What happens is the little rivets
or pins in the bushings that they're

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.549
inside

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.100
get worn. When their brand new you have
the bushing and you have the pin and it's a nice

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.280
tight fit.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.820
But as the pin gets worn, and the inside of the bushing gets worn
all of the sudden now it gets pulled up

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.720
against the edge.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.920
And so you have that in each of the little links

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.229
that the little pin is pulling to the one
side of a larger hole

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.770
and the chain just appears to get longer.
With a ruler

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.049
if I go ahead and put the beginning of
the ruler

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.070
right on the the center of a pin, every pin
should be

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.430
one half inch. So they should line up
all the way down to the 12 inch mark.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.350
So I line up the start of the ruler right
in the center of one of the pins over here

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.890
and then when it gets to the 12-inch
mark down there

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.200
you see it's right about the center on
the pin there.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.530
That's because this is a brand new chain so

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.469
there's no wear on it at all. Now let me go
ahead and show you a chain

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.380
this actually worn. So first I'll show you
with the gauge.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.560
Here's the gauge and I go down and then
that drops right in That's

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.920
the 1.0. That's one

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.950
percent wear and that just drops through right nice and easy. There's not even any

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.319
resistance down there and also you can
go in and

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.590
and check further links and see if
like that like that but they're

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.190
all...

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.360
This chain is just worn. Let me show you
with the ruler.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.599
So I line up the beginning the ruler
right to the center of the pin over here.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.510
Okay, so here's the other end of the ruler.
As you can see

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.230
the pin is well past the 12-inch mark.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.040
And what we're looking at is the center
of the pin

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.209
I'm if the center of the pin

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.269
is less than a sixteenth of an inch

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.360
past the 12 inch mark, then it's okay. Go ahead and continue using the chain.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.590
If it's a over a sixteenth of an inch

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.950
then you wanna go ahead to replace the chain.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.180
If it's over an eighth of an inch past

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.769
the 12 inch mark. And again we're
talking the center the pin,

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.430
then at that point the chain is
extremely worn and you're probably going want

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.879
to go ahead replace

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.900
the chain rings and the freewill. And
this chain here

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.450
is extremely worn, So I am probably going to 
have to replace everything.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.890
So anyway that's how you measure chain
wear

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.140
with a ruler. I hope this helps. Thanks!
