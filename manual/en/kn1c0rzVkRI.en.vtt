00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.400
[Intro music]

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.589
[Intro music]

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.780
[Intro music]

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.570
Assalaamu Alaikum and welcome to Titli's Busy
Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.110
If you do a little bit of research,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.400
you'll soon discover that nobody really knows

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.880
why Beef Wellington is called Beef Wellington.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.910
But one thing is clear.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.890
You will not gonna need these.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.480
Unless of course...

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.080
You want to wear them while you're making
it.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.539
Bit too kinky for me.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.530
To make my Beef Wellington, I've got a 1 kg
piece of steak.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.730
This happens to be topside and be warned.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.110
This recipe only works with a good quality
piece of beef.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.010
I've got 250 g of mushrooms, very finely chopped.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.900
These are chestnut mushrooms but any mushroom
will do.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.350
One onion finely chopped.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.140
A beaten egg.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.510
25 g of butter.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.369
Two tablespoons of chopped parsley.

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:01.890
This is flat leaf parsley.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.989
And one crushed clove of garlic.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.950
Some recipes call for the use of pâté

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.549
and I just think it makes it a bit rich.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.030
Instead, I like to serve the pâté as a starter
for Beef Wellington.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.800
I also need some puff pastry.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.250
This is ready-made puffy pastry.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.950
There's about 400 g and it's already rolled.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.970
Now I'll give you a choice because I'm good
like that.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.450
If you like your meats really rare,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.900
heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a pan,
really hot

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.500
and then sear the meat, all over, for about
2 minutes.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.210
Hmm...

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.930
Seared.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.470
Or if you're like me, you're not so keen on
red beef,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.720
you can do it the Gordon Ramsay way.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.659
You can pop the meat on a baking tray,

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.729
brush all over with olive oil

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.760
and pop it, in the oven, at 220 degrees Celsius
for about 30 minutes.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.740
And if it's good enough for Gordon Ramsay,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.729
it's good enough *bleep* for *bleep* *bleep*
me.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.890
You *bleep* *bleep* *bleep* *bleep* *bleep*
*bleep* *bleep*.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.170
And 30 minutes later, there we are.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.890
I've popped this on a plate and I'm gonna
leave it to cool for about half an hour

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.379
and then chill it in the fridge for another
half an hour.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.730
While the meat's cooling we'll make the stuffing

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.529
by melting the butter in a pan, adding in
the onions.

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:26.529
And sauté them gently for about 5 minutes
just to soften them.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.779
Once the onions have softened,

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.239
add in the garlic

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.480
and the mushrooms.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.739
Mix well.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.989
Cook this on a low heat for 15 to 20 minutes

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.260
to drive all the moisture out of the mushrooms.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.739
Once it's become all nice and soft,

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.540
you can turn off the heat, add in the parsley,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
season with a little bit of salt and pepper

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680
and mix well.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.400
Put the mixture into a bowl.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.469
Then pop it into the fridge to chill.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.139
Now that everything's chilled, I've opened
up my puff pastry

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.090
and I'm gonna put a layer of the stuffing
on one side.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.659
and I'm gonna put a layer of the stuffing
on one side.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.079
Make sure you leave a good inch margin all
the way around.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.309
I'm gonna pop on the beef

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.799
and then spoon on the rest of the stuffing.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.419
and then spoon on the rest of the stuffing.

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:30.389
My top tip here is to push the stuffing into
the pastry a little bit.

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.959
Then fold the pastry over the meat.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.069
Then fold the pastry over the meat.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.779
Push it all down. Push it together.

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.639
Now we'll try and make a nice

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.329
neat parcel effect.

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:44.889
Oops...

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.040
Stabbed it.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.689
Cutting away some of the excess pastry.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.930
Brush with beaten egg.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.529
Fold up.

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.040
Pinch the edges together.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.439
Make a good tight seam.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.689
Do the same down the other end.

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:12.139
Do the same down the other end.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:12.859
Right. I'm gonna...

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.059
...remove this off its paper.

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.260
...remove this off its paper.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.199
And pop it onto a baking tray.

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.449
And pop it onto a baking tray.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.770
Brush it very firmly, all over, with a beaten
egg.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.099
This will help to

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.639
get rid of any little

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.110
cracks and helps the seams to come together
better as well.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.330
We'll just make some...

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.870
We'll just make some...

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.759
...very, very shallow cuts in the pastry

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.940
so that we'll end up with a nice pattern.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.860
Now we'll chill this in the fridge for 30
minutes

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.650
and then bake at 200 degrees Celsius for a
further 30 minutes.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.639
There we are.

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.539
Nice, shiny Beef Wellington.

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.310
I'm gonna let this sit for 10 minutes before
I cut it open.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.050
Beef Wellington.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.889
Pink on the inside,

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.360
delicious puff pastry crust and a wonderful
stuffing.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.639
So let me stress again.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.189
This recipe only works with a really good
quality piece of steak.

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:17.259
The kind of beef that you use for pot roast
just isn't gonna do it

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.229
or as Gordon Ramsay would say:

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.259
"Are you *bleep* trying to use *bleep* *bleep*
*bleep*

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.520
Beef *bleep* *bleep* *bleep* Wellington

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.060
or are you *bleep* *bleep* *bleep* just an
*bleep* *bleep*

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.930
octopus *bleep* *bleep* *bleep* biscuit."

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.039
Join me next time in Titli's Busy Kitchen

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:41.039
Until next time... Khuda hafiz
