00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.769
High Life is the second collaboration between
Brian Eno and Karl Hyde, of British electronic

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:07.590
group Underworld.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.740
The album follows 'Someday World' and has
been released on June 30, 2014.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.880
Background
The album is Eno's sixth for Warp Records,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.189
and was recorded following the announcement
of his first collaboration with Karl Hyde.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.579
Brian Eno was quoted saying, "“when Someday
World was finished I felt like we were still

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.949
on a roll and I wasn't ready to stop working
and get into 'promotional mode' for that record.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.280
So I suggested we immediately start on another
album, a different one, where we extended

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.690
some of the ideas we'd started, and attempted
some of the ideas we hadn't.”

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.620
The album was released on 30th June 2014 on
CD and digitally with a vinyl copy of the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.170
album due to follow in August which will feature
two additional tracks, 'Slow Down, Sit Down

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.610
&amp; Breathe' and 'On a Grey Day'.
