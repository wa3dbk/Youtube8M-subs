00:15:31.600 --> 00:35:32.719
Hello, welcome to Armageddonoid video tutorial.

00:37:46.159 --> 00:53:19.519
Armageddonoid is Android (aka google phone)

00:53:19.519 --> 01:17:44.079
port of the old arcade game from the 80s.

01:17:44.159 --> 01:37:44.039
If you watched Terminator 2 movie

01:37:44.079 --> 01:48:50.560
maybe you remember what game John was playing

01:48:50.600 --> 01:57:43.840
in the video arcade when

01:57:43.880 --> 02:13:17.439
T1000 found him for the first time.

02:17:43.920 --> 02:31:04.200
So, basically this game has arcade perfect

02:35:30.280 --> 02:46:37.319
look and feel in the current release,

02:46:37.399 --> 02:55:30.840
which means really basic graphics and

02:55:30.840 --> 03:15:30.840
almost no sound. Also it was developed

03:15:30.840 --> 03:33:17.239
for the trackball only to be as close to

03:33:17.239 --> 03:44:23.840
the original as possible.

03:44:23.840 --> 04:13:17.360
You control your missile launcher using trackball.

04:13:17.360 --> 04:31:04.000
To launch missile you just press on the trackball.

04:31:04.000 --> 04:51:03.880
This is how it works...

05:13:16.919 --> 05:28:50.799
The aim of the game is to defend your six cities

05:28:50.799 --> 05:46:37.200
from death rays coming from the above.

05:51:03.720 --> 06:08:50.560
You have limited number of missiles

06:08:50.560 --> 06:28:50.919
so you need to be quick.

06:35:30.479 --> 06:48:50.360
You can also play in the full screen mode

06:48:50.360 --> 07:08:50.520
in horizontal position like this...

07:08:50.520 --> 07:26:37.279
You need to open your G1 keyboard.

07:28:50.319 --> 07:42:11.639
It will take a while and the game will reset

07:44:24.000 --> 08:06:37.439
but then you can play in the horizontal mode.

09:15:30.639 --> 09:31:04.120
If you feel that crosshair is too small

09:31:04.120 --> 09:53:17.360
you can go to options. So you just go back

09:53:17.360 --> 10:15:30.680
to main screen, you click options and you can

10:19:56.599 --> 10:46:37.279
change the crosshair to either small, medium or large.

10:46:37.279 --> 10:55:30.599
You do it like this...

11:08:49.760 --> 11:19:56.919
You save your preferences and then you can go

11:19:56.919 --> 11:19:59.919
back to the game.

11:33:16.800 --> 11:55:30.519
Now the crosshair is larger so you can see it better.

12:19:56.760 --> 12:35:30.080
One thing that users reported is that trackball

12:35:30.080 --> 12:46:37.239
can be sluggish from time to time, so again

12:48:50.319 --> 13:02:10.639
you go back to Options

13:42:08.000 --> 13:55:30.879
and you have something called trackball sensitivity.

13:55:30.879 --> 14:08:50.400
If you slide it to the maximum,

14:08:50.400 --> 14:39:57.559
then you go to Save, back to game,

14:51:04.120 --> 15:02:10.440
trackball will be much

15:02:10.440 --> 15:15:29.959
more responsive. It will be easier for you

15:15:29.959 --> 15:31:04.120
to go through the screen to aim.

16:48:50.239 --> 16:59:56.639
All right, many users have also asked for

16:59:56.639 --> 17:13:17.000
the touch screen support so it was added to the game.

17:13:17.000 --> 17:39:57.000
However, it still requires you to touch the screen,

17:39:57.000 --> 17:59:57.000
hold down and drag your finger to manipulate the crosshair.

17:59:57.000 --> 18:22:10.600
You can do it like this...

18:59:57.039 --> 19:22:10.320
So basically you move the crosshair on the screen

19:22:10.320 --> 19:33:17.440
and then you tap to fire.

19:55:30.399 --> 20:17:43.679
Still, you need to be really quick to blow the ray of death

20:17:43.679 --> 20:31:04.000
before it reaches your city. Right?

20:31:04.000 --> 20:46:37.039
The touch screen controls were implemented in a way

20:46:37.039 --> 20:57:43.679
that it does not really matter where you tap the screen

20:57:43.679 --> 21:04:23.679
or you put your finger.

21:04:23.679 --> 21:15:30.839
You still are able to aim and fire.

21:17:43.600 --> 21:28:50.039
So it does not mean you need to cover the crosshair

21:28:50.039 --> 21:42:10.720
and move it. You basically touch anywhere on the screen.

22:44:23.320 --> 23:17:44.000
So: tap, hold down, move, and tap again to fire.

23:19:56.679 --> 23:44:23.679
That would be it in this I guess short video tutorial.

23:44:23.679 --> 23:44:27.520
Have fun with the game. Thanks.
