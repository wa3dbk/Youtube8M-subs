00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.771
So there are loads of reasons why I'm just
completely in love with the Alpina D3, but

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:24.010
one of them that I've really come round to
is the interior. This one isn't absolutely

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.700
loaded with goodies. The basic price of the
car is just under 50, this one is Â£55,000.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.010
It's kind of got everything you'd want, it's
got the nav system - the really complex nav

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.590
system. It's got the diff, as well, which
is cool, but other than that it's not loaded

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.420
with options. It's got the standard leather
seats and it's just a lovely place to spend

00:00:46.420 --> 00:01:02.170
time when you're behind the wheel. Overall,
the D3 is just a tremendous, tremendous car

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.270
to live with each and every day. It's got
350 horsepower but that's not he headline.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.850
What is, is 516lb/ft of torque. On the road,
the D3 is just this civilised thing. Long

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.450
journeys it just eats them up almost as if
they almost didn't exist. I arrive at my destinations

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.840
after two or three hundred miles just thinking
"what happened there? Where did those miles

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.570
go?", and you just feel completely relaxed
when you get there. And yet the flipside is,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.689
you come to a track like this at Croft, you
can press the Sport button - Sport+ button

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:47.049
- the dampers get stiffer, the steering gets
much firmer and more precise, the diff, the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.080
optional diff in this one, really starts to
come into its own on a circuit like this because

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:03.409
you can do all the kind of dairy stuff if
you want to. And, it's really, really fast.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.910
I mean proper, hyper-space quick. If you know
what you're doing, you can take this thing

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:21.100
to a track day and dust an awful lot of really
quite serious machinery. Just the combination

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.880
of agility... OK I don't think it's just as
nimble as an M3 because it does weigh a little

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.360
more because there's a huge great diesel engine
up there, but at nine and a half tenths which,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.709
let's face it, most people aren't going to
go much beyond. If they do, they'll end up

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:48.860
in the shrubs. But at nine and a half tenths,
the D3 feels delightful in Sport+. Properly

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.560
composed, properly fast. Just such an enormous
amount of car under one roof, the D3 represents.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.050
And that's why I just love living with it.
I think this is, you know I've run a few long-term

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.510
cars over the years and I think this is my
absolute, outright favourite because it does

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.741
so many things in so many different ways.
None of which are bad, all of which, well

00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:19.180
most of which are just sensational and all
of which are welcome. I love this thing, I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.540
love it to bits. I'm going to hate the day
when they ask for it back.
