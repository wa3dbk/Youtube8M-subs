Here’s today’s video clip, movie news are coming up!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The Smurfs 2 is coming out the 31 of July 2013,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and Columbia Pictures is already set on the development of The Smurfs third and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the second isn't even going to be out for a whole year.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Jordan Kerner is still the producer and Raja Gosnell is in for directing the sequel,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
but for the third nothing is decided yet.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
This movie is bringing back the same live action cast members like Neil Patrick Harris or Gèma Mèis,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and the same voice actors like Katy Perry (Smurfette) and Jonathan Winters (Papa Smurf).

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
A plus entrance will be Christina Ricci who will play the voice of a totally new character,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the evil Vexi, the opposite of Smurfette.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
That’s all for today, see you next time!
