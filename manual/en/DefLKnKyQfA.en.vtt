00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.120
Hello everyone!

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.320
Today we’re going to learn about 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.880
some very interesting vertebrate animals: 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.840
 we present - the reptiles!

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.960
Reptiles are vertebrate animals

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.120
which are characterized by their special way of moving: 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.000
many move by dragging their tummy, or abdomen, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.960
on or close to the ground; their name,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.680
 in Latin, means just that: reptar mean to crawl or slither.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.640
 Many are terrestrial, but there are also some that live in water.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.520
All reptiles have a number of characteristics 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.320
we should know about so we can recognize them.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.560
Reptiles are cold-blooded animals

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 that breathe with their lungs. 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.320
They are oviparous, that is they reproduce by eggs; 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.280
when the eggs develop and hatch, 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.760
the babies are just like their parents... 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.640
but very small. Aren’t they cute?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.320
As you can see, reptiles’ skin is covered with strong, 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.520
tough scales, and some, 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.000
like tortoises, even have a shell. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.640
It looks like he has his house on his back, doesn’t it?

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.000
As for feeding well, most reptiles are carnivorous... 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.840
They hunt, 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.880
like this crocodile which has just eaten this poor rodent; 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.640
or this cute chameleon, with its long, 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.320
sticky tongue that catches all kinds of insects... 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.360
Look, look! As we said already, 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.480
most reptiles are carnivorous, but some, 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.120
like this iguana, are herbivorous.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.840
There are lots of interesting things you should know about reptiles, 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.400
such as: most snakes have venom in their fangs... 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.720
But they’re not as bad as they seem, 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.280
because they warn us of danger with their bright colors

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.600
or the sound of their rattles.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.800
Chameleons are very curious: they can change color, 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.120
copying the landscape around them -

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.840
 they blend in with the background so no-one can see

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.760
them, and they become almost invisible.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.760
So let’s remember the most important characteristics of reptiles

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.680
Reptiles walk by dragging their tummy on or close to the ground; 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:26.400
they are oviparous and their body is covered with strong, hard scales... 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.560
They are vertebrates and are cold-blooded... 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.400
And remember, they breathe with their lungs.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.880
Reptiles really are quite interesting, aren’t they? 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.240
Well, goodbye for now everyone, 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.360
