00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.899
Hi - this is John. I'm here on the site of a building we're going to go ahead and do an inspection.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.880
I'm here with Peter - one of the recent graduates from..

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.020
the program Field Rep 101.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.440
And I'm going to today just walk through the property.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.360
We're not going to do everything.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.760
But this is just to give you an  idea of some of the things that's involved

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.920
in the inspection of a commercial property.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.940
So, right now I've got my clipboard..

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.939
..and camera, pen..

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.080
And I also printed out the form.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.160
Sometimes with all the electronic means of doing inspections nowadays..

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.919
..people just kinda ignore that.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.920
I still think that it's really worth it.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.740
Just because you can go ahead take notes.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.280
You can also ahead of time jot down some of the requirements.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.820
Different types of properties will have different things that the lender will want you to check.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.640
One of the things I want to do right away is to take a picture of the signage.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.640
It's a great marking point or marker shot -

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.960
..to basically get things oriented.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.000
Okay, so once we get started we'll take some basic shots.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.650
One of the things I typically do after the signage is..

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.340
..take what's called a broadview or glamour shot.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.500
Just basically this sample of how the property looks..

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.560
from an overall perspective.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.360
Other things we want to do is street shots

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.520
..which basically include as much as you can of neighboring properties.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.740
Other than the street views is we take pictures of the signage, if there's any.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.561
..and after which the other main thing is to go ahead

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.220
and go into the different units

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.060
In this case we're conducting this almost as what's considered

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.580
a "no contact" or "exterior only"

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.560
The property manager's elected to allow me to simply go to the property myself.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.750
And in other situations sometimes
you'll be sent out on assignments

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.270
where basically the lender doesn't want you to contact anyone for various reasons.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.330
So, in this case we're going to go ahead and just go..

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.240
into some of the individual units and get some photos.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.420
Right now we're inside the unit of a donut shop.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.160
I just spoke with the manager on-site

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.620
Sometimes it happens where the discussion is that..

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.780
they feel either uncomfortable..

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.340
..or they're not sure what you're doing there, or something like that.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.620
Again, typically this is not an issue with

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.920
having the actual property manager for this site to walk you through it.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.740
But other times you're better off saying thank..

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.710
and just carrying on and stuff.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.030
It's usually not worth it.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.220
I did take a shot of the interior.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.000
And that's pretty much all that the lenders are looking for.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.780
They just want to see generally how the property looks.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.860
So, that's pretty much it.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.940
We've covered two of the three interiors

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.140
..that were the requirements for this particular inspection.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.670
And that pretty much will fulfill our requirements.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.860
We'll look at one more unit.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.860
They have an upstairs, and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.860
..we'll probably go ahead and do that.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.260
Other than that we'll take more shots of the exterior

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.500
..and more shots of the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.930
overall property itself.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.900
So, just wanted to

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.900
basically give a general description

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.320
of what we do

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.300
for these inspections..

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.540
..of commercial properties..

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.960
for retail or office buildings..

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.780
Pretty much done the same way.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.180
The things that's usually more intensive..

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.740
..are the apartments or multi-family properties.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.120
Those are usually more where they typically will involve..

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.520
..meeting with a property manager going through the units.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.840
Never mind things like..

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.020
HUD or low-income housing.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.020
Those kinds are even more particular.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.420
But again just wanted to give a brief intro

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.700
..how and what's involved with a general commercial property inspection.
