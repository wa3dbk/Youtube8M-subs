because this is a cake that you can eat

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.109

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.390

tablespoons

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.140

banana small banana that we're gonna
mashup 2 teaspoons

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.620
of vanilla extract gonna start off
by mixing all the dry ingredients so

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.190
we're gonna

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.550
chuck in the almond flour the cocoa powder

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.219
and also the baking powder and we just in
the blend that together

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.109
I'm just gonna put that to one side and
I'm gonna mashup my banana

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.199
the riper for your banana is the sweeter it will be

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.820
I try to have my bananas ripe as
possible so now that that's mashed the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.360
recent but that one site again

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.619
of am gonna come back to my mixture
here I'm gonna

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.979
I'm gonna pour in the coconut oil and my
coconut milk

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.830
I'm just gonna give that quick blend
next up I'm gonna

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.560
put in my sweetener which I'm using agave nectar here
my mashed banana

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.360
and also the 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.750
and now we can give another blend look
at that chocolatey

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.880
goodness

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.270
I'm just gonna prepare cake tin 10 and I'll
show you how to do that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.830
so here have my cake tin and gonna
take a little bit of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.100
vegan butter and I'm just gonna spread
that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.140
really doing this with the vegan butter so that it doesn't stick

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.149
and obviously we've already preheat your
oven to 180 degrees Celsius because the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.210
a bit thicker batter gonna have to just a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.369
spread around alright so our cake is in
the oven right now and

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.560
is gonna be there for around 30 minutes
and then I'm gonna check on it to see if

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.520
it needs more time

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.739
meanwhile I'm gonna try and make the
frosting here so it's the first time

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:13.920
make this frosting

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.310
but I found this great recipe that uses dates instead of any sugars

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.380
so I have a cup of dates here and I've
depitted

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.590
and so next up I'm gonna use some coconut
oil so

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.620
quarter cup of melted coconut oil

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.380
into a blend is this man nutribullet and I'm gonna 
use a quarter cup

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.480
of water so and I'll also gonna use a
quarter cup

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.250
of cacao powder and now I'm just
gonna blend this all up and show you how

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.130
that looks like

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.459
so this is what I'm gonna use to put on
my cake and then refrigerate that until

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.530
my cake it done

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.090
alright so 30 minutes had passed and the cake
just came out

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.260
and the knife is coming out clear so
we're just getting

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.650
wait for it to cool down and then we're
gonna apply the frosting a show you how to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.810
do that alright so the chocolate cake

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.799
I'll and turn it upside down and now I'm
just gonna spread this

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:11.799
frosting that we did previously

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.440
 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.319
alright so we're not gonna stop just there we're gonna decorate our

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.260
cake with some strawberries
so what I'm gonna show you is how I fan them out

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.970
like this

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.610
see take your strawberry you can use how many strawberries as you like

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.840
and then you just grab it to the part where the
leafs are

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.600
and then you start cutting but don't cut
all the way

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.019
up to here you wanna leave like a space
there so that it doesn't

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.250
cut through completely and then you cut it
all the way down

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.690
I'm trying to do them as thinly as I can without
actually breaking

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.400
and just do that to the whole strawberry

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.780
and once you finish that

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.530
you just fan it out like this and there you have your fanned

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.239
strawberry

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.140
so there you go guys he have a perfectly
delicious

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.870
chocolate cake that is pretty good for you
