This is the University of Rochester.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.025
I play the trumpet.

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:05.750
I play french horn.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I play the euphonium, and I play the french horn.

00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:09.500
Yeah, I play french horn.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.500
I play the trumpet.

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:13.500
So, I'm here because it's the Day of Brass, 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.200
and we're doing this community outreach program with the Brass Choir,

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:19.277
to get people to come and learn more about brass instruments, 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
because they're awesome!

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Like all the other ensembles on the River Campus,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
they're really open to all majors.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Environmental  science major.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm a senior electrical engineering student.

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:34.915
I'm not attending college yet, because I'm a senior in high school.

00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:38.132
It was really the students and I who came up with the idea.

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:41.383
And, so we've invited high school music programs to pick

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.005
two or three students, allow them to come and participate.

00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:49.500
And what we've got in store for them is a day of workshops--

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:53.876
'These were used to scare their enemies.'

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.000

--rehearsals, we're going to form a festival brass ensemble--

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.695
'Now guests, it's asking a lot of you to come in here and 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.000
play everything pretty much at sight today.

00:01:08.847 --> 00:01:11.847
So, drop out when you need to, 
take it down an octave when you need to.

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:16.144
That's what we do, too, in rehearsal.  There's no shame in that.'

00:01:18.463 --> 00:01:22.463

It was really nice to see Professor Jim Thompson from Eastman,

00:01:41.587 --> 00:01:44.587
'Listen.  Listen to what you sound like.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Listen to what other players sound like.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Listen to players that you really, really like,  

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and say what is it that I like about that sound?'

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.409
The Civil War instruments were very interesting to see, too.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.569
It was very cool stuff.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.000
'Now on this one, the valves are a little bit leaky,

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:02.002
and I have not oiled it recently.'

The Excelsior Cornet Band will take the stage for the final performance.

I can't wait to hear the true sound of a Civil War-style brass band from the 1860s.
