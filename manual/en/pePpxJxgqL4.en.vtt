Hi! My name is Scott Reil and on behalf of
Expert Village, I would like to talk to you

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.680
about container gardening. When designing
containers, it is good to keep a couple of

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.210
general principals in mind. One is the principal
of contrast and in trying to do my two containers

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.060
here, I’ve chosen a taller container which
I’ve even accented the vertical even more

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.840
by putting a tall plant in it and plants that
grow in a more upright shape and I want to

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.220
contrast that with the horizontal. You can
see I’ve picked a lower container here and

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.519
I want to pick some plants that are going
to accent the horizontal more. First of all

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.010
I am going to put this gerber daisy in the
middle. Now you can see the leaves hold on

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.429
a very horizontal way and the flowers that
come up, it holds on a horizontal plane as

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:54.539
well. So this is the kind of plant that is
going to really accent the container that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.739
it is in by being horizontal as well and that’s
a good way to look at it. Here I’ve actually

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.859
wanted to make the taller container vertical
and the lower container horizontal but you

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.990
could switch it around some. To make this
container more horizontal all we need to do

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.091
is put some trailing things and some lower
more vertical plants and trail it over to

00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:21.601
the side; it would change the feel entirely.
The other thing to think about when you are

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:27.630
designing containers, is your color contrast
and your color compliments. This one I’ve

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.740
chosen to go with a little bit of a red, white
and blue theme; little bit on the patriotic

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.180
side but I also again, chosen plants are going
to stay low, packed and horizontal so this

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.390
is never going to be a really tall container.
What I have done though is I’ve chosen some

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.189
plants that are going to compliment the colors
that I’ve used in this container. For instance,

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.549
this quartz blue verbena is going to show
off a very blue coloration in here soon and

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.619
it is really going to stand out against that
red here, but it is very much going to compliment

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:11.250
the blue in the container that I used back
here. I’ve also done much the same thing

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.080
with the ageratums that I’ve used. The ageratum,
being to the whiter side is going to compliment

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.900
with the white snapdragons up here, but there
is just a tinge of pink in here so it will

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.580
reference back to the daisy’s that I’ve
got in the middle. The other nice compliment

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.650
that I have going here is we have two types
of ageratums, so even though the flower colors

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.330
are different, I get very similar looks in
the big tall flower up here and the low flower

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.160
that I’ve used down there. By contrasting
and complimenting back and forth between different

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:54.670
colors, you can get a look in your container
that is going to be cohesive with the gardens,

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.989
cohesive with the other containers and it
is going to give you that finished polished

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.480
garden look that you are looking for.
