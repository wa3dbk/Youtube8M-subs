00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.410
Deadly Premonition is a very unique game.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.009
It's cheesy, it's technically low-quality,
and it's... different from any other game

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.560
I've ever played before.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.900
The game follows an FBI agent named Francis
York Morgan, who is investigating a murder

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.580
in a small town in rural Washington State.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.380
While many people praise Deadly Premonition
for its story, the real appeal, to me, is

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.980
the detail of its town.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.230
There's combat in this game, but this is not
a game for action hounds.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.380
York is quite the odd beast.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.410
Many people peg him as somewhere on the autism
spectrum, and he certainly does act socially

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.410
inappropriate.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.430
He talks about odd subjects, doesn't seem
to be aware when he's upsetting people, and

00:00:39.430 --> 00:01:05.000
as an added bonus, he talks to his imaginary
friend Zach in full view of other people.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500
The heart and soul of this game is really
its town.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.070
It's very detailed, and life in the town is
very realistically simulated.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.390
But for every aspect that's realistic, there's
one that's comedically unrealistic.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.500
There are many places to go shopping, such
as a convenience store, a diner, a gunsmith,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.230
and even the front desk of a hotel.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.220
But the things that are sold sometimes make
little to no sense.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.890
For example, why does a gun store sell lollipops?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.310
Why does a convenience store sell clothes
and weapons.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.740
Though you gotta admit, it's convenient.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.580
Come to think of it, let's take a closer look
at what's on the shelves.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.360
Lots of bland name products with broken English.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.700
Try reading these.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.070
Some are almost real products, like "Maxwall
House".

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.870
None of them can actually be purchased by
the player; they're just decoration to make

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.080
the place look more realistic.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.240
The prices you pay are insane.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.450
This is the type of economy that could only
exist in a video game, which explains the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.280
high prices for nearly everything, except
cars, which are stunningly cheap.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.500
If you need more money, though, just stay
up at night and fight some zombies.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.810
After midnight, the place is crawling with
them.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.330
They practically break the game's economy.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.300
There's a lot more to do than just shopping.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.230
The town is bustling with life, and you can
go and meet the townsfolk.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.060
Or threaten them with your gun, but if you
engage in that kind of rogue behavior, the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.880
FBI deducts your pay.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.420
If you're looking for hobbies to pass the
time, there's several.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.660
You can play darts at a bar, smoke a cigarette
to quite literally pass the time, or go fishing.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.849
If you're lucky, you might catch an actual
fish.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.860
Usually though, you'll catch just about anything
else.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.430
In an added attempt to simulate real life,
you can do things like shave, and you're required

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.930
to eat and sleep in order to stay alive.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.160
This has the effect of forcing you to live
like a real person might, and take in the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.350
detail in the town.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.410
Will you grab some quick food from the vending
machines, or visit the diner, eat lunch with

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.820
the police, and go to the nightclub at night?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.270
Your car runs out of fuel rather quickly,
forcing you to become familiar with the gas

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.770
station and its owners.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.050
Ultimately, you'll get to know the town rather
well.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.569
What's more, the conversations the townspeople
have with you change over the course of the

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.040
game.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.420
Revisiting previous locations such as the
convenience store is strongly encouraged,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.510
as you can buy new things, not just talk to
people about new things.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.680
You can also turn up the creep factor by stalking
every character in the game via the handy

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.180
map.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.490
It literally shows you the location of every
character in the story, which allows you to

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.300
notice that they all have their own unique
routine, where some of them visit the convenience

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.840
store, diner, nightclub, bar, or other people's
houses at different times of day.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.640
They go to work and then relax by stopping
by the bar later in the day.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.530
You can also sometimes drop by people's houses
unannounced and simply hang out.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.800
They don't care.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:22.889
And that, to me, is the heart and soul of
Deadly Premonition.

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.570
Sure the game is known most for its cheesy
dialog, its odd mixture of humor and unscary

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.280
horror, its blending of a murder investigation
and the supernatural, and the game's low production

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.669
values and the poor quality of its combat
and driving.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.960
But if you play the game and then ignore life
in the town of Greenvale, skipping only to

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.720
your next mission objective, and complain
about the eating and sleeping requirements,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.030
then you're missing the point.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.880
The town is the major ingredient that makes
the game tick, and it's the one that many

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.650
people who mention it online seem to not even
bring up in their discussions.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.380
If this sounds like a combo you'd like to
try, this game is definitely worth checking

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.720
out.
