00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.980
Games are inherently spiritual; if you think
about it.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.700
When you're playing a game, and it's not too
hard, it's not too easy &amp; you're into that

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.110
flow state.
You aren't thinking about the future, not

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.520
worried about whats gonna happen tomorrow.
You're not angry about what happened yesterday.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.520
Or guilty about the mistakes. You're in the
'now' and that is spirituality.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.309
So,
We wanted to take a game, create a game that

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.309
tells a spiritual story, but at the same time
brings it home in a practise. In playing the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.240
game you experience the story of Ramayana.
Ramayana is of the two great Hindu epics.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.640
The other one of being Mahabharat from which
comes the, let's call it Hindu Bible it's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.640
called the 'Gita'. But the Ramayana is about
prince Ram -great leader. Thought to have

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.850
lived roughly 5 to 7 thousand years ago. He's
a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu (Krishna)

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.659
Perfection and leadership, dedication, and
devotion who's facing his greatest challenge.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.479
The Demon Kind, "Ravana", has kidnapped his
wife, (Sita) and wants to make her his own

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.030
wife. Ram is on tight schedule,
he's got get to her, rescue her, To vanquish

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.250
the army of demon king Ravana; as quickly
as possible, there's not much time. So he

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.940
gives Hanuman, the task of finding her and
delivering his ring to her so she knows that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.150
he's on his way. So, she's not feeling defeated
and she knows there's hope. So, Hanuman, he's

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.970
confused, worried; there's no how he's going
to find her; there's no how he's going to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.970
get to her. He know she's far away, doesn't
know where. What he doesn't know also is,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.250
he is actually a son of the wind God. And
he's able to fly. He's forgotten this; and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.250
because of the curse he's forgotten his superhuman
powers. Jambuvan helps him to remember his

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.860
powers, helps him to feel confident again
that he's capable of doing. He's on the beach

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.390
in Southern India, he starts running on the
beach towards Lanka, feeling his power flowing

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.390
through more and more- reaches supersonic
speed creates sonic boom and leaps to Lanka.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.400
Of course he still has to fight through the
demon army and Several major characters. Surasa,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.750
who's demon with snake arms. Simhika, demon
with huge octopus like 200 feet talk. Fight

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.850
demon army then vanquish Lankini a demigod
at the end of Lanka before he actually finds Sita.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.870
So how we bring the player to experience this is:

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.650
First of all, by using accelerometer in android

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.650
and iPhone platform, so when Hanuman is flying
you can steer it like it might playing. In

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.720
battles again you're using accelerometer -fighting
some of the demon hordes- you're using accelerometer

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.720
like a sword -slashing at the hordes.
It's a 3D game. We have 3D artists in India,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.400
California, New York, Florida. We also use
traditional mobile game controls where you've

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:45.449
joystick thumb control, buttons for jumping,
for slashing, for whirling.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.940
It's a game that we hope, will bring the story
home with fun and family friendly way.
