00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.500
Hey guys we just changed the electronic
throttle body on this late model GM

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.500
vehicle

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.980
now we're gonna show you how to do the
relearn procedure.  Let's go!

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.320
okay so you've just installed your
replacement throttle body

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.230
and your vehicle won't idle or has an
erratic idle. You're thinking the part must be

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.420
defective right? Not necessarily

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.460
over time your PCM has been making
incremental adjustments to the throttle body

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.950
resulting in changes to the throttle blade angle. These adjustments compensate for things

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.710
like carbon buildup in the throttle body

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.920
The PCM learns these values and memorizes them to maintain proper engine idle

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.230
now that you replaced the throttle body
with a clean carbon-free unit, the PCM is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.130
still operating as if the original unit
is still in place

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.230
so you'll need to perform a relearn proceedure on the PCM. Here's how you do it.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.880
Start and idle the engine in park for 3
minutes. Initially you may notice a

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.810
high or incorrect idle speed until the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.350
ECM start to learn the new idle cells. At this point your RPM should start to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.000
decrease

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.579
next turn ignition off for 60 seconds

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.590
then start and idle the engine in park for 3
minutes again. After the 3 minute

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.240
run time

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.590
the engine should be idling normally.
It's important to note sometimes during

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.700
the drive cycle

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.590
check engine light may illuminate
indicating idle speed diagnostic trouble

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.819
codes are present. If idle speed codes are
present clear the codes so the ECM

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:34.090
can continue to learn. If the engine idle speed has not been learned from this procedure

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.509
it may be necessary to drive the vehicle
at speeds above 44 miles per hour

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.380
with several deceleration an extended
idles. After the drive cycle the engine

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.069
should now be idling correctly. If not,

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.480
turn the ignition off for 60 seconds
and repeat step 3

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.740
That's all for now. I hope this information
has been helpful.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.100
thanks for your time and I'll see you on or
next edition of ProTech.
