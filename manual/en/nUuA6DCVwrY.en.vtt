00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.990
Stuck with a space that’s tough to configure?
See what a difference a little ‘design’

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.419
can make.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.639
Here’s a look at the challenges and the
changes in this typical l-shaped layout. First

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.640
challenge? – function. Arranging a long
narrow space can be difficult….this room

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.050
needed a focus and got one with A DIY entertainment
center. Made up of shelving and stock cabinets,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.220
it spans an entire wall and is now the reason
for the room. It provides storage and style,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.939
and even incorporates the tv. Wrapping the
look onto an adjoining wall, by adding a small

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.610
workspace, extends the functionality. Matching
the desk to the color and height of the cabinets

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.410
makes it feel completely integrated. The last
change in the living room? Shifting the orientation

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.770
of the seating area to a diagonal. It more
clearly defines the space and makes the most

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.070
of the room’s new focus.
Next challenge…a front door that opened

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.710
right into the living area..awkward. The change…adding
a room divider to create a natural entryway.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.890
This modular flexible project can be stacked
higher or lower, and a variety of drawers

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.420
and cubbies provide practical storage as well
as display space. The design allows light

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.420
to pass through - keeping things open and
bright….and a handy bench with built-in

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.280
shoe storage is the perfect complement. Another
practical project - a message board with hooks

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.710
to hang purses or coats – makes this entryway
a place with purpose.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.659
In the dining area….the main challenge was
the lack of storage. The change here was easy….adding

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.999
this upcycled buffet provides not only the
much-needed storage, but by hanging art and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:35.240
plants around it - it becomes a real focal
point for the room.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.469
all these changes support more functionality,
defining separate areas to look and LIVE less

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.020
like one big room.
So if you’re challenged by uninspired surroundings,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.020
make some changes for a space that works for
you.
