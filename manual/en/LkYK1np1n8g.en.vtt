00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.369
Hi I'm Adan Tanton, and we're here to talk today
about the world's first kinetically powered EC meter

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.079
The EC Shake

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.759
EC Shake has many benefits over other nutrient meters

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.939
firstly the obvious... it has no batteries

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.249
power is provided by the harnessing of kinetic energy via the movable magnet.

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.759
Around ten shakes initially

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.270
is enough to charge up the super capacitor

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.510
to give you an initial reading

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.550
other advantages of having no batteries include:
environmental friendliness, and the elimination

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.170
of false readings from flat or tiring batteries.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.760
The unit is also completely sealed and therefore is completely waterproof

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.890
and can be submerged completely in water without
the fear of actually damaging your meter.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.480
The EC Shake also comes with external temperature compensation

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.030
which gives more accurate readings in both hot
and cold water temperatures which vary from

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.260
the recommended temperature of twenty two 
degrees or seventy two degrees fahrenheit.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.730
The housing is made from tough polycarbonate plastic

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.220
and is drop tested to four feet, making it sturdy and reliable in the field.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.299
It also requires no calibration.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.260
To clean this, you simply remove the cap

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.390
and you wipe the graphite nodes here

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.270
on a piece of fabric

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.290
or your jeans

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.800
once a week to remove any mineral salt buildup
left from your nutrient solution.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.560
Remember though, to replace the cap, or it won't work properly.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.010
The cap makes sure the electric conductivity 
works correctly, so don't lose the cap.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.610
Sunlight Supply offers a full one year warranty on factory faults.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.500
The meter is conveniently marked in the scale of EC

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.490
CF

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.420
PPM seven hundred and PPM five hundred

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.660
Most nutrient manufacturers recommend parts per million

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.370
and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.790
also recommend on the bottle, what scale they're using.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.860
Always mix nutrients to manufacturers specifications

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.030
and if no scale is provided, EC is a direct measurement,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.749
and seven hundred PPM is definitely the most accurate conversion to use.

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.290
So... in most cases, in the United States you would be using

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.219
EC of seven hundred

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.559
Remember this product... The EC Shake

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:21.109
Green energy with every shake!
