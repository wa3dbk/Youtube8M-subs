00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.150
Imagine you are sitting at a desk and you
have got a sketchpad and pencil.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.699
You are going to begin to draw on that sketchpad.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.279
As you begin to draw you are not going to
treat that sketch pad as if it's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.000
cemented down to the table.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.550
You are going to rotate and move that as you
sketch,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.550
because you have got to accommodate your hand,
wrist and arm motion, so

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.960
that as you draw certain angles are going
to far easier to accomplish with the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.890
sketch pad oriented the way that's most comfortable
for your hand.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.170
And the same thing can be done in Painter.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.500
There is actually a command and a tool called
the Page Rotate tool that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.699
enables this to happen.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.359
Now it is actually on the Tool palette and
I'm going to click and hold the

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.250
grabber so that I can call this up.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.710
You will see there is actually this little
Rotate tool and what happens is if I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.229
click and drag, I can actually rotate this
page to any angle.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.080
Well that's great, but just like the Hand
and Grabber tool I was showing you before,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.880
there is actually a way to do this without
having to bother going in and

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.369
locating and unearthing the Rotate tool itself
and that is actually another

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.670
cording action and let's put ourselves in
the Brush too because this is most

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.750
likely when you are going to encounter wanting
to use this tool.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.310
If I hold down the Spacebar as well as the
Option or Alt key, you will see I

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.410
get that same cursor and now without actually
going to that tool I can go in

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.009
here and quickly rotate to accommodate my
hand and I'm going to show you why I

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.310
would want to do that.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.610
Now I'm going to do this a little artificially,
but imagine once again, if I

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.330
have got my tab at right at front of me here,
when I want to draw a horizontal

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.510
line across the screen, I have got to somewhat
tuck my elbow up to the side of

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.569
the my body and then draw back and forth this
way and it's a bit unnatural.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.980
Now I'm going to go ahead and use the page
Rotate tool and once again I'm

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.110
holding down the Spacebar and the Option or
Alt key and I can rotate this now so

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.800
that this is a much better way for me to draw
those lines and that's why this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.739
Page Rotate tool is so important.

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.319
There are just many, many times you are going
to find where it's very difficult

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.390
to draw a particular angle.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.959
For example, I'm left handed and for me to
draw kind of a circle sometimes this

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.780
way is very difficult, but if I rotate the
page around to an angle like this

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.519
that's much easier for me to do and again
what you are going here is you are

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.310
accommodating your hand, wrist and arm, just
so you are in the most comfortable

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.830
position to accomplish that angle and artists
use this all the time.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.420
If you ever sit and try to sketch without
ever rotating your sketch pad around

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.590
you will find it's very difficult to be able
to accomplish and have the same

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.989
freedom to draw that you get when you do rotate
the sketch pad around, and the

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.629
same holds true here.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.800
Being able to rotate the page is a very key
component of natural drawing and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:29.519
fortunately it's built into Painter with the
Page Rotate tool, so take advantage of it.
