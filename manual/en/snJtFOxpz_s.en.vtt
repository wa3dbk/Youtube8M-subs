Well welcome back to the program of Tai Chi.
Now we are going to talk about the brushing

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:14.809
knee stroke. Brushing knee, yeah. Do you really
have to brush your knee? No, actually it is

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.519
just a name for down block. Now let us do
it together beginning with this hand. Brushing

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:28.690
knee stroke, a push, coming back. I believe
you remembered round house kick, front elbows.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:39.610
What is this for? Take a look again. Brushing
knee stroke, rocking back. Brushing knee stroke,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.750
rocking back. Now there are three points I
would like to talk. First of all, brushing

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:57.870
knee stroke. One. Again. Again. One. It is
just like down block. The finger position

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.290
can be this, or that, but most likely be kind.
Be kind to the person attacking, if he is

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.610
not threatening your life be kind. Just give
him a push as a warning. If you are really

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.120
facing a life danger, then you poke. At this
moment, take a look. Brushing knee stroke,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.610
poke, back. Why am I asking you to step back?
You are blocking in case he is smacking you

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.790
with an elbow. We saw it already, elbow, landing
right here. How about your legs? How to do

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.330
it? Imagine that, and elbow. Remember, when
someone is throwing a weapon up here with

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.230
a hand he won't kick because they can not
coordinate together at the same time. So in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:57.540
block your best timing is a kick. Block, kick.
A block, kick. But in Tai Chi it did not show

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.960
that much you got to find that out. One more
time. Brushing knee stroke, this. Now when

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.230
we swing back, elbow block. We have a leg
right here because we can always pick up the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.739
knee and poke. Does that make sense to you?
Thank you.
