00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.390
How to Follow Diet Do's and Don'ts.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.630
Review some of the basic do's and don'ts of
a good diet to find your best balance.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:19.630
You will need Breakfast Protein Fats Small
portions Veggies Light and water.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.870
Step 1.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.820
Never skip breakfast.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.140
Keep breakfast simple, quick, and healthy,
by sticking with high-fiber options.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.510
Don't load up on fast foods, snacks, or sugar.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.170
Keep trail mix or dried fruit handy if you're
pressed for time and have to eat on the run.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.440
Step 2.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.989
Realize that protein keeps you feeling full
longer than carbs do.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.699
Protein also absorbs water and creates a further
sense of fullness, which help you avoid overeating.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:48.699
Step 3.

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.589
Eat fatty fish, nuts, and other healthy fats.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.870
Flaxseed oil activates leptin, an appetite-suppressing
hormone.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.260
Step 4.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.969
Get good rest.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.370
When you don't, your body produces more ghrelin,
a hormone that stirs hunger, rather than generating

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.750
the leptin needed to feel full.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.060
Step 5.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.020
Remove chips and treats from big bags, dividing
them into smaller storage bags, to control

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.020
the impulse to finish everything at once.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.539
Researchers have found that people who ate
from large bowls consumed 56 percent more

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.229
food than those with smaller bowls.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.299
Step 6.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.799
Eat vegetables that are low in calories, and
packed with fiber, to fill up.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.570
Steer clear of peas, corn, acorn and butternut
squash, or potatoes, which are too starchy.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.490
Make it a rule to avoid buffets -- they make
portion control and limiting yourself more

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.490
difficult.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.149
Step 7.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.249
Eat in lighted rooms, where you're more self-conscious
of others watching.

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:53.259
You'll also be able to see your food, which
makes you more aware of how much you're eating.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.670
Step 8.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.690
Remind yourself that if you feel thirsty,
you're already dehydrated.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.689
Drink water on a regular basis, whether thirsty
or not, to avoid feeling empty.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.329
Step 9.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.200
Don't snack after dinner.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.560
When you eat late at night, the body stores
fat, and that digestion process interferes

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.040
with sleep.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.470
Good luck with your diet.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.220
Did you know There are about 3,500 calories
-- or stored energy --per pound of fat.
