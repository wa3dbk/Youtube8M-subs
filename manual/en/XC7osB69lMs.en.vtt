00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to SewVeryEasy, my name is Laura.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.240
And I really enjoy visiting with my old friends, but I get

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.940
super excited when a new kid comes on the block. So

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.000
please join me as I welcome the new kid on the block,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.360
the Bernina 790.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.040
Cutting the straps are always a fun thing. The sound is

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.540
great.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.620
So the first thing that I can do is actually just lift up this

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.880
entire top tray. It comes in nice layers. The first thing

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.280
you're going to get is this little package. And this little

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.880
package is just a product and it helps keep the machine

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.120
dry. This is a good thing to hang on to by the way and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.140
throw it in your sewing supplies. And it comes with

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.660
some beautiful Mettler thread to start with. This is the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.360
base of the sewing machine so if you want to sew with a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.560
larger surface, this is where that's going to be. Of course,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.300
some "power bars." Next layer we have an instruction

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.840
DVD. This is a little pedal that goes on to the machine

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.720
and it lifts up your presser foot. And you use it with your

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.600
knee. A seam guide that you're able to put on that large

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.760
plate so that you can guide your fabric along the edge.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.020
The next layer will have all of your machine parts, oil,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.300
bobbins, all lots of fun things. And in this beautiful tin is

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.680
your BSR. Let me give you a quick peek at what that is.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.580
It's a little sewing foot that goes onto the machine and it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.020
keeps the stitches exactly the same size. Doesn't matter

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.540
how fast or slow you go. I'll get to this as I go down in

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.860
layers. In this box is your instruction manuals which

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.120
you're going to be able to refer back to. And in this box,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.660
probably one of my favorite boxes out of them all. Well, I

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.960
like to call it a Barbie wardrobe. You have more machine

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.700
parts, and this is actually made to sit upright beside

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.380
your machine. And all of your feet and accessories go

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.680
right here, so it's sitting right beside your machine and,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.620
well, it closes just like the closet. Now let's get into the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.380
big box.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.180
So the first thing you're able to do is take out these little

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.400
side pieces. And that was actually the handles for the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.400
outside. And then you're just able to take out some of

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.620
the center supports, and it all fits together like a puzzle.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.140
And then the top piece will come right off.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.796
And in with the machine you have a cover for your

00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:32.800
sewing machine, which I always recommend that you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.280
keep your covers on.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.300
And if you put your hand into the bottom of the box it

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.500
also comes with one more foot, and this is a buttonhole

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.940
foot. So make sure you pull that out of the box.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.200
So just by unwrapping the paper at the top you'll be able

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.880
to grab the handle and lift the machine out.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.620
And in the corner of the box,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.300
and you can see it's right here in this corner, nicely

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.400
protected, is your foot pedal.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.400
And if you're looking for the cord, it's all wrapped up in

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.700
the bottom.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.489
And let's take a better look at the machine.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.100
The machine is covered with a plastic covering here, so

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.740
you can take off this little piece of plastic. It's attached

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.800
to the stainless steel plate, and it's just there so in

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.039
transportation that it doesn't get scratched.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.500
And there's little pieces of cardboard and again plastic

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.240
on front of the top.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.015
Again these are just made to protect it during the

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.420
construction and for travel. It comes with another bag to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.820
keep it dry,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.980
and you have this piece that's covering the foot. Again,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.120
it's to protect it during transportation. And you're just

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.180
able to pull that right off.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.120
You can take the styrofoam out and now it has that free

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.480
arm, and a tape for the area for where the bobbin comes

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.620
in. Now you will notice a little hole right in here and that

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.260
is where this arm goes in. And what it does is it gives

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.540
you a hands-free system so you don't have to move the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.580
foot up and down with anything but your knee. And that

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.240
will go in there once the machine is set up.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.260
And attached to the handle is a little notification of the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.462
quality control and the person who worked on it actually

00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:42.320
signed his name.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.720
On the side, this is where you're going to be able to plug

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.580
it in. You have your on and off switch here, and there's a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.960
little button right here at the bottom. It's very flush with

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.480
the machine. It's going to raise and lower the feed dogs.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.500
You have your foot pedals spot, and this is for a

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.860
computer and this is also for a stick that you can put

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.220
memory into the computer.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.060
And in the cardboard box you will find what looks like a

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.960
pen. And that sticks there and this is going to replace

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.100
your finger for touching the keypads. Also at the side

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.580
you will notice this here. And that will take your spools

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.000
of thread that you want to come up at the top. This piece

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.940
is going to take the spools of thread that go horizontal.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.800
So you have two options on what thread spools you

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.740
want to use.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.960
When you turn the machine on...

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.880
it does take a couple of seconds for the machine to

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.560
boot up and get ready because it is computerized.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.820
It makes a little bit of a gurgling noise and then it's ready

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.000
to go. You're able to set the screen for the language and

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
everything that you're going to need and everything is

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.400
going to happen on this screen. You have a couple of

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.220
knobs here, and that's going to do some stitch lengths

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.140
and widths and this is where the little pen is going to

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.140
come in handy in order to get your settings going.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.000
And now that the machine is turned on you're able to

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.880
peel off this plastic. And they have set a sample in here

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.000
so that you can see that the machine is working fine.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.340
And now you can put on this large plate.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.100
Your foot has to be up and it's just going to slide right

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.200
into place, locking on these little pins on the front and

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.980
the back.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.100
Now you have a large surface that you're going to be

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.060
able to sew with. You have a little window here so that

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.500
you can see to change your bottom.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.020
Now we need to find her a nice new home to sit in and,

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.040
well, I'm good to go.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.460
So I'm going to take time. I'm going to read the manual

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.340
and I'm going to become familiar with my new friend.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.920
And will I use my old friends? Absolutely, but I'm very

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.700
excited and getting to know my new friend a whole lot

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.200
better.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.760
