so if you guys can remember are lots of
happiness or abhilash naked it shifts

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.410
after bride her a bottom to make an
appearance if she was one of the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.260
luxuries we're going to have her father
mr

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.369
okay

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.549
anyway so people were really upset about
this they're calling a racist and uh...

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:27.689
serena

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.819
emailed u_s_a_ today to kind of talk
about and share her thoughts on in his

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:36.800
mission to set i don't care an i would
call her my friend and i don't think she

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.190
meant anything racist biet she continues
to read at the end of the day i spent my

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.360
time to spend my time focus on things to
become better

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.550
and not bring me down i must add if
people feel this way she should take

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.130
reason to do something different next
time

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.780
no that's not very

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.720
their goods

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.130
defensive

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.660
okay so that citizens have debate on the
show you and i were on the side of their

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.859
friends it's not racist they're they're
just goofing around

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.560
jesse came out not to say i was a little
surprised by that he was

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.950
then overruled by the entirety what the
supreme court even though he's arrived

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.700
in america responded and has an extra
votes tonight it's but nonetheless he

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.500
lost and we decided that it was not
racist and we partner right

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.670
uh... but

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.880
he landed on the something

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.220
cricket we're ido but

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.060
uh... because

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.440
defense is not a very good is a reason
why she prays that weird

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.950
i know cal

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.909
and i would call her my friend react i
wasn't

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.180
you know right away freezing it but it's
not as big as though she stripped over

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.310
the world she's not speaking she wrote
in email

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.590
the probably were publicist another
couple of people looked at this and the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.450
the press rate

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.530
i would call her my friend is a way of
saying and i really like what you do it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.700
right i think the very last statement
really clarifies that because she

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.350
basically says wallace other people are
offended by it will maybe she should

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.240
think

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.220
twice before doing something like that
yeah i mean it's

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.520
almost or her on the bus

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.990
not quite an issue so there are on their
elective in equal parts of and reduce

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.190
your risk of the case you can recover
it's okay

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.900
but uh...

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.310
and it's an integral weeks to send this
out look if i did a prank where i a did

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.909
something against you or something and i
made funny you

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.099
and

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.689
everybody's asking you to close to eight
p

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.010
sexist or whatever right

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.019
against you

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.699
he takes several weeks to respond i'd be
like

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.279
can i get a lawyer can you help a
brother how would wednesday ten so long

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.559
to write you have any you put out a
statement

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.370
i guess i would call jack my friend
buddy the watches that's

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.760
but but not now

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.980
that was it a reimbursement yet so
apparently

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.900
you know she was a little bit more upset
about it then we would have thought

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.739
yeah and i think that if she's upset she
has a right to be upset you know it

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.719
and unless of without it

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:05.719
well if she doesn't like anyone

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.920
bigger in at the time and the groups et
cetera et cetera so i'm really fixed and

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.239
so that's why i did

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.999
dishing out the pardons left and right
if jimmy door did this catch word comes

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.829
