00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:28.978
Step 1: Downloading QBC source code.

00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:46.306
Step 2: Compiling. Type "make" to compile.
I used "make -j4" to compiler it faster (utilizes parallel processors).

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:59.435
All these scrolling messages are GCC's messages (or commandlines). It happens automatically.

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:18.993
Step 3 (optional): Running "qb --help" to see the commandline options of QBC.

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:34.673
Step 4: Downloading QBNES source code.
I use Wget for downloading, you can use something else if you like.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:52.500
Step 5: Compiling QBNES using QBC.
Type: "pathto/qb cpu.bas"
I added "-Ofast" option to build an optimized build, and "-o qbnes" to generate an executable file called "qbnes" rather than "a.out" which is default.

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:09.134
Final step: Running QBNES.
Type: "./qbnes ntdec5n1.nes" to load the cartridge image from "ntdec5n1.nes".

00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:33.928
A reminder that most of this lagginess is caused by the screen recorder, which cannot keep up with the refreshing rate of the window. I have slow hardware.
