00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:15.550
Whatoplay presents the Top 10 PC Games of
2015 So Far.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.970
Our ranking is not a personal opinion.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.650
It's based on a 1 to 10 score that aggregates
gamers and critics' reviews into a unique

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.620
score called playscore.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.340
Ranked 10 is Deathtrap.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.790
Tower defense and fantasy fans, this is our
game!

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.970
Your mission is to keep demons from reaching
the portal into our world.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.770
It's just another TD game.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.329
Deathtrap adds elements of action RPG that
adds a layer of complexity into its gameplay.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.520
The presentation and sound are okay.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.850
But playing it is so much fun.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.699
Especially coop with friends!

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.171
It holds a playscore of 8.8.

00:00:53.171 --> 00:01:00.070
9th is Five Nights at Freddy's 3.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.100
I know.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.100
I know.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.559
I was surprised, too.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.040
But it seems that the popularity of the first
two games helped keep this one on the highly-rated

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040
list.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.060
So, what's different?

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.330
There's only one animatronic, and the rest
are your hallucinations.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.660
The jump-scares are still there but it's more
subtle and frightening.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.340
It feels and plays as if the game has matured.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.140
A playscore of 8.8.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.700
Number 8 is Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee - New
n Tasty.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.710
This is an outstanding remake of a classic
platformer released more than 10 years ago.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.080
Better graphics, now supporting up-to 4K resolution.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.210
The controls aren't as tight but not game-breaking.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.500
And it's still as fun-to-play as the original.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.680
Overall, New n Tasty has kept the charm that
made it a hit years ago.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.550
It holds a playscore of 8.9.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.210
Ranked number 7 is The Escapists.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.480
This is an awesome game where you play as
a prisoner and your goal is to break-out of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480
prison.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.110
There are hundreds of ways to escape.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.110
But it's not that simple.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.750
You need to prepare, craft items, find resources,
level your character and a lot more before

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.610
you can try an escape.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.020
It's hilarious, surprisingly truthful, and
challenging.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.090
A playscore of 8.9.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.730
In sixth place is Hand of Fate.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.770
It's hard to describe how it plays.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.210
There are cards, battles and some 'role-playing'
and these elements flawlessly combine to form

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.140
something unique and enjoyable.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.960
Thumbs up to the game-master's voice acting.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.200
The graphics is average and combat is too
simple.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.480
But it has high replay value as each session
feels and plays differently.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.190
It receives a playscore of 8.9.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.580
Ranked number 5 is Grow Home.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.460
This is a relaxing platformer that centers
on the adventures of a Botanical Utility Droid

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.310
or BUD as he tries to find his way back home.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.400
It's not particularly challenging but it presents
enough difficulty that keeps runs interesting.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.600
Platforming is polished and the controls are
intuitive.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.520
And the lively cell-shaded visuals further
enhances its casual atmosphere.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.060
A playscore of 9 out of 10.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.069
Number 4 is Cities: Skylines.

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.930
This is a fantastic city builder that lets
you construct &amp; manage beautiful sprawling

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.040
city, with great details.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.090
It gets all the basics right:

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.680
Simple user interface.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.040
Big land area for expanding your city.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.190
It has an active modding community so we'll
see some crazy mods in the coming months.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.240
And like other well-designed city builder,
it's addicting.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.730
Cities: Skylines has a playscore of 9.1.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.410
Ranked third is Pillars of Eternity.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.460
This is it, Baldur's Gate fans.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.220
This is what we've been waiting for!

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.400
An incredibly deep role-playing game oozing
with content.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.160
There are tons of lores to explore and the
absurd amount of detail on the environment,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.890
narrative and NPCs is extraordinary!

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.660
And, of course, the combat is top-notch.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.660
Opps.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.900
I just couldn't stop singing praises for this
game.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.490
A playscore of 9.1.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.909
Second is Life is Strange.

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:31.029
This is an episodic game that stands on the
appeal of its realistic characters to draw

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:32.029
you in.

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:35.319
A feat it succeeded with flying colors.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.919
Characters are well-developed, despite the
average voice acting.

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.919
The tensions and settings perfectly captures
early adulthood.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.710
And if offers enough twists in gameplay and
story to keep it grounded.. and to look forward

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.569
to the next episodes

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.990
A playscore of 9.2.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.100
And the highest-rated of 2015 so far is Ori
and the Blind Forest.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.460
This is one of the finest platformer I've
played.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.310
It looks beautiful and playing it is so rewarding.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.280
You play as a young orphan on a mission to
save your home forest.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.689
It excels in every aspect:
A gripping story

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.120
Stunning visuals &amp; animations
Solid platforming

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.809
And I love the soundtrack!

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:25.110
A playscore of 9.4

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:36.589
To recap, here are the Top 10 Best PC Games
of 2015 So Far
