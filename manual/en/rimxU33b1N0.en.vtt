Hi I'm Melody on behalf of Expert Village
I'm going to show you how to deep fried breaded

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.220
oysters. We have some ingredients and we will
go over here. Here we have some oysters that

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.779
we bought at the store we bought in a jar.
You could get them in many different ways

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.249
plus just out of the ocean. So you pick your
way to get your oysters just do this to cook

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.749
them and you will be doing fine. You could
actually do this type of cooking out on the

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:34.910
barbecue and at the beach. We are going to
put them onto some egg that as been beat,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.350
we are going to throw a little bit of flour
on it and then we are going to put it onto

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:46.240
a breading and smash the breading onto the
egg and flour mix so it is covered very well.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.870
It looks lie this, we are going to set here
for a second and we are going to do another

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.690
on. See jsut put into a egg make sure that
it is cover. Put into the flour that is the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:16.740
messy part it sticks to your fingers, get
that breading in there and you clean off your

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:27.159
hands. Then put them in the deep fryer our
temperature is about 375 degrees and that

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.090
is a okay temperature it could be a little
bit less if you wanted to have a little bit

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:41.829
more time watching to take them out. I'm just
going to go ahead and set this down in there,

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:50.940
try to keep them as flat as possible and I
will just get them started and we would see

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.920
how many minutes this takes. Alright I think
this are just about done, I'm going ot take

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:05.219
a look here. Okay those are nice and brown.
Let me just grab a towel here my hands where

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.670
a little damp I dont want start a bunch of
grease thing going on. Alright we are we said

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.500
that we where going to make you some nice
breaded oysters and here we are, we try to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.810
keep them flat as possible. You decorate your
plate with little vegetables and there you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.090
