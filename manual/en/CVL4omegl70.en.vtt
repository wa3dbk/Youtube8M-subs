00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.230
I everyone and welcome to the last of Nicko's Kitchen's Australia Day special

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.970
and today we're going to go out with a BANG

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.970
we're making Tim Tam Cake Pops, 
so much fun - so let's get started!

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.140
Tim Tam Cake Pops

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.920
so easy to do and they are going to taste delicious!

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.939
let me tell you

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.680
Now we're going to use the food processor for this.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.739
ok? And it's the easiest way to do
it you can get food processors now

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.610
they're so cheap to buy.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.790
And the first thing that we're going to be adding in is some

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.020
Philadelphia

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.090
cream cheese at room temperature.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.660
And the star ingredient of course is
going to be Tim Tams. Argueably

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.490
Australia's favorite

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.480
biscuit or cookie. It's a chocolate
coated

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.010
biscuit as we call them here in Australia. You can get all different types. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.880
I'm using the original type here.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.510
And you can get them all around the world, you can get them and they are sold, so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.620
you just have to find them

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.360
in one of those world markets or something like that, I'm sure you will pick 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.070
them up.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.150
And all I'm doing is just popping them

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.250
straight in.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.050
Just breaking them in half

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.080
Then I'm going to give it a pulse a couple of times.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.700
litter it.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.340
So this is the mixture that we're after, just 
like that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.480
nice and smooth, creamy.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.090
And now we can start shaping our cake pops.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.880
So guys, I've just got a plate with some baking paper on it.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.900
And using clean hands I'm just gonna roll
these

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.259
into ball shapes and just place them

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.280
on the baking paper and just keep repeating that
process with the mixture that you have.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.250
And all I need you to do now is pop your balls into 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.010
the freezer - the Tim Tam ones I'm talking about.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.060
And I want you to pop them in there for about a half an hour just to chill.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.380
Ok and we want them to firm up. So guys, I've just brought them out of the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.470
freezer and it's very important: what
will happen once you put them in their

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.600
initially

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.320
they'll get a little flat spot

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.479
on the bottom so what I want you to do is
just again

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.249
mix them, roll them

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.139
into those ball shapes. 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.469
It'll be a little bit harder this time, because they've

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.009
almost sort of set if you like

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.379
in the freezer but we're just going to roll them around and recreate

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.969
that ball shape. Now

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.329
repeat that process with the balls that you have and pop them back in the freezer

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.899
for another five minutes.

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:31.359
What we are going to do now is insert these cake pop

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.369
sticks now if you don't have these you can buy these

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.919
at a cake store, cake decorating store or kitchen shop.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.090
But if you can't get your hands on them, 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.299
just use a normal skewer.

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.349
uh... that you would use for kebab
or something like that will do

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.469
just fine and all I'm going to do

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.929
is just straight down.

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:54.259
Now what I've got here guys is some melted chocolate, I've just got some of those 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:55.859
chocolate chips

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.369
pop them in the microwave for about a
minute

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.059
and I've just let the chocolate cool

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.329
for about five minutes so it's not that real intense heat

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.739
when it comes

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.349
out of the microwave. And I'm just going to grab one of the

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.679
balls here

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.979
and just dip it in,

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.239
okay, bring it back up

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.439
and just let the excess

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.079
chocolate just drip off.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.549
Just keep repeating that process

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.150
and then we can decorate them

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.150
and then stick them in the freezer
just for five minutes just to chill.

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:37.110
So there you have it guys. There's my Tim Tam cake pops.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.459
Really simple to do, fun

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.839
and you can save these up for dessert
on Australia day. 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.589
Everyone can get stuck in. Just pick it up.

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:46.879
pop it and you go

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.189
and just go for broke and 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.209
they will be so delicious.

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.479
Now let's get 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.409
eating them, shall we? So we're going to give one of these cake pops a try. 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.059
i love these, I love the Tim Tams in them

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:05.149
let's go!

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.849
Oh yeah. Ohohoh!

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.329
you know what?

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.569
Some people go "It's not really a cake pop because it's not a cake"

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.209
But it's like a cheesecake pop.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.769
Because it's like that

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.489
Tim Tam cheesecake thing meeting up and that chocolate crust on the outside. 

00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:28.939
It's like a choc bomb. If you were in Australia you would know what a choc bomb is,

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.009
that crunch when you go through

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.569
that is amazing the flavor of that

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.780
is just sensational.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.550
So I hope you enjoyed these Tim Tam cake pop as much as I did, whole lot of fun. 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.020
And they do look fantastic

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.509
