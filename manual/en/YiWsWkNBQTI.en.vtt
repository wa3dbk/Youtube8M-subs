00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:08.116
The reason I started shoeing

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.681
was because I had a horse
that had problems with its hooves.

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:14.776
And I had trouble
getting them to shoe it

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:16.536
the way I wanted
it to be shod.

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:19.320
And so eventually I applied
for the college course.

00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:22.824
And it was difficult to get accepted as I was a girl,

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189
because it was actually designed for guys.

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:29.497
But after a lot of persuasion and a long
apprenticeship, I eventually got in,

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:31.986
and that was about 30 years ago.

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:39.142
It can be hard going sometimes,
particularly in the winter.

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:43.659
It’s cold, it’s draughty,
it’s wearing on your body.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:49.315
But you also have to make sure
that you do more

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.422
than just stand there shoeing,

00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:54.796
and that is, for example,
riding,

00:00:54.831 --> 00:01:00.421
exercising in some way, swimming,
doing something completely different.

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:12.198
To become a farrier I think you have to

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:16.845
firstly really like horses, you have to have
a huge amount of experience of being around horses.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.310
And then you have to have a good body, be in good shape.

00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:27.058
You also have to be able to plan,

00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:35.656
take responsibility when it comes to customers,
arrive on time, deal with paperwork,

00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:39.299
be able to do everything
relating to running a business.

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:44.348
Because most of us generally have our own business.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.662
In this profession you don’t just stand there shoeing,

00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:52.368
there are a lot of different things you can do.

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:57.945
You can give talks like I do a fair amount. You can work internationally.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.708
A lot of people have travelled the world
in their profession.

00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:05.689
There are also a lot of options for further development.

00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:15.566
The best thing about the profession is getting to work
with something you really enjoy

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.863
and for me that’s horses,

00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:21.439
which I think is actually the most enjoyable thing there is.
