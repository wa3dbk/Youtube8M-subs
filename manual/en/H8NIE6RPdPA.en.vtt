00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.270
Hello, I’m Barbara.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:17.640
Today we’re going to be painting an easy
animal.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:28.210
I’ll be using the Wacom Intuous tablet,
and Artrage Lite.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.589
I’m using the pencil tool and creating a
sketch to begin.

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:43.739
I’m using very simple shapes to sketch an
owl.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.890
Next we’ll outline in ink.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.499
Let’s add a layer, bring it below, and switch
to the ink pen tool.

00:00:51.499 --> 00:01:05.780
Select the smoothed inking preset, change
smoothing to 40%, and follow your sketch.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.100
I’ll bring smoothing up to 80% for the moon.A
slightly larger tool tip for the telephone

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.640
lines.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.220
These go on a new layer.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.480
We’ll can use the eraser to bring the wing
and feet into the foreground.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.080
No softness, and pressure to 100%.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.920
I’ll pick the watercolor brush, bring a
new layer below the rest, and choose a dark

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.180
blue.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.230
Keeping my tool tip at 200%.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:57.350
I’ll just cover the whole area first, using
long strokes starting off-canvas.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.340
Next I’ll clean up my moon, stars, and owl
using the eraser.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.780
Softness zero, pressure all the way up, this
will give us a very sharp edge.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.750
I’m adjusting my tool tip size depending
on the area.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.260
For these smaller stars, using the zoom helps
a lot.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.410
To zoom, I’m using the buttons on the upper
right of my tablet.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.760
Next let’s add a layer, go back to the brush
tool, pick a really dark blue, and paint our

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760
trees.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.890
I’ll shrink my tool tip now and do a second
pass.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.410
Let’s do a little clean up with the eraser.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:57.750
I’ll add a layer, pick a pale yellow for
the stars and moon, and start to paint.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.060
We can turn off the sketch layer now.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.010
I like the effect it gives when you leave
just a little white on the edges here.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.390
To undo, I’m using the bottom left button.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.970
For the face of the owl let’s use a light
brown.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:33.370
I’m moving the stylus in small circles to
darken the area around the eyes.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.380
And a smaller tool tip for the beak.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.459
I’m using a warmer tone for the body.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.050
My brushstrokes follow the natural direction
of the wing.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.560
A smaller tool tip and darker color for the
feet.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.710
For feathers, I pick a similar color, use
the ‘dried strokes’ preset, turn insta-dry

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.930
on, adjust my thinners, and set my tool tip
to 100%.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.700
Watercolor is additive, so these strokes will
be darkened by the layer beneath.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.519
Im using a flick of the wrist to achieve these
narrowing strokes.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:29.070
I’ll switch colors and continue on the owl’s
chest, then add a bit of shadow on the edges.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:38.870
I’ll duplicate our ink layer, and change
its blend mode to shadow.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.870
I like this darkness better, but just for
the owl, to make it stand out.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:53.970
I’ll switch to the eraser and get rid of
everything but the owl on this layer.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.550
One more layer, we’ll add a little white
to the eyes.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.500
With that bit of highlight, I think we’re
done!

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.940
I hope this video was helpful, thanks so much
for watching.
