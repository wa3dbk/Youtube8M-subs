How to succeed in making a Genoise with Chef Sylvain

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Start by breaking the eggs in saucepan, add the caster sugar, then whisk everything.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Heat the mixture at around 50 °C while continuing to whisk. Regarding the temperature, you can use a thermometer or simply your finger to check the mixture. When using your finger, you should feel the heat but it shouldn't burn your finger.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Pour the mixture in a tank , then whisk until complete cooling. You should see the mixture turning white and gaining volume. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Sieve the first half of flour on the mixture, mix softly with a wooden spatula going all the way down to the bottom of the tank and turning the tank at the same time. Add the rest of sieved flour, and mix until complete blending.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Butter a 22cm diameter non-stick baking pan for Genoise, that you also flour if the baking pan is getting old. Then, pour the mixture into the baking pan.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Bake the Genoise for 15 to 20 minutes in a 210 °C preheated oven, while keeping an eye on the baking process.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
When the Genoise is out, unmould the Genoise on a metal grid and leave it to rest. After about 10 minutes, flip the Genoise to avoid the creation of a hollow and to ensure that it stays straight.
