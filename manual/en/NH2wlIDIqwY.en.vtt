MY LIFE AS A VIDEO GAME - Featurette #2

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.259
SPACE COMBAT (Starfox, Wing Commander, Space Invaders, Star Citizen)

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.480
So when it came to the Space Combat episodes,
that was interesting because the tone really

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.640
changes for those episodes.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.110
Space combat simulator episodes are great
because it's some of the best special effects

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.620
in the entire first season.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.050
"Disable their engines"

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.050
When I first saw the spaceship I was like...
"So what's the from?" and then I realised

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.970
it's actually from "the show", it's really
amazing.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.159
"Everybody holding on tight?"

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.900
"Cause we're probably gonna die!"

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.330
Before we had the first person shooter, which
was a lot of action and some funny stuff then

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.470
you had the beat 'em up episodes, which were
mostly comical episodes, but had of fights

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.100
in between and stuff. But the Space ones are
a lot more serious than the other ones and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.900
that I think is because the tone of those
games is more serious, you look at games like

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.290
Wing Commander

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.050
The Space episodes were really interesting
actually because that's the end of season

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.280
one and it's where Kera's walls really start
to come down.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.610
"Let me take the helm"

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.540
"I Got this"

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.850
"What?"

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.050
"Just trust me will you?"

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.720
"Ohhhh... this should be fun!"

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.940
I think the space ones are going to be some
of the most interesting because shooting these

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.600
episodes we get a bit more seriousness to
it and especially learn a lot more about Kera

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.250
and her character and bit more about Menu
and the effect he's had on her, that he's

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.550
very protective over her.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.550
Unknowingly, Don kinda gets let in to what's
going on and it's really nice for her to have

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.320
someone to talk to.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.510
"...Cocky as a all hell and worse than you
when it came to dashing into danger..."

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.959
"But he always put others ahead of himself."

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.959
But at the same time she's still this hardened
space-girl fighter and it's a really interesting

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:20.790
juxtaposition.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.739
Each arc that we're doing gives us a different
perspective really.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.769
I like space shows, I'm a Star Trek fan, so
I was excited to actually be a part of something

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:31.939
like that.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.209
I almost had basically a mental breakdown
every other week and said "Screw it! I'm not

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.730
doing any more!" but in the end we've all
pushed through and I'm really proud of the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.680
final product. Very, very proud of it. And
I hope you guys enjoy it too.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.849
