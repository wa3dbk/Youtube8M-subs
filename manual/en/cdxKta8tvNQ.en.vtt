Hey, Brewster. How about a cup of coffee?

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.060
[Brewster] No problem! Would you like to try the Pigeon Blend?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.700
Sure. Sounds good.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.340

Pigeon milk.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.240
Okay, not only is that disgusting...

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.800

Woah, Nook! What are you doing?!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.360
[Tom Nook] Oh. I'm expanding your house.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.220
Without asking me?

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.380
[Tom Nook] Don't worry, I'm designing it around what YOU want.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.960
For example... um... What color do you want the roof to be?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.560
Don't change my roof! I just painted it red!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.480
[Tom Nook] See, it's red. Totally designed around YOU!

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.440

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.800
Well, see ya.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.800
Uh, by the way!

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.980
You owe me for this, and it costs more than the entire rest of your house.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.940
*sigh*

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.460
Seriously, what the hell, Nook?!

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.580
*shock*

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.200
[Resetti] Hey, uh, I swear I wasn't looking up your dress from here.

Don't worry, I didn't think you were trying to look up my dre-

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.960
WELL, SURE, ACCUSE THE MOLE OF IT, YOU KNOW I'M BLIND, RIGHT, THAT'S OFFENDING TO THE DISABLED!

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.160
IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT MAKE PEOPLE LIKE ME SICK OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU!

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.000
MY PATIENCE GAUGE IS OFFICIALLY ON EMPTY!

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.540
YOU PEOPLE THINK THIS IS JUST A GAME SO YOU COULD MESS AROUND ALL YOU LIKE WITH NO CONSEQUENCES!

ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME? JESUS CHRIST! THE NERVE OF YOU PEOPLE! I SWEAR I OUGHT TO BURROW OUTTA THIS TOWN

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.520
AND TRY TO FIND A CITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GRATEFUL FOR WHAT THEY HAVE

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.200
INSTEAD OF THROWING AROUND THEIR STUPID ACTIONS YELLING YOLO OMG YOLO

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.720
When REALLY, they just plan on hitting THE FREAKIN RESET BUTTON
