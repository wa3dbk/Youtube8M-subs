&gt;&gt; Hilah: Hey dudes!

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.201
I am Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I have
a special, frosty cocktail surprise for you.

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:05.240
You want a hint?

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.430
Here’s a joke.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.999
Knock, knock, who’s there?

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:08.999
Man.

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:09.999
Man who?

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:10.999
Man, go get me a margarita.

[Mango Margarita Recipe ]

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:24.199
&gt;&gt; Hilah: For this recipe we’re going to
use one of these ataulfo mangos, this short

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.449
of kidney-shaped thing.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.909
To me they’re really sweeter and less fibrous
than those big bulbous ones.

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.610
I am not sure what those are called, the ones
that are like green and pink when they are

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.610
ripe.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.200
These don’t ever turn pink.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.830
They just get this this beautiful golden-yellow
color when they are ripe, and they feel soft,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.720
and they smell like delicious mangos, so I
have got one cubed here.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.180
We are just doing one margarita because let’s
face it, you’re probably drinking alone,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.440
like me.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.440
Just kidding.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.680
Okay, so I’ve got about a half of a mango
here, and you want some ice.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.180
If you wanted to make this even more frosty
and frozen, you could freeze the mango first,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.760
but I rarely think that far ahead, so, this
is how mine goes.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.510
And then some lime juice.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.400
Squeeze that into here.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.810
Oh my God!

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.900
This is making a huge mess.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.940
Good thing I am not already drunk.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.630
It’d be like a way huge mess, right?

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.600
Okay, somebody is going to have to clean that
up later.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.070
&gt;&gt; Hilah: We’re replacing basically some
of the sweetness of the orange liquer with

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.850
the sweetness of the mango, so the riper the
better, and you can buy mango chunks frozen

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.850
already.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.850
They are fine.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.820
They are usually not as sweet as a really,
good fresh mango that you picked out with

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.110
your own two hands and your nose.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.980
Let’s do the tequila first.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.530
Two of them.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.080
Aye, yi, yi.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.270
I don’t usually like promote brands, but
this is a local Texas, orange liqueur that’s

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.549
very good.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.330
So, you know.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.180
Go Texas!

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:18.190
One of them, and just like half of a lime,
half an ounce of lime juice, and then if you

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.750
have an ice crush setting on your blender,
use that one.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.860
[Blending]

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.530
&gt;&gt; Hilah: That’s my favorite sound is when
the blender turns off because that means it’s

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.810
drink time, it’s drink time, everybody loves
drink time, and I have a special, salty rim

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.849
thing I am going to show you.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.849
Ta da!

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.440
So this is just a mixture of salt, sugar,
and chili powder, so one part salt, one part

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.060
chili powder, and then two parts of sugar,
and just mix, I don't know, it’s a fun,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.730
little deal, so I’ve got a little wedge
here, not a wedgy.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.630
Just cut a little slit in it, and then just
use that to sort of rooop!

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.850
Remember to do this before you fill up your
glass with your margarita.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.980
And then we just swirl it around in this goodness,
and this tastes delicious and also I like

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.180
this color contrast with this sort of brick
red, chili powder rim with the bright orange

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.180
mango.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:22.000
That smells awesome, and that mango just gives
it a really silky, smooth texture.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.160
Oh, man.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.870
Should have one of those giant margarita glasses,
but I don’t.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.099
Okay, and then we can garnish it with a little
yoink!

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.319
Oh, hmmm.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.760
Take a little sister.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.860
Hmmmmm.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.960
Mmmmmm.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.360
Oh, man, that’s awesome.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.460
Mmmmmm.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.860
I almost said the F-word, but the goodness
of the fruit compelled me not to.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.860
That is awesome.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.880
This is better than any frozen margarita you’ll
ever get in a restaurant I bet you a hundred

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.880
dollars.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.650
Well, you there you go, another lovely summertime
cocktail that I hope you will enjoy.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.870
Yeah, mangos, they are awesome.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.870
I love them.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.519
They are good source of vitamin A also, so
thanks for watching.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.890
If you have any questions or if you have any
ideas of other fruits that you’d like to

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:20.620
put in your margaritas, please leave them
below and have a great week!

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:34.190
Bye guys!
