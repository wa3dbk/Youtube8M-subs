00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.233
The president:
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:06.066
This morning I want to extend
to the people of Haiti the deep

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:09.100
condolences and unwavering
support of the American people

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.133
following yesterday's
terrible earthquake.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.233
We are just now beginning
to learn the extent of the

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:21.800
devastation, but the reports
and images that we've seen of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.800
collapsed hospitals,
crumbled homes,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.300
and men and women carrying their
injured neighbors through the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.400
streets are truly
heart-wrenching.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.800
Indeed, for a country and a
people who are no strangers to

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.900
hardship and suffering, this
tragedy seems especially cruel

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.967
and incomprehensible.

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:42.900
Our thoughts and prayers are
also with the many Haitian

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.367
Americans around our country
who do not yet know the fate of

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.600
their families and
loved ones back home.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.333
I have directed my
administration to respond with a

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:56.934
swift, coordinated, and
aggressive effort to save lives.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:01:00.133
The people of Haiti will have
the full support of the

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.767
United States in the urgent effort to rescue those trapped beneath

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:08.467
the rubble, and to deliver the
humanitarian relief -- the food,

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:12.667
water and medicine -- that
Haitians will need in the coming days.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:16.934
In that effort, our government,
especially USAID and the

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:20.567
Departments of State and Defense
are working closely together and

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:24.800
with our partners in Haiti, the
region, and around the world.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.900
Right now our efforts are
focused on several urgent priorities.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.000
First, we're working
quickly to account for U.S.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.266
embassy personnel and their
families in Port-au-Prince,

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:39.200
as well as the many American
citizens who live and work in Haiti.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.834
Americans trying to locate
family members in Haiti are

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:49.100
encouraged to contact the State
Department at 888/407-4747.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.233
I'm going to repeat
that - 888/407-4747.

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:58.867
Second, we've mobilized
resources to help rescue efforts.

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:02.200
Military overflights have
assessed the damage,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.233
and by early afternoon our
civilian disaster assistance

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:08.200
team are beginning to arrive.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.600
Search and rescue
teams from Florida,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.734
Virginia and California will
arrive throughout today and

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:17.433
tomorrow, and more rescue and
medical equipment and emergency

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:20.333
personnel are being prepared.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:24.166
Because in disasters such as
this the first hours and days

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:27.934
are absolutely critical to
saving lives and avoiding even

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:31.500
greater tragedy, I have
directed my teams to be as

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.333
forward-leaning as possible in
getting the help on the ground

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:40.967
and coordinating with our
international partners as well.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.900
Third, given the many different
resources that are needed,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.567
we are taking steps to ensure
that our government acts in a unified way.

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:52.166
My national security team has
led an interagency effort overnight.

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:54.633
And to ensure that we coordinate
our effort, going forward,

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:56.967
I've designated the
administrator of the U.S.

00:02:56.967 --> 00:03:00.633
Agency for International
Development, Dr. Rajiv Shah,

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:04.367
to be our government's
unified disaster coordinator.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:08.333
Now, this rescue and recovery
effort will be complex and challenging.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.400
As we move resources into Haiti,
we will be working closely with

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.834
partners on the ground,
including the many NGOs from

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:19.200
Haiti and across Haiti, the
United Nations Stabilization

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.867
Mission, which appears to
have suffered its own losses,

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:24.333
and our partners in the
region and around the world.

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:27.734
This must truly be an
international effort.

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:30.333
Finally, let me just say that
this is a time when we are

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:33.533
reminded of the common
humanity that we all share.

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:37.867
With just a few hundred miles
of ocean between us and a long

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:41.734
history that binds us together,
Haitians are neighbors of the

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:44.266
Americas and here at home.

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:48.066
So we have to be there for
them in their hour of need.

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:51.367
Despite the fact that we are
experiencing tough times here at

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:55.233
home, I would encourage those
Americans who want to support

00:03:55.233 --> 00:04:00.667
the urgent humanitarian efforts
to go to whitehouse.gov where

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:03.633
you can learn how to contribute.

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:06.834
We must be prepared for
difficult hours and days ahead

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:09.834
as we learn about the
scope of the tragedy.

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:13.533
We will keep the victims and
their families in our prayers.

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:16.166
We will be resolute
in our response,

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:18.533
and I pledge to the people of
Haiti that you will have a

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:23.533
friend and partner in the United
States of America today and going forward.

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:28.033
May God bless the people of
Haiti and those working on their behalf.

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:29.033
Thank you very much.
