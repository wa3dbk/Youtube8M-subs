00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.160
So, what are you doing for Christmas?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.749
I actually have four days leave. I'm
going to head home.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.119
That's great! Where's home?

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.880
Uhhhhh...

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.830
Kamino.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.150
Riiiiight.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.219
Ohhh, now what?

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.590
There's been a lot of unusual activity today.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.260
Sector 9 is already on high alert.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.960
Well it's about to get worse. Looks like we have
an intruder.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.260
This doesn't look good. I'll
inform Lord Vader.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.520
This is KZ-914 reporting from control room 7715.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.180
We have confirmation of an intruder in Sector 9.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.160
Thank you trooper. Lord Vader,
there's trouble in Sector 9.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.990
Yes, I have felt it.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.400
We have an intruder.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.680
I've got a bad feeling about this.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.290
There's been too much unusual activity already.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.200
I shall dispatch additional men to
Sector 9 immediately.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.560
See to it. I want this finished immediately.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.330
No intruders will get out of here alive!

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.120
Lord Vader, we have captured the intruder.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.700
He was discovered in Sector 9
exiting his vehicle.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.180
It was a crude, open-hull design.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.800
There was no sign of any
communication devices whatsoever.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.550
We were able to confirm with the main tower that he
had sent no communication or signals of any kind.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.530
His craft is secured; he has been 
completely locked down.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.710
Good work troopers.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.280
Tell me, what is your name?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.260
- Why, I'm Santa Claus!
- Huh?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.200
What is your mission, Santa Claus?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.530
I am here to spread joy throughout the galaxy!

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.460
Captain...

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.039
take the prisoner to the detention center
now and prepare for his immediate execution.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.519
I will sign the orders myself.

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.629
Woah, woah!

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.029
Lord Vader, a moment please...

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.489
...perhaps you should reconsider?

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.000
Do you not know who this is?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.709
- It's Santa!
- SANTA!

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.909
Excuse me?

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.409
Yes my Lord, Santa Claus.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.000
Once a year Santa travels throughout the galaxy
delivering toys to all the good boys and girls.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.309
TOYS!!!!!!!

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.540
I don't understand...

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.299
...what's his scheme?

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.509
There is no scheme sir...

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.779
...and no ill intentions whatsoever.
He simply delivers toys.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.919
He is

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.689
pure goodness.

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.910
A-ha! You say he delivers toys do you?

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.659
Well...

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:47.490
...where are they?

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.449
Was he captured with anything else?

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:50.919
Just this sack Lord Vader.

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.419
Is this true?

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.419
Is what they are saying the truth?

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.299
Why, yes my child,
every word of it!

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.079
I have presents for all the
good boys and girls!

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.279
Goody, goody goody!

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.369
If you will allow me, I have your
presents here with me now!

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:07.769
Very well.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.939
Now, let's see here...

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.989
...yes, yes!
TK-421...

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.169
...here is something for you!

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.399
Hoo-ray! It's a day-planner!

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.799
Now you'll know where you're
supposed to be...

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.659
...every minute of the day!

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:21.759
Yay!

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.699
And this is for you CS-316!

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.489
Wow! Power converters!

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.279
Now you won't have to go all
the way to Toche Station!

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.109
Ha-ha! So long Outer Rim!

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.009
And don't think I forgot
about you, Captain!

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.599
Ahh, a new comm-link!

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.599
With Bluetooth!

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.499
Exquisite!

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.659
Well, that was exciting! Now, if you
will be so kind, I must be on my way!

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.549
Ummmmm...

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.369
...aren't you forgetting someone?

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:53.140
No, no. I don't believe so. TK-421...

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.730
...CS-316...Captain...

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.149
No, no, that's...all.

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.449
Surely you must have something for me.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.029
It's not as if YOUR LIFE DEPENDS

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.279
ON IT or anything!

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.680
Oh, ahh, yes, you are correct!

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.629
I uhhh...

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.280
I do...

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.449
...have something for you; it's, it's
somewhere in here...

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.120
...ah, yes, this is it!

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.749
What madness is this?!?
Coal? COAL!?!?

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.449
Ugh, arrgh, urgh

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.229
Merry Christmas to all!

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.020
...and Happy Life Day!
