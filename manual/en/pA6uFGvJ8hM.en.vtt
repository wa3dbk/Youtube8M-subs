Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns dot com.
One of the rewarding things about turning

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:22.119
bowls from green wood is when you finally
turn and finish the bowl. This one I rough

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.160
turned 2 and one half years ago. At that point,
it weighted, according to my little cheat

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.620
sheet here, 910 grams. It promptly lost about
40% of its weight to 540 grams in about five

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.289
months. Then it didn’t lose much more for
the next two years.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:50.500
Now, I have a little bit more connection with
this bowl, this apricot bowl. Because, from

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.960
the same tree is the one that cold-conked
me when I was turning a piece of crotch. Now,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.370
that’s the piece that convinced me that,
even though I was wearing a face shield at

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.530
the time, that I should always wear a face
shield when I turn the lathe on. So, whenever

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.049
the lathe is running and I’m turning, even
though it is a spindle or bowl, I’m wearing

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.830
my face shield. Now, it should not take a
conk in the middle of the forehead to convince

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.540
anybody of that. I thought I was invincible
that proved that I wasn’t. So, wear your

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.100
face shield. Turn your green wood. And, enjoy
turning.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.290
Let’s turn it.
This bowl warped in a typical pattern. It

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.040
is somewhat oblong with raised peaks at the
end grain. The first thing I thought to do

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.229
is to flatten the top on the sanding disk.
This enables it to sit flag against a chuck

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.520
or faceplate. This bowl is almost too big
to flatten on a 12 inch sander.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.479
Then as I went to the lathe, I realized the
bowl fit just over my chuck. With this close

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.520
fit, I could have skipped sanding the rim.
Oh well, not all is lost – at least the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.820
rim is more even. I’ll center it with the
tailstock.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.730
Now to turn the exterior. I’m starting with
a medium bowl gouge. I’ll switch to a skew

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.110
to reform the tenon to make it round again.
The rough bowl is quite clunky. I want to

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.200
flatten the outside curve for a better flow.
The tenon is way too long to use as a base

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.400
as is.
I’m remounting the bowl to the chuck with

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.890
the tenon as quickly as possible. Before flipping
it around, there was too much variation to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.430
do any final cuts. Now that it is stable,
I’m shape the exterior a little more with

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.849
some shear scraping.
The exterior is looking pretty good now.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.749
Now for the interior. I’ll start with a
gouge and even out the rim. I’d rather do

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:06.409
this first so I can have a good entry surface
to re-hollow the interior.

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:12.709
Then I’m going for the interior. This goes
well. The apricot is hard but my gouge is

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:24.230
sharp. Hollowing is a series of cuts to reduce
the wall thickness and shape the interior.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.490
There are some small hairline cracks in the
end grain lip area from the drying process.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.510
I’m treating these with some thin CA glue
before I go on.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.730
Now I’m switching to scraping first with
a round nose scraper for the interior. This

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:53.720
apricot is looking really nice.
Now just a little bit more to clean up the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.950
exterior. The CA glue got a little sloppy.
I’m using a skew as a scraper on the convex

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:18.840
surface and a round nose scraper on the little
bit just below the lip.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.250
To finish the base, I’ve mounted the bowl
to my home-made Cole jaws. I’m carefully

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.790
cutting back the original tenon with a gouge.
Then I’m switching to scrapers to refine

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.289
the base.
After a bit more sanding, I can remove it

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:41.589
and apply a mineral oil and wax finish. By
the way, the finished bowl weight is 161 grams

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:49.539
a loss of another 40% of the original weight.
And, my apricot bowl is finished. Apricot

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:56.020
sure is a pretty wood. I’m glad I finally
bit the bullet and finished this bowl. I left

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.169
it for 2 and ½ years to dry which is far
from immediate gratification. I’ve seen

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.349
a lot of bowl turners with stacks and stacks
of bone dry rough bowls.
