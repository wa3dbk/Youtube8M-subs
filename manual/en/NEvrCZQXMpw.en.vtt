00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.963
I can remember, probably back
about 5-6 years old, my uncles

00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:11.420
took my brother and I to
the games quite often.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.470
A big Red Sox fan, watch them
in the World Series.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.239
Somehow, I just never made
it out to a game.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.710
Never made it even in Fenway.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.700
You know, watching the
Yankees, growing up.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.435
And obviously, the Red Sox,
whenever they play there, you

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:25.820
always see that venue on TV.
It's an historic venue, so

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.090
it's just going to be great
to be a part of it.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.110
Keep it simple.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.610
Get in, get it out.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.370
Stay on that puck, stay
on that puck.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.830
Get it behind, and get
it deep, and get

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.155
shots to the net.

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:45.800
Should be an awesome experience
to play outside at

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.580
Fenway Park, against
our rivals.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.348
It's what we've been waiting
for, let's go.

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:50.960
I couldn't ask for
anything more.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.655
All week, it's about
being simple.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:53.250
OK, we've got to
play together.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.020
Do the little things, just
like the kipper said.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.880
Up and down all night.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.660
Get the puck to the net.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.510
Back check your ass off, get
the puck to the net.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.400
We're going to do it together.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.657
Team on three, one, two, three.

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:03.114
Team!

00:01:03.114 --> 00:01:04.364
Let's go!

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.894
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:12.196
Let's go, Smitty.

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:13.760
You're definitely going to feel
like a little kid out

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.494
there, and you want to enjoy
every moment of it.

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:18.342
Here we go, huh?

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:19.728
Stevie!

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:20.560
Let's go!

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.200
I don't think anybody here has
played in a venue with as many

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.100
people in the stands.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.925
No big deal.

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:27.000
Hey, only 40,000
tonight, boys!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.488
Here we go!

00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:28.464
Oh, boys, take care.

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:29.928
Don't worry, boys,
don't worry!

00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:31.392
Just do your best tonight.

00:01:31.392 --> 00:01:32.856
Nothing but the best, boys.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490
I grew up playing outside.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.090
Had a backyard rink, plus
ponds in the area.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.330
And other guys had
backyard rinks.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.850
So we played outside all the
time growing up, but never

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.690
structured, just more for fun.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.350
When I was younger,
Lake Placid--

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.685
there's a rink, I must
have been 10.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.620
I played in a tournament,
and one of our

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.450
games was held outdoors.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.815
But having been outside, playing
hockey, besides the

00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:06.195
winter on the ponds [INAUDIBLE]
since then.

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:07.822
These two teams have
met one another

00:02:07.822 --> 00:02:08.985
quite a number of times.

00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:13.052
111th meeting all-time between
the University of Maine and

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:14.450
the University of
New Hampshire.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.060
Well I think it's always special
when we play Maine.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.490
We've had some great games
and some great venues.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.370
Whether it's been in Anaheim,
whether it's been here in the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.210
[? winter ?] up [? at Alphon. ?]

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.880
And now we're going to take it
to Fenway Park, and I think

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.184
it's two great programs to
get terrific support.

00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:30.112
U-N-H!

00:02:30.112 --> 00:02:31.076
U-N-H!

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:32.522
U-N-H!

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:35.420
U-N-H!

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.240
What do you plan on doing
if you score?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.540
Do you have any--

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.960
I don't know.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.160
Obviously, the BU game,
somebody hit the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.342
ball out of the park.

00:02:44.342 --> 00:02:46.690
I was thinking maybe have a
bunch of people line up and

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.130
slide into first base, or
something like that.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.260
Be spared the moment at
that point, I think.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.570
Downing gets a backhander with
[? Savers ?] made a big

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.018
rebound score!

00:02:55.018 --> 00:02:56.440
Henrion on the rebound!

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.920
I kind of sweeped the ice
coming up center.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.770
I just tried to hold it for
as long as I could.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.480
Wildcats take a one-nothing
lead, a minute and five

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.560
seconds into the game.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.802
Oh, it's awesome.

00:03:10.802 --> 00:03:12.880
To see him score the
first goal--

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.840
just to see him get
a goal is awesome.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.700
Anytime he can do that,
we really enjoy it.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.290
Goumas walking, it's
shorthanded.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.860
Goumas shot, score!

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.030
I tried to do a baseball
thing because you're

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.630
playing in a ballpark.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.820
A couple years ago, one of the
kids on [? BU ?] did a

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.480
[? in and out, ?]

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.870
this year the kid slid.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.950
So I just tried to come up with
something different that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.595
was new, so I did a
home run signal.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.425
[? Zap! ?]

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:37.910
Zap!

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.395
Zap!

00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:38.880
Zap!

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.850
[? Zap! ?]

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.280
Playing anybody at Fenway,
outdoors, at such a venue,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.860
would be awesome.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.864
But then to play Maine makes
it that much more special.

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:52.280
And we don't like them as a
team, and I really enjoy

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.130
playing them.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.420
Shuttled right back the
other way for Moses.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.365
He drops it into the zone, gives
[? it up ?] for Goumas

00:03:56.365 --> 00:03:58.450
for a shot, and he scores!

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.030
Goumas gets his second
of the game.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.570
It's something very
special, you know?

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.970
Playing in front of the
Whittemore Center,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.740
it's 6000, you know?

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.230
But this is just unbelievable,
and it's totally different,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.480
but it's a of fun.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.610
It says a lot for the program
and the university, obviously,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.320
the tradition of hockey.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.560
You obviously have to have a
great following in order for

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.165
the Boston Red Sox and their
organization to bring your

00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:24.480
program, your university,
to Fenway

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.730
Park to play an opponent.
