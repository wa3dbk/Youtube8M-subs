00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.100
you know when we talk about the voice of
God there are

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.850
there are times when God speaks audibly
 thats rare for most people I don't

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.529
you know maybe

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.180
 for you it's an everyday thing
for most people it's a pretty rare occurrence 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.340
so often when we talk about the voice of God
we're not talking about vibrations in

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.230
your ear drums

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.720
we are talking about something else...what
is that that we're trying to describe

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.560
I think with certain people
depending on the call even and how it

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.380
breaks down it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.860
tends to be a little more dominant in
certain ways to different people

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.200
but like you said yeah I mean the
audible voice of God we know its

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.670
biblical and it's for today and it's always
been

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.980
but it's a rarity

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.750
but I would say the voice of God looks
like many things, sometimes

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.230
like I mentioned, an unction, just an

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.460
inner knowing that has a peace that
passes all understanding but you just

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.000
I didn't you know as a light bulb went
off, just an unction, an inner  knowing is often

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.860
the Holy Spirit

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.750
a lot of times with me

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.240
the more predominant way is through
seeing you know it's very clear you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.320
You see in Jeremiah 1

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.420
verse 11 where the  Angel comes to Jeremiah

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.829
he says., "what do you see" he says "I see an almond branch" and how this practically 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.789
plays out to demystify it is sometimes
you'll be in prayer and your still in his

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.329
presence you know and all of a sudden

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.299
you'll see things sometimes it can even
be as simple as a picture in your mind's

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:31.679
eye

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.090
and God speaks through these
parables the pictures as well as an

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.950
almond branch in Jeremiah 1

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.149
that the angel went on to tell him this
speaks of God watching over his

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.630
word to perform it...you see this is often how dreams work to those parables is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.560
parabolic pictures and things like that
but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.319
the voice of God like you said it's
not audible, it's just

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.869
often one of my favorites is in
stillness

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.020
you can hear in your spirit and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.670
it gets to the point where it is just about
audible. I mean you hear so crystal clear

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.679
just like you see in the spirit because
we all have a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.289
obviously natural hearing but spiritual
ears and eyes

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.560
Ephesians 1 speaks of, and I have begun
to learn it's a real dynamic available

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.050
in the spirit you know I learned this
years ago I began to be still before the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.300
Lord and I kind of like this a lost art

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.790
at large, in the body
of Christ, but Psalm 46 be still and know

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.620
that I am God

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.860
you know those who wait upon the Lord
Isaiah 40, and its so hard

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.720
with our just culture our fast-paced
life

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.890
 for us to get still but if we can
really begin the train ourselves in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.690
doing that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.490
the realm of God's voice that you're
speaking up opens up in so many

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.530
dimensions that we didn't know were available

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.890
Now, why do you think that is that
stillness 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.780
correlates with God's voice so much?  I
feel like

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.080
often you know I wouldn't be a scholar on
this topic by any means but I feel like

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.490
often, God's whole frequency and dynamic of
flow is just not

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.530
on the solace realm, it doesn't mix in a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.880
in the solace realm we often are busy in just
thinking on carnal

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.980
matters, in the spirit is like oil and water

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.930
to the carnal things you know and so
we're just so fast pace like

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.370
even I've learned a lot in what I call
the Twilight state you can

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.960
dub it however you will, but in that point of

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.260
just about to fall asleep or just waking
up, I'll hear God very fluently even

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.040
in those windows and you see that in 
scripture

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.010
but I feel it's if you're awake enough

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.070
where you are just falling asleep or coming out of it to where

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.170
your available enough in your 
soul to hear

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.290
but you're still enough that your mind isn't thinking what do I have to do today...

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.380
busy, phone calls, emails, and enough like God's
frequency often is

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.000
and he's on his own channel you know and
often we're on ours, if we would just get still

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.190
and just set aside everything, be still

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.970
 I waited patiently upon the
Lord, he heard my cry

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.720
and he's always speaking I feel like just often we are not on his channel

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.500
that correlates to something that Eric and I were just talking about, that

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.170
very thing

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.100
Let me ask you the same
question that I just asked him. You know we talk

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.670
about stillness we talk about

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.250
the secret place and so on, is it
that God is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.890
waiting for us to get still and then
when he sees, "Okay now he's still" then

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.770
he takes initiative

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.190
Or is God always speaking and
it's just that we need to get on his

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.890
frequency

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.700
I totally believe in the latter, you'd probably say the same thing

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.550
to me he is so loving number one

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.730
revelatory number two, just full of vast communication, always speaking to his

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.260
people

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.670
through so many various means it's just
often

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.380
we don't have the ears to hear or the
posturing to align to the frequency to

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.830
hear

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.070
you follow me, in a car that applies in
any aspect: the Word of God, the Holy

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.740
Spirit,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.890
dreams, visions... God speaks through signs
and wonders but we can walk right by one

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.920
or something manifest from God's
presence

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.210
Moses if he wouldn't have stopped at the
burning bush

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.620
he would have never heard the voice of God

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.930
to me he's always speaking trying to
reach out to those people who love us

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.580
direct us, correct us, warn us

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.660
and we often are postured in order to
hear that if that makes sense
