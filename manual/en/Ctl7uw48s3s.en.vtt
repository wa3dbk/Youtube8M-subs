JoanTheDark Presents

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.680
The Prince JoanTheDark: EPISODE I

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.880
Previously on The Prince JoanTheDark

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.780
*Glass breaking* Gee, they almost caught me.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.280
Ouch! What the hell? OUCH! AHHhhhhhhh *Splat*

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.480
Narrator: Well, that concludes the story of our brave Prince

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.080
Who failed trying to escape YouTube's palace.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.280
He used all his strengths and fought bravely,
but his efforts weren't enough. END.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.880
Wait a minute, this shouldn't end this way, right?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.980
I think something went wrong.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.580
What do you say if we give a little help to our Prince?

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.080
*Rewind time*

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.180
*Glass breaking* Gee, they almost caught me.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.080
AHA!, I got you, die!

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.380
*Splat*

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.080
Another one? They are very annoying lately.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.480
Guard: You are going to die damned impostor!

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.280
Gee, I'm so scared *sarcasm*

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.180
*Splat*

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.380
I better escape, I will soon obtain my vengeance

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.780
For now it's not possible because
The Prince JoanTheDark series

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.880
Would be too short and
we don't want a dissapointed audience.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.880
Guard 1: Get back here you son of a bitch of a botch!

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.080
Guard 2: I got him! Here I go! AHHHHhhhh!

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.480
Let me tell you something guys:

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.480
*Cocky* HahahahahaahahHAHAHAHAHAHAH
HAHAHAHAHAHAH

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.380
Oops (ouch), I shouldn't have done that (OUCH!)

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.680
*Splat*

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.480
*Splat*

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.080
That's what happens for mocking them, incredible.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.880
That was without a doubt a life lesson.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980
Damn I'm better than Morpheus! (From Matrix)

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.080
I can see the pier from here.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.280
I better take a boat and leave YouTube for a while.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.180
Well, time to "magically" recover my health.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680
*Recovers Health*

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.780
Guard 1: You will pay for all the Guards you've killed!

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.680
Since he has 2 life bottles he must be the boss.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.080
Guard 2: Damn you! You killed him! 
We were playing Xbox 360

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.780
Ouch!
Weird that you guys didn't got the Red Ring of Death.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.280
Guard 2: You will pay for your insolenc-

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.980
Scorn.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.980
Guard 3: Free sluts!

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.480
Really?! Jumping I go!

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.680
Guard 3: We got him!

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.780
Noooooooooooooooooooooo *Gets beaten*

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.880
Narrator: Yes, just like you imagined,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.680
We will give him a little more help.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.580
*Rewind Time*

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.380
Guard 1: You will pay for all th-

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.380
SILENCE!

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.380
Guard 1: Damn you coward don't run!

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.780
What?! You called me a coward?!! Come here sucker.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.180
Hahahaha you fell for it!

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.280
Guard 1: Noooo come back!

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.680
Goodbye

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.980
Guard 1: Nooooo he's escaping I better
throw him the Xbox 360 with RROD

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080
*Explodes*

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.080
Guard 1: Damn, my plan didn't work...

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.980
Guard 1: What do we tell the Prince now?

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.780
If we tell him the impostor escaped
he's going to rip us apart!

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.780
Guard 2: He doesn't need to know we failed...

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.780
This waters are very dangerous,
I don't think he'll survive.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.280
*Censored*

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.880
Enough with the deaths already!

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.280
The Prince leaves YouTube on a Merchant Ship.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.080
It's been a rough day for him.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.980
Not even in his dreams can
get away of the ugly truth...

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.580
Nikolas606: Rape him, rape him!

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.280
Princess: It's just a poor man who crap his pants.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.080
Nikolas606: Guards, rape him, rape him!

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.180
?????: Wake up since here
comes a bitchy storm!
