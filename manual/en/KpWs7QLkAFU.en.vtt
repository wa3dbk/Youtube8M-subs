00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.750
Polymerase chain Reaction

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.090
PCR is a rapid, inexpensive and simple way
of amplifying specific DNA fragments from

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.900
minute quantities of source material.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.390
This revolutionary method was developed by
Kary Mullis in the 1980s.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.570
PCR methodology employs a temperature resistant
polymerase enzyme, which works in the presence

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.690
of a short stretch of single stranded DNA
called primer by consuming the substrate dNTPs

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.969
and finally amplifies the template DNA specifically.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.480
As the name indicates, PCR is a chain reaction
having repeated cycles, each of which consists

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.300
of three steps: Denaturation, Annealing, and
Extension.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.140
Denaturation is achieved with an increase
in temperature to 100 degree centigrade, primer

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.200
annealing at 54 degree centigrade and extension
is achived by Taq polymerase at 72 degree

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.790
centigrade.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.920
Repeated heating and cooling cycles which
is accomplished by the thermal cycler amplify

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.670
the target DNA exponentially.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.420
20 PCR cycles can amplify the target by a
million fold.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.670
Materials Required

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
Icebox
RNase Free DNase Free distilled water

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.430
10x buffer
Plasmid template

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.079
Forward primer
Reverse primer

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.680
dNTPs
Taq polymerase

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.670
PCR tube
Micro Pipettes

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.840
Pipette tips
Thermocycler

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.390
Procedure

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.189
Arrange all tubes in the ice box.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:06.110
Take a 10-100 µl pipette and adjust the volume
to 37.5µl.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.710
From the tube placed in the ice box pipette
out RNase Free DNase Free distilled water.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.470
Add this solution into a 0.5 ml PCR tube taken
from the ice box.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.930
Place the PCR tube back in the ice box.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.510
Discard the used tip.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.730
Now take 0.5-10 µl pipette and adjust the
volume to 5 µl.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.180
From the tube placed in the ice box, pipette
out 10x buffer.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.709
Add this solution into the same PCR tube.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.080
Place the PCR tube back in the ice box.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.660
Discard the used tip.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.170
Prepare the reaction mix by adding the following
components in the respective volume: 1 µl

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.299
of plasmid template, 2 µl of dNTPs, 2 µl
of forward primer, 2 µl of reverse primer

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.090
and 5 µl of taq polymerase, using the same
PCR tube.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.650
Mix the solution in the vial using the pipette.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.340
However ensure you do not mix this vigorously,
as this will inactivate the enzyme taq polymerase)

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.040
Turn on the Thermocycler
Place the PCR tube containing the Reaction

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.000
mix in the PCR machine.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.099
Close the lid and set the specific PCR program.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.659
Then press the start button to run the PCR
program.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.810
Result:

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.230
The amplicons which are formed after the specific
amplification of the target sequence can be

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.440
detected using the technique of gel electrophoresis.
