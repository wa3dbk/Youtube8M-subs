00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:16.875
Little inspires more fear and anxiety
than a medical procedure.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.345
Luckily, most doctors and surgeons are
required to go through great lengths to

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:23.084
master their profession.

00:00:23.084 --> 00:00:26.175
But let's face it. Nobody's perfect.

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.145
Don Church received a medical
diagnosis that

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:54.454
everybody dreads. He had a tumor. However,
this wasn't a small tumor.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:58.044
It was a 13 pound tumor located in the
stomach

00:00:58.044 --> 00:01:03.064
that had to be removed immediately. So Don
promptly underwent surgery at the

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:06.015
University of Washington Medical Center.

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:10.314
Fortunately, his surgeon was an expert at
removing the tumor.

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:13.745
Not so fortunately, his surgeon was also

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:18.515
upbeat forgetful. Don was sent home
after surgery and experienced severe

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.234
abdominal pain; this of course

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:24.844
could be expected after the removal of
such a large tumor,

00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:29.005
but more and more time past, the pain
only became worse.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.495
He notified the hospital, but he was
assured that the pain

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:36.415
was normal. But Don knew something
wasn't right.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:40.714
Some days he would spend curled up on
his bathroom floor sobbing 

00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:41.305
relentlessly

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:45.945
from the pain. Aside from that, he began to
develop a metallic taste in his mouth.

00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:47.745
When he managed to be able to do

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:51.894
any traveling, he would set off metal
detectors at the airport.

00:01:51.894 --> 00:01:55.454
He knew something was wrong. These
occurrences months

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:58.695
after his surgery were anything but normal.

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:02.024
So Don went to a family doctor, who
while examining

00:02:02.024 --> 00:02:05.255
Don felt an abnormal lump in his abdomen.

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:09.355
X-rays revealed the Don had a 13 inch
long metal retractor

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:14.325
sewed inside his body. The tool is
used to keep a wound opened

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:15.325
during surgery,

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:19.994
and though counting tools after surgery is
typical medical procedure,

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:24.024
the surgeon somehow overlooked one of the
largest

00:02:24.024 --> 00:02:28.805
tools of all. Don underwent emergency
surgery to have the metal retractor

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:31.665
removed and suffered no lasting effects.

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:35.964
For his trouble, the hospital paid him
nearly one hundred thousand dollars.

00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:40.225
It was revealed that Don was the fourth
instance where a metal retractor was

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:41.895
left inside a patient

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:48.895
at that same hospital.

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:53.785
Jessica Santillan and her family
went through extraordinary lengths

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:58.765
to see that she got adequate medical
care. At such a young age, Jessica was

00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:01.305
plagued by a disorder that was killing
her.

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:05.605
Her heart and lungs were on a path to
failure, and no doctor in her home

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:06.985
country of Mexico

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:10.615
could help her. So her family did what any
family would:

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:13.815
they worked to find her the help she
needed to survive

00:03:13.815 --> 00:03:18.325
at any cost. Jessica's family actually
managed to smuggle her

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:22.145
into the United States and they took up
residency in a trailer in North

00:03:22.145 --> 00:03:23.065
Carolina.

00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:27.185
Having no money, Jessica's family
continued to champion for her cause.

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:30.755
They started fundraisers, and raised
enough money to see to it

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:34.705
that Jessica would be able to get a heart
and double lung transplant.

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:38.615
The surgery would be a life-changing one,
even if successful,

00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:43.265
but for Jessica and her family it would
become a horrifying ordeal.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:47.255
Surgeons prepared to work and put Jessica
under anesthesia.

00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:51.255
The lung machines and bypass were all
started and the surgeons were ready to

00:03:51.255 --> 00:03:51.965
begin.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:56.255
The surgeon’s expert hands went to work,
and admittedly they worked well.

00:03:56.255 --> 00:04:00.065
Jessica's new heart and lungs were
transplanted without an issue.

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:04.575
Her lungs began breathing on their own
and her new heart started beating away.

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:08.705
The surgeon was preparing to close her up
and send her to the ICU.

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:11.845
That's when they received a call from
immunology.

00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:16.295
They informed the surgeon the horrific
true. While Jessica had type

00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:19.515
O blood, the organs she was given were
type A.

00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:24.285
Her body immediately began to dispense
antibodies that started destroying

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:27.895
her new organs, not only wasting
perfectly good organs

00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:32.465
but putting Jessica into serious
jeopardy. Doctors did all the could for

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:33.205
Jessica.

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:37.855
They found new compatible organs and
performed a second transplant procedure.

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:42.765
Unfortunately, Jessica slipped into
a coma and suffered severe brain damage,

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:48.615
and died just days later. Her family sued
the hospital for undisclosed amount of

00:04:48.615 --> 00:04:51.485
money. Neither the family nor the
hospital

00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:58.485
are allowed to talk about the settlement.

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:02.894
Sherman Sizemore, a Baptist minister, began
to experience

00:05:02.894 --> 00:05:08.614
unexplained abdominal pain. So he was
scheduled for exploratory surgery.

00:05:08.614 --> 00:05:12.495
Sherman was admitted to Raleigh General
Hospital in West Virginia.

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:16.195
To keep Sherman’s muscles from twitching
during the procedure, he was administered

00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:17.635
a paralytic drug.

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:22.495
Unable to move, doctors cut him open and
began to search through Sherman's organs,

00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:27.965
physically shifting his insides about.
Everything seemed to be going well,

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:31.054
but for Sherman, the procedure was
anything but

00:05:31.054 --> 00:05:34.995
well. What the surgeon hadn’t realized was
that Sherman was under the effects of

00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:36.245
the paralytic drug,

00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:39.415
but he hadn't yet been put under
general anesthesia.

00:05:39.415 --> 00:05:43.614
Sherman, while being cut open and searched
through, may have been unable to move

00:05:43.614 --> 00:05:44.554
or react.

00:05:44.554 --> 00:05:48.394
But he was wholly awake and aware. He
felt every

00:05:48.394 --> 00:05:51.894
inch of the incision, every poke and prod,

00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:56.685
but there was nothing he could do about
it. After the surgery Sherman's life

00:05:56.685 --> 00:05:58.475
changed dramatically.

00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:01.775
The experience was so torturous that
it scarred him

00:06:01.775 --> 00:06:04.915
physically and mentally. He started to
experience

00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:08.605
terrible nightmares and couldn't be left
alone. The hospital

00:06:08.605 --> 00:06:12.875
didn't immediately admit to their error,
causing Sherman to struggle with not

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:14.885
knowing if his memories were real

00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:18.114
or not. It tormented his every waking

00:06:18.114 --> 00:06:22.045
moment. Eventually, he started to become
delusional and believe that people were

00:06:22.045 --> 00:06:23.965
trying to bury him alive.

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:28.685
Less than one month later, Sherman shot
himself to death.

00:06:28.685 --> 00:06:32.375
Experts estimate that tens of thousands
of patients

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:36.485
experience what is called anaesthetic
awareness each year

00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:39.815
during surgery. While these instances may
scare you,

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:44.175
don't worry. You probably won't ever have
this type of experience.

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:48.864
Probably. I'd like to let you all know
that Seriously Strange has its own

00:06:48.864 --> 00:06:49.545
Twitter.

00:06:49.545 --> 00:06:53.425
Here you can get extra doses of
creepiness about anything from the

00:06:53.425 --> 00:06:55.025
bizarre and unexplainable

00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:59.535
to serial killers. If you just so happen
to have trouble waiting for a new episode

00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:01.415
of Seriously Strange each week,

follow it, you won't regret it.

00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:11.745
That's all for now. Remember: you may not
believe it, but anything is possible on

00:07:11.745 --> 00:07:13.765
a world so Seriously Strange.
