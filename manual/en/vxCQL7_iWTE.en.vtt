00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.990
Today were going to review part number th9028
from Thule, the vertex 2 hanging hitch bike

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.990
rack.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.369
A few quick notes about this bicycle rack,
that this will work on inch receiver hitches

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:12.969
and 2 inch receiver hitches.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.030
This bike rack will carry up to 2 racks and
also comes with the anti sway cradles.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.170
The design of the bike rack itself has an
arch shape to it, this helps keep the bikes

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.310
away from the vehicle and also helps lowering
the bikes onto the arms.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.300
The bike rack also includes 2 hitch switches,
one for your tilted bicycle rack and one to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.230
help fold up the arms of the rack.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.340
Well go into a little more detail, this bicycle
rack will work with an inch and a quarter

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.750
receiver hitch class 1 and class 2.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.700
It will also work with class 3 receiver hitches
as it includes spacer.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.579
And for our demonstration well go ahead and
install that.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.910
The bike does come with tools needed for assembly.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:57.920
And here we have a hitch switch, this allows
you to fold the bicycle rack out of the way

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.040
for access to the back of the car.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:02:07.040
It also includes a hand hold at the top of
the post to make it easy to pick it up 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:28.680
and 
move 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.090
it around.
