00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.140
Welcome to Coronado!

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.860
Renovated and re-opened for Fall 2012

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.280
Coronado is the UA's largest residence hall

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.480
Housing 776 students

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.920
This big friendly community of Wildcats

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.440
Is located on the west side of campus

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.060
And it's just a short walk from classes

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.940
and University Boulevard with all its popular student hangouts

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.060
With the remodel

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.820
Coronado is refreshed and upgraded

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.100
So let's go take a look!

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.480
Here we are at one of Coronado's bedrooms

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.640
Because of Coronado's recent renovations

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.800
Every room has brand new amenities

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.000
New desks, new lighting, new built-in closets

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.760
New carpet, and best of all

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.240
Completely remodeled bathrooms

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.600
Coronado's double rooms are suite style

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.120
Meaning that its two rooms connected by a single bathroom

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.180
So that's four students per bathroom

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.040
But suites are always single gender

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.580
Each room comes with free internet, local phone service

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.240
And cable TV for you and your roommate to share

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.520
Hi, I'm Tiana!

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.520
And I'm Billy

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.560
Let's go show you our rooms

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.200
Alright

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.720
So this is the closet space in my room

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.180
My roommate's side is here

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.920
And mine is on this side

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.920
Back over here

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.440
Our closets

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.040
And I covered mine with a curtain

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.960
I have room for my extra shoes

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.040
My ties

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.200
And I even have room for a storage bin here

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920
And these are our beds

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.540
We raised them to the highest height that you can do possible

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.460
So that we can store these storage units under here

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.960
And it's nice for extra space

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.820
Moving on in

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.740
We share a microwave

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.220
Our fridge, our coffee maker

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.260
Very important!

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
And our TV

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.440
And over here, is my desk

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.040
And over there is her desk

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.380
We kinda moved them to create a little more

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.900
Privacy when we're studying

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.940
In the middle here

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.260
We even have room for a chair

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.140
To do extra lounging

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.300
Or just hanging out

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.500
And this is our bathroom

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.020
Down here we have tons of space

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.520
to store all of our shampoos and conditioners

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.380
And up here

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.780
We have our own individual towel racks

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.900
I shower with my roommate

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.280
And my suite mates

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.420
So there's four of us

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.720
And there's more than enough room

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960
Definitely the best thing about living in Coronado

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.440
Is that everybody doors is always open

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.520
And everybody is so socialable

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.820
I feel comfortable

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.820
I feel safe

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.180
I just feel at home here

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.480
Thanks for coming in

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480
Thank you so much for joining me

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.720

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.320
Every floor has an RA

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.560
These are students who are here to help you figure out

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.560
Everything you need to know about hall life

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.340
They're awesome!

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.360
