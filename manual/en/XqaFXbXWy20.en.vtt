00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.120
difficult it's wonderful we wouldn't
trade it for anything in the world once

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.489
you get to Children's you know it's
going to be all right

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.930
Patrick is the fourth of five boys
Patrick was born February 26 to 2000

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.500
from everything we could see very
healthy baby got tired easily and he

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.670
fell asleep easily it was hard to wake
him up I give my wife all the credit she

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.350
took him to Children's this baby was
very calm very you know just the perfect

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:34.170
child never made a sound and they're
telling me he has a heart issue complete

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.450
heart block is really an electrical
issue with the heart where the atria and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
the ventricle don't communicate with
each other at all and so they could lead

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.810
to fainting can lead to dizziness
palpitations and even worse you're in

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.440
such shock dr. Campbell who's been our
doctor for a number of years took us

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.330
under his wing and just said look this isn't great but you know what it's

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.770
addressable it's very addressable and
treatable and it's something that we'll

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.979
have a plan for and here's what the plan
is we're gonna treat Patrick for a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.370
number of years and at some point we'll
know he'll have to get a pacemaker

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:25.629
I'm not ready I'm not ready to manage
a pacemaker you know how do I do this

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.970
what if it doesn't work you know later
what's a defibrillator when you're

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.129
looking at your child I mean you have to
be so strong a ten-year-old at the time

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.870
having surgery to put in a pacemaker is
a difficult thing and something you

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.180
would rather not happen but children's
made it much easier we have so much

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.049
confidence in the doctors we have so
much confidence in the hospital the the

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.870
quality of care the attentiveness he had
the best doctors and there were lots of

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.450
prayers I told him he was in good hands

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.420
I was with dr. Campbell since I was
really young and he said he would be my

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.370
sports agent he's a funny guy isn't he yeah I love him you know that
you've got a world-class pediatric

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.110
center in Atlanta and the way I look at
it is that we're all obligated as parents

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.959
and that citizens to do whatever we can
to enhance improve children's because I

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.900
think it's the most precious Civic asset
for the city of Atlanta

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.010
Bar None what you really hope for your
children is that they have a normal life

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.610
and that's what you want and we feel
that the care that he's gotten with with

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.329
children's and-and-and having the
surgery and getting the pacemaker it's

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.160
given him you know pretty much a normal
life or at least as normal as you can be

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.269
when you live in a household with five
rambunctious boys if you could feel it

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.450
right as you walk through the doors and
when you walk through the doors to me it

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.170
feels like a safe haven you know you
don't have to worry when you drive up

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.860
that driveway that your child's gonna be okay
