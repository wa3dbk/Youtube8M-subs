wooah get me outta here

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.300
god

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.300

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.540

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.680
oh yeah, what was i saying to you guys..

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.180
oh yeah-

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.220
MAMA MIIIIIAAAAAAAA

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.200
oh, fun fact, i was actually considered to be the voice actor for mario in this game

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.940
oh yeah

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.480
just a heads up,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.840
i am playing this on the wii virtual console

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.640
cause the thing i use to record

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.240
apparently doesn't work with N64

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.620
so i had to get it on virtual console

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.860
i had my n64 all set up, ready to play,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.100
and then it doesn't work

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.900
and uhh,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.580
furthermore when you play on a virtual console, you gotta play it on gamecube controller,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.600
so i'm playin..uh...

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.360
you hit the left trigger on the gamecube

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.320
and the .......

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.100
to uh...

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.040
hit z (?)

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.140
which is kinda gay

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.460
takes some getting used to

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.840
aaaand shit

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.680
so if i ever fuck up a backflip or a leap,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.040
it's all gamecube controller's fault

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.380
takethatbitch

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.700
get'm durdle

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.500
