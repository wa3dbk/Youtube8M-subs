00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.261
(upbeat Dance music)

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:06.731
- Sabrine, darling, Miss Brazil,

00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:08.914
what are we making today?

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:11.399
- Today we're doing
the World Cup Cocktail.

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:12.338
- Exactly.

00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:13.895
All right, this was sent to us by someone,

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:16.674
and he specifically made
it for the World Cup

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:18.624
to match the Brazilian flag,

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:20.905
because that's where it's being hosted.

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:22.912
But the USA is going to win. All right!

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:24.955
- (laughs) That's a great joke!

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:27.554
- (laughs) Let's make this drink!

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.404
Blue Curacao, pour it in there.

00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:34.160
Stop!

00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:37.162
Coconut syrup, pour it in there.

00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:39.714
Keep going.

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:42.823
- Shake, shakity shake it, shake my shit.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:47.528
That's so sweet, it's blue!

00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:49.280
- That's a Brazilian shake, right there?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.720
- I don't know! (laughs)

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.020
- OK, you've got three shakes to do,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.434
so the next two better be better.

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:55.451
- [Sabrine] OK! (laughs)

00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:00.490
- Cachaça, pour!

00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:04.654
Some coconut rum!

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:06.264
- I love this one.

00:01:06.264 --> 00:01:07.260
- [Skyy] Stop!

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.722
OK, try translate, OK.

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:09.617
- OK.

00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:10.440
- In Bra --

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.319
Portuguese, orange juice, pour!

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.615
- Suco de laranja.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.600
- Pineapple syrup!

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.218
- Abacaxi. (laughs)

00:01:22.218 --> 00:01:23.425
- [Skyy] Are you making stuff up?

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:24.204
- [Sabrine] No!

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:25.526
- That don't even sound like it, abacaxi!

00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:26.884
- Abacaxi is pineapple.

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:28.685
- Whatever, OK, but I
said pineapple syrup,

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:30.344
so it should be "abacaxi something else".

00:01:30.344 --> 00:01:33.244
- Yeah, I'm trying to
think what it is, syrup.

00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:36.688
It's like, seems like (speaks Portuguese).

00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:38.267
- I'm sorry, Brazilians, OK?

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:42.114
I apologize for bringing her on the show.

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:45.708
I will try my hardest to find
a real Brazilian next time.

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.287
- I am a real Brazilian, I speak --

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:48.587
- You don't speak the language, obviously!

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:49.911
- Dude, I do!

00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:52.593
- OK, shake it and keep
it sexy, all right!

00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:54.531
- [Skyy] We want to see that!
- [Sabrine] Hello!

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.611
- Let's see the Carnival dance.

00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:56.525
How would you do that?

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:58.803
- ♫ Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♫

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:01.550
- Just strain down in
there, little fellow, OK.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.069
Just a bit.

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:08.823
- Vodka! Portuguese.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.257
- [Sabrine] Vodka!
- [Skyy] Same thing?

00:02:10.257 --> 00:02:11.091
- Yeah.

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:12.809
- Never mind then, OK! Never mind!

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.033
- Vodka's vodka.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:15.074
- [Skyy] Stop!

00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:16.265
Ready for this one?

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:17.933
Melon Liqueur!

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:22.378
- (laughs) Licor de melon.

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:24.563
(laughter)

00:02:24.914 --> 00:02:26.784
- [Sabrine] More?
- [Skyy] Yeah, keep going.

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:28.012
- I don't know, OK.

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:30.058
I'm beginning to question.

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:32.769
- I swear I said that!

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.301
Licor de melon! (laughs)

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:36.088
Licor de melon.

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:40.178
(mumbles and laughs)

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:44.473
Licor de melon. That's it.

00:02:44.473 --> 00:02:45.940
- [Skyy] OK, OK, OK.
- [Sabrine] OK.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.379
- This is the final day of Carnival.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.819
This is the finale.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.538
Go ahead, impress us.

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:56.839
- ♫
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♫

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.242
- So, when you're doing Carnival,

00:02:58.242 --> 00:02:59.303
like are y'all twerking?

00:02:59.303 --> 00:03:00.333
Is that what it is?

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:01.528
- No, Hell, no.

00:03:01.528 --> 00:03:02.307
- It's just --

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.414
- We have more class than that.

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:04.888
- Excuse me! No twerking in Brazil!

00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:06.259
OK, that's enough.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.572
So y'all are just basically doing this?

00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:10.155
- Yeah, it's like, it's a lot of energy

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:11.521
coming from inside you all,

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.840
so it's like you keep moving and smile.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.085
- What is with the nudity,

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:16.972
because some girls just
have their bodies painted.

00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:18.735
- We wear small bikinis.

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:20.175
We are comfortable in our bodies.

00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:21.336
It's part of our culture.

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:23.356
Americans are not used to it that much,

00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:24.702
but for us it's normal.

00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:26.653
It's not like, "Oh, my
God, she's half naked!"

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:29.053
No, she's just wearing a bikini.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:30.711
- Exactly, America!

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.564
Y'all need to adopt that, OK!

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:33.585
That's right!

00:03:33.585 --> 00:03:35.548
Half her ass is hanging
out, but it's just a bikini.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.385
- Yeah, it's just a bikini.

00:03:37.385 --> 00:03:39.521
- (laughs) OK, hold that on top of there.

00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:41.401
- Oh, God, here we go again.

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:44.127
- [Skyy] Lift it up,
lift it up, (mumbles).

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.023
- [Sabrine] There's a lot
of technique here, people.

00:03:48.023 --> 00:03:50.402
- OK, right there, all right, cool.

00:03:50.402 --> 00:03:51.623
- Can I take this?

00:03:51.623 --> 00:03:53.388
- Yep, just slide it down.

00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:56.579
- [Sabrine] Yeah, that looks --

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.186
- How's that look?

00:03:58.186 --> 00:03:59.742
(laughter)

00:03:59.742 --> 00:04:01.820
And there you have it!

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.967
The World Cup Cocktail,

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:06.336
and this was sent to me on Instagram,

00:04:06.336 --> 00:04:09.000
by my boy Over_Ice.

00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:10.897
If you've got a cool drink,

00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:12.405
take a picture of it,

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:15.321
post it on Instagram, #TipsyBartender,

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.166
remember to include the recipe, OK!

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:19.779
I'll re-post it, and I might
even make it if it's good!

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:22.334
- [Skyy] Sabrine, ready?
- [Sabrine] Yeah.

00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:24.075
- Go ahead, put your lips on that.

00:04:24.075 --> 00:04:25.329
You've got different levels,

00:04:25.329 --> 00:04:26.919
so play with it and see
what you come up with.

00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:30.704
I know the bottom one is the coconut.

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.035
The top one's straight booze. (laughs)

00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:42.968
- Thank you for letting me know! (laughs)

00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:45.988
It's delicious! Oh, my God!

00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:47.226
I just want to take this home!

00:04:47.226 --> 00:04:49.201
- [Skyy] You like it?
- [Sabrine] I love it!

00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:50.291
- It's the perfect combination!

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:51.800
It's sweet!

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.995
The orange is a little bit citric,

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:56.177
and here it's strong, so --

00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:57.815
- Yeah, it's a nice mix.

00:04:57.815 --> 00:04:59.938
This is a really cool, cool drink.

00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:01.692
Tipsy Bartender!

00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:04.815
Find us on Instagram, @TipsyBartender.

00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:06.213
And you are Sabrine Ferretti.

00:05:06.213 --> 00:05:07.301
- Yeah, Sabrine Ferretti.

00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:08.385
- Yeah, it's Italian,

00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:09.953
but it's really in Portuguese.

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:11.293
- It's Brazilia.

00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:12.732
- It's Brazilia.

00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:14.335
What city are you from again, Brazilia?

00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:16.075
- Brazilia, yeah, the capital.

00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:17.678
- Where are the hot girls, again? Rio?

00:05:19.108 --> 00:05:20.453
- Well, all over the place.

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:21.546
- Don't come with all over the place.

00:05:21.546 --> 00:05:22.829
Where's the bulk of them?

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:24.526
Where I will jump out of my car and go,

00:05:24.526 --> 00:05:26.604
"Holy Christ, is this Heaven?"

00:05:26.604 --> 00:05:28.647
- Just put your feet on the Brazilian land

00:05:28.647 --> 00:05:30.527
and you're going to find that.

00:05:30.527 --> 00:05:32.304
- [Skyy] With a little orange.

00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:33.523
Keep it sexy.

00:05:33.523 --> 00:05:34.580
- That's pretty!

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.566
- [Skyy] Damn right it is sexy.

00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:36.914
That's why I picked it.

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.491
What would you name your kid?

00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:40.975
- Peyton.

00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:42.217
- Like Peyton Manning?

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.704
- [Hostess] Yeah.
- [Skyy] Are you serious?

00:05:43.704 --> 00:05:44.865
- Mmhmm.

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:47.174
We already decided, sorry.

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:50.200
- Y'all decided y'all would
name y'all's kid Peyton,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.346
after Peyton Manning?

00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:52.595
- Yeah, whether it's a boy or a girl.
