00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.200
Welcome everybody I am Quagdarr this is
going to be a very special episode

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.300
I am talking World of Warcraft I am talking
legendaries and these are my

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.800
top 5 legendary weapons World of
Warcraft

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.260
Number five Shadowmourne Shadowmourne is
what we

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.900
we've got instead Frostmourne for obvious reasons we were never going to get

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.130
Frostmourne but Blizzard was kind enough to
give us an axe that look

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.149
fairly similar to it is just
unfortunately that design

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.230
was not that spectacular in the
overall

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.780
end result. Some people like it, I have
firm beliefs in terms of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.789
what a legendary should look
like in the end result.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.899
For me in terms of what defines the
legendary

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.969
so you have a really cool quest line to
build it yeah really effects.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.489
but it was just missing that's something
special you can look at the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.079
Corrupted Ashbringer

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.489
this was not a legendary weapon but

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.869
it affected the player, maybe you could
have had

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.500
shadowmourne just like talk to you umm,
maybe you could have had it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.420
change the color of your character
to be a little darker similar to what

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.759
the

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.750
corrupted ashbringer would do. In the end it didn't do that

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.400
but because it has the Lore behind it I'm
putting it at number five.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.210
number four Sulfuras, the Hand to Ragnaros

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.729
this was the small version the weapon
used by

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:32.260
the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.590
most famous and game bosses in the
entire history

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.910
a World of Warcraft after 10 years and

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.360
this game being around Ragnaros still
has this

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.560
appeal to its audience he's just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.370
that famous so to be able to wield a
weapon that this guy would wield

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.980
is just simply amazing. Its identifiable

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.540
its is this just unique, it was bad ass
in its day, it was the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.040
O.G. of legendary weapons, so

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.360
I need to keep it in the top five even
though it is one of the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.640
easiest ones to get in the game.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.930
but at least you still have to to wait
out some

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.320
some rare drops coming coming from

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.870
various a in PCs in the game

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.060
and the actual end boss himself Ragnaros.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.630
If you're looking for legendary I would
probably go ahead in gun for this

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.930
if not then Thori'dal the Stars Fury
just to go ahead and get

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.680
and achievement and have just a
legendary in your stash

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.440
those are the ones that I would go with.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.959
Number 3! The Warglaives of Azzinoth. The weapons of Illidan

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.060
himself. These things were bad ass lookin

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.280
you get two of them, they were just huge
and legendary weapons

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.459
really should be huge, it just

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.580
emphasizes that cool factor in that much
more

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.060
these things had tremendous artwork, the
lore behind them is just

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.590
it it great its everything that a
legendary weapon

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.330
should be. I am NOT a fan of the fact
that

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.540
legendary is just straight up dropping I
like legendary is to have to be

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.010
crafted or ridiculous quests to go ahead
and and put them together but

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.040
for this particular one, I get it it was
his weapons he's there he's dead

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.129
go ahead and take it a so

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.760
because of the lore behind its and just the graphics

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.879
you got up put it up there kind of high, at
number three

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.659
that's going to be the Twin Glaives of Azzinoth. Number two

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.489
Teragosa's Rest, this thing is just

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.739
really cool lookin and the stages I love
the fact that the players had to go

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.069
ahead and build it up in various stages

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.909
to go from some piddly little twig, to
amazing looking thing

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.150
it would reward you're entire guild for the
effort that everybody can get a little

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.620
little piece something and recognition
being able to to get this legendary item

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.030
for you guild. it had great stats

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.209
he could turn you into a freaking dragon.
You can't do much cooler than that, and

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.250
it would reward the whole faction

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.280
in you faction's main city with the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.329
with great big show that you just stay
there forever

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.819
basically saying you

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.110
"Look at me!" So because of

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.949
all these very special aspects in the
story, the questline

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.960
all these little features that they would
put into this

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.970
one legendary weapon it is for sure at
number two.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.379
At number one as if there was any
doubt!

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.810
I'll go ahead let you guys take a second
try and guess it...

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.979
that's right

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.080
the cloaks from Mists of Pandaria, these

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.030
things are amazing. I am just joking with
you on that

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.319
there's no way I'm backing these things up.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.500
Number one Thunderfury, The Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.740
it has everything that you want in a
legendary weapon

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.719
insider this game, it has unique design
work

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.219
you can tell it by its silhouette
perfectly

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:20.080
its huge, its a one-handed weapon that is
way bigger

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.990
then almost every two-handed weapon
still in the game

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.780
you can not get cooler than that. it would rain downed

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.880
thunder and lightning and tornados all
around you just destroying, 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.719
And laying waste to your enemies.

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.219
enemies. It is a status symbol for Guilds

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.940
back in the original days of the game, if
you had this

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.979
it would literally define your guild on
the server.

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.610
Is this guild legit? Are these guys any
good? One player in your guild

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.270
having this weapon would put a

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.580
status around your entire guild. it
was

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.990
it was perfect, the the quest line to go
ahead and build this thing was

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.750
absolutely amazing. You had to get
numerous legendary items

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.270
just to build it, uh it and to this day

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.319
it no other weapon in the game can start
and in

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.379
internet meme, Thunderfury has a
reputation

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.039
it can flood chat channels just by
hearing its name once.

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:26.770
Nothing else does that, so because of 
that and the fact that they also

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.270
have it so famous in the halls Blizzard
Entertainment, they put it

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.030
in Diablo 3 as

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.990
a legendary item. it's carrying over, that
is Blizzard's

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.080
big famous weapon and because of that

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.169
this thing will be number one I do not
ever seeing it

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.789
being dethroned it's just going to stay
there, it is a badass weapon

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:54.099
everybody that saw it wanted it, so at
number one

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.580
Thunderfury the blessed blade the
WindSeeker. well guys that's going to do

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.819
