00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.140
G'day!

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.500
I'm here to show you the Chicken Caravan 150

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.300
This one is a third of the size

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.860
of our larger Chicken Caravan.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.220
It still has its rollaway nesting boxes

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.980
and a lot of the other features of the large caravan.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.860
And I'll show them now.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.740
The Chicken Caravan 150

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.740
houses 150 laying hens.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.140
Here at the front of the Chicken Caravan 150

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.900
we just have a standard jockey wheel

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.020
like you found on most trailers,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.100
and it's just a flip-up jockey wheel,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.540
so you can flip it up when you want to move

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.540
the Caravan to a new location.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.660
We have a 130-litter water tank on the front,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.740
and that collects the rainwater from the roof

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.540
then goes down these pipes, and fills it up.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.180
It's also got a standard garden hose connection:

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.380
if you want or need to top up the water tank,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.940
just put an ordinary garden hose, and fill that up.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.820
You've got your chicken drinker there,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.460
and as you can see the chickens just

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.100
flu up on this bar here

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.900
or just the A - Frame

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.220
to drink out of it.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.980
And you can also pull the drinker off

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.260
and sit it on the ground.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.260
So you have it down there for the birds

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.220
to get full access to that.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.660
And it's easily put straight back up again.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.340
In the hose that comes out of the bottom

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060
of the tank, we have an in - line tap

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.980
that we can turn on and off

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.060
in case we need to unplug the drinker

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.180
or service for any reason.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.380
The drinkers are attached by just a standard garden hose

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.060
The doors on the Chicken Caravan 150

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.140
have the same same size doors

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.100
as the larger caravan,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.340
and also the same catch:

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.620
they got a catch under here

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.300
where you just pull out,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.100
and they're on lockable gas struts

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.220
so we can lock it off at any level.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.500
Today there's a little bit of wind around,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.980
so if you want to,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.540
you can lock it down to about there.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.900
It still gives the chickens

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.340
plenty of access to go in and out,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.180
and then in a very hot, sunny day

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.900
or perhaps if its wet,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.140
you got the opportunity to pull

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.100
the doors right out like that,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.700
creating a lot of shade

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.580
and a lot of shelter for the birds.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.940
Inside the Chicken Caravan 150,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.620
it's similar to the 450

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.180
we do have the same size rollers

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.780
and also the same nesting boxes.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.820
They ran across the Caravan

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.940
just parallel with the axle rather than length ways,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.300
and they still have the rollaway nesting boxes,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.300
and also the nesting box gates.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.060
To collect the eggs,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.820
just pull the shelf down here,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.340
(we got a nice big tray

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.620
where you can put your plastic egg tray),

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.580
and then just simple wind the eggs in.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.820
And look at that:

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.580
they come out nice and clean

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.780
with the rollaway nesting boxes,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.460
and you can just put them in your trays: very easy.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.500
Inside the Chicken Caravan 150,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.420
just below the nesting boxes we have nine perches

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.140
for them to sleep on at night.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.220
And then when they come into lay,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.620
they just hop up on the perches

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.180
to the edge of the nesting boxes,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.380
and then hop in.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.020
And we use there an Astro Turf matting

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.740
same as the Chicken Caravan 450.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.100
Here at the back of the Chicken Caravan,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.660
here's our back roller.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.300
It's the same size roller as we use on the larger model,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.740
and its also got the same adjustment points,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.820
so if ever the belt is loose,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.860
you can just turn this nuts just half a turn

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.540
(you got two on each side),

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.460
which will just pull that roller out a bit,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.740
putting a little bit more tension on the belt.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.260
We have a timer box here,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.980
with a 12 - volt battery at the back,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.700
and this wire going up here,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.700
it goes to a solar panel on the roof.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.140
Now the solar panel charges the battery,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.820
and it goes to the timer box

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.020
and that's to adjust the nesting box gates:

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.740
to open and close them,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.220
so birds won't sit in the nesting boxes at night.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.780
Here at the back of the Chicken Caravan,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.740
we have another jockey wheel.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.740
This acts as a stabilizer,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.860
just so if you walk in the back of the Chicken Caravan,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.700
you're not going to tip it up because it's a smaller model.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.260
Also in a little bit of a windy conditions

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.420
it acts as an extra stabilizer.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.940
The reason we've used to jockey wheel

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.700
and not a jack-stand solid leg is,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.580
if you do forget to wind it up

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.380
and you start moving along,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.220
you will probably feel that hit, and it will just roll along

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.620
rather pending a leg and doing damage to the unit.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.620
So this is Buena Vista Farm, in Gerringong,

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.900
New South Wales, quite hilly

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.580
And I guess I wasn't sure about

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.980
the Chicken Caravan when I first

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.940
it seemed massively over engineered.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.900
but these crazy struts and the,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.620
you know... the rollaway nesting boxes

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.860
and the fabulous solar cell on the top.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.660
It's so efficient, we love it, it's really well thought out,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.980
I just love the fact

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.420
that it's cut egg washing time down enormously,

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.060
so we don't have to wash eggs anymore.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.460
And it just, it's a really efficient,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.620
fabulously engineering design, we love it.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.140
 It's great.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.580
And after struggling, I guess, to keep pasture up to our hens,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.260
and having to have fixed infrastructure

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.660
and rotating them around paddocks.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.140
It just provided a great solution.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.860
It's easy to handle, easy to move around,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.540
the chooks are happy, they get fresh pasture every couple of days

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.020
and it's just it's simple and well built,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.540
and it just works wonderfully.
