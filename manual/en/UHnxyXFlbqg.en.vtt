00:00:01.293 --> 00:00:03.791
Hello YouTubers
and microcurrent fans.

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:09.598
Today I wanted to talk about
these microcurrent gloves

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.045
that I have been using.

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:14.359
I am loving these gloves.

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:17.780
They are superconductive,
which I wasn't sure

00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:18.896
if they would be.

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:22.129
I'm not really even sure
what they are made of.

00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:27.284
But it feels like
a poly-cotton mix blend.

00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:35.258
But my machine –
It has color, gym, sound,

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:37.718
frequency generator
with microcurrent,

00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:40.087
and it has sounds.

00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:42.556
So I can hear
when I am connected or not.

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:43.942
It goes, "wee woo wee woo".

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:46.654
I have never heard it disconnect.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.517
With these, it is always connected.

00:00:48.517 --> 00:00:50.287
So the conductivity is really good.

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:53.783
I ordered these from China.

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:56.681
I have been looking
all over for them in the States.

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.967
I just hadn't seen them.

00:00:57.968 --> 00:00:59.611
I hadn't seen them in the shows.

00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:01.033
I hadn't seen them anywhere.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.350
I was scouring the internet
looking for them.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.170
I finally just asked Big Camel 77
on eBay.

00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:10.541
It's Big Camel 77.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.239
I just had to email them
and say, "Listen,

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:21.321
can you sell me just the gloves?"
and they said, "Sure".

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:24.500
And I said, "How much?"
and they are $35 including shipping.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.725
They just come in a little –
a bag from China.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.960
And these got here in a week.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.080
I couldn't believe it.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.995
It's probably because
I just needed an extra pair.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:41.289
These gloves –
You have to wear latex gloves

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.986
underneath it or whatever you use,
vinyl latex gloves underneath them.

00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:48.692
Otherwise, you will receive
the treatment and not your client.

00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.076
So definitely wear gloves
underneath them.

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:53.761
They come with this little
snap connector

00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:57.891
and I went through heck and back.
[laughs] Sorry I have a two-year-old.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.160
I don't curse anymore. [laughs]

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.277
At least not advertently.

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:11.197
But I went to spectacular research
to try to find a way to connect

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:16.183
this because mine –
my cables don't connect this at all.

00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:19.148
And so what I ended up doing –
you can you see these?

00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:24.123
What I ended up doing is just,
I have the gloves on

00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:26.946
and so I am not getting
the treatment.

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:31.492
I just stick them in here like so.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:37.043
I stick them up underneath here
into the crook right here

00:02:37.043 --> 00:02:41.594
and I work like that. [laughs]
which it's fine.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:44.188
These things –
These chords are pretty long

00:02:44.188 --> 00:02:46.202
and so I don't have a problem.

00:02:46.202 --> 00:02:48.508
I just wrap them behind my head
or whatever.

00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:49.545
And it works great.

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:54.806
Yes, I am having a lot
of fun with them.

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:58.587
What I have also discovered is
if you start out with lymph

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:03.025
drainage moves that not only
is the treatment far better,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.970
but it's --

00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:10.478
Doing lymph drainage
with these gloves on

00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:13.671
is like lymph drainage
on steroids. [laughs]

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:14.845
It's great.

00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:18.752
And so I learned
my lymph drainage

00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:22.633
just from a ton
of dermatologic classes

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.599
that I took and they teach you
the IDI, they teach you

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.845
the doctor water method
at the IDI and they have classes

00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:31.677
that roll around once
to twice a year

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:32.945
that are more in depth.

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:37.364
But I don't do anything super,
super in depth.

00:03:37.494 --> 00:03:39.735
I spend about five minutes
in the beginning.

00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:44.871
These gloves, they are pretty soft
for the client.

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:50.182
And what you want to do
is you put -- I would brush.

00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:54.435
[laughs] I will not try to put
conductive gloves on these gel –

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.791
gel on these gloves first.

00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:01.338
I would probably -- What I do is
I submerge the gloves before

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:02.485
I put them on.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.160
Put on my vinyl gloves.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.292
Put these over them.

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:07.444
Insert these and away I go.

00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:10.874
But I have painted
on my conductive mask

00:04:10.874 --> 00:04:14.541
before I even start
because they would just absorb

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:16.305
all your conductive gel.

00:04:16.393 --> 00:04:18.780
And if you are using
expensive stuff like I am,

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:23.268
[laughs] I am kind of tired of that,
it just absorbs it all.

00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:30.312
Definitely, put that on first
with the brush.

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.699
And then I go
and do my holding movements.

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:43.046
I do try to change up
the different muscle lifting patterns

00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:46.449
each time to keep the muscles
guessing as to what's coming.

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:48.619
That tends to work
really well for me.

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:50.956
What else?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.040
These gloves work really well.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.057
I am pretty satisfied with them.

00:04:57.217 --> 00:04:58.667
Oh, disinfecting them.

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:00.684
Disinfecting them is tough.

00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:04.656
You need to run them
through the washer.

00:05:05.084 --> 00:05:07.004
I would not put them in the dryer.

00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:09.871
So you have to let them air dry
between each client.

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:13.137
So that is why I have ordered –
[laughs] I just keep ordering

00:05:13.137 --> 00:05:14.236
more and more

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:17.262
because as my microcurrent business
gets busier and busier,

00:05:17.262 --> 00:05:21.246
I have to have six pairs for the day
or five pairs for the day ready

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:23.679
and dry and clean and everything.

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.060
So that is a little tricky.

00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:33.167
Yes. So $35, Big Camel 77,

00:05:34.006 --> 00:05:35.471
pretty happy with them.

00:05:37.008 --> 00:05:39.771
I know that there are –
I think there is another company

00:05:39.771 --> 00:05:42.849
that makes these gloves.

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.874
I don't know how much they cost
but they have to have –

00:05:45.874 --> 00:05:47.777
I think they have like four channels.

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:51.094
These are only working
on one channel.

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:55.941
I wish it were a big sheet of energy
that went straight across like this

00:05:55.941 --> 00:05:57.813
from when I was working
on my clients,

00:05:57.813 --> 00:05:58.945
but it's really not.

00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:01.544
It's just one stream of energy
that is going across.

00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:04.670
And then there is another guy
on eBay that talks about this –

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.366
I can't remember his name.

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:11.335
But it's a really fascinating video
where he has an argon glass globe

00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:15.330
and he shows you -
like with microcurrent wands.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.019
He will turn them sideways.

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:20.620
How much energy
is actually connecting from one point

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.721
to the other.

00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:24.010
It's not a sheet of energy
like we are open.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.156
It's one single
stream of microcurrent.

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.602
So with that in mind,
it makes it much easier

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:35.739
to pinpoint where you're working
and it just clicks

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:39.660
and it makes many more sense to me
and I found out couple of years ago

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.415
when they first put it up,
I was like, "Wow" [laughs].

00:06:42.484 --> 00:06:44.841
It really helped
in my microcurrent treatments.

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:46.709
So anyway,
I hope that this helps.

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:48.428
I don't want to ramble on
too long.

00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:52.152
Please subscribe
and press like if you liked it.

00:06:53.853 --> 00:06:54.994
Thank you.
Bye bye.
