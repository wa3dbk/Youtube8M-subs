[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.240
EXTRA - Contribution, Svampriket, Childhood memories.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.660
Hi, dear viewers! Today we have a special epsiode.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.080
To get you updated on what's been going on and who this guy is.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.615
Hello!

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.020
Fredrick has left Revansch! to work on his other projects.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.540
A spot was available.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.780
Here is my good friend Björn!
Why don't you explain who the hell you are?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.360
I'm Björn!
William Pantzar

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.100
What's there to tell about me. I'm a regular guy and I enjoy video games and movies.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.420
Stuff like that.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.280
Kinda like me!
We're identical.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.060
We have killer times together!
We do!

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.520
We have the same style of playing games and that's nice!

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.200
If I have to brag, I would say that we're very good as a team.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.860
We have some good news! 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.940
Svampriket.se, want's to put our videos up on their website.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.440
We think that's great so we've already agreed.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.040
That's the reason for this video, to get you an update on what's been going on.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.580
A perfect opportunity to get to know these people.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.560
They did the famous podcast called Retroresan. They won the award for best swedish gaming blog in 2011.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.394
It's a really great website...

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.920
...if you like games, check it out or...

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.960
...if you're watching this you probably know what it is already.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.674
But for those that don't know, check out Svampriket.se

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.674
One thing that...

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.980
is playing old video games.
Yeah.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.680
We talked about getting better at...
Organizing the games a lot better.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.140
It's been a lot of NES games lately and one SNES game.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.780
Me and Björn are going to sit down and go through...

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.440
...all your SEGA fans are going to see those games also.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.760
I got one!
Yeah.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.640
Exactly!
I don't have a Mega Drive!

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.800
I took care of that.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:27.400
We're gonna make a list with a perfect mix of games from NES, SNES, SEGA etc.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.060
We make a list with the games we own. Then we have a Track &amp; Field match.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.340
The winner chooses the game.
Kinda.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.220
Ah. Jo. Jo. Ah...
Ah. No.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.720
Yes
[LAUGHS]

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.780
The thing is, we're going to play retro games.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.900
It's not going to be Xbox, PS3, Wii, WiiU or...

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.260
The limit is Nintendo 64 and below.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.400
That includes Playstation 1, Nintendo 64.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.820
Nintendo is calling the Game Cube retro, but is feels too new.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.200
We don't feel the need to take revenge of those games. Let's save those games for later.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.500
I remember when the N64 was released.
Fuck me, I hated it AND loved it,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.780
It was my first cons...

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.300
I bought the PS1 after the N64. That was the first time I bought a new console when it was released.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.320
When it came?
Yes! The day it was released.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.300
At Leksakslagret in Vetlanda, Yo!
[LAUGS]

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.674
Anywho...

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.640
I really like that the PS1 had awesome cut scenes.
So I got it one Christmas. Anyway! 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.379
When the N64 was released...

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.040
...we went to the local toystore, Leksakslagret.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.260
And we had to write a slogan to win a contest.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.220
My dad has this bad slapstick humor. He wrote,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.220
"Mario is nice and happy when he drives in his go cart..." period.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.040
Those who won wrote poems like, "Until the current do us apart, N64"

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.980
That was the first time a got a new console and I still got it, at the addict, at home.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.340
We got it, played it when we came home and the joystick instantly developed flour.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.380
When you had to throw Bowser.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.340
Got damn!
How many of those joystick did we destroy? 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.914
I collected all the 120 stars!

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.040
So the need to take revenge on N64 games isn't that strong.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.560
But if we haven't played a N64 game, it may be interesting.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.000
We had N64 at the youth recreation center and they changed it up!

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.000
That was strange...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.200
they went from Nintendo 8-bit to Nintendo 64.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.500
What a big fucking jump!

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.880
It was very revolutionary because...

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.800
Gislaved, where I'm from.
The commune was sponsoring with this.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.320
They were like, "boys and children."
Reftele.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.960
A village this big, super tiny, nobody lives there. People went there to visit the youth recreation center.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.600
Cause you had the N64?
[LAUGHS]

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.840
They was sponsoring this and we was like...

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.100
Wow! There's graphics out there on a whole nother level.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.100
That was awesome! 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.700
They had a couple of games that I thought was very hard.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.140
I wa really in love with Super Smash Brothers.
It was really fun!

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.260
We played that for a long time.
I will beat you in that game some day.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.640
The one who wins a Super Smash Brothers. match gets to pick a game from the list.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.980
Only the standard character or...
Whoever you like!

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.340
Dibs on Pikachu cause he kicks ass.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.520
Alright, you play with Pikachu...

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.900
[LAUGHS]

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.480
Anyway, the reason for this video is to tell you how happy we are that we are published on Svampriket.se

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.120
I really hope that our partnership will be awesome.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.136
Is awesome!

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.480
Yeah, it's already awesome.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.200
It will be a lot of fun with those guys. 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.780
I have to say, it's a home, because we don't really have a website. 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:03.640
We have our Youtube, Facebook, Twitter but now we have a place to stay.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.860
That's were we live know.
Yeah!

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.020
So check out Svampriket.se

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:15.200
Make sure you continue to watch our episodes and I hope you will play a lot of games until then.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.400
Anyway!

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.260
Grab a beer while you play video games.
It stimulates the nerves.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.140
If you're under age and watching this, forget about it!

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.000
Light beer!
Their dad is going to be crazy!

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.200
You can go to Systembolaget and buy non-alcoholic.
Not when your under 18.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.840
Non-alcoholic beer!
You can't enter the store if you are under 18.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.680
We will find out!

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.074
Bye!
Bye!

00:06:43.540 --> 00:07:06.160
[OUTRO MUSIC]

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.160
Fuck!

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.600
It's Final Cut that I use now instead of the old one.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.320
What's was the old one then?

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.280
I don't wanna say because I downloaded it.
[LAUGHS]

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.800
The mic is over here!

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.400
[LAUGHS]

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.520
And we hope to connect with them...

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.280
No we don't.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.640
That sounded gay, let me redo that one.
[LAUGHS]
