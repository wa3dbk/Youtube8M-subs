John Stotler: People that would speak to me
in the hall wouldn’t speak to me anymore.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.000
People that I sat with at lunch wouldn’t
sit with me at lunch anymore. I became even

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.200
more alone in the world that I was living
than I had been before and it was very hard.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.200
Ayme Kantz:I was a scrawny little runt. I
was perceived as different. No one knew about

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.160
my gender identity issues in junior high school.
I kept that very, very hidden. So I was being

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.840
picked on just for being different.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:01.100
Rodolfo Joaquin:When I was being bullied,
I felt very alone. I felt that nobody understood

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.200
me. I felt that my friends weren’t really
my friends because they didn’t know the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.759
real me when I was growing up.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.759
Wendell Blayloc:The message was I wasn’t
equal. I didn’t have any value. And that

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.300
those individuals didn’t respect me for
just being me, and they didn’t know me,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.240
but didn’t respect me.

Robert Propst:In those many dark hours, there
was a wonderful teacher I had that was a straight

00:01:48.860 --> 00:02:00.760
woman who knew I was different and she took
such great care of ensuring that I was OK

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.830
in school.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.440
Mario Diaz: When you feel isolated and you
feel like you are being bullied, there, there

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.069
are today hot lines where you can call and
you don’t have to give your name. You can

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.190
speak to someone who understands what you
are going through and they’re going to help

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.190
build your esteem, your self-esteem and your
confidence to make sure that you are OK as

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.090
you are.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.440
Donna Hill: It’s so important in your life
to be able to be yourself.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.500
John Stotler: Deep down inside, you need to
accept who you are and love who you are and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.580
grow from there.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.260
Ayme Kantz: Study up. Reach out. Be yourself!

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.300
Rodolfo Joaquin: At the end of the day, it’s
all about your happiness within you.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.300
Stacy Crickenberger: It’s OK to be you.
And, most of all, it’s OK if the world isn’t

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.000
OK with you. You are.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.260
Robert Propst: Look in those darkest moments
to the light because it will eventually shine

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.460
again.
