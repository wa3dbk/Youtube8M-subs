00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.209
Hello, in this video, I'll share how to make
crayfish in your own kitchen.

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.519
If you are outside Nigeria and you can't buy
crayfish where you live,

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:10.670
this is for you!

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.180
This process also works for dry prawns and
dry shrimps.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.560
Crayfish is a seasoning we often add to Nigerian
cooking.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.230
Is crayfish a shrimp or a prawn?

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:36.740
I would say that what we call crayfish in
Nigeria is a shrimp.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.300
The ones we have in Nigeria are quite tiny
with big ones here and there.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.150
But if in doubt, just go to your local supermarket

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.950
and buy what looks like what I have in my
hand right now.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.500
We will be using frozen shrimps for this.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.230
Leave them on your kitchen counter to defrost.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.910
This takes a few minutes.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.870
Then rinse them in cool water.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.900
Put in a sieve and set aside.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:08.909
No need to add salt because shrimps are quite
salty when dry.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:28.270
Place the shrimps on your oven rack like this
and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.729
Then dab some vegetable oil or sunflower oil
on them and bake for additional 15 minutes.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.930
It is Ok when it is crunchy dry but not burnt.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.039
Bring them out and leave to cool down completely.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.380
You see how crunchy dry it is?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.639
Grind with a dry mill before adding to your
Nigerian cooking that call for crayfish.

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:52.630
I remove the head because I find that it's
kind of bitter.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.360
This is not the case for crayfish that I buy
from Nigeria though.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.360
That's it!

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.680
Bye byeeeee
