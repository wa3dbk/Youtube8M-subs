00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.101
Taking a look at the backside of the element
console, what we have are we’re gonna take

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:09.380
a look at the different connections that we
have available. Over here on the side, is

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.320
an accessories port, a 3-pin XLR connector
with a dimmer for a Littlite. It does need

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.700
to be a Littlite brand.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.590
Coming across from this side, we have a Kensington
lock. And this is a standard computer lock

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.160
that you can get at any computer store for
securing the console to a table.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.320
A little RJ11 port. This is for plugging in
the phone remote. You can find out more about

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.769
the phone remote in the manual or in some
data sheets on our Web site. The remote macros

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:47.499
trigger. The information for this, is in the
Ion manual. MIDI in and out, so if you’re

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:54.620
doing a MIDI connection to some other device.
Two ports of DMX. Five-pin XLR connector,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.379
pretty standard. We’re gonna plug into Port
1.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.479
Coming across, the AV ports here are non-functional.
They really don’t do anything for our console.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:15.000
Network connection. This is a standard RJ45
plug. The little tab goes up. Six USB ports.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.030
These for options like a keyboard, mouse,
or if you’re using touch screens. The way

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.490
the touch screens function is to plug into
the USB ports, so there are six of them on

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.030
the backside.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.159
Two DVI connectors. And the trick with DVIs
is they have this flat little pin that you

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.549
have be careful of, and the pins are kinda
small so do pay attention when you’re plugging

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.369
it in. This can go two DVI monitors, or a
VGA, a combination that’ll only run on two,

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.270
not three. So any two of those.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.200
Mains power, pretty standard. It does come
with the mains power plug, as you would expect.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.910
And then the main breaker. This is the mains
power switch. This is really just a mains

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.990
kind of a breaker. It’s not intended to
be your everyday on/off switch. You’ll just

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.429
leave it in the I position, and we’ll go
over powering the console up and shutting

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.560
it down in another tutorial.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.270
Coming across to the fan, there’s nothing
else on this side. Make sure the fan and these

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.950
vents stay clear. The console does wanna stay
cool. The plugs kind of keep enough space,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.030
but try to avoid dropping anything down into
the backside here. And that kinda covers the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.670
major connections on the backside of element
console.
