00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.270
Hi my name is Ronald Gallardo; I’m from
Dublin, CA.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.490
I own MDS, Mobile Detail Specialists, and
I’m taking the class here to add-on to my

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.490
business.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.020
It’s the Paintless Dent Repair class.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.090
I got to work with Dennis; he’s a really
good trainer.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.580
I learned a lot from Dennis.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.300
There are some hands-on courses you’ll take
and the instructors just ignore you and just

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.890
tell you this and that, Dennis will be there
with you and show you the right steps and

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.080
I learned a lot from him.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.820
I’m glad I got him as a trainer.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.129
When asking questions, you can’t be shy,
just call his name and he’ll just run up

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.059
to you and see what’s going on and help
you and show you step by step.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.500
Practice panels were a little hard at first
but once you started getting use to it, it

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.130
started getting easier.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.590
Then the second day, I actually started seeing
what I was doing the first day and fixed those

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.590
mistakes.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.840
And then when they gave us an actual car to
do it on, it got even easier because you’re

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.229
actually against a vehicle instead of just
on a panel.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.770
You can feel the type of leverage you need
to push those dents up.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.780
The dents that we’re doing here is what
I see every day on cars.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.750
You see a bunch of door dings, or some hail
damages and we fixed those.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.040
From day to day it’s getting better and
better, and now I’m starting to master it.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.829
It was really good experience and now I know
what do.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:02:01.770
This is a really good place to go and I recommend
anyone to go here and learn Paintless Dent

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.070
Repair.
