00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:13.151
Civil View ships with a variety of resource kits that include a library of objects that you can use to embellish the scene.

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:18.208
Generally, these resource kits are defined by country or region.

00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:24.776
Although you can edit any one of these kits, it is often a good idea to work on a Private Resource Kit.

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:29.409
A Private Resource Kit can start off as a duplicate of an existing library.

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:36.209
Editing a private resource kit ensures that the original libraries that ship with the product remain unchanged.

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:39.379
Continue working on your project from the last movie.

00:00:39.764 --> 00:00:44.131
For what you are about to do, you can in fact also work from a blank scene.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:51.699
Make sure Civil View is running and go to its Preferences dialog.

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:56.596
Click the Resource Kit Paths tab.

00:00:57.222 --> 00:01:01.639
Note the path for the resource kits involving the one you set as active.

00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:06.603
Note also that you can set a project-based resource kit.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:12.375
As the name implies, that would be specific for the project you are currently working on.

00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:20.316
A third option lets you specify your own private resource kit that you can use for any project you start or edit.

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:27.633
If you were to enable this option now, it would create the necessary subfolders based on a path you specify.

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:35.218
It would not fill those sub-folders with library items though, in fact, your private kit would start off blank.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.858
If you want to duplicate an existing kit, you would need to copy it from the Country folder to the path you chose.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:49.146
And so, using Windows Explorer, open a session to where the country kits reside.

00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:57.226
Note that the \ProgramData folder is a hidden one, so you have to type it in to reach it on the C drive.

00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:04.236
In the country kit folder, there are five kits to choose from.

00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:13.060
Depending on your location and unit preference, you choose the kit that suits you best, in this case Country Kit US Metric

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:20.795
It has many subfolders. Go ahead and select them all, and then right-click and copy them to memory.

00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:35.069
Now go to the C3D_to_3dsMax folder you created on the C Drive and create a subfolder named:"myMetric Kit"

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.953
Go into that subfolder, 

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:45.410
and then paste the library contents you copied to memory.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.250
Once you have done that, go back to 3ds Max Design and enable Use Private Resource Kit.

00:03:00.253 --> 00:03:06.081
Click the path button and point to the myMetric Kit folder you just created.

00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:17.923
Click OK when done. From this point on, you get a choice of using either the original Country kit, or your own Private one.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.578
Of course, you can now make changes to your private kit without risking damaging the original country kit that ships with 3ds Max Design.

00:03:27.298 --> 00:03:31.898
Although you probably don't need to, you may want to restart 3ds Max Design.

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:41.273
It is a pet peeve of mine but I like to restart 3ds Max when dealing with plugins and script changes, even when it is not absolutely necessary.

00:03:43.387 --> 00:03:49.783
With that done, you now start using Civil View and its wonderful capabilities to embellish your bridge design.

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:53.885
This is what you do in the next movie, starting with Road Markings.
