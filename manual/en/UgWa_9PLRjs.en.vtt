Hi! I’m Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village, and today we’re going

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.582
to talk about training dogs. We’re working
with Gloria the husky on recall now. Now the

00:00:09.582 --> 00:00:15.259
recall is the come command, and it’s absolutely
the number one thing that husky owners need

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.519
to focus on. It’s a number one complaint
that we as trainers hear from husky owners

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.119
about their dogs. They love to run away, they’re
very curious, very independent and this is

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.519
how huskies usually are. Checking out, scanning
their environment and wanting to get off the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.290
leash. Now with Gloria, we have found that
food is not a good motivator. So I’m going

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.360
to risk becoming a fool on the camera to show
you another way to get your dog to come to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.360
you. I’m going to jump up and down, scream
and run backward, and say the word come when

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:58.780
she starts to come. Yippee, come, good, very
nice, very nice. Gloria is immediately checking

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:07.540
out her environment again, so I’ll do it
again, good, come, good girl, now that time

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.760
she found me kind of interesting. Now one
thing about the recall with this dog, see

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.620
how she comes and she immediately turns around.
I want to start grabbing her collar when she

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.909
gets to me and then say okay, before she goes
off again, that means she gets used to having

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.150
her collar touched. It will give her owners
an opportunity to grab her if she has run

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:37.810
off and come back, and I’m letting her go
off again on my terms, not hers. Come, good

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:52.540
girl, okay. The reward in this case is getting
to run off again. Come, good, good, …Gloria

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.690
is turning this into a game, okay, good girl.
It can be a challenge to teach a husky to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.350
come, but be patient, your dog is worth it.
