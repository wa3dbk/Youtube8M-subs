00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.920
Hi I'm Jeff Kriet and I'm going to talk to
you about the Hydrowave.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.340
I hear all the time does it really work??

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.700
But I'm telling you that it works, 100% it
works.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.600
On the Bassmaster Elite Tour 100 guys have
a hydrowave on their

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
boat.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.410
You never want to be the guy without one.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.550
But some of the tricks I've learned and I've
probably run this this longer

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.100
than anybody other than KVD, there is no really
you don't have to worry about screwing up.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Okay?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.420
Just turn it on and run it.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.300
If you're just out fishing I like this thing
on right now I have it on power pattern with

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.829
a 30 second delay.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:40.829
Okay?

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.589
You cannot go wrong with it
and when you run it the volume depends on

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.589
the condition.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.570
Like today its not overly windy it's kind
of calm so I'm going to come in here and set

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.930
my volume on
like 3 to 4 bars.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.930
Okay?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm not going to blast them out I just want
that little crackling of the shad and things

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.309
like that.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.630
Now if it's really windy,
I'll bring that volume up.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.900
The other thing i'll do is if I was in here
right now and if I was seeing fishing schooling

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.020
around a little bit I might turn that volume
really high

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.040
because what I'm going to do when I do that
is I'm going to bring the shad in closer to

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.950
me that way they will start blowing up in
range of my casting, so I don't have to troll

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.000
over here to try to catch one that blew up
and then troll over there you will literally

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.530
bring the fish in.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.430
Another tip I can tell you that has made a
big difference for me

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.880
is when I'm practicing.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.880
Okay?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.640
When I'm out on these ledges and I'm out there
trolling around and looking around trying

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.420
to find them that's a lot of the times
where I'll run this volume on 10 and I'll

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.990
tell you why because I'm not concerned in
practice about catching those fish.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.300
When I crank the thing up to 10
any bass that were on the very bottom you

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.300
will never see them on your graph.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.560
So if I turn this thing up really high what's
going to happen is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.900
when I'm watching my graph I'll watch these
fish raise up a little bit they will swim

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.670
because they're curious because you know they
will here that shad and they here the feeding

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.709
they will swim up.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.599
I'm not worried about catching them so I will
drop a way point right where I am and then

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.420
when I come back around when I fish for them
I may turn that volume back down

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.470
but I'll know exactly where they are.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.680
Its worked for me several times and during
tournaments also where I've been catching

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.120
them on a ledge and may have my buoy out and
I'm fishing and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.879
I'm not really getting bit.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.150
So I roll up my buoy and as I start fishing
them may have moved 40 or 50 yards.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.200
So always remember on your graph that the
fish that are on the very bottom

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.459
you won't see, you'll never see them.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.170
But if you can bring them up a couple feet
you will see them.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.189
Use that Hydrowave for practice; it's a big
big tool for that.
