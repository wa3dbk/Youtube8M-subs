Hi, Sharon Danley here with another two tips in two minutes. This week it's about

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.780
addressing the emotional aspects of
transitioning from colored hair to your natural gray.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.420
It's a journey you're going on or your heart part way through or maybe you've finished.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.320
It's a really good idea with any journey to keep a journal

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.920
write in the journal once a week even
about your feelings about going through

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.690
the transition. Write down about people
who are complimenting you or people who

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.700
are making sometimes some pretty unfair
judgments about the fact that you've

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:52.360
decided to embrace your grey.  Often when people make harsh statements about your decision to embrace

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.920
your gray hair - it's about them not about you.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.129
It's about their fear of possibly doing the same
thing when they see a person who's going

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.799
through the change with confidence -
walking with aplomb - it's scary because

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.900
they don't feel that perhaps they could
do it themselves or to change would upset

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.500
their lives. And it does. When you make
any change in any lifestyle situation it

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.860
does change and like the famous a family
systems therapist John Bradshaw would say

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.490
with the mobile - when you make a move
or do something different everyone

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.360
around you is affected by your decision
in some way shape or form.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.840
Now when you get good compliments -  which you will - and often you'll find by men -

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.880
write those down to keep a journal or a section in your journal for comments and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.270
experiences that you've gone through
that have uplifted you, made you feel

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.850
good, made you feel like yes I'm glad I'm
doing this - so that when you get

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.100
something that's negative you've got a positive to bounce off it.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.640
And the other thing that's really good to do is to take a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.680
selfie once a week perhaps in the
beginning but definitely once a month.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.840
Take front, profile and back views and log those in with your journal you will so glad that you did this.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.440
Remember any change in life is a journey and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.560
embracing your gray hair in a society
that still sort of looks at grey hair as

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.800
all those old broads -  you don't want to
be like that or witches or Crone's. Yes

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.020
the paradigm is shifting and currently
in 2015 grey hair is all the rage but

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.350
that's a trend and we know that trends
come and go. However good style, chicness,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:07.240
timeless look, it's always in fashion -
always looks good - and always makes you feel better.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.840
So during this transition period record your journey both

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.020
with images and with words or even read into
a tape recorder and you know have your

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.489
own voice speaking back to you. You will
be very glad that you did because you

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.800
will discover many, many gems along the
way about people, about your family and friends,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.160
but mostly about you.   Enjoy - we'll see you next time.
