00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.090
hey guys, today I got you guys a girl power raid which composes of 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.160
archer's healers and valks. If you guys are
interested makes to sure to stay tune and check

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.839
it out

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.980
get down  

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.179
there

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.990
yo what is up guys this is neo and  today I
am here with a new gameplay for you guys

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.810
it is a Class A clans gameplay as you
guys

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.720
obviously expected so this is girl power
ranid where I put down all the girl troops

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.230
in clash of clans and and put them in this
attack

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.070
So first off I have 11 Valks, 4 healers

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.410
56 archer's perfect enough to do this
raid however guys I do not have the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.260
witches is which is really unfortunate

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.810
but I will post a new vid with the
witches and sorry guys hear some

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.950
snapping right now

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.220
I do apologize for that I'm just really
tired eyes to be honest all

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.739
so I put the archers in the outer area just to
take down the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.140
small defense and all this stuff: wizard towers and etc.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.750
In the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.780
Valks just to take down all the elixir and get all the storage  

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.700
I really need now I see them spread out
two healers on the left two healers on

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.430
the right which is really perfect for
this raid guys

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.890
now with the distraction going on these
archer's can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.320
easily take down anything beneath them and this giant bomb. Oh Well :P

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.240
such a sad story for these archers

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.870
really I wish they had like a lot of
like I don't know, health or something like that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.210
they die very easily and I know I have bad
composition whenever I do these raids.  I

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.340
do apologize

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.570
I try to find the best raids for you
guys and all that so

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.500
so far to taking down all the motors in
the defences which is proving to be

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.560
really successful guys. All the healers just died which pretty unfortunate

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.720
I really don't mind about the healers dying. What I mind is about the archers

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.090
and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.170
Valks staying alive because these healers are the main component as much as there

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.520
main component if they die

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.890
I'm still ok because the Valks still have some health and will still survive

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.299
so far to motors only problem but without further do, they take down the motar

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.490
like a boss

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.319
and take down all the good loot over
200,000 I believe

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.720
200,000 loot

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.770
Which is a sucessful 3 star guys and next raid I got for you guys  

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.530
same raid, girl power raid except I got

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.160
different composition slightly now I
known as a space is the inside out so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.850
I put out my barb king

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.860
just to take down the main stuff like anything surrounding it now

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.360
seeing my barb king just died was just a
disappointment. Like I really expected

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.790
to see my barb king take down the level two but oh well. I put down my rage spell

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.370
like all I was really panic. I was like aw

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.620
shoot my barb king just died so i put down my

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.550
spammed out all my Valks and my healers and I put the archers in the outer area

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.650
not this bomb and I hate bombs. I'm not kidding. So the archers in the outer area

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.090
just to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.300
serve as a distraction like I mean used the Valks as a distraction so the archers can 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.420
take it down easily

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.820
now they're getting taken down a lot and
these cannons do a lot of damage

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.490
two archers that one hit kill I need
upgrade my archers guys

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.620
because I know Town Hall 8 I could probably upgrade to another level

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.460
or something like that

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.770
but what I do like is that how the Archer
towers and the mortar towers, they focus

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.160
on

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.330
one thing like let's say the Valks so I
can use the archer's

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.120
to use an attack these defenses

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.320
basically these Valks are like the
distractions all

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.660
while the archers can easily take them down. So all the good loot are getting

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.750
taken right now

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.770
almost a hundred thousand loot which I
think yeah right now 100 over a hundred

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.510
ten thousand loot

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.920
guys there was a towers doing a lot of damage so I put down my rage spells just in case

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.520
who knows

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.100
different outcomes happen in every raid
guys and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.660
I don't want; to have to play it safe
guys just to win this and get the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.660
three stars all the defenses are taken down. Whats left is the townhall

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.980
Town Hall and they wanted outer area for
Army compositions and seed archers and

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.070
outs working together girl power guys

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.110
taking that town hall down with that
successful three-star

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.580
yes and for the next raid I got for
you guys it is a two star and

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.760
fortunately oh some

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.970
was one my first raids I've done with the girl power which is really badly

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.640
coordinated

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.340
I was really cocky with this raid like
looking at the walls and apologize for

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.270
that guys like

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.710
I try to zoom in but I keep pressing that, for some reason so

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.180
looking at the walls and everything. I was like Awh dude this is too easy

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.500
three-star all the way nope, nope that's no it 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.990
guys like I badly composed this raid. I
should've put in my Valks first and  then my

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.879
archers you see

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.229
once I put down my archer's they just died
and once I put out my Valks

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.490
they finally do damage to basically I
wasted like 15 seconds on this raid

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.879
when archers which I really regret doing
but doesn't matter guys I still get that

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.099
star at the end

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.030
so going in and taken on the defenses and I needed that loot. hundred thousand loot

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.310
36,000 elixir and 125 dark elixir

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.550
now with this raid I really got  be
honest with you. you're gonna spend a lot

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.090
elixirr guys not really dark elixir as
much

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.610
I might but if your town hall 8 maxed like I am (almost) 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.949
is not huge sum but it's going to cost
a lot elixir

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:17.030
one archers two healers and the rage spells and everything

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.099
Whenever I raid, I try to conserve my rage spells and healers 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.860
but I decided oh well, you know what, it doesn't matter, lets do this and put

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.789
down all my

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.700
rage spell. So I put down that one rage spell right down there because

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.550
I really wanted to get that 50 percent
guys and when I did I was like

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.840
oh you know what guys I can get a
hundred percent i then

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.750
end up putting my, I think my rage spells
around now

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.860
yep right now hold on hold on, 3 , 2, 1

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.770
I never did guys

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.699
I really apologize so this is basically the end of the raid. I see that one Valk but

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.600
couldn't do a lot of damage really

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.319
the archers finally died

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.659
I find it really interesting

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.699
Ok, you go up, there are a couple more archers left but they died

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.669
anyways guys successful right here. 3 to 2
stars. Cost a lot of money

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.370
and thanks for watching guys. Please comment below what other raid I should do

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.340
and I'll see you later in my next video. Ciao
