00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.880
What we're trying to do makes the job go
so much faster

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.910
with a little bit a pre-planning we can
actually

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.490
save ourselves a lot of time and effort.
Remember

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.509
that the BuildBlock are 16 inches tall.
So when we put our footing in

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.809
we want to make sure that we're working
in increments of 16 inches

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.540
when at all possible to make
everything layout.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.829
That way if we have a four inch step
everything, 16, 16, 16, is gonna line up

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.270
when we get to that footing, and  it's gonna continue. If we can save you having to do

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.460
rip cuts it's going to save you time and effort on your project.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.030
As we get going on these things, there's
going to be several things we want to do.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.160
We want to stage our material inside the
hole

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.009
before we get going. That way we're not
running back and forth for product.

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.390
It takes a little time to get it there
beforehand

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.920
but we don't want to start laying block
too early. We want to make sure that we

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.079
have our rebar,

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.799
we have our alighnment system, our bracingin and  that we have our block in the hole

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.060
that we're going to be using

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.580
to save us time and effort when we get
going.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.080
Two quick tips about staging the project;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.290
when you bring your bundles down space
them evenly

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.610
around, by your footing, six-foot
back.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.180
If you were closer we would be moving them again to get the bracing system in as we went.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.500
So what we're gonna do is spread them
evenly and then we're going to use them

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.890
in the area where we set them. Don't use
one bundle

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.229
and then go to the next bundle. Break
your bundles and use them

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.329
as you go by and they will stay more
uniform and even in doing it in that manner.
