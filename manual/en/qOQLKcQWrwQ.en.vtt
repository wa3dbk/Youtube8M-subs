00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.367
Can you hear me?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200
In times like these...

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.333
...we have to ask ourselves several important questions.

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.967
How can you, I, our friends and children really trust

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.867
that what we see on TV and hear on the radio is true?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.533
How do we know that our opinions...

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.967
are really our own?

00:00:39.267 --> 00:00:43.367
How can we be sure that the weak voices are heard

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.633
and not scared into silence?

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:47.667
I can tell you how.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:56.000
There is one person we can thank for all this

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.600
We can thank this person for giving us new perspectives.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.767
We can thank this person for giving us a choice.

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:17.200
This person gives us an alternative to uniformity...

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:18.600
...and short-term thinking.

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.333
We owe this person for

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.000
making an ordinary day into something special.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.000
A day when we rise from the TV couch and say:

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.000
"I've changed my opinion."

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:35.200
There's only one word that does full justice to that person:

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.200
Hero.

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:39.967
Thank you.
