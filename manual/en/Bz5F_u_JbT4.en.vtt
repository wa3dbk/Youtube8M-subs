00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.500
My poetry is based on technique and imagery.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.500
As FÃ¼ssli said: miserable is he who strives
to make things 
that are banal. 
It's a waste of time, isn't it?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.900
I don't copy just photos but I propose an image to which I give a soul so that I can share it with others.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.000
 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.000
An image, in order to be truthful, must portray
something beyond what the eyes can see.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.800
Everything that is art must express the sublime.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.300
She's holding something that cannot be seen,
in fact the real subject is not drawn, it's

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.400
hidden by the thumb, it is hidden! And that's
where the sublime lies.
