00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.110
Today on our 2004 Dodge Dakota, we'll be installing
part number TX262101 the truck's port tonneau

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.849
cover from Truxedo.

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.850
We'll take the two siderails and we'll need
to apply the weather seal here on the corner

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.930
plug, here at the front corner.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.360
After doing that, we'll set them in the place
on the bedside, where we can then attach our

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.670
front cover assembly.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:34.230
You wanna make sure that the corner plug slides
into the cover assembly like so.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.280
We'll now put the clamps loosely over our
rail.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.000
You'll notice the clamps have teeth.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.850
These teeth will fit here into the siderails
matching the teeth on the siderails.Now, with

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.129
all the clamps loosely installed, we'll center
the cover with the truck.

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.890
We'll need to make sure we get them as close
to the cab on the bed as possible.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.129
We can go ahead and snug them down.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.690
We can now go ahead and start on rolling our
tonneau cover.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:30.480
This will help to keep the rails even while
we tighten 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:02:12.200
them down.
