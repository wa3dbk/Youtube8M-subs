My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.810
actually make eggnog and stop of buying that
stuff in carton at the grocery store. So we

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.480
got our eggs. Now the important thing to do
here, make sure your eggs are really cold

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.430
because if your eggs are warm or room temperature
even, that makes this a lot harder. I'll show

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.730
you what happens here. So were just going
to take our egg, one of down sides to using

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.910
a plastic bowl, is that it's not really hard
enough, well I guess it is, it is barely hard

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.350
enough to crack an egg. What we'll do, this
is how I do it. Everyone's got their own way.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:40.059
I just take the top off the egg like that,
take my hand and just go like this. What I

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:48.460
want to do is make sure I keep my yolks in
one bowl, and my whites in another. You want

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.569
to try hard as you can to not get any yolks
with your white because if you do, you'll

00:00:54.569 --> 00:01:00.410
have to start over. Having a little problem
here, see what I told you about that plastic

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.620
bowl, if you get any yolk in with your white,
your whites won't whip, you get any fat in

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.110
there at all. See if you crack it a little
further down you get lucky and a lot of it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:22.720
just falls down in that first little crack
there. Just a couple more to go here. Like

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.180
I said take your time, be careful, because
if you get any yolk, any yolk whatsoever,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.610
it ruins it. See what I'm doing, I'm holding
the yolk like this. I'm letting the white

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.590
fall through my fingertips get squish my fingertips
together to make sure it all gets out of there.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.950
Now you can get white with yolk all day long
and that won't cause any problems at all,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:56.630
except for the fact that it'll just make your
yolks a little harder to whip. Also, you keep

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.430
the shell out of both of them, because that's
an undesirable part. Let this last little

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:20.040
bit just drip off, if it will,
and if it won't, there we go, so that is how

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.979
you separate eggs.
