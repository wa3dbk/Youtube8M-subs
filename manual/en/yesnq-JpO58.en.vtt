00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.630
Here we are in step number four of the partial
sew in hairstyle using Mrs. Rutter's hair

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.490
extensions from MrsRutters.com in this step
I'm going to be teaching you how to straighten

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.589
your hair extensions as well as how to straighten
your leave out to blend with your look in

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.849
this step I'm going to be focused on teaching
you how to straighten your extensions and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.369
I'm also going to show you how to straighten
your leave out now when you are straightening

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.640
your extensions the process is very easy and
simple and really quick I am going to show

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.649
you how to do that what you want to do is
make sure the hair is divided in half and

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.120
then you want to take a clip and keep one
side sectioned just in the back the reason

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.600
why you want to do this is so that when you're
focusing on straightening another section

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.370
it’s not going to mix with your wavy hair
so you are going to grab small sections working

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.920
your way in the back and you are straightening
you are going to throw it behind your back

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.730
and then you are going to keep doing this
over and over and over again grabbing very

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.710
small sections and putting it behind you until
you straighten your whole side so now you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.180
are going to push the side right back in front
take your clip and you going to now keep your

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.330
straightened section out of the way so that
way it doesn't mix with the wavy hair and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.050
then you are going to do the same process
start in the back straighten it and just keep

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.910
throwing sections to the back of your head
until all of your hair straightened also after

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.140
you do this then you are going to straighten
your leave out so that way it’s more of

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.750
a smooth transition and you are not fighting
to try to straighten your leave out while

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.030
also straightening your extensions that's
why you have to straighten your extensions

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.960
first and then straighten you leave out when
you straightening your extensions I suggest

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.430
that you don't go over the temperature of
350° the reason why is because when you're

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.790
doing this you could encourage heat damage
and with heat damage it makes it hard for

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.570
the curl pattern to return to his natural
state so it's safe to just go up to a maximum

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.200
of 350° when you straightening your extensions
and with your real hair as well now with my

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.560
hair I don't have to straighten on 350° to
get my straightest result I can achieve that

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.039
one 300° now I have also straightened out
my real hair just on the edges except for

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.650
the very top which I will show you how I do
that working with small sections you will

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.189
ensure that you can get your hair straight
as possible with your style so I have already

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.069
done the sides and the back and then I'm going
to be showing you how you want straighten

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:38.239
out the very top of the hair so I have already
prepped you on how you want straighten your

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.959
hair extensions and now I am going to be showing
you specifically how to blend your leave out

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.519
with your partial sew in I have already straightened
the sides of my leave out as well as the back

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.709
and I am just going to be focused on teaching
you how to do so at the top my flatiron is

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.700
already on 300° and my hair has been prepped
with heat protectant when I'm straightening

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.000
my leave out I like to do some small sections
and I suggest that you do as well because

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.060
when you're doing this this is going to make
sure that each section is as straight as possible

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.379
if your sections are too big or too wide or
you parted to far back when you're doing it

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.060
you may not successfully straighten it out
so it may leave behind some wave or kink and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.340
if you want a smooth and silky results you
have to do so in small sections when I straighten

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.180
my hair I like to do so in three parts so
I like to start at the back and part a small

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.299
section and keep that clip because that hair
is going to flow back this way then I like

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.659
to part this in half and have one section
going this way and one section going this

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.939
way and I like to work in section so now I
am just going to take my rat tail comb and

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:57.150
I'm going to section the hair out and keep
the sections clipped where you can see its

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.510
going to be straightening going in these directions
and then this is going to be straight going

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.760
back to the way the hair isn’t resistant
when I comb it all down in its directions

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.569
so now I'm going to start on this section
here and I'm going to part a very thin amount

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:18.000
hair now if you have a wavy hair you can probably
get away the paring a much wider section in

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.530
this but this is how thin I like to do my
sections so now you are just going to comb

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.090
your hair through if necessary you are going
to start at the root and then as soon as you

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.630
close the actual blades the actual plates
as soon as you close them on your roots you

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:51.100
are going to slide through your hair so you
close and start sliding as you can see very

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.590
simple now keep doing this in small sections
so that this is straightened and then you

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.830
can move to this side or you can do the back
first it doesn't matter just work on one section

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:31.380
at a time 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.430
once you straighten you leave out this is
how your hair should look Mrs. Rutter's hair

00:05:35.430 --> 00:06:00.030
extensions 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.710
so now that all of your hair has been straightened
in the very next step, step number five I'm

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.650
going to be teaching you how to achieve a
high ponytail as well as add big curls to

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.240
your partial sewin hairstyle
