00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.370
 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.040
inside of this cartridge there are 3
sponges. one for each color.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.940
cyan magenta and yellow

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.340
the sponge contains the Ink

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.100
the sponge is made of a material called hydrophobic foam.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.200
it's a synthetic porous rubber

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.100
imbued with water-repelling agents

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.700
hydrophobic foam repels ink rather than absorbing it

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.900
and controls the ink flow inside the cartridge.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.200
put the cartridge on an area where you can tolerate a spill, 
or on some newspaper

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.600
Remove the label from top of the cartridge.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.399
now the filler opening is visible

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.700
you'll see several holes.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
if you are not sure which is the right refilling hole

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.200
stick a needle down into each chamber

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.200
then wipe with paper to check out the
correct filling hole.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.100
during refilling a little Ink might come
out of the top to the cartridge, if full.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.700
so cover up the other refilling holes to avoid contamination.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.400
Fill the syringe with a maximum of 5 milliliters of color ink

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.900
insert the needle into the cartridge enough to penetrate the internal sponge.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.400
you will notice a slight resistance

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500
this is due to the sponge inside the
cartridge

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.900
Very slowly inject the ink into the cartridge.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.310
If the hole is too small for the
syringe

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.500
you can use a knife to widen it for filling.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.000
Ensure that you stop if the ink rises to the top of the filler opening

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.000
In this case, draw a little back into the syringe

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.500
when finished you can leave the top
label off, and the filling holes exposed

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.700
the cartridge has to pull in air, or it will not works

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.950
Remove the tape over the other refilling
openings

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.000
replace the cartridge and run a cleaning
cycles

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.790
for best results leave cartridge in
printer for two hours after refilling

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.700
so the ink can saturate the entire sponge.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.200
After reinserting the refilled cartridge, 
your printer may show an error message

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.400
saying that the cartridge is empty.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.860
this is because the printer knows that cartridge

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.800
from the serial number and knows it to
be empty.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.890
You can only replace the cartridge with another refilled one

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.500
or follow the Reset instructions.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.600
If the print is poor, the printhead of the cartridge may be blocked with dried ink

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.590
If you need to clean the cartridge

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.610
follow the instructions of this video.
