00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.730
[alert chime]

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.080
Potter&gt;&gt;This is the "blue light in your pocket"... it's the assist function

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.030
and if you're in some real trouble you can hold on this emergency button...

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.280
its gonna send a report... and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.760
put you directly in contact with public
safety

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.080
[alert chime]

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.380
As soon as I press that button they know
who I am, and where I am, as well as my

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.990
emergency information if 
I choose to provide it

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.870
Irish&gt;&gt; Besides the blue light, our motto here is:
"Inform, Report &amp; Assist"

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.290
and so we offer the inform stream - it is easy
access to phone numbers over at public

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.860
safety

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.610
That can be used by faculty, staff,
students... also parents who want to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.690
get that information. We also offer a
medium level reports like a jump start or

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.239
a noise complaint... anything like that.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.680
And that really helps people who, you
know, just wanna

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.379
put in a noise complaint and not have to call
public safety - and handle things at a little

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.140
lower level.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.280
And finally, like I said, for anything else
we have the blue light that someone can

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.200
press and hold and get instant attention.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.210
Officer&gt;&gt; Some folks are nervous calling public safety, you know, and they don't know

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.850
the location: "Where am I?... I'm next to a...
dumpster."

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.399
So now we get more detail with location.
They can put comments in there...

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.550
you know, the exact location where
they're located... color of the vehicle... or

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.240
things like that. It just makes it easier
for them.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.810
Irish&gt;&gt; So at RIT we have a very large deaf and hard-of-hearing population

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.500
and we've had that in mind from
beginning there. So we designed this so that

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.710
a user can either choose to call or text
after the press the blue light

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.700
Officer&gt;&gt; Yessir, if you can head over to University Commons...

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.330
Director&gt;&gt; GPS is just another service...

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.810
certain situations are fluid, so at least
we'll know: OK, they reported this condition,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.340
they happened to be in Parking Lot B.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.299
So at least we know: okay, at least we knew where they were at the time of the call.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.800
It's just good information.
Information is vital to any emergency service.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.520
Potter&gt;&gt; The benefit of
this is you don't need to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.189
go to a location to send a report. You just pull it out of your pocket.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.210
Irish&gt;&gt; We also like to say that, you know, maybe we have ninety-five blue lights here

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.400
but now we have 20,000...

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.460
or however many users we have... you've got that many "blue-lights".
