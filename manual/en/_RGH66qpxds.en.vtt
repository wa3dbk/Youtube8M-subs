WHY WOULD THEY TAKE HER?

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:04.570 align:start size:75% position:25%
BECAUSE I WAS CARELESS.

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:07.907
BECAUSE SOMEHOW HE FOUND OUT
WHO SHE WAS, WHO YOU WERE,

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.341 size:53% position:73%
AND HE KNEW
I'D COME FOR HER.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.044 size:72% position:36%
WHY? WHY WOULD YOU COME
FOR HER?

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.612 size:53% position:73%

MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

RICHARD,

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.585 align:start size:53% position:47%
I'M YOUR FATHER.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.723 size:53% position:27%
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'RE A SPY?

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.358 size:69% position:66%
"INTELLIGENCE ASSET"
IS THE TERM.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:30.029 align:start position:0%
MY DAD'S A SPY.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.197 align:start position:0%

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.699 align:start size:28% position:72%
MNH-MNH.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.934 size:66% position:67%
WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU
ABOUT ME?

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:39.372 align:start position:0%
UH, THAT IT WAS
A SPECIAL NIGHT.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.274 align:start position:0%
SHE WAS IN LOVE.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.176
SHE WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING,
YOU WERE GONE.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.311 size:75% position:38%
SHE NEVER SAW YOU AGAIN.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.082 align:start size:56% position:44%
YEAH, THAT NIGHT,

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.851 size:78% position:61%
I HAD JUST FINISHED A JOB
AT THE U.N.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:52.952 align:start size:72% position:28%
LEAST I THOUGHT I HAD.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.187 align:end position:100%
AND THE NEXT DAY,
THINGS WENT SOUTH.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.290 size:78% position:61%
I HAD TO
GET OUT OF THE CITY FAST.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.693 size:75% position:63%
IT WAS A YEAR BEFORE
I WAS STATESIDE AGAIN.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.262 size:72% position:64%
THAT'S WHEN I FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOU.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.564 size:75% position:38%
YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT ME...

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.333 size:50% position:25%
ABOUT US,
ALL THESE YEARS,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.069
AND YOU NEVER ONCE LET US KNOW
YOU WERE OUT THERE?

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.738 size:72% position:64%
WHAT I DO
MEANS NO COMMUNICATION,

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:15.141 size:53% position:73%
NO RELATIONSHIPS,
TO ANYONE.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:17.843 size:53% position:73%
BUT... HEY,
I'VE BEEN AROUND.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.013 align:start size:56% position:44%
WE'VE MET BEFORE.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.147 align:start size:19% position:81%
YEAH.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.482 size:59% position:70%
WHEN YOU WERE
ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD,

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.751 size:63% position:69%
YOUR MOTHER TOOK YOU
TO THE LIBRARY,

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.586 align:end position:100%
AND YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR A BOOK AND, UH,

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.087 size:88% position:56%
I GAVE YOU A COPY OF, UH--

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.556 align:start position:0%
"CASINO ROYALE."

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:31.891 align:start size:19% position:81%
YEAH.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.393 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS YOU?

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.799 size:75% position:38%
THAT BOOK MADE ME
WANT TO BECOME A WRITER.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.534
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN
I READ YOUR FIRST SPY NOVEL.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:42.702 align:start position:0%
YOU READ MY BOOKS?

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:43.869 align:start size:31% position:69%
OH, YEAH.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.004 size:66% position:67%
I GREASED SOME WHEELS
AT THE CIA

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:46.205 size:63% position:69%
WHEN YOU WERE TRYING
TO GET ACCESS

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:48.441 size:59% position:70%
TO SOME INFORMATION
FOR RESEARCH.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.043 align:start size:75% position:25%
I KNOW THAT'S NOT MUCH,

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:52.145 size:84% position:58%
BUT FOR A MINUTE THERE...

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.980 align:start size:47% position:53%
IT MADE ME FEEL
LIKE A FATHER.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:57.383 size:84% position:58%
NO, I'VE BEEN, UH, CHECKING
ON YOU AND YOUR MOM

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.285 align:start size:34% position:66%
AND ALEXIS

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.621 align:start size:56% position:44%
YOUR WHOLE LIVES.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.288
THIS MAN WHO HAS MY DAUGHTER,
WHO IS HE?
