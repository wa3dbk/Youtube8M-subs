00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:09.309
I’m going to show you a series of numbers,
and you need to recall them when I ask.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.639
Ready?

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.969
6,3,4,7,1,5,2.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.619
This is a picture of my dog, who in my opinion
is ridiculously good looking.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070
Do you remember the series of numbers?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.250
If you got all 7, in the right order, your
working memory is, well, working.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.020
But there’s someone who would have trouble
repeating those numbers.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.590
He’s renowned for having a terrible memory.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.080
This is Henry Molaison, also known as Patient
H.M., one of the most famous patients in brain

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.250
science.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.030
As a child, H.M. hit his head and began having
seizures.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.940
They became worse and worse as he got older.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.070
When he was 27, H.M. had surgery and the part
of his temporal lobe that included his hippocampus

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.879
was sucked out of his head.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.160
It was the early 1950s and no one was certain
what would happen next.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.330
H.M.’s seizures stopped, but he became forgetful.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.480
He couldn’t retain some information and
couldn’t recall the few years before the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.900
surgery.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.940
Researchers were puzzled–he remembered some
things, but not others.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.759
So they studied H.M. to try to piece together
his behaviour.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.200
Without his hippocampus, H.M. couldn’t couldn’t
store declarative memories — our memories

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.460
for facts like a phone number or dog breed.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.549
But he could retain procedural memories — those
for learning a skill, like riding a bike.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.060
H.M. kept repeating a task where, only using
a mirror to see the reflection of his hand,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.430
he’d draw a shape in between two lines.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.390
His motor skills doing the task kept improving,
even though he had no memory of completing

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.830
it before.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.530
Researchers discovered there were these different
types of memory.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.610
And that they relied on different areas of
our brain.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.910
When we form declarative memories, the information
travels to the hippocampus before it’s consolidated

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.090
and permanently stored.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.340
And when we form procedural memories, they
rely on other areas, the cerebellum and basal

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.340
ganglia.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.110
Without a hippocampus, H.M. was missing a
pretty important piece.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.440
The case of H.M. helped us understand the
nature of memory, that there are different

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.580
types of it that rely on different parts of
your brain.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.640
His brain was such a big deal that in 2009,
after he passed away, it was cut up into 2,401

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.780
paper-thin slices and reconstructed into a
3D model.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.260
It’s over 60 years since he first had his
hippocampus sucked out of his brain and we’re

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.790
still learning from H.M.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.910
And one last thing!

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.210
Do you remember that series of numbers?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.520
Go on…

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.510
If you forgot, 6,3,4,7,1,5,2.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.400
And don’t worry.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.980
H.M wouldn’t even remember being asked in
the first place.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.140
And um, here’s another picture of my dog.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.670
In case you remembered that.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.970
And maybe wanted to see her again.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.660
So good looking.
