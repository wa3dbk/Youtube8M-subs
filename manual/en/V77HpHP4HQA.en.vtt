00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.990
&gt;&gt;Announcer: Build this custom planter bench
that adds an interesting twist to any outdoor

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.889
space.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.759
The bench is a basic build. Start with the
back frame which is two posts, a cap, and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.359
a series of rails. Flip the frame and add
the front rails. You'll also add the cable

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.499
rail where you'll attach the wires used to
hold the planters.

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:30.150
Build the front frame of the bench by adding
the front and back rails to the legs. Join

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.730
the two frames using the shelf connectors
and the seat connectors. Then you can install

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.000
most of the slats for the bench shelf and
the seat leaving these spots open to attach

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.510
the wire ropes.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.510
With the bench built, it's time to install
the clever planters. These are actually pieces

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.430
of duct work I found in the heating and cooling
aisle and when you open them up a little and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.430
attach these duct caps using machine screws.
Either paint or leave them 'natural'. Next,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.320
drill the small holes on each end that you'll
use to wire the planters onto the bench.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.870
The wire ropes that hold the planters are
secured at the bottom of the bench, and at

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.550
the top so start at the top and thread the
wires through the eye screws and secure them

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.320
with these wire clips. Mark the height your
first planter will hang at. Put some tension

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.320
on the wire, and mark the measurement with
some tape. Thread the wire through the holes,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.970
and shimmy your planter up and into place.
Use a couple more of these wire clips to secure

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.860
them, then repeat the whole process for the
remaining two planters.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.030
To secure the bottom, you pull the wire right
through the openings in the bench, and using

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.030
the wire clips again, secure it to the eye
screws just like you did at the top.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.510
That's it! Install the final slats, add plants,
and enjoy.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.520
