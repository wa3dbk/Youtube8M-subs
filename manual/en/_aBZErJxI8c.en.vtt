00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.600
[220 Mile High Lab]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.800
[International Space Station]

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.522
Everything about
space is hazardous.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.857
It's extremely
harsh environment.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.927
And yet here we have a
laboratory where humans

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.996
can thrive, and they can
do experiments, and

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.864
they can learn more
about their environment

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.224
and how to mitigate
those dangers.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.937
The International Space Station

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:41.541
right now it's going
through space at 17,500

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.242
miles an hour.
It's surrounded

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.745
by a vacuum, so that
if you got a hole

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:47.980
in any of the modules,
then you would lose

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.583
all of your air
pressure inside.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.152
When it's in the sun,
it's at 160 degrees,

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:56.088
and when it's cold it's
at minus 50 degrees.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.458
It gives us our
first long term

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.195
access to space life.

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:05.703
This is how do you live
and operate in space.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.235
There's usually over 200
experiments that are

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.870
on the International
Space Station at any

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:14.540
one time. Now we're at
the very beginning of

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.142
getting science results back.

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:18.778
It's showing that it is
worth that investment.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.747
What Boeing does for the
International Space Station,

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.251
is we are the sustaining
engineers. So, we make

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.553
sure that the International Space Station

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.822
is functioning properly so that the astronauts

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.325
can stay healthy and they're
not having to worry about

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.027
maintenance or repairing
different parts of the station.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.596
They could spend their
time doing real science

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:40.333
experiments and if an experiment

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.301
comes in the door to
NASA and they would like

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.303
to put it on the
International Space Station,

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.305
Boeing is very highly
involved in making sure

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.609
that it is safely integrated
into the space station

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.477
and can be used by the astronauts.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.080
We're working hard to
streamline the processes

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:57.517
to get experiments quickly
up onto space station.

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.152
One of the experiments
showed that viruses

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.088
react differently in space.
When you get out

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:03.689
of the gravity
environment they become

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.124
much more deadly.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.793
What that did is it enabled
the scientists on the ground

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.096
to be able to determine
ways to make them

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.064
less deadly because
that genetic marker

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.600
is the same. And then
they can develop vaccines.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.669
So, they're looking at
vaccines for things like

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.871
Salmonella, which effects

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:22.575
hundreds and thousands of
people across the world.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:26.579
They looked at MRSA, the flesh
eating bacteria virus,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.347
you know, and if you can
find effective ways

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.483
ways to treat those things
from things that you

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.218
learn on the International
Space Station, then

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.487
that's a benefit
for everyone.

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.255
There has never been
anything like the

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.790
International Space Station.

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.659
I'm just really proud to be

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.461
a part of the team that
has built the capability

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.764
that is unique in the
history of the world.

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:46.332
You know, we've taken
the best minds and

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.301
we've built something
that I think will

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.124
really help humanity.
