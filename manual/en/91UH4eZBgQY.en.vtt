With MobileForge you can see just how accurately your smartphone or tablet

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.490
displays photos, videos, and other digital content

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.480
whether you're testing devices for
hardware reviewing company

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.240
or are curious about the color performance other device you have at home

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.400
the MobileForge generates parents automatically for CalMAN display calibration software

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.720
so you can measure the unique color
performance of your Android device

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.880
to verify the proper screen mode with
the highest color accuracy

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.300
to get started simply download and install the free MobileForge app from the Google Play Store

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.380
on your Android device

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.400
and you also need to download and install the free CalMAN ColorCkecker Software

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
from the SpectaCal website on your Windows computer

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.240
here's whats needed to do this test,  you'll need free CalMAN ColorCecker software,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.600
the free MobileForge app, and a colorimeter

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.020
with the MobileForge app in waiting to connect mode

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.260
open up CalMAN ColorChecker software

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.300
select find source, find the MobileForge pattern generator under manufacture SpectraCal

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.049
search for your device and click connect

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.350
Once it's connected you can go ahead and select the meter you are using to do the measurements

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.719
select find meter make sure that it says all those meters except for the listed below and click search

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.380
CalMAN ColorChecker software will search for the device

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:26.880
and if it's connected to USB port with the drivers installed it will find the device and start functioning

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.000
once the meter is connected go ahead and position it over the device that you'll be measuring

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.800
select the settings tab, make sure that
you have the proper color space

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.900
that you want to compare the performance at the display to

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.980
in this case we're going with sRGB and
we're using the PC levels

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.220
once we have those selected we will go ahead and do a read series

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.340
and let it capture the color performance of the device

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.620
as you can see

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.280
CalMAN ColorChecker is automating all the patterns

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.780
being rendered on the phone through the MobileForge application

CalMAN ColorChecker collects all this data and present it in the charts and graphs on the ColorChecker software

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.020
capable of generating millions of parents for any combination of red, green, and blue values

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.660
MobileForge is perfect for a single color readings as well series readings for grayscale,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.520
color temperature, color space, ColorChecker and much more
