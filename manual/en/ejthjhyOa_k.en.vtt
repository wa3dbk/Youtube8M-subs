Hi, this is Jon in this clip we will be staining
our project. The color of the stain that I've

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.599
chosen is a natural color. It's going to keep
the wood just about the same color it is,

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.920
but it's just going to bring out the grain
a little bit. I went ahead and placed just

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.570
a couple pieces of scrap wood underneath my
project so that I could elevate it a little

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.030
bit off the table. This is going to help me
stain a little bit easier. To stain my project

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:38.809
I'm just going to take an old rag and soak
it in my stain. I'm just going to rub that

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:47.649
onto my project. Now you can see it's keeping
almost the exact same color of the wood, but

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.289
it's just kind of bringing out the grain a
little bit and making it look just a little

00:00:53.289 --> 00:01:00.739
bit nicer. You're going to want to coat your
whole project with a pretty thick coat of

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.280
stain for first coat here. You're going to
want to let the stain soak in your project

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.050
for just a couple minutes and then just come
back with a dry rag and wipe off any excess

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.740
stain. Now if the project is a little bit
lighter than you would like, you can always

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.490
come back and put a second coat of stain on
and that's going to darken it up a bit. If

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.450
it's still too light you can always do a third
coat or a fourth coat, or keep going until

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.469
you get exactly what you want. Now you want
to make sure that you stain those buttons

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:47.700
as well. What I like to do is take my rag,
put those buttons in it and just form a nice

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.659
little pouch, then I'm just going to dip that
pouch into my bucket of stain.That's going

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.770
to coat them real nicely. You might need to
do it a couple times and then make sure you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.869
lay those out to dry. When you're finished
staining, you'll want to let the stain dry

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.930
over night or at least for a couple of hours.
