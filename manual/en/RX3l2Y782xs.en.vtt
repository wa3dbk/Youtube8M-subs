00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.480
One more?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.260
You don't look satisfied

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.640
Let's take one more

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.460
Hello!

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.160
Hello

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.800
We heard that

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.460
you are working for NYLON

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.680
as a contributing editor

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.260
That's right

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.760
I still have a busy schedule as a model

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.760
But I decided to try out

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.940
a new challenge as an editor

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.980
Are you taking this seriously?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.660
Of course

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.820
I'm being really serious

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.060
Since I have many experiences as a model

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.960
I thought it would be fun to become a fashion editor

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.340
This is 'Stage9' of Apgujeong

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.120
It's a union storage for LEATA and SHEEN66

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.100
I want to introduce a friend

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.840
who is going to help me out today

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.520
He is also from Agency Garten

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.680
His name is Oh Kwon

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.560
We are going to try out some of the outfits

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.600
and try on some accessories together

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.980
Then I'll decide on

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.460
which ones to use for the shooting

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.580
Since you are interested in clothes

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.820
it won't be too hard for you

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.740
But I'm not here as a model today

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.860
So I can't tell for now

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420
These are the lists of items that I need to check here

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.380
and the rough draft

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.980
for the May issue of NYLON

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.500
At first, not many people knew that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.600
I work as an editor

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.940
But thesedays

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.480
they call me 'Editor Sohn'

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.240
I'm not used to it yet

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.380
Let's start with the clothes

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.860
You look like Super Mario

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.540
It would have been easy

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.700
to pick out my outfit

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.080
But I have to select clothes

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.940
for someone else

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.380
It's very different

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.460
I'll take only these

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.440
Have a good day!

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.520
Thank you!

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.640
Now, we are on our way to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.720
the 'thisisneverthat' store

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.540
in Hongdae

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.860
The models of Agency Garten

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.960
are well-known for

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.820
pulling off leather jackets very well

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.140
We are all manly

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.500
Except me

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.580
You are not tough?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.980
Yes. I don't look great in leather jackets

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.440
I got scolded for

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.480
wearing a leather jacket

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.980
To whom?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.920
Our boss...

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.180
You shouldn't have said that!

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.980
Can you decide not to decide

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.020
if you fail to find something suitable?

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.480
I'll keep in mind

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.720
all the things I selected at Stage9

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.240
I have to select something

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.420
that can go well with

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.340
other items

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.900
It's similar with shopping

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.420
my clothes

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.500
Whether it goes well

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.400
with what I already have

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.600
I always keep it in mind

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.560
when I'm shopping

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.140
I think you'll be familiar with the whole process

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.840
since you worked as a model

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.980
But I don't have as much sense

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.120
as the experts

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.240
If I had that sense

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.340
I would be a stylist

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.520
and a photographer myself

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.160
I get to meet many editors

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.020
And I really respect them

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.860
It's good to have many experiences when you are young

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.220
What is the best thing about being an editor?

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.420
The best part...

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.100
I think it's no different from a model

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.060
When the final outcome comes out

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.840
and have my name on it...

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.240
I feel pride as a model

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.540
when I see myself in magazines

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.840
I think it's the same for editors

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.120
Are you done with it?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.060
Yes. But I'm not fully satisfied

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.320
I just hope it goes well

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.660
I was attending the H&amp;M event

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.480
for the last episode

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.620
And I might have said something like

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.820
'We will try to show many different looks

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.260
through GARTEN TV'

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.360
at the end...

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.280
And I'm actually trying many different things out

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.780
Working as an editor is one of them

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.140
I'll try to come up with

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.620
more fresh items

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.380
as the editor of NYLON

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.460
Thank you!
