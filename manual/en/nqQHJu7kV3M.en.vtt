00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.980
How can you decide that Mai? (Village word for mother)

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.240
A gift is a gift! 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.140
No one can put a value on it.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.480
More than the gift itself, the feelings and love that come with it are what are valuble.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.240
So now today, will this mother keep her child from getting that love? 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.120
Come now, why are you so upset with me Mai? 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.320
Mai, please give it to me. 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.280
Or what is it you wish for?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.440
Already in my childhood, people have called a thief 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.000
Now will you make me known as a dacoit too?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.700
When Krishna returned safely so did the life of the people.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.800
They are meeting him and giving him gifts 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.080
All as per their own capacities

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.000
In Treta Yuga He was Sabhri's Shri Ram

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.520
Today too he is tasting the jaggery

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.040
which is an offering of unconditional love

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.320
Glories to Thee Ghanashyam!

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.760
Mai, have you filled this Gur (Jaggery) with all the sweetness of the universe?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.960
wow, what did you do it?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.640
You haven't taken a bite of it yourself to make it so good, have you? 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.320
Daou, I'm very sorry

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.600
you have the first right to every gift from the people.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.300
but this time around, even if I have to fight with you

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.740
I won't give you one bit of this Gur (Jaggery)

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.500
Mai, it is deliciously sweet! 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.560
compared to this Gur (Jaggery), all the other presents are quite bland.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.900
Do you know why?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.600
Because in this Gur is your love 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.300
Your faith

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.300
Your affection!

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.280
If anyone gives me anything with love and devotion

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.900
Then for me there cannot be anything sweeter than that.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.880
With King of Chedi, who is Maharaj Jarasand's son named Shisupal

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.820
I have fixed your marriage!!

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.520
You are taking in all the pleasure of your pastimes sitting here. 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.280
And there, Princess Rukmani is going through so many troubles. 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.680
If she has taken birth as a human,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800
Then she must experience the joys of the brightness of day

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.880
as well as fight through the darkness of the night

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.500
Such is the law of mankind
