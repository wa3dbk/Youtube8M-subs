00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.650
It's working.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.970
It's helping people from coast to coast, all
of which makes the lengths to which critics

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.250
have gone to scare people or undermine the
law, or try to repeal the law without offering

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.570
any plausible alternative so hard to understand.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.390
I've got to admit, I don't get it.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.669
Why are folks working so hard for people not
to have health insurance?

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:38.730
Why are they so mad about the idea of folks
having health insurance?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.000
Many of the tall tales that have been told
about this law have been debunked.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.989
There are still no death panels.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.019
(Laughter.)

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.519
Armageddon has not arrived.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:58.679
Instead, this law is helping millions of Americans,
and in the coming years it will help millions

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.820
more.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.520
I've said before, I will always work with
anyone who is willing to make this law work

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.890
even better.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.000
But the debate over repealing this law is
over.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:37.990
The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:48.789
(Applause.)

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.940
And those who have based their entire political
agenda on repealing it have to explain to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.820
the country why Jeanne should go back to being
uninsured.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.189
They should explain why Sean and his family
should go back to paying thousands and thousands

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.319
of dollars more.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.700
They've got to explain why Marla doesn't deserve
to feel like she's got value.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.710
They have to explain why we should go back
to the days when seniors paid more for their

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.340
prescriptions or women had to pay more than
men for coverage, back to the days when Americans

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.459
with preexisting conditions were out of luck
-- they could routinely be denied the economic

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.120
security of health insurance -- because that's
exactly what would happen if we repeal this

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.360
law.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.569
Millions of people who now have health insurance
would not have it.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.019
Seniors who have gotten discounts on their
prescription drugs would have to pay more.

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.550
Young people who were on their parents' plan
would suddenly not have health insurance.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:02.349
In the end, history is not kind to those who
would deny Americans their basic economic

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.580
security.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.580
Nobody remembers well those who stand in the
way of America's progress or our people.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.670
And that's what the Affordable Care Act represents.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.379
As messy as it's been sometimes, as contentious
as it's been sometimes, it is progress.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.860
It is making sure that we are not the only
advanced country on Earth that doesn't make

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.049
sure everybody has basic health care.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.439
(Applause.)

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.560
And that's thanks in part to leaders like
Nancy Pelosi and Dick Durbin, and all the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.519
members of Congress who are here today.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.520
We could not have done it without them, and
they should be proud of what they've done.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.110
They should be proud of what they've done.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.140
(Applause.)
