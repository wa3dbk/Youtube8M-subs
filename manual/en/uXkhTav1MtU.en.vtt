HARSHAS: Hi! I’m Harshas&nbsp;Mashelkar.

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.150
HARSHAS: I’m pursuing my masters in Computer Security and Information assurance and I belong to Mumbai, India. 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.289
ISIS: Hi!

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.659
ISIS: My name is Isis Quiñones

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.259
I am a graduate student here at RIT, studying

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.029
A master’s in professional studies with
concentration in Project Management and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.639
Supply Chain Management

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:34.080
I’m original from the Dominican Republic

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.080
Hi! My name is Mirna from Madagascar. I’m a student at RIT
0:00:41.080 0:00:43:80
majoring in Hospitality and Tourising Management

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.310
ISIS: My favorite RIT event is “Unification”

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.200
It’s a cultural performance where all the different 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.370
International students represent something unique from 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.370
their culture.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.680
HARSHAS: Dandiya, for sure! And the RIT Imagine Festival.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.090
Dandiya is a traditional indian dance,
which originates from Gujarat. 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.250
That’s a state in India.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.030
and it's a play

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.520
with two sticks

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.960
so it’s all fun

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.560
RENEE: and about how many participants
are there? 
HARSHAS: Oh…There are

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
I guess 100 to 200 of them coming 
for the event.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.290
So, it’s all fun!

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.710
PAOLA: I really like 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.870
walking in downtown,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.830
going to the theater there,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.990
We did hiking. 
It all depends on what you like.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.210
uh... we have a pool

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.200
here so

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.480
Even though it’s winter,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.900
it’s indoors. You can spend time there. 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.710
There’s a lot of

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.600
activities all the time at RIT. 
I like the hockey games, a lot!
that's something that I don’t have in 
my country so I really enjoyed the time 
that 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.820
we went to the games

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.820
I’m a member of some organizations
and some clubs.
0:02:08:83, 0:02:13:80
For example, there’s the Lead Organization.
There are some Christian organizations
0:02:22:00, 0:02:24:80
and also the Women and Gender Center. 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.709
I also participate in some of the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.899
Workshops. There are workshops all the time
here. For example, to develop your

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:33.519
leadership skills.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.370
That’s something that I really like,
and something that you can be part of with

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.249
With no cost.

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.230
So… Definitely, Why not

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.009
being involved in different activities and club?

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.529
Thank you for watching!
