00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680
Hello? Hello?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.920
Well, if you're hearing this and you made it to day two.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.920
Congrats!

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.720
I won't talk quite as long this time since

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.180
Freddy and his friends tend to become more active as the week progresses.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.400
it might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.540
just to make sure everyone's in their proper place, you know.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.700
Interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come off stage very often.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.140
I heard he becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.100
 I guess that's one more reason not to run out of power, right?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.620
I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.340
 There are blind spots in your camera views,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.320
and those blind spots happen to be right outside of your doors, so...

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.920
if you can’t find something, or someone, on your cameras,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.420
be sure to check with the lights.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.260
 You might have a few seconds to react... 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.160
Not that you would be in any danger, of course.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.500
I'm not implying that.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.660
 Also, 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.400
check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.160
The character in there acts strangely

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.680
if the cameras remain off for long periods of time.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.100
I guess he doesn't like being watched.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.400
Well...

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.240
I don't know...

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.860
 Anyway, I'm sure you have everything under control!

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.490
Talk to you soon!

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.600
Hello, hello?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.890
Hey you're doing great!

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.160
Most people don’t last this long.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.260
I mean, you know, they usually move on to other things by now.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.220
I'm not implying that they died.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.279
That's...

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.979
That's not what I meant.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.240
Anyway,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.580
I better I better not take up too much of your time.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.220
Things start getting real tonight.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.800
Hey, listen,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.920
I have an idea:

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.720
 if you happen to get caught and want to avoid getting stuffed into a Freddy suit,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.166
try playing dead!

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:24.088
You know...

00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:25.895
go limp.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.740
Then there's a chance that,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.260
maybe they’ll think that you're an empty costume instead of an endoskeleton.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.680
Then again if they think you're an empty costume,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.480
they might try to... stuff a metal skeleton into you.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.860
I wonder if it may works...

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.200
Yeah, never mind, scratch that.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.740
 It's best just not to get caught.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060
Ok, I'll leave you to it.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.140
See you on the flip side.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.840
Hello, hello?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.752
Hey, wow, day 4.

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:10.692
 knew you could do it.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.460
hey, listen,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.800
I may not be around to send you a message tomorrow.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.520
It's been a bad night here for me.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.160
I'm kinda glad that I recorded my messages for you

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.280
When I did...

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.340
Hey, do me a favor.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.400
Maybe sometime, uh, you could check inside those suits in the back room?

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm gonna to try to hold out until someone checks.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.160
Maybe it won’t be so bad.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.100
I always wondered what was in all those empty heads back there.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.640
You know...

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.340
Oh no...
