00:00:01.571 --> 00:00:05.810
Spoon uses the racing events to
develop and enhance the parts.

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.322
This EP3 brought to the
race is prepped for

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:13.265
endurance race, it stands
out in its debut battle.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.598
So let's check its potential in a battle!

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:22.053
The first rival is the Phase EK9 Race Spec.

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:27.203
I suppose this is gonna be a tough
race for the old Civic version.

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:30.668
It's a 1.6 liter N1 Spec.

00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:33.185
The one behind me is 2 liter version.

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:34.477
A race version.

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:40.059
So let's have a look at the difference
between the old and the new civic.

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:42.205
DoriDori drives the EP3.

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:46.483
How pitiful, bringing in the old
Civic with just 1.6 liter engine.

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:49.232
The only real rival is behind me.

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:50.204
Inte R.

00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:54.010
This is also a debut battle
for racing spec Inte R.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.878
This is "One make" spec Inte R.

00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:04.992
I drive the endurance spec Civic
too, though I think this car is

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:12.477
more suitable for track racing,
I'll try to demontrate just that.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.221
West Ebisu 5 laps battle.

00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:20.980
Hey, Orido's EK9 is trying to gain an
advantage with a jump start.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.485
His jump start advantage will vanish soon.

00:01:27.057 --> 00:01:29.521
There's a 400c difference,
let's let him have

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.063
the jump start advantage
and continue the race.

00:01:35.508 --> 00:01:39.764
Just don't underestimate my old version.

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:44.101
He's fast on straights!

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.875
Hacchyan begins immidiately
checking the Civic.

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:52.039
So how about the uphill?

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.938
Inte is fast in corners.

00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:58.871
But he's pulling away here.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.863
Civic is fast.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.547
Is this the difference of
power steering (Hydraulic vs.

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:06.304
Electric) and weight, that we've
been told by Ichishima CEO?

00:02:06.304 --> 00:02:07.667
He's fast.

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:19.710
But Inte is faster in corners.

00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:22.944
Though I'm falling behind on straights.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.238
I've have to keep pushing.

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:36.043
EP3's brakes got normal calipers with the
rotor size of 17 inch, same as Inte R.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.375
With an improved ABS system it's a
must-have combination for the racing.

00:02:43.568 --> 00:02:46.205
My car doesn't have the ABS.

00:02:46.623 --> 00:02:52.649
The "One Make" regulations don't
permit the usage of ABS system.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.721
So the braking lacks a bit, but
the cornering is very good.

00:03:01.617 --> 00:03:06.355
Although this Phase version represents
a top class among EK9 civics,

00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:10.569
its start advantage vanished
completely during two last laps.

00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:15.236
Alright.

00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:19.816
My brakes are much better.

00:03:24.284 --> 00:03:27.141
Tsuchiya's EP has caught up to Orido's EK.

00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:40.054
He's so mean.

00:03:41.897 --> 00:03:45.094
But the EK is able to
keep up in tight corners.

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:56.123
My acceleration is far better
compared to older version of Civic.

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.356
The 400cc difference is just too big.

00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:06.882
The suspension is totaly different too.

00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:09.345
The stability is different.

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:18.350
The Ebisu west course demands a suspension with proper setup,
the Inte R is suffering from insufficient stroke due to

00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:25.457
the lowered car height, so it feels like the race results are
settled for now. Though both new versions run so pleasantly.

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:31.236
Inte is pretty fast.

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:35.843
Orido decides to move to a
track short cutting strategy.

00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:38.509
The difference is big.

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:44.206
Hacchyan's trying very hard to keep
up with Tsuchiya's EP at braking.

00:04:49.246 --> 00:04:50.554
Inte is fast.

00:04:50.798 --> 00:04:51.954
Dangerously fast.

00:04:56.064 --> 00:04:58.132
It's been always very fast.

00:05:01.847 --> 00:05:03.196
The civic loses here.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.135
I'm faster here.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.508
I'm faster.

00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:11.856
The difference between these cars
is that the Inte R has better "road

00:05:11.882 --> 00:05:15.813
holding" in tight corners, while the
Civic accelerates better from corners.

00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:17.310
So it's the final lap.

00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:25.951
I wish I got the ABS.

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.558
But it's against the
regulations, can't help it.

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:33.436
Also the limiter at 8500rpm
doesn't make my race easier.

00:05:34.328 --> 00:05:37.700
The other car is based on
endurance race specs, so...

00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:40.910
in that sense, ...

00:05:41.564 --> 00:05:44.149
Look I'm absolutely faster in corners.

00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:02.636
I little mistake here.

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:09.910
So it's the race finish, both new
versions are very fast VTEC machines.

00:06:10.884 --> 00:06:16.149
This car's been developed for a while now, it runs differently.

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.462
This car has been barely finished.

00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:23.437
Its suspension doesn't seem to be as fast as Inte R's.

00:06:23.651 --> 00:06:24.151
True.

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.744
The front doesn't feel so stable.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.001
There's a need for further develompment.

00:06:30.087 --> 00:06:31.491
I'm doing my best.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.823
Yes you're doing.

00:06:32.823 --> 00:06:36.114
So let's look forward to further
develompment of Civic.

00:06:36.114 --> 00:06:38.472
This was the VTEC club, Ariga-V.
