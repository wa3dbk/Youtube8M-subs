00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.880
Imagine taking the heat from the sun in the
summer, storing it, and then using it to heat

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.830
a greenhouse in the winter!

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.370
Heating a greenhouse costs so much in Canada
in the winter that it's cheaper to truck food

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.239
in from 1000's of miles away.

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:25.689
Trucked in food is chemically ripened and
tastes horrible.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.699
It costs so much to heat a traditional greenhouse
in winter that if we did that the food would

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.520
cost 10X more, so we suffer with trucked in
produce.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.710
The solution is technology.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.860
A new type of greenhouse and a new type of
heating system.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.829
The winter greenhouse uses two new solar heating
technologies to provide fresh fruits and vegetables

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.930
all year round, even in -40' temperatures!

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.280
The first technology is a new type of greenhouse.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.110
Called a solar greenhouse
The north wall is insulated and it's designed

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.619
to face the sun in the south sky.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.869
China has embraced this technology and now
has millions of acres producing food 12 months

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.149
of the year.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.490
Some call them solar greenhouses, some call
it a walipini, regardless of the name these

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.320
greenhouses work and are in use today to grow
food in mild winter areas.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.979
By adding insulation a solar greenhouse can
be made to work with the cold Canadian climate.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.759
When I say solar collectors most people think
photovoltaic electric cells.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.340
The ones on calculators and rooftops.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.000
But there is another kind of solar energy.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.229
Heat.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.440
Evacuated tubes thermal solar collectors generate
heat, so much heat they generate 4X more energy

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.400
than the photovoltaic collectors everyone is used to
seeing.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.509
Heat that we can collect, store, and use months
later when we need it.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.819
Imagine taking free solar heat in the summer,
storing it, and then thermermostatically releasing

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.049
it in the winter as needed.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.280
Imposible?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.500
Nope.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.620
It's actually already being done to heat a
community of 55 homes in Alberta.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.560
Drake landing solar community put thermal
solar collectors on every garage and sent

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.410
that heat to a big community thermal battery in the ground,
heating the dirt to 80' C by the end of the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.800
summer and then withdrawing that energy in the
winter to heat all the homes.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.170
Using technologies like a solar greenhouse
and a thermal battery we can design a 4 season

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.340
greenhouse that can grow fresh fruits and vegetables
in northern climates for you and your family.
