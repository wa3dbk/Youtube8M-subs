00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.190
The Acoustic Geometry Front Wall
is an easy-to-install modular system.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.199
Start the installation by measuring the left-to-right
back wall space and mark the center line on

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.349
the wall.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.720
Then measure and mark the center line on the
center

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.870
module and line up the two marks.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.780
Make sure the center module is flush to the
back wall

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.970
and level using shims and spacers where needed.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.050
Once the module is solidly in place, attach
the module

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.940
to the back wall at the vertical studs.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.350
Place the right and left bottom modules.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.260
Make sure they are flush and level and attach
them to the back wall studs.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.750
Take your time, the bottom three modules must
be flush and level across the entire wall.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.190
Now the top modules can be placed starting
again with the center module.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.960
Each module is lifted into place and attached
to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.759
the adjoining modules once it's flush.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.030
The top modules can then be attached to the
back wall vertical studs.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.939
The five top modules are clamped and attached
in place.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.360
Then acoustic insulation is placed into the
four

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.180
side modules.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.430
The front cover plates are attached to the
side

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.260
modules and the side trim plates are measured,
cut, checked for fit, and attached in place.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.140
The front wall is now ready for the finishing
panels

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.040
and trim pieces.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.280
Throughout the installation, accurate measurements
are critical for integrity and appearance.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.750
Use a level to make sure the equipment and
closure

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.840
trim frames are horizontally aligned.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.100
And using a spacer board will speed up the
installation as well as giving the trim frames

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.370
a
clean appearance.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.350
To install the top finishing panels, mate
the two

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.190
pairs of z-clips and measure the distance
between

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.190
them.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.390
Measure and mark the z-clip lines on the top
side

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.560
plates and remove the z-clip adhesive cover
paper.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.519
Align the z-clips with the mark lines and
attach them

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.900
to the top plates.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.900
The finishing panels can then be set in place
with gentle

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.730
downward pressure.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.120
Take your time, measuring and attaching.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.020
The panels can be adjusted sideways, but not
vertically.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.120
The base trim and fireplace trim can now be
measured,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.610
cut, and attached.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.520
Again, a spacer board makes this job much
easier.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.940
Plug in the fireplace and attach the top and
side brackets

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.690
according to the manufacturer's instructions.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.410
Set up spacers and shims to align and level
the fireplace.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.410
Drill the bracket holes and attach the fireplace
to

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.410
the front wall.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.920
Remove the shims and spacers.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.440
Measure, drill, and mount the bottom trim
board,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.300
making sure the access notch lines up.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.880
Slide on the glass cover and check the alignment
of the speaker grille panels.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.640
The Acoustic Geometry Front Wall System: beautifully
complete any room.
