00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.320
Tips

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.320
Hi!

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.320
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.440
Today, I'm going to be doing a book review
on The Elegant Man.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.669

In addition, if you like this video, if you

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:17.540
would like it down below.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.420
I'm also going to be linking you to the review
and our free 47-page e-book.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.000
All right, let me jump right into it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.850
This is the book right here, The Elegant Man
by Riccardo Villarosa and Giulano Angeli,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.850
an amazing book.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.780
I'm going to tell you right off, I give this
five out of five stars, one of the best books,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.039
a serious man who's building his wardrobe
can own.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.620
It's one of the lesser known books out there
and in fact, I think it's mostly because of

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.899
the price.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.190
It's funny, but any time a book is more than
$20 on Amazon and more than $10 on Amazon,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.510
people are very hesitant to buy it, which
is a shame.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.931
Now, the book, you're going to find the shape,
it's a big book and it's not so much that

00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:03.931
it's tall.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.480
It's about a foot high, but it's very square.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.830
It's around 14 inches wide and this is great.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.210
I love this layout because the pictures and
the images, they're top notch.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.560
I'll put some of the pictures in the review
in the article so you'll be able to see them

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:32.110
here, but yeah, it's got approximately 179
pages, excellent book.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.970
It stacks up very well.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.110
In fact, I would say on Sundays, I'll like
it a lot better than anything Alan Flusser

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.960
has put out and it's right up there with what
I consider to be one of the best books on

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960
men's style.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.240
In fact, it's I would say on the same level
as "Gentleman" by Bernhard Roetzel.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.590
Okay, so why haven't you heard about this?

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.579
It started off, from my understanding, in
Italian.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.630
It was translated over to English and it just
didn’t have the same type of marketing that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.210
we've seen some of the other books out there.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.000
It came out approximately, I think, in earlier
this decade, so it just kind of didn’t get

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.350
as much publicity, as much love.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.580
I'm going to give it some love today.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.380
So let me talk to you about the four reasons
why I think this book is worth your time and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.650
worth your investment.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.650
1.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.060
It's got real tailoring insight.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.200
So the gentlemen that wrote this book, they
really understand the craft.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.240
They're Italians.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.860
They go into this very, very detailed.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.050
It's just beautifully written.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.360
A lot of the pictures, they're English, but
again, the writers are Italian and it's got

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.600
a very strong European view to it.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.880
The attention to detail, again, is great.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.020
If you've enjoyed the book "Gentleman", you're
going to love this book as well.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.020
2.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.570
Wardrobe discussion - I love how they bring
the whole wardrobe together and they talk

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.870
about not just as individual pieces, but they
try to bring it together as a wardrobe, so

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.870
that's big.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.260
A lot of books, they'll break things down
too much and they won't bring them together.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.440
This book doesn’t have that problem.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440
3.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.030
Care and maintenance of clothing - I haven't
seen another book out there that goes into

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.930
as much detail onto the care and maintenance
of clothing.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.850
"Gentleman" comes close, but this one takes
it to a whole another level.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.850
4.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.300
The lat but not least and actually one of
the best things about this book compared with

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.000
any other book I've seen out there is their
discussion on fabrics.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.030
They start off the entire book with this discussion,
and I'll show it to you here really quick,

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.360
but they I would say probably -- I don't know,
maybe 20% of the book is nothing more than

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.810
going into fabrics, and you can see right
here.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.760
They'll talk about cotton, so they give us
a page on cottons.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.700
They bring up two great pictures, one of them
really up-close detail and they do this for

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.200
tons of fabrics out there.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.810
You're not going to find a better description
of fabrics in a layman's book.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.170
I don't know if I'd say it's a layman's book,
but unless you go out there and you study

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.140
textiles, you're not going to get better descriptions,
and I think the descriptions here are even

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.280
better than some of the ones I've seen in
textiles books.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.950
So why would you be a bit hesitant to buy
this?

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.950
It's not the price.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.850
If you think paying $30 to $40 for some great
information is -- well, I just can't help

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.440
you if you don't value information at that
level in any case, so price is not the issue.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.120
What is the issue is it's a very Eurocentric
view and that makes sense, written by Italians.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.610
But if you're in Midwest United States, you're
down in Brazil, you're over perhaps in India,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.840
you may find there's a bit of a disconnect
with what they're talking about here and what's

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.500
available in your country and what you're
going to work with.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.440
So for many people, it's going to be this
up in the clouds that you just can't get to

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.790
that level, but I still think there are so
many great lessons you could apply.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.220
The other one is going to be it's a bit dated.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.150
A lot of the pictures, a lot of the images
they use, most of them, they're just older

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.120
and I don't know if that was they couldn’t
get a lot of more modern pictures, but you'll

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.560
look at some of this stuff and you'll wonder,
"Okay, that was perhaps a good 50 years ago.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.510
Is that good in the year 2012?"

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.510
Okay.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.310
This has been Antonio Centeno with Real Men
Real Style.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.820
All I can tell you is that The Elegant Man
is a great book.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.430
I've already told you, five out of five stars,
amazing.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.140
I highly recommend it.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.550
Go out there and get it.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.550
Take care.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.551
Bye-bye.
