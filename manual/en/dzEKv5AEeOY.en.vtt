What's up, Rob here, Man Vs. Pin

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.360
So, the other week Hertta and asheesaurful(?) suggested this cleaning slime pin

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.878
Now there's a million videos of people doing this, so I totally know it works, but I've never tried it myself,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.600
so I'm gonna go on and test this thing out

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.880
Alright I got myself some Borax, which comes in this ridiculously huge box

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.640
A bottle of Emer's glue, and some food dye

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.600
Now in the first bowl I added one tablespoon of water, then one tablespoon of Elmer's glue

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.400
Followed by a couple of drops of food coloring that I mixed in to the whole thing

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.320
In the other bowl I added two tablespoons of water, then two tablespoons of Borax, and proceeded to mix together

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.100
Once everything's all stirred and mixed, just take both of your bowls and combine them together

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.980
And almost instantaneously, it starts turning into this weird, goopey, slimy substance

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.500
which is, I'm imagining, kinda what we want.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.900
You can take it out of the bowl, there's a little bit of water left so I dumped that out and just kinda started

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.500
Playing with it, molding it and puttying it together and really just having a good time, you know, it's slime

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.820
Now the thing that I see here that kinda sucks a little bit is that when you like start pulling it apart

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.300
and you kinda get it a little thinner, you can see the Borax, like soap detergent kinda starts coming out

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.760
So, there's absolutely no way that I'm gonna be putting this on any keyboard that I own

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.880
Also it looks nothing like that clear really cool looking slime right there

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.440
Otherwise, good fun. Good clean, wholesome, family fun.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.480
Which is what Man Vs. Pin is all about

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.540
If you missed last weeks episode/citrus disaster, things didn't turn out too well, however

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.460
In the comments lots of you suggested slicing up the lemons and putting them into some sort of dye

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.920
bath, which, I did, and after two days, they were completely dyed, amazing,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.360
But, honestly, at the same time completely unusable.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.500
Plus, that pin was totally Photoshopped, so, none of this really matters

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.300
Now a bunch of you have been filming yourself testing out various pins and sending em my way

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.200
Awesome, because I totally asked you to.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.520
These users recreated this pillow headboard in what seemed like an epic day of building, painting

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.980
Sewing, and cats. Nice work!

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.980
Holly made this door corner shelf from this super old door that she had dating back to 1870

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.460
And Aileen created these DIY wooden crystal necklaces that she found. Good job

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.240
Instagram is also starting to fill up with Man Vs. Pin projects

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.380
Lavicorn along with anna_banana007 recreated the secret egg note pin

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.140
And Dean, Marisa, and Rosana all created the DIY Glow Cloud, ALL HAIL

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.280

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.120
