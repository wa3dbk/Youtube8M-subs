00:00:03.467 --> 00:00:06.795
He never gives up

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.203
Yuya! something wrong with your shoulder!

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:28.278
He has faced adversity so many times.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:35.523
I have had many injuries and losses.

00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:38.253
But hard time gives me strength.

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:47.164
He never gave up.And he has survived.

00:00:55.773 --> 00:01:02.382
even though I lost in both Japan &amp; World tournament.I'm still getting better.

00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:04.693
I'll be even stronger.

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:10.869
To fight means not to want to die

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:20.568
I never afraid of die.So daily life is very important to me

00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:30.149
I'm telling myself that I shouldn't have reglets.That's what I aim

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.911
He doesn't want to reglet.So I come back again and again.

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:43.085
Speed marster from MMA

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:47.055
I don't plan to do normal K-1 fight

00:01:53.565 --> 00:02:02.581
He fihgts in DREAM as a DEEP welterweight champion

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:09.286
He uses tricky strikes and make opponents confused

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:13.949
I'll do anything as long as it's legal.

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:17.365
I'll show attacks which others even can't imagine

00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:23.590
and give audience surprise

00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:32.934
Yeah,he is a tricky fighter.I have seen his 'Double punch'

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:34.758
He has guts.He is a good fighter

00:02:36.398 --> 00:02:41.782
Yuya,let's do tough fight like a war between K-1 and MMA.

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:50.838
Yuya got married this year and started new life

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:00.896
Whan I was single,I was just thinking about myself.

00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:04.094
But things have changed a lot now.

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:17.653
Things to protect and for his belief.He won't stop

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.789
He's a MMA fighter.I'll knock him out in K-1's ring as a K-1 fighter
