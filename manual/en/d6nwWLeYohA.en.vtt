MARIEVE HERRINGTON: Alright, so the final
thing we're going to do before our guests

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:10.320
arrive, 'cause some of them will probably
be rather hungry, I'm going to put roughly

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:27.680
about a cup of frozen blueberries into the
blender, followed by one cup or there about.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.110
This is plain yogurt, not the really sweet
stuff. You could use blueberry yogurt if you

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.920
wanted but I don't actually find that blueberry
yogurt tastes like real blueberries. And then

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.750
one cup of milk. And then because it was plain
yogurt, I'm going to add two--there's no sweetness

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.559
in that, I'm going to add roughly two tablespoons,
depends how sweet you like it, of honey. Now

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.399
if you didn't want to do this with any dairy
products 'cause I'm using milk and yogurt,

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.330
you could do it with tofu and soy milk or
almond milk. And if was making this for myself

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.040
and not having brunch along with it, I would
probably add some toasted nuts or maybe even

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.910
some oatmeal to really make it a full meal.
But we're keeping it real light with just

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:24.500
some nice colorful blueberries and just with
milk and yogurt and not too much else because

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.729
we've got a full other meal. So I'm going
to blend this and then we'll put it into the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.130
glasses. Oh, I didn't have to add any ice
cubes by the way to this because the blueberries

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.189
were frozen. If I'd used fresh blueberries--oh,
the color is gorgeous, look at this. Isn't

00:01:43.189 --> 00:02:02.240
that beautiful? Get a dose of those antioxidant
berries first thing in the morning. And finally--oh,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.730
right at the end of the blender, we've got
some blueberries. Okay, so those are ready

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.400
for my really hungry guests.
