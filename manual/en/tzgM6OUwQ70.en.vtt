00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:10.799
Welcome to the Smoke Learning Channel.

00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:13.762
In the previous desktop paint videos,

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:17.498
the focus has always been 
painting your main colour image.

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:22.626
This included basics as well as 
cloning on static images.

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:27.455
This video will focus on 
painting on an alpha channel.

00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:32.302
You can follow along with 
this video by downloading the media.

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:39.270
You will find the link in the YouTube description or
 type the link displayed in your internet browser.

00:00:40.347 --> 00:00:46.717
We are going to use desktop paint to fix an issue 
and then put it all together in ConnectFX.

00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:48.950
Let’s begin.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.610
When working with desktop paint,

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:55.039
the alpha channel needs to be 
a separate clip from the fill image.

00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:59.067
So in the media library, 
before you import the files,

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.991
disable the matte container option in 
the General tab.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.225
Dragging in the embedded file into a folder will
 split the RGB and Alpha channels accordingly.

00:01:11.152 --> 00:01:16.518
Don’t forget to re-enable the 
matte container option for other import tasks.

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:19.458
Now switch to the tools tab.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:26.552
You might need to click on the view column to 
display the folder’s thumbnails in the thumbnail view.

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.777
Now this alpha channel has an intentional hole cut 
into it for the purpose of the lesson.

00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:36.518
However you will encounter this type of scenario

00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:41.400
when you are keying a subject who 
has a colour the matches the keyed background.

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:47.022
Or perhaps you need to paint an alpha for 
a logo that has been provided to you.

00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:51.940
There are other scenarios and 
multiple ways to tackle the challenges

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.787
but we will focus on alpha painting.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.583
Since this alpha is a separate clip, 
there is nothing to stop you

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:05.948
from selecting the paint tool, choosing the front 
option and just loading up the alpha clip.

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:09.068
You could paint directly onto it from here.

00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:17.009
However if you exit back to the thumbnail view, 
the RGB colour clip is the context for the alpha clip.

00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:23.154
This might not always be necessary but 
it can help having both in desktop paint.

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.771
With that said, choose the paint button.

00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:31.222
Change the mode to use the FRONT and MATTE option.

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:34.931
With the first cursor, click on the fill clip.

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:39.351
With the second cursor, click on the Alpha clip.

00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:44.567
Tap anywhere in the thumbnail view to 
enter into Desktop paint.

00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:50.506
Just reset the desktop paint module and 
confirm to clear any previous settings.

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:54.629
The first image that you see is your fill source.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.967
To flick to the alpha, you press and hold the F3 key.

00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:04.088
When you release the key, it goes back to the fill.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.050
You would use this to just flick back and 
forth between the fill and the alpha.

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:11.472
To permanently see the alpha,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.550
enable the SHOW button in the bottom left corner and
 ensure the MATTE option is chosen.

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:21.243
This shows the alpha overlay on top of the fill.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:26.768
You can scrub through the frames and see 
the fill and alpha overlay update.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.982
If you try and paint now, you will be 
painting on your fill image and not the alpha.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.664
This is just for display.

00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:40.574
To properly paint on the alpha channel, 
first turn off the SHOW option.

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:45.669
On the right on the Paint interface, 
you will see the matte options.

00:03:46.103 --> 00:03:47.851
Turn on the MATTE button.

00:03:48.147 --> 00:03:53.597
The overlay returns but now you are able to 
paint directly on the alpha.

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:59.023
When the Matte opacity is set to 100%, 
you are filling in the Alpha.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.886
When the Matte Opacity is set to 0% 
you are cutting more holes into the alpha channel.

00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:13.853
So with a Matte Opacity of 100%, you can go ahead 
and paint in the alpha on the talent’s right eye.

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:17.882
Press and hold F3.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.551
You will see that you have 
painted on the alpha channel.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:25.986
Since the subject is moving, you need to 
paint on every frame to clean up the alpha.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.757
In desktop paint, we can speed up this process by
 using auto-paint.

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:34.478
Switch to the Auto-paint menu.

00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:39.868
And change the main option from wipe to 
user for free hand brush stroking.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.000
Advance forward to the second frame that 
has not been fixed.

00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:49.323
Now just paint over the right eye again to 
fill up the alpha.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.102
Switch from Record mode to Play and 
the brush stroke is saved.

00:04:55.713 --> 00:05:04.164
To ensure the same stroke is painted on every frame,
 decrease the paint over time time-bar to a value of 1.

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:09.233
To track the impending brush stroke, 
click the animation button.

00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:15.806
In the auto-paint options, choose the stabilizer to
 enter into the tracking tools.

00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:18.372
This is an easy track.

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:20.275
Go to frame 1.

00:05:20.556 --> 00:05:25.918
And pick up the tracker box from the 
middle of the UI and place it onto her right eye.

00:05:26.549 --> 00:05:28.405
Press Analyze…

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:31.041
…And the track is done.

00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:34.483
Exit the stabilizer by pressing return.

00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:38.712
To see the tracked animation, 
enable the wireframe button.

00:05:39.403 --> 00:05:41.168
When you scrub the time-bar,

00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:46.666
the wireframe is tracked to her face but 
the brush stroke has not been painted yet.

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:49.043
Go back to Frame 1.

00:05:49.654 --> 00:05:52.513
Press Render to start painting on each frame.

00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:55.824
Remember that you always go back to frame 1

00:05:56.058 --> 00:06:00.026
because the render will start from 
the current frame you are looking at.

00:06:00.915 --> 00:06:06.497
The brush stroke has now been applied to
every frame and you can now exit desktop paint.

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:14.785
In the thumbnail view, you now have two new clips
 both ending in a PT extension that is a paint result.

00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:20.264
To complete the composite, 
we’ll quickly build the rest in ConnectFX.

00:06:20.824 --> 00:06:22.743
Switch to the timeline view.

00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:28.194
Select the background clip and 
press CONTROL+TAB to bring up the FX ribbon.

00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:32.744
Choose Create ConnectFX to 
enter into the node compositor.

00:06:33.344 --> 00:06:40.008
In the Media Panel on the left, hold COMMAND and
 multi-select the new paint clips in the folder.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.117
Drag and drop them into ConnectFX schematic.

00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:46.323
To blend these sources together,

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:52.010
hover over the ConnectFX node bin and 
press B for the Blend and Comp node.

00:06:52.635 --> 00:06:56.359
Drag the node out of the bin and 
drop it into the schematic.

00:06:57.182 --> 00:07:01.619
Connect the talent’s fill clip into 
the first RED input.

00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:07.051
Connect the talent’s alpha clip into 
the first BLUE matte input.

00:07:07.762 --> 00:07:12.622
To finish off, Connect the background clip into
 the GREEN background input.

00:07:13.587 --> 00:07:19.043
And take the output from the Blend and Comp node and
 connect it to the CFX output node

00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:21.934
that leads back to the sequence.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.777
If you would like to see the same challenge again

00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:30.825
but using the ConnectFX paint instead of 
desktop paint, please click the link now.

00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:36.908
More desktop videos will be 
posted soon showing the workflows with paint.

00:07:37.297 --> 00:07:43.418
