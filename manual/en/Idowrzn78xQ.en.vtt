Hi everyone!

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.060
So today i'm back with another video on how to stretch up your ears, yes

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.460
Because you guys have asked me how to stretch up your ears

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.600
From 4g to 2g or 2g to 0g or 0g to 00g and beyond

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.080
So today I'm gonna show you how to do this without pain

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.740
'cause it seems like some of you are not able to put in your tapers when you go to bigger sizes and it's really normal

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.800
I think I've started using this method when I was between 4g to 2g

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.620
'cause I wasn't able to put the taper in

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.240
it was kind of hurting bad

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.520
and I was scared to tear up my ear, so this is the method

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.640
This is the thing you will have to use, it's teflon tape

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.920
I'm just gonna open it for you, it comes from stretch it body jewelry, I bought it on ebay actually for like 5 dollars
