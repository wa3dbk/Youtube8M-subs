00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.800
Staring at death, I take a breath, there's nothing left

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.640
Now close my eyes, for one last time, and say goodbye

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.760
Lying naked while the snow falls all around me

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.320
Drifting closer to the edge but She won't have me

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.840
Wake up in sweat, full of regret, try to forget

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.600
These memories, lurking beneath, lost in a dream

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.080
Unchosen paths, a broken past, forespoken wrath

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.480
The pain won't cease, I'll find no peace, no sweet release

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.680
Fragile creatures, we are taught to fear the Reaper

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.000
Ever running, we are dead before we meet Her

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.640
These voices telling me let it go (let it all go)

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.880
I try and try but I can't say no (try and say no)

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.200
This endless nightmare has just begun (nowhere to run)

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:19.480
My heart is dragging me down into oblivion

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.000
The endless lies, I've cast aside, locked them in ice

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.360
Steeled is my soul, my blood grown cold, I've gained control

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.800
Fearless creatures, we all learn to fight the Reaper

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.000
Can't defeat Her, so instead I'll have to be Her

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.480
These voices screaming to let it go (never let go)

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.760
This time I'm screaming back no no no (go on say no)

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.400
My mind's made up, yeah my fear is gone (Where have you gone?)

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:24.560
Open my eyes now here I come, oblivion

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.240
For the last time (I won't say goodbye)

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.960
For the last time (I won't say goodbye)

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.440
For the last time (I won't say goodbye)

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.000
For the last time
