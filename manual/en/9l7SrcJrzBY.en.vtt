00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.400
the mansions side guest rooms were built in
the nineteen eighties

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.400
in two wings that attached by walkways to
the Mansion.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.980
The rooms were built as very generous
spaces which as a renovation project

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.220
gave me the opportunity to create a
generous living

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.520
area.  This is a Mansion-side Guest Room with two queen beds.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.950
This room will sleep up to four people.  
Now for that reason,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.760
we've relocated the desk from under the
television in the media center,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.590
I've added six drawers so there's plenty of storage space for all of the guest's clothing.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.530
The two Queen beds have individual pendant
lights

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.039
amber colored shapes that are very nautical in feeling,

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.649
which are reflected in the customized mirrors over the headboard,

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.360
flanked by this drapery which
creates a sense of privacy between

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.009
the two beds.

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.850

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.740
the white tops I designed LED downlights
for energy efficiency and quality of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.570
white light

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.200
you can see that reflective light at the
dressing table it's bright and cheerful

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.880

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.220
the storage areas that they would
require the bathroom is an extension to

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.850
the dressing area tied together

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.590
