There are consistent layout and configuration
options across many tools which we will review

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.820
in this session. This should help you more
quickly adapt to the learning environment.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.080
The primary navigation tool for a course is
the Navbar. Within each tool, there are tool

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.540
menus to navigate to different sections and
pages, and tabs to switch between sections within a page.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.600
The learning environment makes extensive use
of icons to initiate tasks and actions. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.800
The More Action button initiates tasks not related
to specific terms on the page. Multi-action

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.220
icons effect selected items in the list.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.980
Context menu icons effect a single item in
the line.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.100
The learning environment often presents information
in the form of interactive lists that you

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.240
can sort and search. When a list is long,
items are split across multiple pages so that

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.400
the list loads quickly. You can jump to any
page and change how many items appear on each page.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.260
Please note that if you select items in a

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.340
list and then move to another page within
the list, the items are no longer selected

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700
even though they are part of the same list.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.800
In many places, advanced options are collapsed
by default to help you focus on essential

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.940
features and settings. You can display advanced
options by clicking on the Expand link.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.160
If you save the page, learning environment
remembers which options you displayed and

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.080
shows them the next time. You can hide options
again by clicking the Collapse link.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.580
Entering dates is easy. Click the date to
use the calendar.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.940
Help icons and on screen instructions appear
throughout the learning environment, providing

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.420
you with ready information about the specific
page and tool that you are using.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.440
Click the help icon next to a field, option, or setting
to read a detailed explanation.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.100
Some tools provide you with contextual help.
