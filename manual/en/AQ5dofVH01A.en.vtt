00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.006
[South-Lebanon, 2006]

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.000
There are plenty of sub-munitions around here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.008
Yes, we’ve seen a lot of that kind here.

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:17.002
Up to 4 million sub-munitions delivered in 5 weeks

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.024
Hundreds of thousands did not explode on impact   data: UNMACC

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:22.014
It showed us really the worst case scenario 

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:24.019
of what can happen when cluster munitions 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.010
are used on a massive scale, and in a variety of environments: 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.015
for instance, they were used in or near populated areas, 

00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:38.005
they were used in agricultural areas. 

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:41.004
So basically it showed what the future holds 

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:53.023
if this problem is not dealt with urgently.

00:00:53.023 --> 00:00:56.018
The problem is the volume. 

00:00:56.018 --> 00:01:01.000
These can be delivered in the 100 and 100 of thousands 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.021
in a few hours, in millions in a few days 

00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:06.007
and these numbers, combined with the fact 

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.018
that from 10 to 40 percent simply do not explode, 

00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:10.004
create a huge problem of contamination 

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:15.006
and a huge threat to the civilian populations.

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:16.023
People come back to their home, 

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:19.020
even if they weren’t there at the time of the bombing. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.001
They see the rubble, they try to enter. 

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.013
Often cluster munitions are mixed in into the rubble, 

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:27.013
they may be found accidentally, 

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:34.003
or people may see them and try to get rid of them.

00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:36.019
If cluster munitions are littering a landscape, 

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:39.000
an agricultural landscape for example, 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.007
it can be devastating for the livelihoods of individuals 

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:47.015
who depend on those fields or orchards.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.022
It's a precious source of income.

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:51.020
It's a season

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.019
and farming goes with seasons.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:56.001
Now my arms are tied and I'm strangled. 

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:57.022
I can't move.

00:01:57.022 --> 00:02:01.001
It’s bad enough that civilians are caught up in the fighting 

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.017
and suffer incredible pain, disruption, 

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:07.009
displacement during the conflict. 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.023
But to us it is absolutely repugnant 

00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:13.019
that this killing and injuring of civilians will go on for years 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.023
or decades simply because of the choice 

00:02:15.023 --> 00:02:17.756
of the wrong weapon in an armed conflict.
