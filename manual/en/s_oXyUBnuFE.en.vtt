- It's very cool to be Apollo,
a god, on stage.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Did you know that in
New York City Ballet...
(Semyon Chudin)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
...only a dancer who has danced all of Balanchine's
works can be a candidate for Apollo?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Victoria Simon, choreographer

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When I started working with Vicky,
she made me feel so assured.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:15.000
She'd say: "Semyon, everything will be
alright, you'll make a great Apollo. Just have
a feeling inside, and it will be great."

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.800
This ballet has a long history, I believe;
it dates back even to Dyagilev.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.400
We don't dance it like that anymore.
If back then they did like this
and it was enough,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.000
now we do it inside out,
it's obligatory.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.400
This is a criterion. It may not have
any sense for the audience...
(Artem Ovcharenko)

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:50.800
It won't make any difference to you, but to
the people who work in the theatre, to the coaches,
to those who work with us - for them it's important.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
