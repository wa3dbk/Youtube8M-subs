00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.000
Greetings, and welcome to Earthling Cinema. I am your host, Garyx Wormuloid. This week’s artifact is "Frozen,"

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.620
which won an Academy Award for its chart-topping song “Let It Be,” by the Beatles.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.460
The film follows a princess who suffers from a rare, human condition called

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.860
"unexplained mutant ice powers."

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.660
"Elsa!"

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.860
Her name is Elsa, but it might as well be Milkshake, because she gives her little sister, Anna, brain-freeze.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.780
Their parents take Anna to the emergency room to get her a lobotomy.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.300
Elsa worries that the lobotomy might be contagious,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.100
"Don't touch me."

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.700
so she hides in her room for the rest of the decade.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.060
Satisfied that they have done a good job raising their children away from any kind of school

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.120
or social interaction, the parents go on vacation and die.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.360
And, after waiting around doing nothing for three years in a kingdom ruled by no one, Elsa becomes queen.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.760
But, her name might as well be Queen Milkshake, because she brings all the boys to the yard.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.100
Anna meets a prince named Hans, and they decide to get married after two conversations,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.580
which is their right as heterosexuals.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.580
Anna asks Elsa to save the date, but she refuses.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.620
"You can't marry a man you just met."

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.440
"What?"

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.900
As a preemptive strike against anyone calling her Milkshake again, Elsa runs away.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.900
She builds herself a new castle with central A/C, casting the land in eternal winter.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.100
In any case, Anna meets another conventionally attractive, age-appropriate guy named Kristoff,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.900
who agrees to risk his life taking her up the mountain in exchange for a carrot.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.120
Along the way, they meet Olaf — Elsa’s illegitimate son — who shows them the way to Elsa's castle.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.430
Anna asks Elsa to come back, which is basically Elsa’s biggest pet peeve,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.930
so she zaps Anna again and has her new boyfriend kick them to the proverbial curb.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.290
Kristoff takes Anna back to the emergency room,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.860
where the on-call physician explains that Anna’s heart has been frozen with a capital "F,"

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.600
"There is ice in your heart."

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.300
"No."

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.920
and can only be thawed by an “act of true love,”

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.580
like when someone doesn't throw away this month's Quarks Illustrated before you’re done reading it, Karen.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.360
Kristoff drops Anna off back home, so Hans can give her a little C12-H22-O11.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.220
*Boing boing*

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.500
But, Hans doesn’t want to give her a little anything, because of cooties.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.760
Turns out he’s the bad guy and just wants the throne, so he locks up Elsa for treason and Anna for symmetry.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.300
Olaf helps Anna escape, and tells her to go kiss Kristoff instead, since kissing is all she's good for, anyway.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.040
She figures "what the hell," but then she sees Elsa is in trouble, so performs an act of true love on her instead,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.580
and not in a gross way, Karen.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.840
And just like Huey Lewis, Elsa realizes the power of love,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.440
which makes her suddenly able to reverse the winter and prove once and for all, that it’s hip to be square.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.400
"Frozen" is a musical about the dueling properties of two of Earth’s most cherished elements —

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.880
a song of ice and fire, if you will.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.380
Heck, I don't know why you wouldn't.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.560
Anna is associated with fire, which indicates warmth and passion.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.140
She has fiery red hair and freckles, or sunspots, on her shoulders,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.500
which she should really get checked out, just to be safe.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.440
She uses fire as a weapon against the horse attack.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.640
When Hans reveals to Anna that he only wants her for her nobility, he extinguishes a fire,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.600
thereby extinguishing the passion Anna had for him.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.040
Elsa is associated with ice — she is cold and rational —

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.960
"I don't dance."

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.500
"Oh."

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.260
and thinks the answer to life is to inhibit her feelings.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.200
"Don't feel. Don't feel."

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.720
And, on our planet, she wouldn't be wrong, since feelings are punishable by death.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.340
She isolates herself, trading in her traditional garb for a revealing, skin-tight, transparent dress —

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.500
and all on a shoestring budget.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.560
It suggests liberation, perhaps even sexual liberation.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.960
But, at what cost? It is only by embracing the love of her sister that Elsa can find real fulfillment,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.500
and the happiness that comes with social solidarity, or from a good piece of chocolate.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.220
"Chocolate."

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.860
The movie seems to suggest that independence is a mistake, which falls in line with Disney’s mob mentality.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.680
All people require connection, so a solitary person is considered incomplete and in need of fixing.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.680
"Nobody wants to be alone."

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.600
As the medical staff says, "We need each other to fix us up and round us out."

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.080
"We need each other to fix us up and round us out!"

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.980
Easy for them to say — they're already round.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.180
However, Frozen is progressive in that the heroes’ redemption arrives in the form of sisterly love,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.580
rather than that of a charming prince or frog or whatever.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.480
The adage of “love at first sight,” as evidenced by the courtship of Prince Hans,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.840
is proven to be as trivial and misguided as Karen.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.900
And, even with a promising suitor such as Kristoff, there is no definitive wedding. They take it slow.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.240
Mmm, so slow.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.040
In addition to conservative messages,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.580
another recurring motif is the door, something humans used when they were too tired to phase through the wall.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.380
The film begins with the two princesses stuck in a kingdom with closed gates.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.400
And of course, there’s the door separating the sisters throughout their weirdly uneventful childhood.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.320
Once she becomes a homeowner, Elsa brags about how she’ll handle solicitors.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.040
"Turn away and slam the door!"

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.100
Anna later solicits her to do the opposite.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.120
"Please don't slam the door."

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.380
One of the final lines of the film is “I like the open gates. We’re never closing them again."

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.240
"I like the open gates."

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.980
"We are never closing them again."

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.740
The subtext is clear: Elsa won’t shut her sister out anymore,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.540
and the kingdom will be forever susceptible to attack.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.280
For Earthling Cinema, I’m Garyx Wormuloid.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.440
If you're feeling chilly, grab a cup of hot cocoa and curl up in front of my breakdown of "Toy Story 3."

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.260
Till next time, stay warm.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.380
"Reach for the sky!"
