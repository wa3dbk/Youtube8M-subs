00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.740
Hi, I’m Catherine. 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.980
My peers and I just came back from the 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.800
centenary of Gallipoli and Anzac Day 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.510
and it was amazing because this spirit has lasted 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.310
100 years and it should last 100 more. 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.330
Realising that I was there with 10,000 other people 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.230
and we had that mutual respect and to have that, 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.750
I’m like wow, this is a really important moment.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.800
It shows how we as students can 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.500
carry on the spirit.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.110
It started at 3am. 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.120
We woke up from a whole night of sleeping 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.340
in sleeping bags and it was freezing. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.340
From then we got through six piles of 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.830
security guards and security entries 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.870
and then we were in and it was so worth it.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.480
And just feeling that you’re at the place 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.790
that 100 years ago the Australian soldiers, 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.520
ANZAC troops landed. 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.230
It was just an amazing experience.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.740
Going to the cemeteries and the battlefields 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.350
themselves and seeing what they experienced 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.940
was probably the highlight because you were there, 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.740
instead of like you hear about it and then 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.400
to actually be there is a really different experience.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.470
Down there is Anzac Cove. 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.110
So this is a good example of just how steep it was, 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.190
from here down to the beach below.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.040
Also we had a service at Shrapnel Gully 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.880
which was really nice. 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.340
It was just unorganised.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.390
Someone started singing the national anthem and 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.480
then we all joined in and then one of the students 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.110
brought their bugle and they played The Last Post. 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.590
That was probably the most emotional moment 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.040
for me on the whole trip because it was 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.240
it felt really genuine because 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.140
there weren’t many people there. 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
It was just Australian people on Turkish soil. 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.390
Like we’re all united and it was really special.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.520
The most notable part of it for me was the silence. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.590
In between the speakers, 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.430
in between the anthems or the performances there 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.950
would be silence and all you could hear was the, 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.270
the lapping of the water on the, on the pebbles.  

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.080
And that was the time when you got to think 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.390
100 years ago this is what they 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.100
would have been running into.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.040
This beach is pretty amazing because on 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.840
in one day there were nine 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.740
Victorian Crosses awarded. 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.830
You can see behind 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.590
all the hills and stuff which they climbed up 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.500
and yet it’s just crazy to think this is where 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.910
they were 100 years ago.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.240
And it’s just unbelievable to think that we can sit 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.440
there now in peace and, yeah, a lot of gratitude 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.140
has to be shown to the Turkish who 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.280
this is their, this is their land and after years 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.390
of conflict, peace has prevailed and I think that’s 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.480
what that dawn Anzac service represented.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.710
People live such different lives to us over there 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.630
yet we’re still connected in a way that 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.040
will never be broken.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.040
And every year up until the day I die now 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.440
I’ll be at the dawn service bright and early. 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.830
I’ll go to the Anzac Day march every year as well 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.340
‘cause I think we need to commemorate the soldiers 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.470
that gave their lives and I think that’s really special.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.510
The Anzac legend, while it transcended death, 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.200
it can only endure in the living. 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.540
It’s us that has to remember it and so you need someone 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.340
that was there to tell people, 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.040
to tell people about it. 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.680
And so for me, I hope to do that by 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.480
talking to my friends, to my family, 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.680
to other schools, 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.390
to the RSL to share that experience 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.000
that I was so grateful to have.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.710
And I found out from the trip how important 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.110
it is for all of us. 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.640
So I really try and get my friends 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.040
to contribute to Anzac Day.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.030
And I would like to share it with the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.880
school community to start with and then maybe 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.190
like the sub-branches throughout the RSL.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.270
I’m making another documentary to follow 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.200
my first one that I entered 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.900
to get into this whole tour. 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.340
It’ll be about how the people I was around, 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.940
how they had changed beforehand 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.540
and now afterwards. 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.880
I will never forget the ANZAC spirit and 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.390
the journey that I got to go on. 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.390
Thank you.
