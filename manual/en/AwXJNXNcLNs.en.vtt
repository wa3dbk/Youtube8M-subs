The MRI Scan - what happens?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.300
Here's the MRI Scanner.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.440
If you need to have an MRI scan

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.800
you'll be brought into a room

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.720
much like this.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.240
You lie on the table,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.770
you go into the middle,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.760
you come back out again,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.820
and you get changed.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.230
It usually takes about 15-20 minutes

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.410
to have a scan.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.290
I'll show you the table going in...

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.630
As you can see there's plenty of room,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.410
and it's well lit.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.210
Once it's finished

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.520
we bring you back out again,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.830
(and obviously you have to imagine the person).

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.430
And the table comes down,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.580
and the scan's complete.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.310
It's as simple as that!
