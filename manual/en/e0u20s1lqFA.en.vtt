00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.150
Graphics?

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.890
No.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.630
Story?

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.370
Ha!

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.850
Yeah, right.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.140
How about online multiplayer?

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.949
Well, wrong again, Bob.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.360
There’s one primary difference between retro
and modern games, and none of those are things

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360
are it.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.870
No, the main thing that separates today’s
designers from yesterday’s

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.489
is where they emphasize complexity.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.370
Today, you need seven pages of instructions
on controls, commands, context—it’s convoluted,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.769
is what it is.

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.149
But back then?

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.589
Here you go.

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:49.589
Move.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:50.589
Boost.

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:51.589
Now go play.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:01:00.010
Oh, and uh...good freaking luck.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.869
Games should be challenging, but they shouldn’t
be challenging to play.

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.329
And to their eternal credit, Discord Games
gets it.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.430
In the amount of time it takes to blink your
eyes, you can figure out how to play 48 Chambers.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.920
But playing and conquering are two
very different things.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.440
A new release to the Xbox Live Indie Channel,
48 Chambers is exactly what its title says.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.970
This is a game with 48 twisting, turning,
obstacle-filled chambers, and it’s your

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.030
job to get your little ship thing to the goal.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.509
You move with the analog stick, you can execute
a quick boost with the A button.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.509
The complexity?

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.479
It’s in the chambers...right next to all
the damn spikes.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.249
There’s a casual mode, which doesn’t keep
score and lets you continue, as well as normal

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.550
and hardcore mode.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.799
I’m not a sadist, so yeah, casual was fine
with me.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.189
The thing that’s great about 48 Chambers
is that it controls so well.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.000
Moving your ship is extremely responsive,
so the game totally gets out of the way.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.819
It’s just you, those chambers...and those
spikes!

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.819
Ah, godd*mnit!

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:25.400
I can’t recommend this game enough.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.430
It’s a wicked throwback to the days when
multiplayer meant taking turns with your friends

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.280
and shouting out ideas; when an instruction
manual wasn’t half-filled with contextual

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.790
control commands; when the complexity came
not from learning how to play...but from getting

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.090
through those...

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.090
Spikes.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.090
Sigh.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.049
It’s 48 Chambers.
