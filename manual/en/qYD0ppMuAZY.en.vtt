JOHN VANDEBROOKE: My name is John Vandebrooke
and on behalf of Expert Village, I want you

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.930
to take a look at beginning encaustic painting.
Kleenex is really one of my best friends in

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.440
the wax painting field here because I found
so many different ways to work with it. One

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.070
of the ways is what I call "painting with
Kleenex," and what I do is I take a couple

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.030
plies of Kleenex and I embed wax into it.
I just take some wax, and I'll melt the wax,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.089
and just soak it into the Kleenex. And I usually
will do a pad of black overlapped by green

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:38.559
overlapped by brown. And when you're doing
this, you have to watch that when it sticks

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.789
to the pad, you lift it off quickly enough,
so that you don't get stuck to the bottom.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.010
Give yourself a clean sheet and then start
painting with this. And what's fun about this

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.209
is that you can't see what you're doing. You
have to paint blind. And what I like is the

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:04.559
end result has quite a beautiful Asian quality
to it. So, let's just try to do a little mountain

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.610
picture and we won't worry about skies here.
We're just going to see if we can get the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.940
mountain effect. So, we'll lay the Kleenex
down on the card, take the iron and start

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.720
pushing wax through the Kleenex and you have
to push down kinda hard to get the wax. Now

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.910
you see, you can't see what you're doing,
so this is what's fun about it. You're just

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.420
guessing of what you're getting. And every
once and a while, you can come back here and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.530
take a peek and see what you're getting and
see how it's coming. It looks pretty good.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.940
Let's see what we end up with. Okay, here
we go. We've got the outline of the mountain.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.200
Now, take your finger quick while the wax
is warm and begin to smear the wax into little

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:56.970
patterns like this, and there you end up with
something that I think looks very much like--almost

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:05.290
like sumi ink painting. Now, of course, I
could have put a sky in first, but you don't

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.030
have to with wax. You could leave it this
way and add a sky in with a different medium,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.469
for instance. You could use watercolor washes,
you could use--you could stain it with rubber

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.349
stamp dyes. There's just a lot of different
things you could do with this, but this technique

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.120
is great to know that you could take a, for
instance, make a big rock in the front of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.510
your painting with this technique and get
a rock that you can't get looked like in any

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.000
other way, except with the Kleenex. So, this
is a really great one for you to play with.
