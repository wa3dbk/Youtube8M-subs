00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:02.033
- Hey guys, so I am moving to LA,

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:04.226
which means that I am
packing up all of my stuff,

00:00:04.226 --> 00:00:06.350
including all of my books.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.162
And I came across a book
which I wanted to share

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:09.765
with all of you guys.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.945
It is called "The Cheese Monkeys:
A Novel in Two Semesters,"

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.629
and it is by Chip Kidd.

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.869
So I first came across this
book because it was recommended

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.167
to me by a certain
author named John Green.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.291
Back in 2010, he told me
that I should read it,

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.927
so I went to the Amazon page,

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:25.462
and I scrolled down through reviews,

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:27.770
and then oh, look, there's
a review from Booklist

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.386
written by John Green.

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:31.324
I'll read you an excerpt of his review.

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:34.040
"This is a fascinating, funny,
and wonderfully written novel

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.444
"of graphic design that manages to deepen

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:38.490
"the reader's appreciation
for the artistry

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.428
"and wonder of design
without a single drawing."

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:43.820
So, I got my copy in November, 2010,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.560
and I've probably read it
once a year since then.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.601
It is a fiction book,
and it is set in 1957.

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:52.422
It's about a guy who is
reluctantly starting college,

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:54.859
and because he just doesn't
care about anything,

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.055
he decides to major in art.

00:00:57.055 --> 00:01:00.258
He makes two friends, the
overly sincere Maybelle Lee,

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:03.416
and then the mysterious Himillsy Dodd.

00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:05.216
The book is split into two sections,

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:07.480
which are the two semesters
of the school year.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.477
In the first semester, they take Art 101,

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:10.754
and then in the second semester,

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:12.832
they take Intro to Graphic Design,

00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:16.000
which is taught by an unconventional
teacher named Sorbeck.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.381
And the assignments he gives
them, just, it's so good.

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:19.298
You have to read it.

00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:20.692
So it's really cool to get a glimpse

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:22.758
of what art school was
like back in the 50s,

00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:25.033
even though it was written in 2001.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.134
There's so many things that
you can definitely recognize

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:29.875
and sympathize with if
you are an art student,

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:32.139
but it's still enjoyable,
even if you're not.

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:34.518
It definitely starts off
pretty light-hearted and funny,

00:01:34.518 --> 00:01:36.190
and then it gets darker as it goes on.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.117
And the end is actually really intense.

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:40.172
A lot of the reviews I read
didn't like the ending,

00:01:40.172 --> 00:01:41.055
but I like it.

00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:42.471
I like how the book sort of changes

00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:44.420
in tone as it goes forward.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.453
And even if you don't
like the ending, I mean,

00:01:46.453 --> 00:01:48.961
most of the book is just
like, it's so brilliant.

00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:49.855
It's so good.

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:51.992
So besides the story inside the pages,

00:01:51.992 --> 00:01:54.313
I also wanted to talk
about the book itself.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.355
It was designed by the author, Chip Kidd,

00:01:56.355 --> 00:01:58.631
who is a really famous
and really brilliant

00:01:58.631 --> 00:01:59.954
book cover designer.

00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:02.009
Oh, and this was his first actual novel,

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.379
I don't think I said that before.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:05.759
Every single detail of
the design of this book

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.023
has been thought out,
and it's just beautiful.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:10.043
The cover has some really nice lettering,

00:02:10.043 --> 00:02:12.516
where you can still see the draft lines,

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:14.699
and then the jacket is
only on the front cover,

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.463
and underneath, he uses pictures

00:02:16.463 --> 00:02:18.483
to say "The Cheese Monkeys."

00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:19.657
The thank you notes are written

00:02:19.657 --> 00:02:21.165
on the edge of the hardcover.

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:22.470
And someone he thanks is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.711
anyone who has ever hailed him a cab.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.752
On the edge of the spine,
it says, in tiny writing,

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:30.213
"Whatever you do, don't
think of elephants,"

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:32.489
which would make sense
if you've read the book.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.404
And then, the writing on the spine says,

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.945
"Good is dead," with the title
kind of sitting inside it,

00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:40.453
which I think is pretty brave,
to make the largest writing

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:42.891
on the spine not your book title.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:46.106
And then, on the book pages,
if you bend them one way,

00:02:46.106 --> 00:02:49.973
it says "Do you see?" and if
you bend them the other way,

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:52.411
it says, "Good is dead."

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.709
So going inside the book,
the publishing information

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.203
is written on a single
line over nine pages,

00:02:58.203 --> 00:03:00.270
and it bumps right into the title page,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.464
which is pushed off and
continues on the next page.

00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:06.493
The section headings have some
really beautiful typography,

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:10.313
and the book is set in Apollo,
with some hints of Bedoni.

00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:11.890
And I don't wanna spoil
what's gonna happen,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.202
but at the end of the
book, he sets some dialogue

00:03:14.202 --> 00:03:16.686
in shades of gray, and
it's a really good example

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:20.727
of using design to give even
more meaning to the story.

00:03:20.727 --> 00:03:22.329
And then, the text continues right up

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.324
until the back end paper,
which has a page number,

00:03:25.324 --> 00:03:28.204
and it might be the only
time I've seen an end paper

00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:31.650
get a page number, but since
the ending is so intense,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.810
I love that the book just ends.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.086
And there aren't even any
blank pages to buffer you

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:38.524
between the end of the story
and the end of the book.

00:03:38.524 --> 00:03:40.869
So, it looks like Amazon
has the paperback in stock,

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.645
but if you want this hardcover edition,

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:45.467
it looks like you have to go
through some outside vendors.

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:46.801
But, if you can get your hands on it,

00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:48.346
I definitely recommend reading it.

00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:51.062
And, according to his
review, so does John Green.

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:53.244
So I found out, while I was
putting together this video,

00:03:53.244 --> 00:03:55.009
that there's actually
a sequel to this book

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.308
called "The Learners,"
which I haven't read yet,

00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:59.166
but I ordered it from Amazon.

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.860
So, after I read it, I might make

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.508
a review video about that one.

00:04:03.508 --> 00:04:05.564
Let me know if that's
something you might wanna see.

00:04:05.564 --> 00:04:07.245
And then, I was also
thinking that once I get

00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:09.463
to my new apartment and
get everything set up,

00:04:09.463 --> 00:04:11.564
I might do a full bookshelf tour.

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:13.410
So, let me know if that is also something

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.826
that you guys might wanna see.

00:04:14.826 --> 00:04:16.544
So I can't end this
video without mentioning

00:04:16.544 --> 00:04:18.169
"The Art Assignment,"
which is a new series

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.009
produced by PBS.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.812
And it is staring Sarah
Green, and also John.

00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:24.169
They have a YouTube channel.

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.817
Their first episode
just went up last week,

00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:27.014
and it's so good.

00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:29.254
If you're not watching it yet,
I will link it down below,

00:04:29.254 --> 00:04:31.147
and I definitely recommend it.

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:32.448
So, that is it from me.

00:04:32.448 --> 00:04:35.048
Thank you for sticking around
and watching my videos.

00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:36.289
I really appreciate it.

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.147
If you missed my last
video, it was all about

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:41.177
how I stay organized, so you
can watch that right here.

00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:43.255
Or, if you're an art student,
and you need to put together

00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:46.227
a print portfolio, I made
a video all about that.

00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:47.748
You can watch it right here.
