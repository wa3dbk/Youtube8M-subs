00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.655
The outdoors. Sure I'd never seen this place before but just then it was feeling like home

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:19.528
That brawl made me a man, I think

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:23.871
It was time for me to do something manly and also stop being a big puss all the time

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.591
You all seem in a rush to abandon your friend

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.440
Do any of you even care about him?

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.681
We'll take on the world, Dave

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.784
Just like I took you on in that man-on-man blowfest

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:36.341
Heh, penis

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.873
He's safer than we are, wandering around looking for trouble

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:41.573
Well, let's get on with it then

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:48.396
I had no family. No home. Nowhere to go

00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:51.464
Literally I didn't know which way to go

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:53.074
It was awkward

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:56.029
Geoff, I've been meaning to ask you

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.369
If we kill this wizard, what will you and Matt do?

00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:01.112
Probably stay on the run, why?

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:04.342
Where? Why? Wouldn't you rather have a home?

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:07.734
Neutrals can't have homes, Moe. We're nomads

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:12.116
Well sure, you and Matt and Greg might be nomads. I'm only here so Dave doesn't kill me

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.068
You think this life was our choice, bro?

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.935
You think we like running all the time?

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.681
Man I'm so angry I could swear

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:19.376
You wouldn't you pussy!

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:21.165
Oh fuck off you reverse-orphan

00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:24.142
That look in Matt's eyes chilled me

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.125
I was looking into fear and fear was looking right back

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.057
Oh shut, that came from Tum's camp

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.642
Who's Tum?

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.431
It's Tim, he's our guy. We need him if we're gonna kill Ezalor

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:36.979
Come on then, we've gotta help him

00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:39.793
I'm with Dave, whatever danger it is we can fight it off

00:01:39.902 --> 00:01:41.286
Oh no we can't, we're hiding

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:43.834
We can fight! If we don't fight now we never will

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.189
And that would be my intention

00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.468
Come on Moe, get in the trees he's coming!

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:49.700
Listen to your friends, Moe

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.678
I'd expect nothing less out of you mud cunts

00:01:52.888 --> 00:01:54.510
It's too late to hide, just run!

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:58.175
Oh for shit's sake

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:05.309
Of all the camps in all the jungles in all the world

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:09.028
I had to walk into Moe's

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:24.462
Told you I found 'em, I did good, right?

00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:27.708
You have my thanks Ezalor, now go, I'll handle this

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.290
I spent so long watchin', and listenin' and spyin'

00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:34.415
Where's my bounty?

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.235
Next time you wanna play spy, buy some observer wards

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:38.860
Now scram

00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:41.598
You're making a powerful enemy, Chen

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.547
You... sub par horseman

00:02:45.437 --> 00:02:47.319
Mister Wiggles, YAH!

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:50.749
Hold up, boy

00:02:51.877 --> 00:02:54.335
Mud golem, do you know what I am?

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:56.445
Well he was calling you Chen so um...

00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:58.053
Er, Chinese?

00:02:58.087 --> 00:03:00.497
I am known amongst neutrals as the Mad Horseman

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:01.787
But you're riding a pig

00:03:03.294 --> 00:03:04.444
How dare you

00:03:05.513 --> 00:03:09.001
War, Famine, Pestilence, Death

00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:12.024
To your people I am all of these things incarnate you see,

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.975
I don't just kill your people

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:18.474
I destroy their free will enslaving them, forcing them to attack their allies, loved ones

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.615
You mud golemsssssss

00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:25.151
For whatever reason are immune to my spells so you're coming with me, or I kill you

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:30.200
And as the sun turned away from the world at the end of another day

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.641
I found solice in the darkness

00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:35.830
Where the hell'd you go little bunny?

00:03:38.607 --> 00:03:39.803
Tim, it's Matt, what happened?

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:44.397
They're gone... they're both just gone!

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.301
Who's gone, Tim, are you hurt?

00:03:46.782 --> 00:03:48.227
My little brothers...

00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:54.964
We've all got problems, pal

00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:58.139
I thought you said this joker could kill a hero

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:00.157
He couldn't even save his brothers

00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:01.526
Heh, pathetic
