00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 

00:00:03.067 --> 00:00:06.999
We're up at the Arctic Valley ski slope right now.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.699
And it's a volunteer ski slope run by the Anchorage Ski Club.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.232
Arctic Valley is a non-groomed slope. So we're here in hog heaven.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:20.532
Because we like powder, we like fresh tracks up there.

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.932
You can find places no one else has been,

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.199
and you can just carve your way down the hill, and leave your mark.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.399
Most everybody here is a ski bum.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.266
And a lot of people here, they skied here as kids.

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:37.399
And now they're back here to maintain their tradition and keep it going.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.266
It's Merry Marmot Festival today. It's our spring fling.

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:45.732
And we're having a lot of activities. We have downhill races.

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.299
We have tube races, we have fat bike races.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.199
And my favorite is the dummy launch.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.332
In which people make contraptions on two skis,

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.866
and then we take it to the top of the hill here.

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:03.832
And push it over the edge, and it goes down and it flies in the air.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.866
And then it crashes.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.532
We get judged based on attitude, aptitude, altitude, and a plum.

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:15.699
Mine's just a big missile. It's 14 feet long and about 3 feet in diameter.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.866
And it's on skis with rocks for weight, so we get a lot of speed going down,

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:23.066
so we get a lot of elevation.

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:26.866
And then in the back I went and got some fireworks that shoot flares.

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:29.066
And when we're gonna go up on the hill, we'll light them,

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:32.166
and shoot flares out and push it over the edge.

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.632
So it should get some momentum as it goes down, and when it hits the lift,

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:39.999
it should fly in the air, and be a plum, whatever that is.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:57.632
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go!

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:01.732
When I first started skiing here years ago,

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:05.699
it was back when they used to have rentals, and they did night skiing,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.632
and it was a pretty active place.

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:09.566
And then the military pulled out.

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:14.899
and a lot of people, I think, in town thought the whole place shut down.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.032
And so it went into a real slump. They actually, I guess, almost had to shut down.

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:26.399
And then it was up to the volunteers to kind of put the pieces back together.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.266
Chef: we're getting our BBQ stuff ready, I just stopped selling regular food.

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:32.299
It's taking us a little bit of work.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.866
Carol: and the fact that it's still here kind of surprises some people.

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:43.232
Yeah, we have some very dedicated people. They kept this place alive.

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:47.466
If it hadn't been for those people, this place would have died.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.166
Mike: There's a lot volunteers here everyday.

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:53.599
Each lift has somebody at the bottom and someone at the top.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.499
You have a couple people who show up early to dig it out,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.766
and set it up and get ready. And then you rotate people.

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:02.466
Every two hours you have a shift, so people don't get too tired,

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.899
and you move them around, so they stay alert.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.966
It's a big group of people.

00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:15.432
Carol: I'm in the caregiving profession, so ski patrol just kind of fits with that.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:18.399
You know, having that medical knowledge about how to treat wounds and save a life.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.799
It could come in handy in a lot of different situations in my life.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.932
I've always been kind of an adventure junky.

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:31.266
I'm one of those people that don't like to sit still. I like to have something to do.

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:34.999
Boredom isn't in my agenda.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.332
A lot of my patients sometimes think I'm crazy,

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:42.932
when they find out all the things I do, you know, for fun.

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:46.599
I've done a lot of things that most people think are pretty dangerous.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.599
And I've been injured a few times. I broke my leg up here on year,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.132
I've hurt my shoulder, last weekend I hurt my wrist.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:02.199
I was out kayak camping, and I had a bear come up and sniff the back of my head.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.799
Through the tent. Not once, but twice during the night.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.066
It's like, you don't get that experience hardly anywhere else.

00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:17.033
You know, Alaska is just a little more extreme.
