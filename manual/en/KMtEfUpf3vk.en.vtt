00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.029
[SOUND]

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.070
[MUSIC]

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.420
My name is Kwok Su.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.310
I'm a project engineer for TELACU
Construction Management.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.280
Our organization is an not for profit
company and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.360
a lot of work that we do is either public
works or we used to do private sectors

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.220
development and a lot of senior retirement
homes.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.240
Currently we're doing a few projects for
the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.610
Federal government, with the Navy, Army,
Marine Corps.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.090
And also we do a lot of work with

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.670
the Federal projects, with intended
improvements in the GSA world.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.500
We wanted to streamline the law or
document work flow.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.000
And so that, that was when we started.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.100
We waned to make, make our construction
management style

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.740
a lot more efficient With RFIs and some
metals.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.660
We wanted to expedite that because that
could ultimately lead to

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.735
a lot of delays and a lot of cost involved
in that.

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:26.690
[SOUND] With Procore, we're, we're able to
stay within our, our schedule and budget.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.160
Relatively on a timely manner.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:37.090
If a RFI was submitted like, today, and we
routed it correctly with our review and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.371
with the architect, we're able to almost
immediately respond within a few hours.

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:49.008
[NOISE] The contractor ultimately
understands that this process

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.130
is a lot faster than a, a standard email.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.330
And there's a lot of, of documentation
that goes with

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.020
that, a lot of logs that are produced from
the program.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.750
So overall, they're able to use it more as
a tool than a, than a hindrance.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.420
So, it helps a lot in the process.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.630
[SOUND]

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.600
Yeah, within the first week, they were
able to pick it up and, and run with it.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.560
The unlimited users for a set price was
the, the best selling point, and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.264
the quick start up from new users picking
up the program was a good selling point.

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:33.790
[SOUND]
We were able to generate a lot more

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.788
specific reports that wasn't available
initially.

00:02:38.788 --> 00:02:44.070
[SOUND]
Fast mostly

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.368
within that same day I'm able to resolve a
lot of user issues.

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:55.040
[SOUND]
Procore enable our company to

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.475
document a lot of language and a lot of
workflow from our files to submittals

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:07.560
we're able to make the process of
construction and of the documentation a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.040
lot more steady and a lot more precise.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.650
I would definitely recommend it to other
people.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.560
Number one, unlimited users and number
two, cost effectiveness.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.440
Number three, documentation is, is key in
our business.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.640
So, being able to go back on verbage that
was said.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.700
Or a certain type of document that was
sent.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.540
That's key to our

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.575
business.

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:50.924
