When grooming your horse you're going to use
the same tools that you would use when grooming

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.210
any horse except if it's your own horse you
know exactly what things they like and don't

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.500
like so you can really get specific tools
that work for your horse in particular. Some

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.060
horses like softer brushes. Some horses are
tougher skinned and will take a tougher brush.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.410
So we'll start with this curry comb using
it in circular motions. And if it's your own

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.219
horse you'll know exactly what pressure your
horse will tolerate. Mine will tolerate pretty

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:46.699
good firm pressure. And you'll use this all
the way back on the meaty parts of her body.

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:56.650
Then we'll switch to a hard brush. And using
a flicking motion just get that loosened up

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:10.080
dirt and hair off of your horse's body. Next
we're going to switch to a soft brush. And

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:24.260
work on your horses face and legs.
And the next thing we're going to do is use

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.790
the huff pick. You're going to lean up against
your horse's side, run your hand down their

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:39.020
leg, squeeze a little bit in the crease in
the cannon bone and lift supporting the hoof

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.231
with both hands, and you're going to pick
out along side the frogs and the grooves of

00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:58.720
your horses hoof. The last thing you're going
to do and I like to do this everyday to help

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.459
train my horse's mane is just comb the mane
onto the right side of the neck.
