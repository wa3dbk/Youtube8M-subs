00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
Congratulations Sir, your bid of £2000 won the Sweet 7 album sampler auction.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.960
The seller lives in this suburb here.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.710
We have chosen expediated courier delivery at an extra £15 shipping cost.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.810
The CD will be delivered within 24 hours to our bunker here.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.050
Good. I shall be the first to own the CD and get credit for leaking the Keisha tracks.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.040
My Fuhrer...

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.330
The CD...

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.060
The CD leaked last night, all 6 tracks in High Quality.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.730
It's on every download site on the net.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:57.100
Everyone who doesn't consider the definitive Sugababes to be Heidi, Amelle &amp; Keisha... get out.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.290
Two fucking GRAND I paid for that damn CD!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.520
3 o'clock in the morning I stayed up to win that auction,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.030
and snipe that little shit KeishaStan92 with 1 second left to go!

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.810
Do you realise how many copies of Wordshaker I could've bought with £2000!

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.880
Enough to get it back in the top 20!

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.700
All I wanted was to share one final Sugababes v3 album.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.800
Keisha was the heart and soul of the group!

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.050
A flop Eurovision singer could never replace her.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.880
Without Keisha they're nothing!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.220
Surely you agree Jade has an excellent voice and lots of sex appeal.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.180
Sex appeal? Lifting her leg up behind her ear?

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.720
My fucking dog can do that!

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.020
My fuhrer, the Sugababes are better-off with no Keisha. No Keisha means no drama.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.580
No drama? I don't fucking think so!

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.310
Don't you read the papers or listen to the radio?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.390
Heidi's been making damn sure she turns on the waterworks every chance she gets.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.290
And Amelle's in a fucking loony bin!!

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.000
It's the most acrimonious end to a girl group since All Saints.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.040
And as for the "About A Girl" video...

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.270
"3 Hookers In The Desert" more like!

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.830
To think it was originally all about the music!

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.490
They've become as useless as the Pussycat Dolls without Nicole!

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.250
Since the beginning I've been their Number One fan.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.560
And it was to be ME who shared Keisha's last Sugababes tracks with the world.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.250
For months fans have wanted the Sweet 7 sampler to leak.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.580
Finally one comes on eBay and I transfer funds to...

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.860
the Nazi PayPal account especially.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.170
And then some dick decides to leak the sampler

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.910
the same day I win the auction!

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.910
£2000 wasted on 6 tracks everybody's downloaded for free!

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.590
Don't worry, the Sugababes aren't over. You'll still get your turn in the group.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.040
Deep down, I still hope the first line-up will get back together.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.790
They could be great again. Keisha, Mutya, Siobhan.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.940
I loved those girls.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.830
But we know it'll never happen.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.390
Find my copy of Jade's unreleased album and put it on eBay.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.570
Make sure you use the sexiest photo of her you can find.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.700
I never did get around to listening to it anyway.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.750
Maybe it'll fetch £20 if I'm lucky.
