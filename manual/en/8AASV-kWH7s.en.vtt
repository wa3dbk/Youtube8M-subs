00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:02.502
(squeaking)

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:03.971
(pop)

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:09.810
(♪♪♪)

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.845
WOMAN:
Have you ever been
under a tree in the fall

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.349
and watched as a shower of
leaves fell all around you?

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.984
It feels like a curtain of
leaves has been

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.652
pulled in front of your eyes.

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:22.055
Artists such as Gustav Klimt,
Vincent van Gogh,

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.558
and Georgia O'Keeffe often use
tree and leaf imagery

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.760
in their work.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.130
Using pressed or fresh leaves,
we'll make a mono print

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.531
on translucent paper,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.867
and when many prints
are hung chain-like,

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.637
they will create
a curtain of leaves.

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:39.573
This is translucent
marker paper,

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.241
meaning light
can pass through it.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.843
Since it's translucent,

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:44.144
we can use both sides
of the paper

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.445
to make prints.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.315
This way a subtle
layered effect is created,

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:52.252
almost like watching those
leaves fall on a sunny day.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.454
I've gathered pressed
leaves for my print,

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.424
but paper leaves,
fresh leaves,

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.127
or even leaf stamps will work.

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:02.562
This is Blick E-Z-Cut
printing block.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.099
This block is most often used
to make linoleum print

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.668
with linoleum cutters,

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:11.204
but for this project
it's our printing plate.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:14.641
I'm gonna start by adding
a thin line of paint

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.177
across the top
of my plate.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.713
I'm using Blickrylics.

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.782
These are our
student acrylics.

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:25.519
They're a little bit thinner,
and a little bit thinner paint

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.955
works really well
for this process,

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:30.924
so we're not going to
need a lot of paint.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:38.298
Gonna just put 'em
right on the plate.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.733
Depending on your climate,

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.969
you might need to
spritz just a little water

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.137
on your plate,
if you think that this is

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.139
a little drier than
you need it to be.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.675
So what I'm gonna do
is just use my brayer.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:53.714
I'm gonna pull straight down
to the bottom of the plate,

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:58.085
and yes, these colours
are gonna blend as I roll.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:02.856
That's part of the fun.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:03.924
'Kay.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:06.660
Then I'm going to start
adding some textures.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.563
This is a rubber comb,
which you can pull through

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:16.003
the plate, make a design
there on the side.

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:21.441
You can use rubber shapers,
you can use your fingers,

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:24.845
the end of a paintbrush
works great to pull that off.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:32.619
This is a mono-print just
like any other mono-print.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.522
This is a texture plate,
a little plastic plate,

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:39.760
I'm gonna add a little
bit of texture with that.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.664
This will lift the paint off
where I've pressed it,

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:47.167
and then I'm going to
start adding my leaves.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.869
I'll put a maple leaf
there in the middle,

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.638
kind of a focal point.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:03:01.014
This is a little
grape vine leaf.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.984
Now a hydrangea,
I believe, for this one.

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:07.220
Now all we're going to do
is press the paper

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.258
onto the plate,
just gently lay it there.

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.627
We're just going to go
over it with our hands.

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:16.129
Not gonna do anything fancy.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.066
I have chosen for this print
to leave the leaves

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:20.634
on the plate,

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:22.502
so they're going to
act as a resist.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:24.838
We're going to get
a non-printed area

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:29.609
in the shape of a leaf
on this print.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.878
So once you think you've hit
every area with your hands,

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:36.550
we're just going to
slowly peal that paper off.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.821
There's my maple leaf.

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:41.555
Okay.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.957
And I'm going to lay this
aside to dry

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.359
so I can print
the other side.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.628
Now these leaves
have picked up paint,

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:53.233
obviously,from the plate,
so I can use these

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.302
in the next print

00:03:55.302 --> 00:04:00.640
if I'd like to by
placing them paint side up.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.479
So I'm going to save
those for next print.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:10.217
After both sides of
the print are dry,

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:11.852
they can be framed,

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:15.288
just using thin
woodsy craft sticks.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:18.792
You just use
four craft sticks,

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:22.162
a little bit of
Aleene's Quick Dry Tacky Glue,

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:25.198
and a trim around the edge
with your exacto knife.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:28.935
If you have younger students,
they can build the print

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.005
in a 4 1/2 inch square
that they've already cut,

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.840
so they just cutout their
square in 4 1/2 inches

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.076
and these will fit perfectly.

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.245
When you're done
making the square prints,

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:41.815
they can be made into
a chain, or a curtain,

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:44.050
simply by punching a whole
in the centre top and bottom

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.818
of the print

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.286
with a blunt needle,

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.922
and connecting with
a little waxed linen thread.

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:51.224
Hang them from
a branch for added beauty.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:54.694
They also look beautiful
hanging in a window.

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:58.865
You can use this same process
for making blank cards,

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:02.202
or printing on fabric
using textile paints.

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:04.571
