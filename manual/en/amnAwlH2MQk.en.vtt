00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.560
Today on this 2005 Dodge Caravan, we're going
to be installing Tow Ready Wiring Harness

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.560
product number 118300.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.320
Ok, the port where we're going to plug our
wiring harness into are located behind the

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.600
rear tail lights on both the drivers and passenger's
sides of the vehicle, so we want to go ahead

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.679
and first remove both the tail lights.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.970
And to do that, we've opened up the rear cargo
door here and you can see we've got two push

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.909
pin fasters on the in-board side holding the
tail light in place.

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.119
We're going to go ahead and remove those.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.699
We can use a rivet removal tool, a flathead
screwdriver or whatever you have available

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:42.940
to you.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.900
With those removed, you can just go ahead
and pull the tail light off and we see here

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.690
on the back side, we got the connector for
the wiring harness.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.930
There's a red black new tab here at the top
that we need to go ahead and release, and

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.880
press that over and then push the tab at the
top of the connector and pull them apart.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.780
Go ahead and repeat that for the passenger's
side one as well, then we'll go ahead and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.549
show you how we're going to route the wires.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.119
The T-connector wires are actually going to
be stored inside the vehicle so we're going

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.100
to next go ahead and remove some of the interior
panel pieces.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.720
We need to go ahead and remove the rear threshold
piece, and we need to pop out both the driver's

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.340
and passenger's sides' interior panels.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:45.130
So before we actually route those, there is

00:01:45.130 --> 00:02:02.079
one 
other 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:56.040
thing 
we need 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:09.040
to do.
