00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.516
&gt;&gt; Sally: Hey Dude, look who's here.

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:11.806
It's my friend Izzy the iGEMer.

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:12.606
She just stopped by for a visit.

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:13.976
&gt;&gt; Dude: Whoa!

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:15.996
I've never met a real iGEMer before!

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:17.886
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Hey Dude, great to meet you.

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:21.086
&gt;&gt; Sally: I need to split some
cells in the tissue culture room,

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.066
but I thought that you and Izzy could chat.

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:26.016
Maybe she could tell you
a bit about her project?

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:27.266
&gt;&gt; Dude: Awesome!

00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:28.626
&gt;&gt; Dude: So what was your iGEM project?

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:33.206
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Well we tried to engineer
a bacterial arsenic detector.

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:34.036
&gt;&gt; Dude: A what?

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.156
&gt;&gt; Izzy: A bacterial cell that could
tell us when arsenic is present in water.

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:42.486
&gt;&gt; Izzy: See arsenic contamination
in drinking water is a big problem

00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:44.876
for people living in Bangladesh and West Bengal.

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:48.746
And since there's no easy way to
know if arsenic is in the water,

00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:52.706
people there have been drinking
contaminated water and getting sick .

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.116
So we wanted to engineer a biological system

00:00:56.116 --> 00:00:59.016
that people can use to test
their water for arsenic.

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:00.976
&gt;&gt; Dude: I had no idea this was such a problem!

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:02.525
What a great project to work on.

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:03.536
How does your system work?
25
00:01:03,686 --&gt; 00:01:03,636
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Well our goal or the system
specification as engineers call it was

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:13.896
to have people mix a little of their drinking
water, with a culture of bacteria and know

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:17.045
that there's arsenic contamination
if the liquid changes color.

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:18.036
&gt;&gt; Dude: Awesome!.

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:20.386
But how did you get a bacteria to do that?

00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:23.286
I'm still trying to figure how to
make my bacterial balloon work!

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:26.556
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Well like all engineers,
we used abstraction to help us.

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:27.556
Let's take a look.

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:31.696
&gt;&gt; Izzy: We knew we needed to build a
system that could take as input arsenic

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:33.706
and produce as output a change in the color.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:37.176
&gt;&gt; Izzy: So first, we compiled
our system into devices.

00:01:37.336 --> 00:01:41.646
We needed one device that could
detect arsenic and produce a signal.

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:50.056
We called this our arsenic sensor and
gave it a part number, BBA J33201.

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:54.966
And we needed a second device that could
produce a color when it got the signal

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:58.146
from our arsenic sensor that
there's arsenic around.

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:03.506
We called this color reporter BBA J33202.

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:04.636
&gt;&gt; Dude: I don't get it.

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:06.266
Why are you using two devices?

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:09.606
Wouldn't it be way easier to make
just one: arsenic in and color out?

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:12.446
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Well you could do it that way.

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:15.496
But then the only thing that the
device could be used for is to report

00:02:15.496 --> 00:02:17.266
on arsenic contamination with color.

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:21.266
By splitting the system into two
devices, a sensor and a reporter,

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:25.276
we hope future iGEM teams can use
one or the other for new projects.

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:25.966
&gt;&gt; Dude: How?

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:31.136
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well a team could connect the arsenic
sensor device to a different reporter device

00:02:31.246 --> 00:02:33.836
that say, produces light instead of color.

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:37.856
Or a team could build a new system that
detects say, mercury contamination,

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:40.726
and then produces a color as a response.

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:42.766
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Yep, we designed our system

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:46.126
so that people can more easily
reuse and build on our work!

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:47.946
&gt;&gt; Dude: Oh I get it!

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:51.896
Maybe I could connect your arsenic sensor
device to my balloon-making device!

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:53.266
&gt;&gt; Izzy: Exactly!

00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:55.216
&gt;&gt; Dude: But shouldn't I know a little more

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:59.506
about how the arsenic sensor works before I
just hook it up to by balloon making device?

00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:04.576
Sally got kinda upset last time I didn't'
stop the balloons from growing and growing...

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:08.896
&gt;&gt; Izzy: That's why we entered both devices
into the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:13.296
We also documented our project online
at the iGEM wiki to make it easier

00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:14.516
for others to build upon our work.

00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:17.566
&gt;&gt; Sally: The goal is that eventually,
for each device in the Registry,

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:21.376
there will be a datasheet available that
summarizes all the relevant information

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:24.016
about that device so that you know how to use it

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.956
in a higher level system
like the arsenic detector.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:31.186
&gt;&gt; Dude: You mean just like this old datasheet
I found for this a 7404 hex inverter chip?

00:03:31.596 --> 00:03:31.946
&gt;&gt; Sally: Yep.

00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:35.356
But I'm afraid there's still a lot
of work to do before all the parts

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:37.886
and devices in the Registry have datasheets.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:38.596
&gt;&gt; Dude: Great!

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:40.316
Lots of work to do.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:41.716
Let's get started!
