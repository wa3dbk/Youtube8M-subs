00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.400
When I first encountered this piece,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.967
it was in a dark storage area.

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:20.334
Bringing it out into the light revealed naturalism,

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:23.266
the beauty of the figures,

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:27.433
even the beauty of ugliness. I saw its historical place

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.967
in the history of Gothic sculpture of the thirteenth century.

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:33.934
Through analysis of the stone itself,

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.600
this proved to be

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.333
linked to the great cathedral, Amiens. It was in a large

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:50.200
architectural setting, called a choir screen, incorporated amongst other narrative scenes of the life of Christ.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.967
As you approach it, one sees the drama taking place. They have their back to you.

00:00:56.967 --> 00:01:00.000
You’re almost incorporated into this action.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.266
Within a very shallow space of about ten inches, using three layers of figures that simultaneously shows

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.100
three

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100
significant events of the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.834
life of Christ--the beginning of the end of his life on Earth--

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:21.800
the kiss of Judas that sets into motion

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.100
the soldier seizing him.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
Another element takes place, Simon Peter, in a moment of rage,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.300
cuts off the ear of Malchus

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.400
the servant of the high priest.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.900
There’s one feature about it that is truly astonishing,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.600
and that is the fact that Judas and Christ have astonishing similar facial types.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.266
You cannot see the face of Judas; he’s in fact, identical.

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.333
Amongst the violence and the chaos,

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:56.667
Christ reaches around

00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:02.800
and miraculously brings the ear back to Malchus.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.000
You have to dissect the beauty and the tranquility and the miraculous healing power that’s taking place here,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.934
in a very compact amount of space,

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:16.166
and showing an artist of great ingenuity.

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:20.634
Nothing before it has really been presented in this way.
