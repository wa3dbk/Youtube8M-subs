Hey guys it's Daisy here.

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:18.095
Welcome to my channel and today we will be making these DIY Unicorn Horn Earrings.

00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:22.297
These are super gorgeous and super easy to make.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.760
So first you need some clay. I am using translucent and white glitter clay but you can use two different colors of your choice.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.587
You will also need fish hook earrings, flat head pins and jump rings to form the earrings.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:42.261
Last but not least, we will also need an X-Acto knife, round nose plyers and cutting plyers.

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:48.253
First have your two colors, then cut them equally into portions.

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:51.303
You will need four portions in total for the earrings.

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:57.515
Then role them out into long cone shapes like so.

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:04.215
And just keep rolling and rolling and roll them all out.

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:12.006
Then you want to twist them round like so. Twist them together and it will form something like this.

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.048
Just keep twisting as much as you want.

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:19.754
And then you want to make the end of the twisty bit pointy so it's kind of like a horn.

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:24.787
Then you want to cut the ends of to make them flat like you've cut them off a unicorn.

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:26.719
Unfortunately, it's so sad to think about.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.084
And it should look something like this.

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:35.414
So next you want to make your eyepin and you can just buy pre-made eyepins but I decided to make my own.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.869
I haven't made eyepins before so this was my very first time and it turned out kind of crooked but it still worked out as long as you have the end of the eyepin secured.

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:55.927
Just straighten it out if it's kind of wonky but yeah, it should look something like this.

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:05.486
Cut off the excess, put some glue on it and then put it into the unicorn horn and place it in.

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:06.910
Then it's time to bake it.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:16.409
So once it comes out of the oven, it looks super duper cute and you can even glaze it, but I didn't end up doing that.

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:25.368
Grab your jump ring, open it up, add in the little fish hook thing as well as the unicorn horn and then close it back up.

00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:39.287
And then once that's done, then you are all finished! You have yourself some beautiful unicorn horn earrings.

00:02:39.287 --> 00:02:41.927
Hope you enjoyed this video, see you guys next time!
