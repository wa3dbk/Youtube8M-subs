REBECCA SATO: Hi. I'm Rebecca Sato with ExpertVillage.com.
Let's talk about Web sites. Now, you're a

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:13.380
writer, and so you probably--a lot of writers,
new writers, especially, they're not thinking

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.369
about how to market themselves and how to
get their samples easily accessible to clients.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.579
But you'll find that in today's day and age,
people just don't have time to look at a paper

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.699
portfolio. You can have a beautiful paper
portfolio and I don't think it's a bad idea

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.040
because you can bring it with you when--on
jobs that you end up having an interview with

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.950
the client. But a lot of times, things are
done through virtual offices these days. I

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.710
have great clients that I've never met but
I have a relationship with, and it's entirely

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.800
through the Internet. So you want to make
sure that you have a digital portfolio. And

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.580
one of the best ways to have a digital portfolio
is to have your own Web site, or the very

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.540
least, have a Web site where you have your
own--for example, like iFreelance and some

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.920
of those other freelance sites, they'll let
you build your own portfolio. So it's free,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.990
and you can have just little portfolio and
people can go there and look at your writing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.720
samples. But I think, actually, it's a little
better if you could just have your own Web

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.330
site. If you can get your name or your business
name or your own name, then that's great.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.310
Because that's something that people go to
and they won't see anyone else because I will

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.350
be hesitant to send someone to a site that
looks at lots of writers and my portfolio

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.730
is there. Because what are they going to do?
They're going to think, "Wow, this isn't my

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.271
only option." And they'll start looking at
other writers. If you can set up your own

00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:40.409
site then you're a step ahead from those other
writers. So--and what you want to do is when

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.760
they get there, you want to make sure that
it very clearly says portfolio or writing

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.150
samples or somewhere where they can click,
and that it will have links to some of your

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.130
writing. Now, if your writing is not available
online, like you didn't do it for a Web site

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.650
or a company or some way where it's probably
already going to be online. If you can do

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.180
a direct link, that's great. But if it is
something that only came out in print, then

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.590
you can still go ahead and scan that and have
a link to that work, where it will just pull

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.710
it up in PDF or whatever. It doesn't matter
just so long as that's easily accessible.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.050
You want them to be able to go to your site
and look at what you've done and also, of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.300
course, you want to have an "about" section
and you might want to have that tells about

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.380
you and your credentials, and then you'll
probably also want to have services and maybe

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.080
even pricing. It depends on how much you want
to come upfront or how much you want to discuss

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.080
with them first. But those are some things
that you want to keep in mind when you're

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.670
getting your Web site. And Web sites are cheap.
Don't be intimidated by that. You could get

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.080
Web sites these days that look great. Templates
are already built for you for four bucks a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.530
month. So don't let that deter you.
