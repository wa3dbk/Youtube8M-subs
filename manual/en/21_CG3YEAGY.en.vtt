VIDEO TRANSCRIPT: Great Lakes in Transition:
"Amazing change."

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.700
University of Michigan researcher David Jude:

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.719
"We're right in the middle of some really
dramatic changes that

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.760
are occurring in the Great Lakes right now.
And I've been really

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.960
surprised to see how fast these changes are
proceeding and some

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.710
of the impacts they're having on the native
organisms in the Great

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.270
Lakes. These changes have been really accelerated
by the presence

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.660
of invasive species, especially the zebra
and quagga mussel that have

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.270
come in to the Great Lakes.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.830
"The most amazing thing I've been seeing is
that I've been trawling

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.920
out here from the early '70s, all the way
up to this time. So as

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.690
time went on, we started picking up more and
more zebra mussels

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.350
in the trawls, and then we saw the quagga
mussel come in. And

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.630
about 2001 we started to see a shift over
toward quagga mussels,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.700
a closely related species to the zebra mussel.
As I continued

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.530
trawling, I started seeing more of a shift
toward quagga mussels

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.509
and I started seeing them deeper and deeper
[in the lake].

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.670
"Right now there's probably quagga mussels
across the entirety

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.670
of Lake Michigan.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.290
"So we've seen this whole shift in ecosystem
as this 'trophic

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.819
cascade' is going through the food web and
causing declines

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.009
at every level of the food web. And it's just
unprecedented."

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.009
David Jude, aboard research vessel R/V Laurentian,
displaying

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.009
trawl net full of quagga mussels:

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.604
"This is a good example of the kind of abundance
of quagga

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:32.604
mussels we're seeing on the bottom of Lake
Michigan right now.

00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:33.604
You can't even do a really good trawl out
there without getting

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:34.604
it full of quagga mussels. And it also gives
you an idea--

00:01:34.604 --> 00:01:35.604
this was only a five minute tow and look at
how many quagga

00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:36.604
mussels we caught in the net. It's just amazing
how many are

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:37.604
down there. That's why we've seen such huge
ecological

00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:38.604
impacts."

00:01:38.604 --> 00:01:39.604
Mark Edlund, of the St. Croix Watershed Research
Station,

00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:40.604
Science Museum of Minnesota:

00:01:40.604 --> 00:01:43.319
"Zebra and quagga mussels are filtering out
all the algae in the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:51.270
system, bringing all those nutrients to the
bottom. So we're

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.639
not seeing the normal nutrient regeneration
and algal growth that

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:00.479
we should expect to see in a lake like this
in the spring."

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.590
Edlund displays water sample from Lake Michigan.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.130
"Normally that [sample] jar would come up
absolutely brown with

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.280
diatom growth in it. Especially at this time
of year when

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.679
everything should be happening out here. It's
almost crystal

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.010
clear, the water out here. There's no algae
growing out here

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.010
anymore."

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.110
"Even the algae are changing. We know that
the system is

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.900
really radically shifting. They're the first
cog in the food

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.900
chain out here.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.349
"What we've been out on our cruise testing
is the linkage

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.939
between the algae and the loss of this small
little animal

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.590
that lives in the--that used to live--in the
bottom of Lake

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.020
Michigan called diporeia.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.849
"We hope to be able to find out that the abundance
and

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.560
species composition of the algae have changed
in the last 20 years

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.989
have changed dramatically and that the diporeia
have had to

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.989
change their eating habits to the point where
they probably

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.060
have lost out.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.099
"We're going to do this by looking at the
sediment record

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.620
to see how the algae have changed over time.
And we're also

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.390
going to be looking at historical collections
of diporeia to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.379
see what they were actually eating over time.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.599
"The diporeia were one of the primary food
sources for most

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.569
of the popular or commercial fisheries out
here, be it the

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.569
yellow perch, the whitefish fisheries, the
loss of that

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.799
organism, or that animal, from the Great Lakes,
which is probably

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.730
driven by changes in its food supply, will
have ramifications

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.730
on people."

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.730
David Jude:

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.810
"We're going to have less productivity in
the lakes. And that's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.790
going to translate to less fish. So the sport
fishermen are

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.260
the people who are going to be probably most
affected.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.580
"Suddenly there's going to be less perch.
There's not going to be

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.840
as big a salmon fishery as we had before.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.599
"It's generally cited to be $4 billion, the
sports fishery in

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.540
the Great Lakes--in all five of the Great
Lakes. So it's an

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.689
extremely important economic boon, especially
for Michigan, in

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.950
our current state of affairs. So it's probably
going to be an

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.590
unfortunate sort of impact from the kinds
of changes we're

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.590
seeing right now.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.099
"It's really a dramatic thing to be in this
era, to be

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.040
seeing this happen."
