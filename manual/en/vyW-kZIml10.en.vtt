00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.070
I became involved because my next door neighbour

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.590
was a teacher at this school and the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.300
mentoring system was just starting and she asked me 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.300
if I’d do maths and I said yes, 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.100
and I’ve done it ever since.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.240
The first time I came here was in 1999 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.430
and I had six kids, it was very difficult. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.950
I found it difficult but it was very rewarding 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.190
because they loved it and their enthusiasm doesn’t wane, 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.200
it becomes more.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.800
The mentors are a really important part of our school. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.000
We really value them and we try our best 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.830
to honour them in so many ways. 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.160
They’re people who really give up their time and they 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.960
volunteer their time and we see them as a really 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.150
integral part of all the learning 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.740
that takes place at our school.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.310
I look forward to my mentoring classes every Monday afternoon 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.830
because it’s something that is more of a 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.700
one on one experienced compared to the class.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.470
It’s almost like having a peer, except a mentor is perhaps 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.880
maybe older than you. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.880
She has the same interests as you and it’s all about 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.500
learning together, it’s not really like having a teacher 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.400
who knows more things than you; it’s not as intimidating.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.220
I have been inspired because she made it sound 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.750
really interesting ‘cause at first I wasn’t quite sure 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.070
whether I wanted to learn it but then after mentoring 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.350
I thought I would really like to learn 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.990
more about this subject. 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.900
I keep coming back because of the children. 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.500
They always have that enthusiasm in 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.040
whatever they are going to get out of it.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.640
And some of them have kept in touch with me for some time 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.160
and I’m very, very fond of all of them; 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.826
they’ve been wonderful.
