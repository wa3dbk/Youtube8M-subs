Hey this is Justin with AmericanMuscle.com,
and this is my breakdown of the Ford Racing

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.000
front floor mats fitting all 94-04 Mustangs.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.110
These mats from Ford Racing are for the Mustang
owner who's looking to replace the worn out

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.640
or missing factory floor mats in their SN95,
and may want to save a few bucks by replacing

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.500
only the front two mats.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.840
Appearance wise you can see things are pretty
simple, they went with an all black construction

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.670
that should look nice in just about any interior,
in fact, why don't you go ahead and click

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.660
the link below, and check out our product
page, where you can see these actual floor

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.510
mats in some customer rides, and get a better
idea of how they might look in your own ride.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.769
The cherry on top has to be the Ford Racing
logo, which has been embroidered nicely into

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.809
the bottom corner of each mats.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.179
Unlike other lesser quality floor mats that
you might find in your local parts store these

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:57.069
mats have been custom cut to fit the floor
pan of the SN95 perfectly, and it definitely

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.370
shows in the quality of fitment.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.870
These mats are held in place thanks to the
grommet that's to be used with the factory

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.510
retainer hook, in addition to the heavy duty
textured rubber backing, basically ensuring

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.120
that these mats stay where they should at
all times.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.840
Rounding out the build we're looking at an
extremely durable pile cut carpet, finished

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.540
off with this quality stitched binding, which
should remain looking good for years to come.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.470
Hopefully installing a new set of floor mats
isn't something you should need too much help

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.940
with, however if I can give you one piece
of advice, go ahead and get a vacuum and give

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.580
the carpet a quick once over first, before
you do ultimately install those floor mats.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.660
Either way with or without the vacuum, this
one shouldn't take you any more than 5 minutes.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.000
And remember that these mats, like any other
part from American Muscle, ship for free the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.090
same day as your order.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.340
So if you're looking for a quality set of
OE replacement mats for your SN95, then be

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.570
