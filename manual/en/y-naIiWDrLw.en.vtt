00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.967
Greetings everyone, I am Luke and you are watching “Science of Victory”.

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:10.600
A show dedicated to the “Team Battle” mode.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.967
We continue the theme of reviewing this format’s basics.

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:19.633
Na`Vi’s team member Powerslide, who has won numerous major tournaments, is here to help us.

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.167
Today, we will talk about heavy tanks.

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:33.867
You don’t need to be a pro to know that these tanks are the main body of a team.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.533
They should be the ones to deal the damage to the enemy.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.000
Some of the experienced players may disagree and suggest Med-Tanks and even TDs.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.067
We will talk of those another time; you shouldn’t experiment with your Team Battle lineups until you have a lot of experience.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.900
So, three or four good heavies should make it into your team’s setup.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.367
First; what do we mean by a “good heavy”?

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:01.733
Currently there are fifteen tier 8 heavies in the game.

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:05.767
So which Heavy Tanks are better suited for the Team Battle mode?

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:13.133
Experienced players, including Powerslide, share the opinion that these are the AMX 50 100, the IS-3 and the T32.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.567
Let’s see why.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:15.900
We’ll start with the French tank.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.467
This vehicle is very mobile.

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:20.067
Its mobility even surpasses that of some Meds.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:26.867
Besides this, it’s a tank capable of dealing a massive 1800 points of damage to an opponent in only 12 seconds.

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:28.700
And it’s the only one of the tier!

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.600
The faults of this tank include almost no armour to speak of and the lowest elevation angles of the tier.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.533
However the tank does have a long view range.

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.867
The IS-3 is completely different.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.333
The view range is only 350 meters.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.400
Even though it’s slower than the French, it is still mobile.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.100
Plus it has a weapon named BL-9.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.800
It can deal up to four hundred eighty eight points of damage in one shot, only the American T34 can deal more!

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.367
And of course we must mention the IS-3’s armor.

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:05.167
The armor thickness is not amazing, but the well-known pike nose does its job.

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:08.933
The turret armor is also one of the best in its tier.

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.700
So which tank has the thickest turret?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.100
- The T32!

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.400
Overall this is a pretty balanced tank.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.400
It has a solid 400 meters view range, great elevation angles and a good aim time.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500
It only lacks mobility.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.567
The American is noticeably slower than the others and this can make a difference.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.900
What about the other tanks?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.333
Judging by the parameters alone, you’d want to pick the KV-5.

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:38.000
It has the best durability and the highest damage per minute rating, plus the armor is great,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.000
and the KV-5 is faster than the IS-3 in the numbers!

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.267
It seems to be a dream tank… but that’s an illusion.

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:46.700
The mobility is actually quite low.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.733
This, with low penetration, bad view and radio range makes it not so great.

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:55.533
So overall, this tank isn’t really worth it on all maps.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:03:00.167
Another tank that’s worth mentioning when talking about team battles; is the T34.

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:03.433
It has the best damage per shot and armor penetration.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:06.600
The turret armor is only surpassed by that of the T32.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.933
Plus it has good elevation angles.

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.467
However these are the only pros it has.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:15.533
Because of a slow rate of fire the damage per minute is a bit low.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:17.167
The hull armor is really weak.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:20.900
The tanks mobility is close to the T32, but worse.

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:28.033
Another Soviet heavy – the KV-4 is very similar to its premium comrade.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.433
Great armor and durability but terrible view range.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:40.367
With low mobility and damage per minute you realize that this tank is even worse for the team battle mode than the KV-5.

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:43.933
The Chinese tanks are worth talking about too.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:46.867
Both tanks are pretty similar to the IS-3.

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:51.867
The durability ratings are close but the view range is better as well as the damage per minute.

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:56.100
The 110 and 112 have mobility that’s close to the Soviet heavy.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.467
The top speed is higher, but because of their low power to weight ratio the Chinese tanks’ acceleration is worse than the IS-3s.

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:05.167
As a result, the mobility is too.

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:10.367
Besides, the IS-3 allows you to effectively tank with its turret and that’s quite important for Team Battles.

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:14.533
We’ll not waste time talking about the rest of the tier 8 heavies and sum things up.

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:20.833
Every vehicle is in some aspect superior when comparing to the AMX 50 100, the IS-3 and the T32.

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:23.200
But they are not all-purpose.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.800
For example, the Germans.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.167
They have super-accurate cannons, but lack in terms of armour to mobility ratio.

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:36.700
Of course, many will disagree and some will say that they were devastated by the tanks we saw unfit for team battles at one time or another.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.833
Of course pro players can successfully compete with any tier 8 vehicles.

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:47.400
Some of them use the occasion to level up the vehicles and some use the premium tanks to get extra credits.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.933
Though I don’t advise you to do the same at first.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:53.167
Use the science, the science of victory!

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.267
So get experience playing upgraded vehicles.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:59.700
Master new tactics by playing only the best.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.800
Yes, when you start winning more often you can try to switch your setup with different tanks

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.233
but first try to learn to win with the ones that are recommended by experienced players.

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:13.933
I hope many of you have learnt something new and useful.

00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:16.333
Tell us what you would like us to talk about in the comments.

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:19.133
We do read all of your comments and will try to fulfill your wishes.

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:22.467
By the way; next episode we shall talk about medium tanks.

00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:27.467
So that’s all I have for today; We are Luke and Powerslide, remember to sub to our new channel for more!

00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:29.367
See you!
