00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.230
My two children can play quite nicely, or
at other times, it's World War Three. If they

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.099
both want the same car, or both want the same
thing they're playing with, then it can end

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.459
in disaster.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.920
Sometimes, when I'm naughty, I'll sometimes

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.840
nick my brother's teddies and throw them down
the stairs.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.560
Well, I think my son misbehaves, I think it's
just an attention thing to be perfectly honest.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.939
Misbehaviour in children is normal. They're
having fun, they're learning about their world,

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.000
they're experiencing life. We label it as
misbehaving because we've decided that this

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.100
is how we are supposed to behave in society.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840
A very important one for parents to remember

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.760
is just the age and stage of development of
their child. You have to ask yourself, is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.190
it reasonable what I'm asking them to do?
Are they actually capable of that behaviour

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.250
at this age?

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.660
Sometimes children, who are feeling bad or

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.170
sad, show you by their behaviour how they're
feeling. They don't necessarily have the language

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.560
to put it into words and say, you know, I
felt really sad when my friend pushed me.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.500
So they just misbehave and expect you to guess.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.720
I don't back down. When I say 'no' that means

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.400
'no'. And I think that's really important
and even if they pester you that you keep

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.380
to your decision and then that starts a good
relationship with your children. You can talk

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.380
things through with your child, then.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.020
Talking to them first. If they don't listen,

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.689
send them upstairs. Give them ten minutes
and shout them down again and see if they listen.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.360
I use tactics, such as time out, things like

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.239
that, or positive praise: you know, you've
been so good for not fighting today.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.079
Are you rewarding the child when your child
is being good? You have to catch your child

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.319
being good.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.500
Parents fall into the trap sometimes of just

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.829
not noticing when children behave well. If
they're sitting quietly reading or cooperating

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.940
nicely with their brother, you just don't
think to say anything. You go off and make

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.160
a cup of tea or something. But then, the minute
children misbehave, of course, you come in,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.820
give them loads of attention, but the message
to children is: oh, I get loads of attention

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.960
if I misbehave.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640
If you want your children to respect you,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.640
it's important that you give them respect.
The days have gone when we just expected children

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.950
to do what they're told, or be seen and not
heard. You know, we don't have that kind of

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.170
society anymore. We don't have that kind of
parenting anymore. And you need to listen

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.900
carefully to your child, show them that you
care about what they think, and then they'll

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.819
act like that back to you, but it's giving
respect to get respect.
