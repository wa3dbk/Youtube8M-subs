00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.390
cars dot com auto review

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.920
I'm dave thomas for cars dot com and for 2010 nissan has

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.980
upgraded optional navigation system and
many of its car

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.509
now we have a 370Z here we're gonna show
you how it works

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.320
but it's basically the same for any
power that option now

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.369
I've always liked the navigation system
isn't had I was also the infinities

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.500
I this is just a really nice upgrade
that pop up trade it's a higher

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.630
resolution screen

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.489
nissan says four times um higher
resolution than before

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.590
and you really see that when you go to
the maps and

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.739
you know is you made it out because
street signs actually shows

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.270
3v images ok building thing if you're in
downtown Chicago actually show the Sears

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.800
Tower

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.140
very cool never get any screen

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.399
you have the school's scroll wheel with
directional buttons

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.399
and a number and he's like the back but
not forgetting

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.820
because the previous came from wherever
you are to hear Navalny

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.180
if the wrong funny when I had too far
can go back really easily with just one

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.620
bun

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.080
also the screen is a touchscreen so in
certain areas

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.670
you can if they're using all those buns
just touch it with your finger

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.170
a lot of people for for touch screens
and that's why it's there um

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.590
but when you're driving sometimes is
better not to reach and touch but it

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.960
kinda

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.850
actually a music but that the number
different

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.960
my options including iPod use a USB
connector that's great to get to all the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.180
digital sound quality that you want also
shows call somebody

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.460
artwork don't really see that most are
systems these days

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.590
so obviously higher standard am an FM
radio this satellite radio

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.040
up also this has a hard drive in it to
put in a CD

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.200
you can actually perhaps a nine gigabyte
the music and always be in your car

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.020
so when you take things out so therefore
you also plays DVD's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.649
and it doesn't quite well the quality is
very good and the sound

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.979
not bad go along with all entertainment

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.119
there's also a lot of information packed
into the system as

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.960
stuff like a zag address right guy was
kinda strange there's also a traffic and

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.700
weather which is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.579
really useful for commuters you can see
what nearby construction there as

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.780
on and and he had later accidents for
the traffic on the west side now you get

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.789
the current weather wish

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.290
love the office check outside their car
window and see they also your forecast

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.069
it's kinda cool

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.730
most navigation systems for any brand
will cost you at least two thousand

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.489
dollars the Suns price that movie at
1850

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.400
that's a role to steal for all the
information entertainment options you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.760
get

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.099
it's like a Swiss Army knife navigation
system for more car-related new Skoda

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.250
