The Daisy Stitch! Hi, Guys, I'm Kristen and
Welcome to Studio Knit! It's Knitting Lesson

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.089
Monday and I have recently received a lot
of requests for this stitch. It is the very

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:23.080
pretty, vintage Daisy Knitting pattern perfect
for summer time. I love how the rows, they

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.750
knit up with a bit of thickness and the alternating
rows of daisy flowers are just so cute and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.320
happy. This knit stitch would make a great
baby blanket. What other projects do you think

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.579
you would like to knit up with the Daisy Stitch?
Let me know in the comments below! We begin

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:53.420
by casting on in multiples of four stitches,
plus one. So here in my example I have twelve

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:02.059
plus one stitch for thirteen. On row one,
we simply knit the entire row. Doesn't get

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:14.860
much easier than that. Once you're near the
end of Row One, it's time to start row two.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.380
We begin with one knit stitch. Now, we're
going to be bringing our yarn around to the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.020
front as if to purl which we will be. We're
going to purl three together. So, we put our

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:43.210
needle in to three stitches. Right like that.
And then we take our yarn, we wrap it around,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.850
counter-clockwise as if to purl, and we are
NOT going to take those stitches off the left

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.340
needle. We're going to keep them right there.
So we have one stitch created. Now we're going

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.229
to create our second stitch by a yarn over.
Now this yarn over also goes counter-clockwise,

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.170
so that's the second stitch right there, okay,
great. Now we're just going to finish up the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:22.239
Daisy Stitch. We are going to insert our right
needle again into those three stitches exactly

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:32.430
the same as we did we go ahead wrap it around
counter-clockwise, purl through, and now we

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:42.860
are able to take those three stitches on our
left needle off. And we're done! So, you'll

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.180
see, we have created three stitches of the
daisy stitch on our right needle. Now, we

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.240
just knit one,&nbsp;very simple. Let's do it one
more time together. So, we're going to put

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.599
our yarn in front and we are going to take
our needle and put it through the front of

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:14.840
those three stitches on our left. Okay, we
take our yarn, wrap it around counter-clockwise,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.200
and we purl it through on our right needle.
Now, we keep those stitches on the left needle.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.450
They stay right there. Okay, so now we're
going to just do one more yarn over counter-clockwise

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.409
like that, that's our second stitch, again
we put our right needle into the front of

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:44.590
those three stitches, we purl and we are now
able to take those stitches off the left needle.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.550
Yay! We've done it. So, this is what it looks
like when you're done with your series. You

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.340
have the first knit stitch, then the three,
the one, the three, and the final knit stitch.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.989
Awesome! Okay, so row three, I'm changing
it to the color white. You don't need to change

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:10.400
yarn colors at all. Now, row three, very simple,
you simply knit all the way across the row.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.489
And while you're knitting this row, you may
want to take your time because we are knitting

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:25.830
those yarn overs. Okay, now row four is really
a repeat of row two, except the daisies will

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.379
be alternating so we're going to do Knit One,
Purl One, and then we start our series with

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:41.860
knit one, and we are going to do the Daisy
Stitch. So, you know the drill. We are going

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.839
to put our yarn in front and this might even
be a little bit easier with the white yarn

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:55.370
we go ahead and we are going to purl three
together right here. Okay, now remember we

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:06.080
yarn over counter clockwise, we put our needle
right back into those three stitches, you

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.580
purl the stitch, there it is on our right
needle, we get to take them off our left needle.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.270
Yay! And then we knit one. Awesome, okay now
do this series all the way down the row until

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:26.010
you get to the end and at the end you're just
going to do an extra purl one knit one. And

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.300
here's what it looks like. Now, the Daisies
don't look very defined. They look better

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.699
once you do that next all knit row, so here's
what it looks like so we can see our pretty

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:43.999
white daisies. And so now, you just continue
knitting all the way the same series of four

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:50.569
rows until your piece is the length you desire.
I hope you are inspired to give the DAISY

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:56.800
STITCH a try. For the written pattern, I have
added a link for more information on my website

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.999
