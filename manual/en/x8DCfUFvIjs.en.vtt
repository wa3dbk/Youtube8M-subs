Hi, this is Melody. On behalf of Expert Village,
I'm go to fold a blue jean jacket for you

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.940
in this segment. First, I would button it.
It doesn't have to be every button. Just pick

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.030
a button that will hold it together. If the
bottom has a detail, some kind of, like this

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:34.430
one is an "A" cut, I'm going to go ahead and
button it one button down. One up here. And,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.800
one down here. This way, it will keep the
bottom together, too. When I go to fold it,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.011
it would be nice if it would just stay together.
Okay, there's that one. And, we'll do one

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:52.180
up here. I personally don't have the patience
to unbutton some of these things when I go

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.469
to put them on. I do it, but I have to make
a lot of noise about it. So, sometimes I'd

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:07.030
just rather button one button or two. Okay,
first off, you find the shoulders. I found

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.170
the seam for the shoulders right here, and
I lay the garment down. I pull collars up.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.759
Some people don't do this, but I do. You can
also fold things with the collars like this.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:34.550
Just like a button up shirt. But, I am going
to do it this way for this particular folding.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:47.159
Alright, I'm trying to get it as flat as possible
in all directions so I can see what we have

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.299
here. And, there are different ways to fold
this. You can, I'm going to flip it over here,

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:10.160
fold it on the back. Make it a little bit
of a strip right here. All that does is just

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.220
make it a neater package when you're finished.
This way, the front where all the buttons

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.730
are won't get jammed up in a big wrinkle,
big creases in the very front. It's a lot

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.530
easier to wear creases on your shoulder, in
the back, when you put your body in there,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:40.640
it'll come out, than in the front. So, we
just flip those little sleeves up at the cuff.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:50.220
Keep it all flat. And, put the tail, essentially,
up to the collar. Flip it over. Here's the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.860
front of your garment. Just sort of straighten
it out a little bit. There you go. Depending

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.830
on what you're doing, you could fold it a
different way, but for this purpose there

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.980
we are, our finished garment. In the next
segment, I'll be folding another piece of

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.840
clothing for you.
