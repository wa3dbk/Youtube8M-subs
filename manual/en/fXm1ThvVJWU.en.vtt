00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.919
the a

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.019
what's going on is remotely guild which
the here

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.469
is Muslim years bro areas again since
2001 you and talk about

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.289
another one only three fever pics 181

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.410
Dead Island 2, Dead Island 2, Dead Island 2, Dead Island 2, Dead Island 2, Dead Island 2, 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.320
need to know

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.599
I don't want to be the first thing is
you review over something I personally

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.560
won't buy

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.019
were something that I won't are having
played in the past

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.300
so I don't want to give your view on
something I haven't already tried or

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.740
don't think there will be

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.830
this is so awesome I pinion so with that
being said I wanna go ahead in talking

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.520
about one in the winners in my opinion
for Xbox 360

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.230
experts Mon PlayStation 3 and
PlayStation 4

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.560
now these games can have a little bit of
a shock because the ritual de 99 was not

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.970
really they agree to the game

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.780
it was really repetitive you got 091 you
killed some zombies you get some more GB

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.750
you don't you killed some are zombies
you left the island

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.930
in the mucous rinsed and repeated all
over again so with that being said

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.380
let's go ahead and talk about did Island
to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.500
the second on the series so my original
opinion on this was a scheme would scan

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.520
repair live again bonds

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.630
there is a couple things on here that I
was looking forward to that we're not

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.400
gonna raise on then i won

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.010
the game was visually beary beary great

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.400
the game it won't like it also had a
comedic value in it which

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.060
I mean if you're killing zombies I guess
you can in that refreshing feel that you

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.510
know

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.430
you could take it less serious than
actual call duty zombies game or

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.610
something along those lines

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.150
but you know in a middle the game that
you're trying to kill the entire world

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.830
population zombies

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.610
I don't think I necessarily want to see
you know wat here's one example though

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.430
the used inside the three trailer

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.760
be in the running over is army with the
band began ala the van and pick

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.770
double-leg

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.450
with that shoe and they said well that
sure is a nice kicks:

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.820
as most people would call it as a joke
that makes sure that people thought it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.420
was funny because they're referring to
the shoes that on the trailer was

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.929
actually zombies part

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.450
in a league that was torn off and
tissues at the Bonham

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.510
so I could see the hell they're trying
to make it a late nap the moon center

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.800
being a serious game

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.000
but none the last there's a lot of other
things that are in this game there

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.360
I really im looking forward to mica said
this is probably in the top four or five

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.880
out only three pics so it's not all bad

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.670
so here's my selling point in this game
Aaron Paul the personal plea Jesse in

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.800
Breaking Bad

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.690
is one of the main characters voice over
and you're going to be able to destroy

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.569
the world's

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.500
zombie population with nonetheless and
Paul from Breaking Bad

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.940
now day is pretty much a sign point for
me Aaron Paul

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.650
ABS me is probably will though cause
personalities that has ever happened in

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.050
the last five or six years

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.410
so was me being a huge Aaron Paul
Breaking Bad fan

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.080
I'm definitely get this game just
because I wanna kill zombies are there

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.920
paul because that sounds like an amazing
opportunity for me

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.080
a couple good things about this game
also the blind is very realistic II do

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.390
would actually be

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.860
the blood splatter is no longer you hit
somebody inspires all the walls ceiling

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.790
all over the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.150
outsider in EMBO once or something like
that the trailer it's definitely more

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.690
realistic them when he was previously

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.090
the weapons official in here yet

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.349
and they could be a little better but I
think that they're hiding the weapons

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.840
Intel further down the line

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.620
in the game be deaf we show that you
have vehicles in here so you're gonna

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.330
have to be in the you're going to be
able to drive around there's no longer

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.700
just jeeps on your

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.480
which is pretty good because I get tired
to dream the same jeep over and over

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.950
again

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.650
maybe there's some customization here
maybe you can get a tank maybe you guys

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.810
can get some Jeep see gays maybe you'll
be a sports cars

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.269
in drive around in run over zombies
while you

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.360
injure crew ran around baseball bats and
so these vehicles

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.819
maybe champ are some zombies hands with
some these bands and salty could be

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.930
driving around with

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.220
but overall gays this game I'm gonna go
Henry

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.950
9.5 and 10 I am very high expectations
for his game and I think it's going to

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.910
be one of those games that

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.120
I'm gonna be able to sit there in a joy
for hours on end

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.150
I guess said I didn't really like the
original Dead Island just because there

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.100
was a repetitive

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.380
but I see that they're making progress
in there trying to do stamps

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.760
away from that same old same old
repetitive steps

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.930
I guess again on my own you left eye on
you can rely on you ever owned in

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.169
all along the way you're killing zombies
are in words that burp so

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.800
stupid on the game that they would just
fall you in you could use the same

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.490
pattern 90 percent the time

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.830
Iran in circles and circles and they can
never get to you

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.260
hopefully they saw that on this game you
know I would be kinda interesting in the

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.979
zombies

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.130
if you're running passer like more be
calming incall duties

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.970
zombies trains maybe you know you can
call to see the train also then there

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.800
you know switch half-and-half

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.930
in you have one zombie horde going 10
weighing her room you have one going one

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.360
direction and other going opposite
direction

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.110
in that's kinda gunnery one design
vectors me you know it looks like

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.360
there's a lot more customization there's
been a lot more thought process

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.120
to building this game buddy with years
I'm curious to hear what you said to say

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.599
did you guys enjoy the trailer for did

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.210
I'll into guessing you're gonna be
picking up this game I'm inner-city here

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.849
with two years the disabled in with gays
men Air Forces monthly bills each team

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:30.400
an amount
