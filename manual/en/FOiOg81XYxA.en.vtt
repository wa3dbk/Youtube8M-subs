Build Your Short-term Emergency Savings

00:00:18.692 --> 00:00:22.692
It’s not too difficult to imagine a scenario 
 where you might need access to a

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.429
significant amount of money in a short period of time. 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.680
You start to smell gas from your old stove. 

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:30.816
Your little soccer player gets a shot in the 
 face and needs emergency dental surgery. 

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:35.753
A tree falls on your garage and you need to meet a deductible.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.339
Where will you turn for this infusion of cash?

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.893
Your short-term emergency savings.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.180
Establishing an emergency savings is simple and it’s 
 something you can do starting right now.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.067
Think of your expenses as three mugs. 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.900
The first mug is current liabilities, the stuff you owe. 

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:57.058
You need to put money here or your mortgage company, your credit cards, 

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:01.096
your utilities pester you and eventually ruin your credit score. 

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:04.068
You can’t miss this one. They send you notices every month.

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:07.109
Now the second mug is long-term savings.

00:01:07.663 --> 00:01:10.663
It’s hard to watch a football game, read 
 a magazine or surf the internet 

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:17.446
without seeing an advertisement reminding you of your retirement 
 years or your children’s college costs. 

00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:21.751
And, quite frankly, a lot of people do 
 pretty well putting a little money here.

00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:27.288
Now this third mug - the unloved mug - is the simplest.

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:34.618
It is short-term emergency savings. In it should be three 
 to six months of essential living expenses for emergencies.

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:40.500
It should not be locked up in long-term 
 investments and it should be easily accessible

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:45.170
and in a place that won’t penalize you for early withdrawal. 

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:51.620
A health issue, unemployment, a major appliance decides its time 
 to become a heavy piece of garbage, 

00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:57.030
these things happen. And that’s when your savings come in handy. 

00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:01.860
While you wait for your dishwasher to quit, 
 your savings are also earning you interest.

00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:04.740
Then you can buy what you need without finance charges.

00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:11.300
And, maybe more importantly, is the peace of mind this buffer buys you.

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:18.180
Knowing you are not a phone call or an overflowing dishwasher away 
 from debt will help you sleep better at night. 

00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:22.410
Don’t forget the short-term emergency savings mug. 

00:02:24.428 --> 00:02:27.430
Even if it’s just a little at a 
 time, pay yourself first and save. 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.900
Save money, save brain cells, save heartache.
