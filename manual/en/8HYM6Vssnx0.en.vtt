Developer diaries

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Renewed gameplay

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This project required that we put our best men on the design of the new graphics and control schemes.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We faced a difficult task. We didn’t just want a slight improvement; we wanted to make a major leap ahead in the quality of the gameplay experience.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Improved graphics

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The graphics have come quite a long way already.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Nearly every aspect of the visuals have been remade from scratch at this point.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The two major points we focused on for the graphics were,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the airplanes themselves and an overarching element that brought it all together; making things appear more unified.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
One of the major additions is the work we’ve done with the camera system.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The goal is to allow for the cameras to show off the beautiful designs of the planes during gameplay while still remaining functional enough for combat.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
At the same time, we’re hoping it amplifies the depth of the experience.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Currently, you can see that some very advanced shaders are used for the planes.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Because of this, you can distinguish different types of metal which reflect light in different ways.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The planes that are supposed to be painted will actually appear to have been coated in paint.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Planes that are not-painted are going to have that bright metallic finish.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We want our players to feel like they’re flying.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
From history.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Fabric and wood were used in the manufacturing of the first aircraft. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
These light materials were fundamental building blocks of aircraft hulls for a long time.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
During World War I, German engineers succeeded in building an aircraft comprised of metal.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The breakthrough is credited to German metallurgist Alfred Wilm, who invented the duralumin alloy.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The aircraft became lighter, but a new problem appeared: metal corrosion. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It was solved by the 1920s in the United States. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Duralumin was covered with a thin layer of pure aluminum, preventing corrosion.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Aircraft built of metal completely pushed wooden designs out of the picture.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The players will be able to feel the flight is more realistic, more dynamic and more exciting that will help them immerse themselves into battles of these dangerous steel birds.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
New game controls

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Another feature, which we’ve been working on for recent months, is the control system.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We knew that we had certain problems. First off, we had to make the control system more friendly to people that haven’t played World of Warplanes before and to people 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that just want to play and have fun immediately.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Specially trained people have made a lot of iterations and different prototypes. We hadn’t even shown all of our attempts during alpha or beta testing.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
There has been an enormous amount of testing done. We’ve done a lot of experiments since we want to find the best of all possible control systems and flight physics.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
From history.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The first "balancing" control system for aircraft was pioneered by German engineer Otto Lilienthal. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The glider was adjusted by changing the pilot's body position. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
His weight was about 75% of the total weight of the aircraft. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Otto`s first “flight” was performed with his knees pulled up.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
These simple controls were eventually replaced with mechanical controls

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Elevators eventually added a rudder, but roll was originally achieved by tilting the wings. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Ailerons appeared later.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
All the elements of a glider were controlled by the pilot's muscle strength through a system of levers and rods.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
An increase in speed and size of combat aircraft necessitated the advancement of a more complex control system. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
A pilot's physical capabilities were supplemented with various amplifiers.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Different systems appeared, helping the pilot at critical moments, such as an "automatic withdrawal from a dive" mechanism.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
This led to creating the Automatic controls system, which made the whole piloting process much easier. 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
However, any control system still entirely relies on the manual input of the pilot. It is hinging upon their skill, experience, and intuition.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
In the current build there's a predictive feature between the player and the flight interface. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
This control mechanic keeps track of all the little things that a very experienced pilot would be paying attention to allowing the player to be able to pull of complex 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
aerobatic maneuvers with relative ease.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The new control system consists of two modes: Combat and Assault.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Their main differences are the autopilot behavior and the camera setup that shows the battlefield and the plane itself.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The combat mode allows for the most versatile control. The plane will do barrel rolls, loops, etcetera all responding to the player’s input.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
It provides a good view, and a solid responsive flight feel. It is designed for rapid, but precise maneuvers.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Combat mode makes doing aerobatics possible by simplifying the input required from the pilot; without taking away from the overall control.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
When switching to assault mode, the view point and the controls will shift to emphasize another aspect of the gameplay.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The camera switches to a view under the planes hull, providing a much needed perspective shift when making a run for ground targets. It makes the terrain and those 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
targets much easier to distinguish.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Assault mode is specially designed for low altitude flight and zeroing in with rockets, bombs, and cannons. It’s almost an entirely different game using this mode.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
This feature provides a slightly different feel for the pilot assistance AI. It helps to steer the aircraft more gently.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We want the player to be focusing on hitting the targets more than making the subtle adjustments that would be necessary in a real aircraft. As the player you’re the pilot, bomber, and gunner.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The flight controls are now more elegant than they were before. It’s fundamentally changed the overall feel for plane control; whether you’re chasing an enemy or flying 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.000
low and slow to take out a ground target.
