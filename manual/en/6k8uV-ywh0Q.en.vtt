00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.320
If you're using a computer,
then you've probably

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.120
customized it just for you.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.500
There are probably specific
application configurations,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.960
you might have documents
that you have

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.240
stored on your system.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.590
Maybe there are specialized
bookmarks that you've created

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.870
onto your computer.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.400
And if you move from one
computer to another, you don't

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.860
want to lose those.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.530
And we've gone through videos
before where we've described

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.120
the process of doing upgrades,
where you put in an

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.320
installation disk and it simply
upgrades a system all

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.320
in one place.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.930
But sometimes you don't
have that option.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.660
For instance, if you want to go
from Windows XP and jump to

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.080
Windows 7, there's no upgrade
between those two.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.370
So you have to find some way to
migrate that data between

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.950
Windows XP and somehow get
it into Windows 7.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.480
There may also be a time
where you're not

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.820
upgrading the same computer.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.450
Maybe you're changing to
a brand new system.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.800
So in that case, you can't
really upgrade the operating

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.690
system, either.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.090
You need to move everything to
a brand new computer itself.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.420
And if you run into those
situations, you might want to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.610
use some of those migration
tools that are built into

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.800
Microsoft Windows.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.460
If you're migrating from one
physical computer to another

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.750
physical computer, you can
do what's called a

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.985
side-by-side migration.

00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:14.640
You've got both computers there,
they're turned on at

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.170
exactly the same time.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.430
You can connect them with a
specialized transfer cable so

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.380
you can send information between
the two, and it will

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.716
simply move information from
one computer to another.

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:28.990
Another type of migration is
called a wipe-and-load, and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.780
that's where you are taking
all of the data on that

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.200
computer and you're moving and
backing it up to another

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.290
storage device.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.930
Maybe you've got an external
hard drive, or maybe you're

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.540
backing it up to another device
over the network,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.970
because you're going to
delete everything

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.320
that's on this computer.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.030
You're going to install the new
operating system, and then

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.160
you're going to transfer

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.130
everything back to the computer.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.770
Now fortunately, there are
utilities that will allow you

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.230
to do this, so you don't have
to remember where all the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.320
files were located, or what type
of configurations that

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.340
you need to set up on the system
once you get the new

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.870
operating system installed.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.230
You simply use this built-in
migration tool, and it will

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.630
take care of all of those
details for you.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.610
One of the very early migration
tools in the Windows

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.520
operating system was
called the File and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.320
Settings Transfer Wizard.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.500
That's when you needed to
do a migration to get

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.230
into Windows XP.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.790
So if you were running Windows
95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.090
Windows ME, Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 2000, previous

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.200
versions or editions of Windows
XP and Server 2003,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.240
you could migrate all of those
into Windows XP using this

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240
File and Settings
Transfer Wizard.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.190
This migration tool has been
updated, so if you're using

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.920
newer operating systems,
you'll probably see the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.530
Windows Easy Transfer instead.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.440
If you're already running
Windows XP, or Windows Vista,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.150
or Windows 7, and you want to
migrate from any one of those

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.670
to a newer version, and perhaps
even to older versions

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.650
as well, you can use Windows
Easy Transfer.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.540
And you can see here, you can
transfer user accounts,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.410
documents, music, pictures,
email, internet favorites,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.340
videos, and more, all by using
this built-in utility.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.320
We can use this to do
side-by-side migrations where

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.800
we have two computers that
we're connecting with a

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.330
transfer cable, or we can
do wipe-and-load.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.100
This will take all of the data
and move it off to an external

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.990
storage device, and then you
can use the same utility to

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.020
get all that information
brought into the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.720
new operating system.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.330
If you're in a larger
organization, you may need a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.240
way to automate this process.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.290
You don't have time to go to
everyone's computer and click

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.130
in the graphical interface and
step through the process.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.860
Instead, you might
want to script

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.320
this, or have it automated.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.940
And you can do that with a tool
that Microsoft provides,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.150
called the User State
Migration tool.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.160
And this will also allow you
to migrate from one Windows

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.230
version to another.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.270
For instance, I can move from
Windows XP to Windows 7.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.340
There's a transfer
that you can't do

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.920
through a normal upgrade.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.200
You can migrate from Windows
Vista to Windows 7, Windows 7

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.940
to Windows 8.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.150
You can also go from Windows
8 back to Windows 7

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.160
if you'd like to.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.280
This is included with something
called the Windows

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.010
Automated Installation Kit.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.940
So you can look for AIK to be
able to find the User State

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.149
Migration tool.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.180
And this is scalable to
use across your entire

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.230
organization.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.440
Because it's a command line
option, makes it very, very

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.090
easy to deploy this and have
many people using it

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.870
simultaneously.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.970
Because this is all command
line driven, with the User

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.830
State Migration tool, there are
a lot of different options

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.980
available, and it's a two-step
process to be able to perform

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.340
these migrations.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.920
The first step is to do
something called a ScanState,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.580
which is going to take all of
your data, and it's going to

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.915
compile it all together and
store that somewhere else, so

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:53.120
that you have to be running as
an elevated prompt in Windows

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.010
Vista and Windows 7, or as a
local administrator if you're

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.490
in Windows XP.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.020
Once that information has been
scanned and stored elsewhere,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.540
you can then load it into the
new operating system.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.640
The second step would be to
perform a LoadState, where

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.130
we're taking all of that profile
information that we've

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.390
saved elsewhere, and we're
loading it into our new

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.760
operating system.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.190
So by combining this capability
of using ScanState

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.970
and LoadState, this allows us to
take all of the migrations

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.460
that we need to perform, we can
do it all at the command

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.230
line and automate the entire
process, all by using the User

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.000
State Migration tool.
