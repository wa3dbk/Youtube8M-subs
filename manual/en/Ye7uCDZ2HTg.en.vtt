I'm Tim Gipson and I am talking to you about
how to deep clean your carpets. Now any cleaning

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.119
starts first with doing a thorough vacuuming
of the room that you are doing. Now if you

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.869
are dealing with some particular odors from
your carpet what you may want to consider

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:22.440
is taking baking soda and spreading it over
your carpet and actually taking a broom and

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.749
working that baking soda down into your carpet
and then again come back with your vacuum

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.530
and do a thorough vacuuming so the baking
soda will serve to predeodorize anything that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.600
you are doing. Now in order to achieve some
good deep cleaning the next thing we are going

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.030
to use after we have vacuumed the carpet very
thoroughly is to use a steam cleaning type

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.870
of system. Now you can either have this done
commercially or in most cases you can either

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.760
purchase a steam cleaner to use in your home
or you can rent a good steam cleaner. This

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.410
particular model in most of your steam cleaners
will use hot tap water in a reservoir that

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.260
is held up here and a detergent that is particularly
formulated for steam cleaning. Now it is very

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.560
important that whatever model you use you
want to make sure that you use the steam cleaning

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.450
detergent that is designed for that particular
model. From that we will simply follow your

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.810
manufacturer's instructions or your rental
unit's instructions and the most important

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.600
thing that you want to remember when you are
deep cleaning is that when you are vacuuming

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.409
you might use vigorous quicker motions to
vacuum because you have an agitator and that

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.150
doesn't hurt because it will actually kick
up the soil but when you are deep cleaning

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:50.141
or steam cleaning you want to make sure that
you use slow and steady strokes so that it

00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:56.450
has time for that solution to penetrate down
and then to be pulled up. If you go too fast

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.840
with your steam cleaner you an actually leave
residual cleaning solution down in your carpet

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.240
which can actually cause your carpet some
problems down the road. So I'm Tim Gipson

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.869
with some tips on how to deep clean your carpet.
