00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.566
In the previous movie, we used a shrink wrap 
deformer

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:13.532
to quickly shape the sleeve and torso sections of 
our in-progress jacket mesh.

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:21.499
In this movie, we’ll use the Modeling Toolkit’s Quad 
Draw tool to address the more delicate areas

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.033
like the shoulder and collar.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.033
Make sure to set the current project to the 
provided scene folder,

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.399
then open the file "01-
Jacket_modeling_part2_start.mb".

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.100
As we established at the end of part 1,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.866
using a shrink wrap deformer to create the upper 
portion of this jacket

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.299
would require a lot of adjustments due to its 
complex shape.

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:48.466
Instead, let’s create this section using the Quad 
Draw tool found in the Modeling Toolkit.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.266
This tool allows you to manually plot points which 
can then be filled in to create quads.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.900
Before you begin, go to Face selection mode and 
delete the right side of the jacket’s bottom section.  

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.800
We’ll work on the left side for now and mirror the 
results over at the end.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.599
Now open the Modeling Toolkit and select the 
Quad Draw tool.

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:19.432
We can either use the Quad Draw tool to create 
new meshes or append polys to an existing one.  

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.466
Since the sleeve and torso are already separate 
meshes,

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.332
we'll create another new mesh for the shoulder 
and combine them all later.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.700
By default, this tool creates quads snapped to the 
current view’s grid. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.900
However, here we would rather they snap to the 
body so as to conform to its shape,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.966
like the shrink wrap deformer in part 1.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:46.366
To that end, right-click the emma_body_GEO 
mesh and select Make Live,

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.132
or use the Make Live button.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.466
This tells Maya to restrict our quad drawing to 
that geometry.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:01.599
Click the body mesh at a point roughly centered 
and close to where the upper jacket mesh ends.  

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.166
You don’t have to be exact at this point as we’ll 
be making adjustments later.

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:08.333
Maya plots a single green dot.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.000
Plot three more dots in a quad, keeping the same 
size as the other quads on the jacket mesh.

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:19.432
You can readjust the position of a dot by simply 
dragging it.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.400
With four dots plotted, hold Shift inside them to 
preview the resulting quad.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.100
Shift+click to create it.

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:35.666
If you tumble around the model, you can see that 
the quad indeed conforms to the body’s surface.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:43.733
To attach a second quad to it, plot two more dots 
beside it, then Shift + click to fill in the next quad.

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:47.832
Continue this process of building additional quads 

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.666
in order to cover the upper portion of the jacket 
mesh.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.166
Don’t forget to use the topology of the sleeve and 
bottom jacket meshes

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.199
as reference as you plot your dots.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:04.032
Just like moving the individual plotted dots before 
filling in a quad,

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.366
you can also move previously created vertices 
by dragging them.

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:28.799
When you’re done, exit the Quad Draw tool and 
turn off Live Mode.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.166
Select the shoulder geometry and soften the 
mesh edges.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.033
At this point we have three separate meshes for 
our jacket,

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.899
which we’d now like to merge into one.

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:46.899
To start, let’s first scale up the shoulder and collar 
area

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.366
so it roughly falls in line with the sleeve and torso 
we created in the previous movie.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:56.833
Select the shoulder mesh and go to Edit Mesh &gt; 
Transform.

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:02.332
This allows you to transform all the components 
of a selected mesh simultaneously.

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:09.666
In the polyMoveVertex input node, set Local 
Translate Z to 1.5

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.432
to push the mesh's vertices out.

00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:24.199
With that done, select the shoulder, sleeve, and 
torso meshes.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.633
In the Modeling Toolkit, under the Mesh section, 
click Combine.

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.466
Maya unites the meshes together.

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:34.866
Delete the mesh’s history to keep the scene 
clean.

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:40.199
Now although we’ve combined the different 
jacket sections,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.466
we still need to “sew” them together by merging 
their components.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.733
In the Modeling Toolkit, select the Target Weld tool.

00:04:47.733 --> 00:04:50.599
This tool allows you to merge one component to 
another.

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:56.133
Start by merging the top and bottom portions of 
the jacket together.

00:04:56.133 --> 00:05:00.599
Highlight this vertex on one mesh, then drag it to 
the closest vertex on the other.  

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:04.866
Maya merges them according to the Target Weld 
settings,

00:05:04.866 --> 00:05:07.566
which is currently set to merge at that target 
location.

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:12.666
Continue this process by merging corresponding 
vertices together.

00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:26.532
When you’re finished, you should end up with a 
single mesh that looks like this.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.400
Now before mirroring the geometry, we should do 
a little bit of cleanup.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:36.032
First soften all the edges where we connected 
the three meshes.

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:47.899
Next, if you switch to the front view

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.166
you'll notice that not all the vertices along the axis 
of symmetry are aligned perfectly.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.966
We’ll use snapping to fix this.

00:05:56.933 --> 00:06:02.466
Let’s first adjust the jacket’s back section. Select 
all its vertices along the line of symmetry.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:11.766
In the Move Tool settings, turn off “Retain 
component spacing”

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:16.432
to make sure that the vertices’ snap is absolute 
and not preserving a relative  offset.

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:21.499
Now switch back to the front view.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.266
Hold the X key to temporarily activate grid 
snapping and in world space,

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:29.199
drag the Move Tool’s X manipulator.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.033
Maya realigns all the vertices so they line up in 
the X axis.

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:39.133
With the X key still held, translate them to their 
symmetry line on the X axis.  

00:06:44.533 --> 00:06:49.866
We could repeat this for the jacket‘s front section, 
but instead let’s open it up like it’s unzipped. 

00:06:49.866 --> 00:06:53.866
Delete the first column of faces, then use the 
same grid snapping method

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:56.532
to line up the vertices on the next column over.

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:04.432
Now we can mirror the mesh to create the full 
jacket.  

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:10.333
Select the mesh and go to the Mesh &gt; Mirror 
Geometry Options window.

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:14.799
Make sure you’re mirroring in the –X direction, 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.666
and that you are merging vertices with the 
original.  Click Mirror.

00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:23.199
Maya mirrors the mesh across the Z axis,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.766
merging all appropriate components in the 
process.

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:29.799
If you notice any offset mirroring between 
vertices,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.466
you can fix it using the Merge Threshold attribute.

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:37.733
This completes the basic mesh, but there's still 
more work to be done.

00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:43.399
In the next movie, we'll focus on fine tuning the 
shape and topology of our mesh

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.400
using the tools in the Modeling Toolkit.
