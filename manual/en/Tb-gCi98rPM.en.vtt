00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.636
Grab your board!

00:00:02.136 --> 00:00:02.656
Yes!

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.440
YEAH!

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.600
Today, we surprise our best friends Jard and Bram

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.200
by showing them our new studio.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.940
They don't know about anything yet.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.900
Welcome!

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Do you know the alarm code?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.140
Guys, this is our studio.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.634
Welcome to the Cinemates studio!

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.020
Nice, dude.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.660
This is so cool.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.400
We've been working for weeks,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.380
to fix this whole place up.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.260
This looks great.

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:19.894
We already have WiFi, internet, everything.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.200
Bram, did you know about this yet?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.100
I didn't, this is all new to me.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.280
Next saturday is moving day guys.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.660
Look at this awesome fridge.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.060
I'd rather call this a house.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300
It's like 5000 square feet.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.580
You could almost call this a mansion.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.140
I've decided to come and live here.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.960
Because we couldn't really start working yet,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.300
we decided to do something that young guys do -

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.960
Jesus Peter, clean up your lollipops for once.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.914
Are we really the type of friends that find this funny?

00:01:58.914 --> 00:01:59.554
- having fun.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.420
We have to test our Cinemates pennyboards

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.580
to make sure they actually work properly.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.320
So we'll attach our pennyboards to a car...

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.900
Bram, your car has a hitch right?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.400
Yep.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.820
[24 HOURS EARLIER] Does your car have a hitch?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.080
...My dad's car has one.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.534
Now we just need a rope,

00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:21.854
and some skateboards.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.660
Let's do this.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.775
Cinemates team, GO!

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.420
I mean, now we have the space...

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.760
Why not use it?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.640
What if we just grab the rope and ride around?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.180
Like with horses?

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.660
That's a LOT faster than I expected.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.027
Again!

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.860
Faster, faster!

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.100
Keep running!

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.240
Hold the rope!

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.540
The hat only makes this better.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.892
Right?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.860
Pull him through the doorway!

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.320
Watch out for the car!

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.500
See ya!

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.740
It's time to get the car.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.740
Let's start off slow okay?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.300
Back up.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.760
Look, I'm pulling the car.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.220
Let's do this.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.120
Faster, Bram!

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.800
Grab your board,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.540
grab your board!

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.940
Yes!

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.660
Yes!

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.020
Yeees!

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.960
Kelvin?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.160
This is Beau.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.380
Hi, nice to meet you.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.500
Beau's my sister...

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.940
and she really wants to take a picture with you.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.560
Thanks.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.650
You're welcome...

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.410
and have fun!

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.060
The next morning we got up extra early,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.770
to go to the Westergasfabriek.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.320
We met up with some YouTubers 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.220
for something very special.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.120
Alright, let's go.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.940
Do you want to know what this location's for?

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.220
Watch the next episode!

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.400

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.300
