00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.900
I seemed to have been quite intensive.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Lifting my eyes up to the clock from the reference book, 
 it got to be one o'clock in the morning.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.400
Test tomorrow morning.

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:20.403
Cut out around here, I'll go to bed soon...

00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:28.124
I would close the curtains, approached the window, and there was a figure below.

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:32.288
(Window)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.800
Figure was as small as child, 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
looked up at my room ...It seemed like that.

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:55.699
But, in this late night, how could it be child outside alone...

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.700
Maybe, there are parents out of sight from me.

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:08.295
While I, disturbing further tests tomorrow.

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:11.803
I stopped care of that and closed the curtains.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:19.765
Since the sound of something hitting the window, I woke up.

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:22.475
Dark in my room.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.200
Looking at the clock, it had not yet passed only two hours from sleeping.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
What would be the sound...

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:40.560
Perhaps, it was large drops of rain began to come down ...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.700
However, even getting ears closer, I couldn't heard the sound of the rain.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.800
Out from the bed, I tried to open curtain, the street was not wet.

00:01:57.852 --> 00:01:59.990
It didn’t look like a rain apparently.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.100
I wonder what the sound was exactly.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.500
When thinking so, tried to close the curtains, something appeared in my eyes. 

00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:22.610
Trace of small hand.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.100
Trace of the hand such as children, was just in the window glass.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Look closely,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.800
even here, is also here, here, too, also here, here, too.

00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:48.880
Why such a place ...

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:56.140
I looked carefully with my face closer, found something.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.500
Rather than out of the window, 

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:06.080
hand trace is on the side in.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.100
Window glass in the dark, my room was reflected.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.800
I found the figure of a girl standing behind me…
