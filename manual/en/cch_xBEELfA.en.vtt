00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.730
Andromeda vs. the Milky Way: Astronomers Predict a Titanic Collision 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.590
- presented by Science@NASA

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.610
Imagine having a galaxy fall on your head-

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.090
and you survive the experience.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.560
NASA astronomers say 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.530
that's exactly what's going to happen to our Milky Way Galaxy

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.660
approximately 4 billion years from now. 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.700
New data from the Hubble Space Telescope 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.630
confirm that the Milky Way is on a collision course 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.900
with the great Andromeda Galaxy.  

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.310
When the mashup occurs, say researchers, 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.230
it's likely the sun will be flung into a new region of our galaxy, 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
but Earth and the solar system are in no danger of being destroyed.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.020
'After nearly a century of speculation 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.080
about the future destiny of Andromeda and our Milky Way, 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.260
we at last have a clear picture of how events will unfold 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.630
over the coming billions of years,' 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.050
says Sangmo Tony Sohn 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.830
of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.340
Astronomers have long known that Andromeda 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.130
and the Milky Way were converging, 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.780
drawn together by their mutual pull of gravity 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.100
and an invisible dark matter halo that surrounds them both. 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.780
But no one knew whether the far-future encounter would be a near miss, 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.050
a glancing blow, or a head-on smashup. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.410
It all depends on the amount of Andromeda's sideways motion.  

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.950
A lot of sideways motion 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.250
would allow Andromeda to sail wide of the Milky Way, 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.690
missing our galaxy entirely; 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.270
less of it would bring the two galaxies directly together.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.400
The Hubble team, 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.460
led by Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute, 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.870
conducted extraordinarily precise observations of the sideways motion 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.270
that removes any doubt: 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.700
Andromeda is destined to collide directly 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.350
and merge with the Milky Way.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.710
Although the two galaxies will plow into each other, 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.630
stars inside each galaxy are so far apart 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.530
that they will not collide individually. 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.560
Instead, the stars will be thrown into different orbits 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.160
around a new combined galactic center. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.960
Simulations show that our own Sun 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.200
will probably be tossed much farther from the galactic core 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.140
than it is today.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.400
Team member Gurtina Besla of Columbia University in New York 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.640
describes what a head-on collision will be like: 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.880
'The stellar populations of both galaxies would be jostled, 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.450
and the Milky Way will lose its flattened pancake shape. 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.860
The two galaxies' cores will merge, 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.820
and the stars will settle into randomized orbits 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.480
to create a new elliptical-shaped galaxy.'

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.290
To make matters more complicated, 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.390
Andromeda has a companion, 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.490
the Triangulum galaxy-also known as 'M33.'

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.200
M33 is a relatively small galaxy, 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.160
not nearly as large as Andromeda or the Milky Way.  

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.000
Nevertheless, it could play a big role.  

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.770
M33 will join in the collision 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.060
and perhaps later merge with the Andromeda-Milky Way pair. 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.820
There is even a small chance that M33 might hit the Milky Way first.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.890
Amazingly, Earth and the solar system should emerge from the melee unscathed. 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.990
We'll just have a new galactic address 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.900
and perhaps a night sky with a double helping of stars.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.700
It turns out that a galaxy falling on your head isn't so bad, after all.
