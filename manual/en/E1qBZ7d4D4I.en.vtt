00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:36.365
Gamers worldwide have always had an unhealthy
obsession with the undead,

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:39.580
blasting them away in more games than we care to count.

00:00:39.963 --> 00:00:42.573
And with Resident Evil 5 still a good couple
of months away,

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:46.899
Valve steps up to the plate with their co-operative
murder simulator for zombies

00:00:47.148 --> 00:00:50.166
Left 4 Dead - a game designed for the pure pleasure

00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:54.018
of picking up a gun and shooting anything
that isn't you or your friends.

00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:57.815
Four years in the making, Left 4 Dead
is an experience

00:00:58.072 --> 00:00:59.076
unlike any other.

00:00:59.707 --> 00:01:01.081
Built completely around co-op,

00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:05.616
the game puts players in the shoes of a highly
unlikely group of 4 survivors

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.843
who stick together and shoot their way out of
the zombie apocalypse

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:11.381
with high powered weapons, Molotovs,

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:14.184
and a pipe bomb that seems to draw the Horde
to it as if

00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:17.525
it were some sort of zombie equivalent
of Tom Cruise.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.621
Bill: "Safe house ahead!"

00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:28.613
Zoey: "You think one day it's all just
gonna go back to normal?"

00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:32.739
Bill: "I'll see peace back on Earth if I
gotta murder every one of these

00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:36.878
bastards with my bare, goddamned hands."
Francis: "That's what I'm talkin' about!"
Bill: "Damn straight!"

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:38.741
But be warned -

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:42.134
if you're the sort of spineless coward
that panics when attacked by a

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.490
horde of zombies thirsting for
your blood

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.495
a stray bullet or a wayward pipe bomb
could easily get you a lot more

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.441
attention than you probably bargained for.

00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:13.238
Split across 4 chapters

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.280
Left 4 Dead abandons the usual
zombie hangouts of malls,

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:19.925
pubs and graveyards in favor of
airports, hospitals

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.249
interstate highways and forest preserves.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:26.189
However, if you're looking to massacre
slow, dimwitted zombies

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.214
who'd rather be sitting in the garden shed
playing a PS2

00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:31.335
you're biting off more than you can chew.

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.530
Most of the undead Horde seems
completely capable

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:36.754
of winning the gold at the Zombie Olympics -

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.613
running and jumping in ways
that make their counterparts

00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:41.690
in 28 Days Later and I am Legend

00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:44.561
look like an inanimate carboard box.

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:56.930
And to make surviving
all the more tougher

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.240
the Horde is usually accompanied
by the Special Infected

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.634
powerful creatures that open up
a whole new world

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:04.511
of pain for the Survivors.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.554
Hunters go around pouncing
on players

00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:08.375
like Carl Lewis on steroids

00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:10.449
while walking bulimics called Boomers

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.825
love nothing more than attracting the
Horde by

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.506
unloading their stomach contents on them.

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.871
Smokers drag Survivors away
from the group

00:03:17.872 --> 00:03:18.872
and strangle them to death

00:03:19.383 --> 00:03:22.663
while a very powerful and a very
underdressed creature called

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:24.702
the Witch tears players into shreds

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:26.739
at the slightest bit of provocation.

00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:28.665
And our favorite?

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.413
The Tank - a hulking mass of muscle

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:34.610
that seems to have abused one too
many male enhancement drugs

00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:37.976
taking the combined effort of all
Survivors to bring down.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:03:59.537
And when you do die

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:03.340
the game fortunately doesn't have
you out of action for long -

00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:05.785
respawning you in a safe closet nearby

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:07.936
where you're left groping in the dark

00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:10.713
until someone has the courtesy to
come let you out.

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:16.383
Visually, the game looks fantastic

00:04:16.478 --> 00:04:18.908
Powered by the highly scalable
Source engine,

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.282
Left 4 Dead throws in all the new lighting,
soft shadows

00:04:22.283 --> 00:04:25.900
and particle razzle dazzle that made
their debut with The Orange Box.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.458
while an all new AI engine called
The Director

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:31.405
makes sure every encounter in the game
plays out differently

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:32.643
every time you go through it -

00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:35.300
changing everything from the enemies
you encounter

00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:37.641
to even the music that every player hears

00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:40.467
making sure that the experience is different

00:04:40.468 --> 00:04:43.102
for everyone in the game, even if you're all
playing it

00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:44.103
together at the same time.

00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:22.986
Goes without saying, Left 4 Dead
isn't the sort of

00:05:22.987 --> 00:05:26.920
"I-am-the-Master-Chief-so-it's
-MY-way-or-the-highway" kind of game.

00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:30.123
Every minute playing emphasizes the
importance of sticking

00:05:30.124 --> 00:05:32.394
together and covering each
other's back.

00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:36.161
Acting all John Rambo and running
three miles ahead of everyone else -

00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:39.834
well, do yourself a favor and save the world
all on your own

00:05:39.835 --> 00:05:41.411
in Halo, Half-Life and Crysis

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.569
because there's no way you're making
it out alive here.

00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:55.048
And for those spoilsports that would rather
kill their friends

00:05:55.049 --> 00:05:56.212
rather than work with them

00:05:56.444 --> 00:05:59.369
Left 4 Dead's Versus Mode pits
8 players in a

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.354
Survivors-vs-Infected battle,

00:06:01.801 --> 00:06:03.926
where 4 players try to get to the
safe house

00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:06.567
while the others take on various
Special Infected roles

00:06:06.568 --> 00:06:07.568
to try and stop them.

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:09.105
And we have to admit,

00:06:09.106 --> 00:06:12.607
we especially love playing as the
nearly indestructible Tank

00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:15.672
laughing as our friends scamper away
in sheer terror.

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:18.964
Although the game's matchmaking
seems pretty barebones,

00:06:18.965 --> 00:06:21.870
and is limited to two campaigns
out of the available four,

00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:25.692
the Versus Mode alone is well worth
the money spent on the game.

00:06:37.357 --> 00:06:39.152
In the end, Left 4 Dead is like a

00:06:39.153 --> 00:06:42.675
Halloween treat bag filled with candy and
razor blades.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.182
While the gameplay is frantic, tense
and a whole lot of fun,

00:06:47.183 --> 00:06:50.140
it is best experienced in short
bursts with a group of friends

00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:51.560
that you enjoy playing with.

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:53.568
Try to rush through the game
in single player

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:55.496
from start to end in one sitting

00:06:55.497 --> 00:06:57.590
and you'll just end up getting bored.

00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:01.287
Thankfully, with a ton of user-created
content for the PC

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:04.313
and downloadable content for
the Xbox 360 in it's future,

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:08.371
Left 4 Dead is sure to stick around
as one of the best titles

00:07:08.372 --> 00:07:10.314
to kill time with for years to come.

00:07:14.597 --> 00:07:15.480
Louis: "We made it!"

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:17.995
Louis: "I can't believe we made it!"

00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:20.307
Bill: "Son, we just crossed the street!"

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.685
Louis: "DAMMIT!"

00:07:58.373 --> 00:07:59.438
Zoey: "LOUIS!"
