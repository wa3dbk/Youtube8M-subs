00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.800
How was the tournament for you?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:29.380
Mostly I play good in Germany so I am always happy to play in here. It's a little pity that in singles I didn't get so far, but I'm very happy about our victory in doubles.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.680
How do you celebrate the trophy?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:46.340
Actually I wanted to go back to Düsseldorf today, but I decided to stay in here still for tonight and to go out together with a friend of mine.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.540
How do you spend the evenings at such a tournament?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:08.140
It is very exhausting to play singles and doubles at such a tournament. So I prefer to stay in my room to watch some videos or to listen to music.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.020
What's the difference between the ProTour and the Bundesliga?

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:36.760
To play with my club is a little easier for me. We are very strong. I can be completly concentrated and mostly be confident about winning, so the pressure isn't that big. At ProTour-tournaments the competitors are stronger and even if I perform on my highest level I can't be sure to win. That changes a lot.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.879
How is your relationship to the other players?

00:01:41.879 --> 00:02:08.599
In our team everything works fine. We train together or sometimes also seperated, but if I need something special, for example to prepare for a match against a defensive player, there is always someone there for me.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.240
What are your hobbies?

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:36.120
Shopping – I like to go shopping. If I played good I think "Now you have to get out and buy yourself something“. And after playing bad I think to myself "come on.. life goes on..“ and then I have to buy something for myself as well.
