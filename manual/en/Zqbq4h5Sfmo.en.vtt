00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.400
Precisely five minutes ago at Who Labs, an accident occurred during a mad cow disease cure experiment...

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.460
they're sending us this footage.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.960
They are working on regulating it, but they are encouraging all residents nearby to stay indoors...

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.380
at all costs.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.460
Get in.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.420
So, where are we going?

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.080
It's a safe house of sorts, and if it's name proves true, we'll be safe there.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.140
Um, sir, we've let in two more survivors. They look friendly enough.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.260
Well, bring them here, then.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.700
So, I'm Banks; head of this place and former police chief from back in the day. You?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.960
I'm afraid that's classified.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.060
What are you, some kind of secret agent?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.660
Yes.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.120
Okay, well, I'll show you and your buddy around.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.540
Here's the armory. It may seem a little much, but, it won't be good enough against the world...

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.960
when the time comes.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.280
Now this is what we call "Plan B." If ever the zombies breach the gate and we need to scram, this is our...

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.880
evacuation go-to.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.520
Here we have the main computer room.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.220
Every door in this facility can be opened, or locked shut through this console.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.500
Now, here we have the prized possession of this facility...

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.240
our own zombie.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.120
In here you'll find the other survivors.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.740
That's my number one man, Djobbes,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.600
Katie, John, Marcus, Harold, Joe, and Lucy.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.780
Can I have a word?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.120
Sure.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.100
So, everyone here in this facility has something to contribute. I can see you most likely are quite a...

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.720
marksman, but, uh, how about your friend, what would you say he's really good at?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.360
I don't know, I honestly just met him.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.940
Well, I guess we can't kick him out or anything.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.860
Disgusting, isn't it?

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.860
What?

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.660
The way an ordinary, harmless person gets transformed, in an instant, into a blood-thirsty monster.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.500
So, what all do you know about this virus?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.520
What I know is classified, but I don't think it matters much, anymore.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.060
Three years ago, I was on an assignment to kill a zombie. He was in a top-secret base in the middle...

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.100
of nowhere. I got the job done, but... I don't know.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.500
What I do know, is that you got to kill that thing. You won't believe those scientists. They were going to let...

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.360
him out!

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.540
That's ridiculous! We''ll never do that!

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.460
Will you?

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.680
Just think who this zombie might have been before. Sure he could've been some terrible person who...

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.720
deserved this, but who knows, what if he was like, a pastor at a church? What do you think?

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.000
I think it's a zombie and needs to be exterminated.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:25.100
We have that zombie strictly for scientific purposes only! Who knows? We might find a cure!

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.480
There is no cure as there is no way to contain that zombie! You have to kill it!

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.260
Just think; what if he's still in there?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.820
Hey, uh, why don't you take a step back, please?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.440
I think, I recognize him... I think... some... somewhere...

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.880
Get away from there right now!

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.980
If only, I think... I...

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.060
Hey, where's Djobbes?

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.800
Oh, no!

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.400
Open the door! Open the door!

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.920
Oh, no...
