00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.379
Citarum River basin is Indonesia's most strategic basin and it starts in the foothills

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.799
around Bandung, the fourth biggest basin in the country

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.840
flows through three very large dams creating 1,400 megawatts of power

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.329
and then feeds onto North Java flood
plain

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.600
which irrigates 250,000 hectares of rice

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.520
producing 5 percent of the
country's rice output.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.320
And then also feeds water supply to Jakarta.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.169
80% of the surface water comes from the Citarum River basin

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:53.100
so [it's] an immensely important basin for the country.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.760
The upper basin has a reputation for
being the world's dirtiest river

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.200
and if you google it, there are
some great videos and pictures

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.980
at times of the year, in the dry season, you
actually can not see the water

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.820
there's so much debris
floating on top of it.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.170
I've been there at this time of the year,
it's very smelly.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.790
Several kilometers away you know when
you're getting close to the river.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.049
The quality of the water is very
close to raw sewage.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.360
This comes about because of industries
putting a lot of pollution

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.880
industrial waste and
communities living closely to the river

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.310
unsustainable farming systems creating
a lot of erosion

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.390
runoff into the river and
cause the pollution level to rise.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.060
There's no quick fixes. The government
invited the ADB in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.260
to work with them in an integrated approach

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.180
to the basin long-term development and management of the resources.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.800
We had a series have workshops
and discussions

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.939
with the stakeholders to come up
with a visionary

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.040
planning process and a visionary
statement.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.580
What the communities thought was
required was a clean, healthy, productive

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.100
catchments and river system.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.220
That puts it into a perspective

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.790
of what the basin stakeholders

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.190
feel the Citarum River basin should
look and smell

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.319
and how it can contribute to their
livelihoods.
