00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.370
Titanium Machining Technologies Create New
Opportunities for Patriot Machine

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.690
We've seen an evolution in the way aircraft
parts are designed. Over the years they've

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:30.579
taken these simple parts and unitized them
together to create a part that maximizes the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
width of the material that can be produced
by the mills.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.760
As for the aerospace industry that we serve,
we have a healthy mixture of defense and commercial.

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:52.089
We work for primes like Boeing, Lockheed,
Northrup. We're told by some of our customers

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.129
that we have the best quality and delivery
rating of all their suppliers. They trust

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.550
our commitment when we say we can do a part
for a certain price and we commit to a delivery

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.510
date.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.500
We noticed early on that we were limited.
You're disheartened when you work so hard

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.500
and are limited by the machines. We recognized
that time and time again. So when we wanted

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.000
to expand our capabilities and capacity we
knew that we didn't want more of the same.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.470
We wanted to provide this tool that eliminated
the previous limiting factors.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.210
We're really happy to have the Makino T2s,
with all of their added capability that compliments

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.210
what we already have. Designers today will
design structures that is the maximum width

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.520
and length and thickness that can be produced
by the mills. With these new machines, we

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.910
believe the designers will become aware of
this new capability, and will start designing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.750
parts that will better use the full width,
thickness and length of the material.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.750
Up until now the traditional machines have
only had a certain capability, maybe plus

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:23.689
or minus 25 degrees of articulation with the
A and B axis, and certainly not long reach,

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.769
deep features. But with the T2 equipment,
for example the T2 6-axis, it can handle much

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.620
thicker parts, you can have tools as much
as 23.6 inches long. In the B-axis you have

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.400
infinite positioning and in the C-axis infinite
positioning. All of those features work together

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.560
in a way that's sort of amazing. We've
machined some big, complex hard metal parts

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:07.859
that go together into an assembly. And what
we found is the very first hard metal set

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:15.159
of parts that we assembled together, the tolerances
were very close, they only used half the tolerances.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.599
You can do more now. The parts can be much
more complex, you can have deeper pockets,

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:28.599
you can get to features you were never able
to before, and the cost is much lower. I think

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.239
it's really all the features. The HSK holder,
the rigidity of the machine, but it's the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.790
Makino advantage technology that is sort of
behind the scenes, that's really not visible,

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:53.689
that's playing a part in helping us develop
more precise parts than ever before.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.650
I think what matters most to our clients is
consistency. They want a quality part delivered

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:10.329
on time, all the time. They just ened to be
able to count on that. With the new T2s that

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:19.249
we have, in conjunction with the FAST system,
we'll be able to have single-piece flow

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.060
on the most complex parts. We intend to leave
the parts set up, so when we need another

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.060
part we will just cycle in that pallet, run
it, and if there's any sort of mistake downstream

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.449
after the machining we'll be able to recover
quickly. So in the end that will mean a lot

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.740
to our customers because what's most important
to them is getting a quality part on time,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.740
all the time. And so, with the system that
we have it's going to allow us to do that.

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:00.629
It's a perfect compliment to the rest of
the machines that we have as well. There are

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.490
these additional benefits beyond, say maximum
removal rate.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.490
There's this confidence that we have as
a supplier that I'm sure our customers will

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.390
become aware of and learn to count on.
