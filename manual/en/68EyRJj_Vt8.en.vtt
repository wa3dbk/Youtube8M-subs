00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.040
Hi guys.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.439
In this video, I will be showing you how to
create two simple but elaborate buns.

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.700
They look really fancy but they're actually
not as hard to create as they might look.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.740
The first look features a fancy pulled back,
voluminous bun.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:26.789
And the second look is a side updo with lots
of intricate curls to make it red carpet appropriate.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.260
Lately I have been obsessed with the Nexxus
Color Sure shampoo and conditioner.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.210
As you can tell I have colored hair from about
mid shaft downwards, and this is great at

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.151
locking in my toner, my hair dye, making sure
the color lasts but also moisturizing and

00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:42.151
conditioning my hair.

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:46.230
So if you have colored hair and you are looking
for a new line I highly recommend you try

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.050
these out.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.390
To begin the first look I am leaving out a
couple of sections of hair, just framing my

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.730
face.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.780
With the rest of my hair I am twisting it
slightly folding it up and holding this down

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.850
in place, squished right on top of my head,
wherever I want the bun to be.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.760
Then grabbing bobby pins with my right hand
and securing it down wherever necessary.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.390
So once the bun starts to take shape, at this
point you can decide how you want the bun

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.900
to look and how you want to define it.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.500
So I decided that I wanted to be a bit more
neat, so I am just grabbing the curls however

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.990
they are hanging, twisting them in the their
natural direction and pinning that down for

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.770
more shape and definition into the bun.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.370
This is optional; you can just grab random
pieces and secure them down in place.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.850
It will look great anyway because this is
meant to be a more effortless and somewhat

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.650
messy updo.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.680
At this point, it should look something like
this.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.049
I'm just going to grab a small section of
hair from the side of my face that I left

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.170
out from earlier on, twist this back in the
direction of the curl, and pin it right down

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.640
over the bun.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:07.310
So I like the look of having the loose ends
hanging out, but again, that's totally optional.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.909
So twist back all the loose hair from both
sides and you should end up with something

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.079
that looks like this.

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.331
Feel for any weird ends that are poking out
or anything that's sitting funny.

00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:21.870
For example, I found this section that was
hanging way too low for my liking, so I just

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.299
grabbed it, twisted it, pinned it right up.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.629
Once you are happy with the look we are done
with hairstyle number one.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.719
To prevent frizz, flyway's and to help maintain
the shine in your hair, spray it down with

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.569
the Dove Style and Care extra hold hairspray.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.959
This is great for fancy looks like this that
require the maintenance and extra holding

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.959
power while still allowing your hair to look
and feel really natural.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.139
To create the side updo, I'm going to divide
my hair kind of on a diagonal from my upper

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.239
left temple down to my right ear, and pin
this section up and out of the way for the

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.900
time being.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.310
Twist your hair slightly and pull it into
a low side ponytail.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.419
Once you have done this, take your elastic
band and wrap it around the pony tail a couple

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:18.099
of times and on the very last loop don't pull
your hair all the way through, to create a

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.219
small loop.

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.720
Stick two of your fingers through this loop
and pull the loose ends of your ponytail right

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.139
the way through to create a second loop that
interlinks with the first.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.359
Hold this down in place and adjust it until
you like the look and secure it in place with

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.889
a couple of bobby pins.

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.290
At this point, we can release the upper sections
of hair that we pinned up.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.469
Allow everything to fall down naturally.

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:57.390
Take a random section and backcomb it right
at the root slightly for extra volume.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.729
Brush out the very top layer so it still looks
neat, twist it in the direction of the curl

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:25.259
so that it sits naturally, and pin it down
in place when you are happy with how it looks.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.110
Do this with the rest of your hair and you
should have something that looks like this.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.039
I'm just adjusting the curls to make sure
they sit naturally and are locked down in

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.039
place.

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.340
Once you are happy with the look, we will
again set it in place with the Dove Style

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.319
and Care extra hold hair spray.

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.229
Here again are the final looks for both of
the elaborate buns.

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.800
Both of these looks were surprisingly easy
to master and they look amazing for any formal

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.220
event you might have coming up.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.093
Thank you so much for watching, I hope you
enjoy this video and I will see you in my

00:05:00.093 --> 00:05:01.093
next one.

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:01.095
Bye guys.
