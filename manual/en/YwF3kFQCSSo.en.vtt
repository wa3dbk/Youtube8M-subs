00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.509
These are the vegetables that I already roasted
and as you can see they do become smaller

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:17.409
and they become more actually flacit. In this
case flacitiy is a good thing half inch eggplant,

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:22.529
I'm going ahead and plate it and what I'm
going to do is put the eggplant around in

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.259
a circle. This part is always fun this is
where the artist in me comes out so I just

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:36.879
double up on the ones that I have extra. I
probably made enough for about 10 people here

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.859
it's very hard for me to make a small amount
of anything but I think we'll enjoy the fruit

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.910
of my labor. So here we have the eggplant
all in a circle and this basically has olive

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.541
oil, and the salt and pepper that I roasted
it with, then I'm going around in a circle

00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:58.780
with these peppers so beautiful, look and
you don't really have to peel them. Some people

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.710
do I don't and that gorgeous oil just now
dripping all over the eggplant because you

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.979
can see the kind of pulls inside how shiny
it is, so now it's dripping onto the eggplant.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:19.600
See just gorgeous here's one that has a lot
inside see up side down they sweat a little

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.130
and then I'm going ahead and put on the yellow
peppers. Actually I have more red peppers

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.469
so why not just get everything on there, there
we go, and then the yellow peppers. You can

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:41.310
use green to I personally not fond of green
peppers I have no idea why, and then the zucchini

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
ain't that gorgeous it's like a sunflower
and it just looks like something straight

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.820
out of Italy and so simple so delicious at
this point if you want to you can add a little

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.180
more salt and pepper. I wait to taste it first
so I'm not going to even touch it I think

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.729
it's perfect the way it is. I have only used
the olive oil, salt and pepper, so that the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.560
taste of the vegetables can come through and
when you want to serve it you can just take

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.500
we'll I'm sure you use a beautiful serving
feast but I happen to have this handy but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.470
you can have people serve themselves essentially
what they'll take is a stack something like

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.920
this and put it their own plate.
