00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:20.443
Good day, dear viewers, today we are going to review past day with Alexander Dashkevich, a.k.a. banana-man. Nice name.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:33.565
C'mon, Sasha, has this day finished correctly? Liquid are out with 48.000 plus small change. Is it enough for them?

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:36.622
- Yes.
- So,  are they worthy of this reward?
- Yes.

00:00:37.197 --> 00:00:45.717
Well, games were quick and painful. 20 minutes and they didn't manage to destroy any single tower. Is that normal?

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:58.293
It's hard for them to play. In bo1 you may count on your luck, but here skill is more important. They were lacking it. Sad to be them.

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:09.845
- Okay, so, LGD are stronger and are more worthy of moving forward?
- LGD is the team that plays with one squad. Okay, two guys changed, but

00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:19.943
the rest three of them have been playing together for three years. They are well-prepared. Maybe, group stage wasn't that smooth,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.990
but they managed to pass and show, that they are strong. And objectively, Liquid are weaker.

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:43.445
Okay, next were Cloud 9 vs LGD. Cloud 9 again pick unusual stuff, which no analyst can explain, Meepo, some other stuff.

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:55.724
Visage is banned, cuz Aui punished people too much. They won, hard, but anyway, 2-1, win. Do you think Cloud 9 are in a good shape now?

00:01:56.793 --> 00:02:08.686
Cloud 9 is a teams that can't win without weird picks, they just will be smashed by ordinary strategies in late game or any other time.

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:24.684
They have to surprise, well, like almost every team here. They succeeded against LGD, but DK showed that without strange picks C9 is destroyed within ten minutes.

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:36.935
- Not so sure. First game was 80 minutes.
- Naga Siren.
- Yes, about this Naga Siren. I'm still butthurting as hell.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:47.266
- I'm against her too.
- Naga Siren Club, like Pajckatt Club. Look, Burning and whole DK made two huge mistakes.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:03:01.406
They were wiped just for Burning to push ranged barrack by illusions. After such mistakes they still win, cuz Naga destroys three lanes.

00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:12.339
We lost to Naga as well, cuz we don't know what to do against her. Well, we do, theoretically. But when you play, you have one chance.

00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:25.250
If Naga hasn't pushed all three lanes, you just go and destroy one-two lanes, hoping, that will help in late game. But if you don't have heroes, who kill illusions,

00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:37.975
- Pugna. Lion or some, you're most likely screwed.
- Cloud 9 faced exactly this problem.
- Everybody faces it!

00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:50.333
- Puck does nothing to illusion with Tarrasque. Only Meepo, but he can't take all lanes. So, Burning finished in 80 minutes.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:59.370
- He's got tired.
- 80 minutes, too much money. You see, Refresh and Cuirass in the courier.

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:01.475
- It is not normal! It mustn't be this way!

00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:19.661
Okay, next game. Cloud 9 surprise again. But what will they do about Black Hole? Who will kill Enigma with BKB? But Black Hole wasn't even studied.

00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:33.236
DK are prepared too. They have strategies with Naga and farming as well as "Let's smash!". Troll, Sven and others.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:43.757
Or what they've shown here. C9 haven't played against zombie, or have, but they just don't know it. But it comes to hard lane and gets double kill.

00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:51.376
Okay, there was Witch Doctor, but it's not okay when dude kills your carry and support with boots.

00:04:52.953 --> 00:05:01.169
DK pass to next stage, to Key Arena. You play tomorrow... against whom? And your prognoses?

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:14.422
Titan faces NewBee, the winner faces us. Winner of our pair faces iG. And that winner goes to Winner bracket.

00:05:15.411 --> 00:05:24.818
- Whom would you prefer to play against?
- Doesn't matter, actually. Titan seems to be a bit weaker, but they will fight, for sure.

00:05:25.217 --> 00:05:37.620
And then... I don't know, they are not the strongest teams, but it may be hard. We'll see how it goes, how we play, cuz now we play shitty.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:44.435
- Don't be shy. You've made it to the next stage. You've earned some money.

00:05:45.082 --> 00:05:46.457
PAPERS!!

00:05:47.552 --> 00:05:52.228
- Be serious, it's a review.
- Review, yes.

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:56.931
- We say good bye to you.
- It was Elena Malisheva and day review.

00:05:57.492 --> 00:06:00.980
- You think you're Irina?
- Elena.
- Sorry, Elena.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.469
Here were Alexander Elena Malisheva Dashkevich, Viktor Godhunt Volkov, see you tomorrow!

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.912
XBOCT, the internets are worried. Why did you throw banana at me?

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:23.290
You was a bad boy last night, so I punished you.

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:29.143
- So, after getting top-5, you...
- Yes, I can afford throwing bananas.

00:06:29.475 --> 00:06:41.854
- Aren't you afraid that I'll give you up?
- You're my only friend! You won't turn away, you're my best friend! Thank you!
