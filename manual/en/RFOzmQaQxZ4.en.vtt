Hi, I'm Amelia and I'm here to talk to you
about how to go back to your natural hair

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.220
color. When you go and decide what color you
want to go back to, always let your hair grow

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.049
out just a little bit so that way you can
see your natural hair color. As you can see

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.440
on this model, we've got sort of an eighth
of an inch of root there. So that let's me

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.450
know that she's naturally a brown. So then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to first

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.350
use a tint or a filler. You can get color
fillers at the beauty supply. So always use

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.350
a protein filler of some sort before you put
the color, the desired color on top. Otherwise

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.609
you're going to have a sort of a greenish,
grayish tone to your hair. If you are dark

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.249
and you're trying to get back to your natural
and your natural is lighter, then you're going

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.870
to have to use a color remover or you're going
to actually have to pre-lighten the hair or

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.289
bleach the hair and then go back to your natural.
So this is not something for the faint of

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.799
heart and not something that I would recommend
doing in the kitchen. I do recommend going

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.770
to the salon and having this done. And go
to a reputable salon that does corrective

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.439
color on a regular basis because this is a
fairly corrective process. Now the lesser

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:22.439
of two evils is going to be going from light
to dark because light hair is a lot easier

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.520
to deposit color. Whereas if you were going
from dark to light, it tends to not lift evenly.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.990
You're going to get splotches and there's
a chance that you may pull on the warm side

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.021
or you may see red or brassiness in your hair
when it's complete. So it can be done and

00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:43.369
it can be done beautifully. Just make sure
that you let a little bit of your natural

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.820
color grow in so that way the designer that
you go see or you and your friend can actually

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.520
pick out a color that's very, very close.
And if you're tinting back, in other words,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.781
going from blond to dark, you may even want
to go a shade or two lighter, I mean, I'm

00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:02.270
sorry, darker, so that way as it fades, because
it will fade quickly, as it fades, you will

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.749
eventually get right on target to your natural
level. So that's how you can go back to your

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.959
natural hair color.
