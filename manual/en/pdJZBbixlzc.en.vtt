00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:03.143
(playful music)

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.643
- With my kids,

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.530
I found a great way to save some money

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.180
and give them nutritious food

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.500
is to make my own baby food at home.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.700
It's really simple and it is a great way

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.920
to introduce new foods to your baby.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.280
Are you ready to try some?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.480
Do you wanna try some new baby food, huh?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.530
Maybe some sweet potatoes?

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.830
When introducing foods,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.280
rice cereal is typically
baby's first food.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.550
After that, single fruits

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.550
and vegetables can slowly be added.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.730
These are easy to turn into
baby food with a few supplies.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.420
I'm gonna use sweet potatoes

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.000
but you can start with other
first foods if you want.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.923
I start by washing all the
food with a vegetable brush.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.830
This removes any dirt and bacteria.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.440
Also be sure to wash your hands,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.380
this is very important when
handling food for babies.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.587
Next, remove the skin from
the fruit or vegetable.

00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:03.170
(upbeat music)

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.580
We wanna cut the sweet
potatoes into chunks

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.630
as this will make it easier to work with.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.670
To prepare the food to
be mashed or pureed,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.070
we need to boil it on the stove,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.860
cook it in the microwave,
or steam it with a steamer.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.050
Some foods like a banana

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.180
don't need this and we can skip this step.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.940
However, for this sweet potato

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.673
we're gonna boil it on the stove.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.303
Once your food is ready you can put it

00:01:47.303 --> 00:01:49.470
into blender or food processor.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.290
I have a blender I'll use.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.460
If you boiled, cooked, or steamed the food

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.913
save the cooking liquid.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.840
I've saved the water from the
sweet potatoes in this cup.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.760
You need to puree the
food until it reaches

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.550
the right texture for your baby.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.676
If you need to you can
add liquid to thin it out.

00:02:08.676 --> 00:02:11.690
(blending whirring)

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.180
This is where the reserved
cooking liquid comes in handy.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.900
You don't even need to add
salt or sugar or anything.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.633
This is perfect just as it is.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.280
Once the baby food is ready

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.990
we can divide it up into servings.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.260
An ice cube tray is excellent for this

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.610
and provides us an easy
way to freeze the food.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.063
Simply drop a tablespoon of
baby food into each section.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.803
When full, you can cover
it all with plastic wrap.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.333
Then put the tray into the
freezer and freeze overnight.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.860
Here are some apples I made yesterday

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.720
that are properly frozen.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.470
I'm gonna transfer the apples
from a tray to a freezer bag

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.853
that I'll label with a date and the name.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.370
When you are ready to serve your baby,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.350
grab the number of baby
food cubes you need

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.760
and thaw them in the refrigerator

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.540
or under cool running water.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.470
It's best not to reheat in the microwave

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.820
as this could create hotspots in the food.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.500
Breast milk or formula can
help you thin out the food

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.330
or baby cereal can help thicken it,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.093
depending on your baby's needs.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.800
You should only introduce
one new food at a time

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.920
and watch for possible food
intolerances or allergies.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.330
Signs of this can include a rash or hives,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.890
runny nose, watery or puffy eyes,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.070
fussiness or temperament.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.180
As your baby get older,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.510
you can expand to more
fruits and vegetables

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.670
like peaches, carrots, green
beans, broccoli, or beets.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.290
And even to beans and meat
and combinations of foods.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.860
That's it, you now have a
convenient supply of baby food

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.900
and you can easily,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.300
quickly, and cheaply make
more when you run low.

00:03:51.146 --> 00:03:54.605
(playful music)

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:57.605
(digital whooshing)
