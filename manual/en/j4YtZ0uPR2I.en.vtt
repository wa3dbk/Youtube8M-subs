00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.160
\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hey everybody, my name's Devin.
I am the production lead and co-founder of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.770
BORN Imageworks, and I\'94m here today to
give you a quick video tutorial about my favorite

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.590
piece of set equipment, the c-stand. Now,
c-stand stands for century stand, and you'll

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.820
see this on pretty much any set that you're
on. It is the most versatile, most useful

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.189
piece of equipment that you're going to come
across. That said, in the hands of someone

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.910
who doesn't quite know what they're doing,
it could be an absolute terror, so we want

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.290
to go over a few things. We're going to go
over the part of the c-stand, how to put it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.780
together, what's there, and how to use it
safely.\

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.620
\
The c-stand is made up of three basic components.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.190
You have the legs down here; they fold up
just like that. This is a really easy one

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.160
to put together. This is an impact c-stand.
It's heavy, but it's a really great stand,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.670
and to get this one undone all you do is just
pull up that collar right there and turn it,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.679
and you're good to go. I'll set it right down
on here, so there you go. The second part

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:16.800
is the stand here. This is detachable from
the legs. You just unscrew that and it can

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.350
come out, but then it's kind of not useful
because it's a stand after all. The next part

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.520
of it is this arm right here. Now this arm
is what makes the c-stand the single most

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.221
useful piece of equipment on a film set. This
thing rotates 360 degrees this way, and it

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:43.530
can also rotate 360 degrees this way if you
have it in the right spot, which basically

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.550
means that you can get it wherever you need
to go.\

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.950
\
So let's go over how to operate this thing

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.290
safely. First and foremost, this is the most
important thing you can ever know when you're

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.810
using a c-stand: this grip head right here
(some people call them a gobo head) has to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.580
be on the right-hand side. The reason for
that is basically, physics, and I'll show

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.170
you why right now. Let's say that this is
where you have your light or your scrim or

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.210
anything else that has any kind of weight
to it. What you're going to want to do, you're

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.620
going to want to extend it out. Let's say
you want it right about there, and you'll

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.260
want to tighten it down. Now if this were
on the other side, you would have a problem,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.060
but the reason why you want it on the right
is basically because if you go and pull on

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.930
it, it's going to stay where it is, and that's
because you'll only be tightening it. The

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.180
way you check yourself is to make sure you're
tightening in the direction that the weight

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.970
is. This was a mistake that I had the pleasure
of making in the company of friends, people

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.720
who were nice enough to point our my mistake
and tell me why this was a problem, because

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.320
if you put it on the other side (now it's
on the left-hand side) and you don't tighten

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.250
it that way, let's say you put your load over
here, and it's heavy, it's heavy, it's heavy,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.630
it's heavy, and all of a sudden it breaks,
and it can come crashing to the floor, and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.280
whoever or whatever that's underneath you
is going to have a very bad day. It's going

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.860
to be your fault, and you don't want that,
because you want to get invited back. So,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.730
there's that: keep it on the right-hand side.\
\

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.320
Think of it as ROTT: R-O-T-T, right over the
top.\

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.700
\
You don't want this arm underneath; it's stronger

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.290
on the top, and you want it on the right-hand
side, and that also holds true for this. If

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.260
you have a scrim or something handing out
on here, you don't want it over here and facing

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.510
this way or else it's going to break and all
that good stuff.\

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.540
\
We have a few other safety tips. You're going

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.530
to want one of these. I don't care if there's
nothing on this c-stand. There should always

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.800
be a sand bag on the tallest leg. It's really
easy. It's just a saddle bag, and you throw

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.860
it right on there, and you direct the weight,
whenever you can, over the tallest leg. That'll

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.950
keep everything kind of in place and where
it needs to go. The three point kind of tripod

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.280
structure is best served when the arm is over
one of the legs and not in between two of

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.750
them. You know, you can, it's easier to fall
that way, whereas if it's over (that was the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.070
wrong handle) but it's not going to fall over
a leg unless you really want it to. So always

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.380
have a c-stand on it no matter, or a sand
bag on it, no matter if you have a lot of

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.990
weight or a little weight on it. That'll just
help you keep everyone else safe.\

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.470
\
And another consideration you can make for

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:43.600
you fellow filmmakers is to take care of the
opposite end of the boom arm. This has claimed

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.410
many an eye. These are really easy to run
into. A lot of times they're right at eye

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.889
level. So there is a pretty fun way that you
can take care of it. It's called the \'93pac

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.890
man\'94 solution, and it involves a tennis
ball. An ordinary tennis ball. Take a knife,

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.930
cut a little hole in it, and just like that,
pac man saves the day again. It's going to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.380
cover up that end, so anyone coming towards
is going to be able to see it. It's bright

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.150
yellow, so unless they're wearing a blindfold,
they're not going to run into it, and everyone

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.800
will be able to leave set that day with both
of their eyes, hopefully. Or if they don't

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.330
it won't be because they ran into a c-stand.\
\

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.660
So, with that said, now that you have the
very basics of safe c-stand operation, what

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.650
can you do with a c-stand? Well that's basically
limited to your imagination. If you need to

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.940
get something somewhere that you yourself
can't reach, that's what you need a c-stand

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.470
for. You can mount a light on this using any
number of things. You can use a baby post,

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.180
you can use a mafer clamp, you can use pretty
much whatever you have at your disposal to

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.840
get what you need, where you need it to go.
I've used c-stands to use it as a mic attachment.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.450
You can put your shock mount on this thing
over here, on your other head, and angle it

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.230
down for an interview if your interview subject
is going to be sitting still. You can use

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:12.880
it to hold flags or white cards, anything
like that. Pretty much it's only limited to,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.900
like I said, your imagination and what you
need it for.\

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.801
\
Probably the most useful part about this is

00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:24.190
that it extends. There's bigger c-stands and
smaller c-stands. This one I think goes up

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.240
to about ten feet, and it has two different
risers on it. When you want to raise it up,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.479
you want to start with the top one first,
and that's because if this one gets high enough,

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:38.730
or if you raise the bottom one first, and
it gets all the way up there, you're not going

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.530
to be able to reach that comfortably to raise
it up. So what you want to do is you want

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:49.800
to start with the top and raise this part
first, and once you get that all the way (this

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.560
can go a lot further; this probably goes down
to about here, you can probably get another

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.380
few feet out of it, but for the purposes of
this video I'm not going to go all the way

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.669
up), so then you can do that, and then you
have two separate areas, or sections, to raise

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:07.470
up. Like I said, this thing can get to about
ten or twelve feet. They have smaller ones

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.610
that can be used as well if you need to get
into a bit of a tighter spot.\

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.560
\
But yeah, this is a c-stand. It's a basic

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.830
overview of it, and it is, like I said, the
most useful thing that you'll find on a film

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.650
set. I've never seen or been on a film set
where I wish I had less of them. So get to

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:32.610
know it. This is going to be your main tool.
It is a lifesaver, and it helps make the films

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:39.580
that we know and love today. I hope you enjoyed
this tutorial. Go out there, make some films,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.860
and enjoy doing it safely. Until next time!\
