hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.019
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.060
we're going to learn how to make this
awesome potato spinach biryani

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.630
aloo palak biryani so dear friends to
make this first take a nice handy the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.180
biryani like this and pour some oil. In
this add bay leaves, cinnamon sticks and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.719
cardamoms, cloves;  in this

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.160
add some shahi jeera hmm the moment you add it

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.870
what a nice aroma, in this we're going to
add green chilli instead of red

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.920
chilli powder

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.640
we're going to add green chillies this
should be good enough this is very hot

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.760
and also add ginger-garlic paste, in this
oil itself add chopped coriander,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.309
chopped mint and then we're going to
cook this until this coriander and mint

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.090
slightly becomes crisp frying in this oil

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.310
you know that way the color will not
change and will nicely give nice flavors

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.049
out, wow now look at this, this masala is cooked,in this add chopped

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.770
tomatoes, add spinach

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.439
you know finely shredded spinach and
also add some yogurt

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.860
okay for this kind of biryani just add one cup of yogurt and add some salt

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.490
you know because there is spinach there is salt in spinach so add a little less

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.509
of a salt you're going to cook this till this spinach nicely cooks and then

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.649
we're going to add some potatoes, add pinch of turmeric that will give a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.159
nice enhancing color to this greens

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.290
look at this; this looks fantastic and you know still there is a good amount of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.119
moisture in this now in this add fried
potatoes just peel the potatoes, cut

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.460
into small pieces and fry it in oil that
way without boiling these potatoes

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.300
will hold the shape much better when
you're making into biryanis and pulaos

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.380
so just add in this and mix along with
this masala, now this masala is all ready

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.720
now we need to add some basmati rice the same way we cook for chicken biryani

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.100
or any other biryani

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.850
so here i have got water boiling;  in this

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.090
add salt ok and add some oil

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.910
now the salt is all mixed up now the
waters come to boil here is basmati rice

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.240
which I soaked for almost 30 minutes

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.010
one hour soaking is even better now add this basmati rice into this hot

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.880
water

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.270
fantastic and we're going to cook this
rice till this is almost ninety percent

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.990
done

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.380
you know when you are making chicken
biryani mutton biryani we cook the rice

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.030
till it is seventy percent done but for
this kind of preparation where the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.860
potatoes are fried and almost cooked,  the spinach masala is almost coked so we're

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.390
just going to cook this rice till it is ninety percent done here i have this

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.440
aloo masala allready but what we're going
to do is we're going to take half of the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.400
quantity away because we're going to
make this biryani in two layers

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.190
ok so at the bottom layer will be this
curry and even half way we will have this

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.790
curry

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.590
so the half of the quantity I removed the rest of the quantity i'm just going to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.090
spread as a thin layer in the pan itself
and then on this we're going to put the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.660
rice

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.730
okay look at this rice see when you will know that the rice than ninety percent

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.480
when you press it should not be too
strong

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.350
you know it should get mashed that's
when the rice will be ninety percent

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.160
done

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.690
ok this is almost eighty percent done
so I reduce the heat

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.400
I'm not letting it boil just letting this
rice sit in the hot water is good

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.510
enough to cook

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.370
that ten percent extra see ok now

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.500
eighty-five percent another few seconds it will be ninety percent done

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.080
look at this rice when this is almost
ninety percent done the rice will be

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.000
kind of breaking you know breaking not the grain

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.950
the grain we still remains solid but
within the grain they will split

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.590
little bit and this will become soft

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.000
that's when the rice is done perfect now the rice is all ready

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.360
now we're going to take rice and then spread on top of this you know potato

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.220
masala

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.700
wow okay once you make one layer of
this just take this aloo masala

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.590
look at this the potatoes are still
holding the you know shape

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.700
if you;  you know i wish i could added some fried cashew nuts also into this

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:04.520
wow this is good but you know i'm
going to add some fried onions

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.660
this onions will give nice sweet flavor that is needed for a good

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:20.570
biryani, now add the next layer of rice
potatoes and spread it nicely and add

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:32.030
the entire rice and cover this potatoes and when you're done just pour some

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.310
ghee

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.770
haha wow this is going to be good and
finish it up by adding some more of

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.820
fried onions

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.669
now put the lid on now we're not going
to put on a direct flame put a tawa and

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.620
let it cook on a slow flame for around five to seven minutes it should be so

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.960
slow that only the rice what you added
that little 10 percent need to be steamed

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.500
up

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.880
not cooked or anything just steamed up and you will have a fantastic potato
