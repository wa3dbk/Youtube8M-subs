00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.220
it's been a little while since we talked
about the American

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.259
drone program and the Associated Press
reported

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.300
that missiles fired by a US drone

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.170
slammed into a convoy of vehicles that
was actually traveling to a wedding

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.860
party

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.810
in central Yemen killing at least 13
people according to Yemeni security

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.240
officials

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.300
the official said that the attack took
place in the city

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.960
a read da the capital love by Dow
province

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.170
and left charred bodies and burned out
cars on the road now the city is

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.620
considered a stronghold of al Qaeda

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.070
militants there's no real question about
that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.329
I but the question here is whether any
militants were actually killed

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.430
or whether it was all civilians who were
not involved in any kind of militant

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.030
action no immediate details about who
was

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.219
killed in the strike conflicting reports
about whether there were any militants

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.910
at all traveling with the wedding convoy

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.520
a military official said initial
information indicates that the drone

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.760
mistook the wedding party for al Qaeda

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.380
com boy he said tribesmen known to the
villagers

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.310
were among the dead one of the three
security officials however said that i

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.640
cud

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.700
I al Qaeda militants were suspected to
have been traveling

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.340
with the wedding convoy this is very
very interesting Louis because

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.100
number one the US does acknowledge the
existence

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.390
have the drone program in Yemen but it
typically does not address

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.009
individual strikes if more investigation
ends up determining that the victims

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.470
were all civilians

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.540
this could fuel a serious outburst the
Bangor and we've spoken Louis

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560
this could have two issues about drones
issue 1

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.850
is when we say instead of drones we
should be doing nothing is that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.119
realistic and no it is not realistic at
all

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.360
if we weren't using drones in certain
scenarios we would be doing other things

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.549
and other things which might lead to
more deaths rather than less

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.379
the other question though Lewis is
whether the drone program separate from

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.069
what the alternatives would be

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.459
is creating more enemies for the US then
it is eliminating and

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.620
this seems to be potentially one of
those situations where the answer would

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.340
be yes

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.819
separately of course I i imagined

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.930
the anger billion many people when
something like this happens when they're

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.720
just a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.900
missiles essentially missiles from the
United States out blowing people up in

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.690
their country

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.900
I'm 8 it's clearly never

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.940
going to have a positive affect on
relations

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.290
with other countries that's that that
seems impossible to me

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.120
of course there's the question of how
would the US react if the strikes were

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.810
being carried out by other countries
here and I think that casts

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.860
an immediate a shadow absurdity

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.480
overall over the policy but there's
another thing here which is if you look

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.069
at the language that was used

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.739
a military official said the drone

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.909
mistook the wedding party for al Qaeda

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.090
for al Qaeda con convoy the drone didn't
mistake anybody right n

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.650
it the operator who mistook and this is

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.569
another piece of evidence suggesting
that drone warfare

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.680
further removes the operator the fact
that you are a person

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.709
controlling a drone killing people into

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.370
well the drone mistook the convoy that
Louis

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.720
without even intending to shows us
exactly what we should be concerned

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.379
about with these drone strikes

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.280
well it also shows us that that the
military

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.519
is just something there to because
they're willing to lie

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.540
and the information we're getting in
this case

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.670
is really kinda shady there's a lot of
weird language

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.849
and there's a lotta I'm I don't know

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.950
justs general

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.700
I don't know what you call it damage
control comments that just don't really

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.549
don't really give us any answers yet
there is basically you're remember how

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.080
at the Nelson Mandela

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.439
a memorial there was that a sign
language interpreter

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.570
who was communicating nothing with the
signs he was using because he

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.900
apparently was a loose in aiding or
something like that this statements that

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.740
we get about drone strikes and the drone
program there are words being used but

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.300
they're communicating nothing much the
same way

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.630
yeah I mean what are we really learned
from this we we have no idea if they

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.270
actually thought that they were

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.470
militants here al Qaeda here or if it
was just total accident
