Hey, welcome to the Daily Spin. I'm Rob

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.680
from inlineskates.com joined today by Steven Cherrier - president of Rollerblade. Steven, thanks for 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.830
being here.
Thank you for having me.
So, we're talking about the Twister 80 men's and women's

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.040
skates from Rollerblade. Really unique skate in the Rollerblade lineup.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.150
The biggest feature on this is the molded shell.
Yeah, so

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.260
molded skates, this is part of our urban skate collection, Rob, and they're made up of

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.420
molded skates. Molded skates are really good for transferring 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.620
energy and giving power to the skater.
For sure. And talk a little bit about the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.690
fit the customer's going to get especially with that molded shell.
Well, it's

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.840
a really precise type fit. If you're skating up hill, I mean, you feel it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.010
immediately that when you push off on this skate, it transmits that energy

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.220
directly to the wheel.
For sure. And then great ventilation on this skate too.
Yeah, it's very

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.320
ventilated. There's a lot of ventilation throughout this skate. Closure system

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.470
too - we have 2 buckles. A buckle at the top here, it's a locking buckle and then

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.670
in the instep here, there's also a ratcheting buckle here

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.750
that really locks you down into the skate and gives you a solid fit.
For sure, and then talking about

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.880
it as an urban skate, kind of that go anywhere, do anything type of skate, what really helps

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.060
there is the frame length on this skate, right?
Yeah, so this is 4

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.240
80mm wheels and 243mm Hot Rod Frame so

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.330
the frame is shorter. That's going to make this skate really maneuverable, easy to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.480
turn like that so it's very quick, you'd say.
Definitely. And then talking about the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.730
wheels a little bit too. A little different profile here than what you're 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.850
getting in say like a Macroblade.
They are. These are Supreme Wheels so it's

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.020
high-rebound, high performance wheel and what Rob's talking about is the profile of the wheel

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.210
as rounder like that, fuller so the skate corners better. It's going to hold

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.300
an edge better.
For sure. And then also especially in a molded shell, a little

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.440
bit of shock absorption for the customer too.
Yep, there's a shock absorber under the heel.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.620
You know, this skate is designed, it's kind of a utility

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.820
product, you'd say, kind of go anywhere. But it's really good for maneuvering

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.920
around, we call it urban skating, whatever. It does come with a brake in the box,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.070
it's not on the skate now. A lot of people choose to not skate with a brake on the product.
For sure.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.270
And so, in the Twister 80, who is the customer here?
You know, it's

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.340
funny, it's our most requested product worldwide

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.470
on our website. So, it's got a huge range of people that use it for a lot of

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.660
different things. But it's a reliable, strong

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.850
fitting, maneuverable skate that almost anyone can skate on.
Awesome.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.960
So, really cool skate - the Twister 80 men's and women's from Rollerblade.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.060
