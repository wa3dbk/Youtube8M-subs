Baking Soda face mask for pimples

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.960
Hi! today im going to make a face mask of sodium bicarbonate

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.720
It´s very easy to do

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420
And its going to help you if you have any little pimples

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
its going to erase them immediately

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.520
To start of,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800
you will need to add some baking soda

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.560
and then you need to add some water

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040
it should be like one spoon of water

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060
mix until we get a paste

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640
it should look like a paste, if it is too liquid add a little bit more of baking soda

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.960
And it should look something like this

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.460
With a clean face

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.340
We start putting it on

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.900
in all our face

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500
It helps a lot

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and the better we have our skin

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.580
the less amount of makeup we need to use

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.940
and it looks healthier

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.240
Avoid putting on the eyes area and mouth

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.340
You have to wait until it dries

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.040
Now that is dry

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.940
you can see how the color changes to white

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.480
It is better to use this mask

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.620
for oily skin

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.440
it going to help you get rid of pimples

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.780
and to eliminate some of the excess oil in the skin

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360
If you have dry skin,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Don´t do it, because it might get your skin more dehydrated

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.660
It can also work on normal skin

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900
Now that is dry we can remove it with water

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500
Now that we are ready

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
that we took off the mask

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.760
So if you have oily skin you better try it out

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.900
it would leave your skin without the oil but not feeling dry

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.240
I hope you like it

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720
