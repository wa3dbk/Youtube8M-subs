00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.660
Porsche Design Pâ€™9981 Smartphone from BlackBerry.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.080
Expected Q4 2011.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.100
A phone with a very unwieldy name, the Porsche
Design P'9981 from BlackBerry is a reworking

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:31.050
of the BlackBerry Bold 9900, with a very different
case design and a few software tweaks along

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.050
the way.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.890
Underneath, the P'9981 is identical to the
9900, featuring a 2.8" 640 x 480 pixel touchscreen

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.920
display, a 1.2 GHz processor combined with
768MB of RAM and 8GB of internal flash memory,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.260
and a 5 megapixel camera on the back with
720p HD video recording.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.890
There's a microSD slot, Bluetooth, 3.5G support,
WiFi and GPS, all running the latest BlackBerry

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.110
7 operating system.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.649
Most of the changes are external, with a stainless
steel case, leather back cover and sculpted

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.049
QWERTY keyboard that looks very different
from a run-of-the-mill BlackBerry.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.299
It is slightly larger and heavier than the
9900 on which it is based.. but you can guess

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.049
that it is a lot more expensive too.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.789
There's also a special version of Wikitude
pre-installed and the P'9981 has a special

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.619
PIN number for BBM users to identify it as
something special.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.500
These are not exactly huge improvements over
the standard BlackBerry 7 offerings though.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.579
The Bold 9900 is a powerful device and is
certainly a big hit with BlackBerry fans,

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.479
so the P'9981 has sound underpinnings.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.920
Porsche Design have a reputation for making
stylish and well engineered products for the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.950
discerning few who can afford them.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.920
But it seems to us that the elegant design
has compromised the handset's ergonomics with

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.380
a keyboard and navigation pad that seem to
be more about style than substance.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.319
We don't know how much the P'9981 will cost,
although we suspect that potential customers

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.959
won't care.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.499
The handset should be available through Porsche
Design outlets by the end of the year.
