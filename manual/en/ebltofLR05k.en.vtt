Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com and
today I want to show you how to make the

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.090
Evening Waltz Earring and this comes as
a completely kit from

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.729
Beadaholique.com

00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:22.249
So here is an example, I already used half the kits to make this finished

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:23.650
earring

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.380
and what you'll need

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.640
to complete this earring in terms of tools is a pair of wire cutters

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.390
a round nose pliers

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.420
and a chain nose plier

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.940
and in the kit you'll have all the ingredients to make your complete

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.190
earring. Like I said I've already done one so I used half of the ingredients but you will

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.120
get

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.060
two stairway beads

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.540
you'll get four of these little bead caps from
TierraCast

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.030
and two of these little beads which I have a great detail to them

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.940
and then you'll also get four Swarovski
rondelles

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.230
for the findings there are earring hooks,

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.430
two eye pins and two head pins

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.990
so how do you go about making these
earrings. It's actually quite simple, they go

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.720
together really quick

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660
take your head pin

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.189
and placed onto it

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.420
this lovely detailed bead

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.450
and you're going to bend your wire

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.260
at about an forty five degree angle

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.970
take your round nose plier, grip them right at
the bend

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.250
bend the wire over the top of the plier

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.700
then you're gonna rotate your pliers up
to the top

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.680
grip it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.970
and complete your bend

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.770
you just made a simple wire loop

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.370
and all you need to do now is trim your loop

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.530
take your cutters

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.820
and just cut

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.390
where the wire overlaps

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.190
take chain nose plier and straighten up your loop

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.670
if there's any gap

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.460
close the gap

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.060
take your eye pin

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.830
and place onto it

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.140
one rondelle

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.239
one bead cap facing up

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.279
your stairway bead

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.409
which fits in that bead cap really nicely

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.799
another bead cap

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.929
in the down direction

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.869
and another rondelle

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.909
pay attention to the orientation of the loop at the bottom, you want your loops to

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.509
always face the same way at least in this
earring

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.669
again create a simple wire loop. Just kind of bend

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.359
that wire

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.389
at an angle

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.779
grip it with round nose pliers

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.009
bend the wire over the top

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:53.009
rotate your pliers, continue your bend

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.619
and use your cutters to snip it

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:58.319
now we're going to use our

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.209
chain nose to straighten up that loop

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.099
and see if they're both facing the same
direction, if they're not what you can do

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.609
is you can take your round nose pliers

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.269
and twist

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.459
wire is very forgiving. If you do need to orient them properly don't worry

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.609
about it just

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.579
use your pliers to do so

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.619
so now we need to attach these two parts
together and place our earring on the

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:28.949
top of this lovely column

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:32.209
we're just going to open our

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.280
simple loop

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.810
the same way we would open a jump ring so
we're not going to pull it apart

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.579
we're going to want to push

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.889
open it

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.090
attach it to the loop at the base

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.090
now we just close it back up

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:01.469
for the earring do the same thing, open it

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.930
attach the earring hook

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.519
close it back up

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.849
and now you have a lovely new pair of earrings that you made yourself.
