00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.450
Hi, this is NUSensei and today, we're going
to clarify something.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.830
So, you're looking at getting a bow.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.760
You might be imagining this epic camouflage
bow that looks awesome and you just want to

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.499
have it in your hands.

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.000
And then you might, you know, I want to do
some competition shooting.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.609
So you look at these competition bows and
you see these weird things sticking out, and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.390
you're like, what are they? Are they important?
Do I have to get them?

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.050
You know, I come across a few people who want
to get a bow for backyard shooting.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.780
And then they want to do some competitions
and they want to do hunting as well.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.440
It's quite important to understand that there
are some differences between bows that are

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.789
designed for target shooting and bows specifically
designed for hunting.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.010
To give this some context, let's say that
there are entry-level bows, target bows and

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.940
hunting bows.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.910
The entry-level bows are the cheap wooden
takedown bows

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.150
such as the Fuse Focus, the Samick Polaris
and the PSE Razorback.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.220
These bows aren't really target or hunting
bows.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.710
They're somewhat small, have light draw weights
which cap out at around 34#

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.380
and are meant for people who are just getting
into the sport and want a light bow to practice

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.380
with.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.070
The power and performance don't make them
suitable for competitive target archery or

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.070
bowhunting.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.460
There are some exceptions. The Samick Sage,
for example, can come in higher poundages,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.760
such as 45# or 60#.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.950
And they can be used as entry-level hunting
bows.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.390
So if you're moving on from entry-level equipment
or you've chosen to skip that step and get

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.931
intermediate equipment, you've got to spend
quite a bit of cash and you want to think

00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:47.830
about what kind of archery you want to specialise
in.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.100
So, let's take a look at some of the differences
between target equipment and hunting equipment.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.520
Target bow are the kind of bows you would
see in competition shooting.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.530
For most people, this is what you would see
in the Olympic Games.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.200
As you can imagine, there are competitions
at local, national and world level.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.490
Target bows are optimised for performance
on the range

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.710
and the accessories you put on the bow are
designed to assist the archer in achieving

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.800
long range precision and consistency.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.820
Target bows have some distinct features.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.730
Firstly, their appearance is bright, metallic
and feature large brand logos for that sporty

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.730
look.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.580
The size is also quite obvious, with the typical
target bow being 68 inches long, effectively

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.240
as tall as the archer.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.130
The long stabilisers help with keeping the
bow steady.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.830
The sight is a simple adjustable ring sight.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.190
Bow materials generally favour aluminium or
carbon.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.190
The bows are typically rather heavy and balanced.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.270
If you're thinking buying a bow with the possibility
of going hunting, target bows aren't really

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.750
a practical choice.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.760
Remember, when you hunt, you'll be in the
field.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.190
The size of a target bow make it rather cumbersome,
and I'm talking about the length.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.010
It's kind of taller than you are. It's quite
huge.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.990
You can't use the long stabilisers because
it'll get in the way.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.650
The bright colours and the branding don't
really fit in the outdoor environment.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.730
It's generally very clumsy.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.880
Remember, target bows are designed to consistently
hit targets at 70, 90 metres.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.660
You're not really going to be shooting beyond
30 metres when you're hunting.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.440
So, what makes a hunting bow different?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.450
For starters, the appearance is quite different.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.270
Most hunting bows are wooden or otherwise
have camouflage patterns or just plain black.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.090
Unlike target bows, wooden hunting bows are
a large part of the market, although you can

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.780
get metal risers.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.410
Hunting bows are shorter and accessories are
more compact.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.250
Your choice of accessories also differs.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.600
Many hunters prefer to shoot with a glove
rather than a finger tab.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.370
Whisker biscuits are commonly used.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.730
And string silencers are also normal.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.090
Modern bows often allow for bow-mounted quivers.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.410
Sights are often multi-pin sights for multiple
distances, since your target won't be conveniently

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.200
standing at a set distance.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.680
And of course, the choice of arrows and arrow
points will be different.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.370
We've established that target bows aren't
very practical for the field.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.220
So does a hunting bow have a place on the
range?

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.250
From a practical perspective, you could use
a hunting bow in a target competition from

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.570
a technical perspective.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.690
However, it's going to be out-performed by
a target bow.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.699
Here's the tale of the tape.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.510
In simple terms, a target bow, especially
a high-end one, will squeeze out more performance.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.390
We're talking about more efficiency for a
given draw weight.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.810
Higher velocity, and more control over vibrations.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.710
The light weight of a hunting bow is actually
a disadvantage on a target range compared

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.050
to a heavier target bow, because there's less
stability.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.080
Additionally, target bows can mount a variety
of stabilisers and dampeners as well as other

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.030
accessories, such as a plunger or clicker
whereas hunting bows cannot.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.710
On the target range, colour and shape and
noised don't matter.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.810
All things considered, a target bow should
be able to get tighter groupings at longer

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.810
distances.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.010
This underlines the unique requirements of
bowhunters and target shooters, and how manufacturers

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.420
design bows that suit these needs.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.810
A bowhunter doesn't need long-distance precision

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.940
while a target shooter doesn't have to worry
about the size of their bow.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.960
As a footnote, while this mainly applies to
recurve bows, these differences also apply

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.210
to some extent to compound bows.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:48.190
This affects you, because you can't really
buy a bow that is suitable for everything.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.770
Bows are designed with these purposes in mind,
especially at the higher end.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.450
If you're thinking of getting a bow, it's
worth keeping these limitations in mind.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.630
Anyway, this is NUSensei. Hope this video
was helpful. Thanks for watching, and I'll

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.539
see you next time.
