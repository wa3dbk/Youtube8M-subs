00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.120
Hi and welcome back to Steve's Kitchen. We are continuing the cake theme, now I'm

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.830
taking that simple batter and

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.510
trying to encourage people not to get the
box batters but actually take this one

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.469
and make so

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.280
many different cakes and today we're
going to make a real Kids Classic

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.130
the red velvet cupcake. I'm going to put a nutella frosting on it as well.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.170
This is so easy to make, come on let's
get started.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.000
Now today's recipe is going to make about 12 cupcakes and we're using

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.750
equal quantities of all our ingredients
the usual pound cake batter

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.200
I've got two hundred grams that's about
seven ounces of softened butter

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.129
into a bowl and 200 grams 7 ounces of
white sugar 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.940
just going to use a spoon to cream these
together and don't forget you can use an

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.920
electric mixer

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.860
so we've now got this wonderful sugary
butter here

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.530
we're going to pop into that our 4 eggs

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.330
and changing over to the whisk here I'm
just going to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.939
whisk this all together and you want
to be fairly vigorous with this because

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.680
we're getting some air into the batter

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.140
and now we're ready to put our self
raising flour in there I've got 200 grams 7 ounces

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.000
again

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.549
just pop that on top , I'm just going to add a teaspoon of baking powder in there as well

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.509
now because this is going to be a red
velvet cake I'm going to get some

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.170
dark cocoa Dutch processed and I'm
putting a couple of tablespoons

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.759
in with the flour now this is where the
recipe starts to change a little bit

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.259
from more traditional pound cake

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.720
we've got our cocoa in there and we're going
to put some red food coloring now I'm

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.399
going to put about a tablespoon of food
coloring in

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.680
because I want a fairly strong red color

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.409
and ideally you want to use a gel or a
strong food coloring

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.430
now we're also going to add a couple
teaspoons of a white vinegar

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.979
in with our mix it reacts with
the cocoa when it's cooking and adds

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:57.930
more redness

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.090
to our red velvet cake and then we're going  to mix this all together to get our

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.610
lovely

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.189
red velvet cake batter now look at that
we've got this wonderful

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.700
red velvet cake batter now. Now I've added a
few extra dry ingredients so I'm going to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.180
add a couple of tablespoons

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.090
of full cream milk and then we just
give this one last mix

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.480
and we're ready to go now you can decide
if you want to put them straight into

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.450
your muffin tins

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.230
I'm going to pop them in these little
silicon holders I just think they look

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.780
pretty

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.040
and we going to distribute this red velvet batter into each of the cupcake

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.819
holders

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.430
now want to fill them about
three-quarters of the way up

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.590
and whilst we're filling these get your oven on 170 degrees Celsius

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.129
325 fahrenheit and we're going to cook
these

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.750
for about 15 to 20 minutes just keep an eye 
on them we don't want them to go too dark Brown on top

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.269
so we've got about 12 cupcakes filled there
I'm  going to pop these in the oven now and

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.500
we'll bring them out when they cooked

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.340
and there they are

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.730
out of the oven now they are perfect
textbook cupcakes

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.540
keep it simple stupid we're going to leave these
on the side now to completely cool

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.040
down

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.050
and then we'll decorate them. Now whilst
they're cooling on the side we might as

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.660
well get and make our Nutella

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.180
butter frosting I've got two cups that's 250
grams of powdered sugar in here

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.900
I'm going to add a couple tablespoons of full
cream milk into that

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.150
and then I've got  125 grams that's about four ounces of softened butter

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.010
now that would make a normal butter
frosting with a little bit of vanilla

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.410
in it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.920
I'm just going to start to whisk this
together and make it nice and creamy before

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.130
we

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.099
add the Nutella. Now that gives us a wonderful
butter frosting if I wasn't going nutella

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.579
I'd put  a little bit of lemon rind in
here

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.590
and some vanilla extract but we going to
be popping about half a cup

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.000
of Nutella in with the mix and then
we're going to continue to whisk this up

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.170
and we'll get this lovely chocolate frosting

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.430
and there we've got this wonderful Nutella
 frosting which I'm going to pop in a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.150
piping bag and when those cupcakes have
cooled down we're going to pipe it on top

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.460
now if you haven't got the kids involved
already you should do by now my cupcakes

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.850
have cooled down I've got frosting one

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.560
in a bag with a nozzle on one without
come down here let me show you what we

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.040
can do

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.220
we can take either a nozzle like this

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.750
and put a little design around something
simple

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.410
pop a simple little design put some
colored sprinkles on there

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.840
and we can take a plain piping bag like
this maybe put

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.370
a nice big dollop in the center there put
a spike on it

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.060
and follow around the edges with some
smaller ones now you could do this in a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.030
ziploc bag

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.770
but these piping bags are a lot cheaper or
you could just take your piping bag and put

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.570
a plain

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.550
Simple swirl around like this so

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.570
take a look at those cupcakes they are
my nutella frosted red velvet

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.100
cupcakes I have got one here

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.920
I'm not actually going to try these I'm
saving these for the kids they come out

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.180
perfectly well

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.940
please share the love if you've enjoyed this
all from the same cake mix by the way

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.160
so give this one the thumbs up and I'll
see you

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.760

look out for that one take care thank
you see you next time

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.130
now that frosting by the way will keep
in the fridge I made way too much of it here

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.160

recipe
