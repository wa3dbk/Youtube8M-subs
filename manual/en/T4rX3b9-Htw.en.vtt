Hello everyone, I hope all is well. Today 
 we have Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs. 

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:11.033
Disney's Marvel Avengers edition! The reason I like to dabble in Marvel 
 Surprise eggs is because I'm a fan of Captain America, 

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:27.072
there is also Wolverine, Venom, Thor, Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man...so 
 many Marvel characters inside these delicious Kinder Surprise Chocolate Eggs. 

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:32.504
So now we are going to open these delicious Disney's 
 Marvel Avengers Limited Edition Kinder Surprise Chocolate Eggs

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:42.284
Here is the first Kinder Surprise Chocolate Egg we will open. 

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:57.502
Let us see what is inside. Wow, it's 
 Wolverine, from Disney's Marvel Avengers movies! 

00:00:57.964 --> 00:01:01.964
Wow, will you look at this? He is so beautiful.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.010
Because I am a big fan of Disney's Marvel Avengers character, the Wolverine, 
 it is because many of Disney's Marvel Avengers can't match Wolverine's bad-assery.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.250
Many Disney's Marvel Avengers fans agree that Wolverine doesn't have 
 many superpowers, but I disagree...his power is his badassery.

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:17.935
Am I right? Am I right? 

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:25.333
He has incredible dangerous claws made of Adamantium. So I advise not to 
 cross him, because if you do, he will claw you to death.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.370
Here comes the second egg in the limited edition 
 Disney's Marvel Avengers Kinder Surprise Chocolate Eggs.

00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:39.711
Are you ready? 1-2-3....

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.880
We open this Kinder Surprise egg. Wow. Will you look at that? 

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.840
If you'd like to read closely on the Kinder Surprise box, it states clearly...

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:53.140
So in reality, only two of the three eggs contain 
 a Marvel Heroes toy. Collect all 13. 

00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:58.420
Why can't all three of have Marvel Heroes toys? 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.130
But this is what I like to call in English...

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:13.940
Before you watch this part, I'd like you to participate in the comment section by telling me if you 
 think this second egg will be a Marvel Heroes toy or just a random toy from Kinder Surprise.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:15.360
Now it is time for us to open it and see. 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.040
Wow. I guessed right. It is a Marvel Heroes Toy from Disney's Marvel Avengers movie, and specifically it's 
 the Winter Solder Captain America! The first two Kinder Surprise Eggs have Marvel Toys in them! 

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:36.140
This is Disney's Marvel Avenger Captain America. Oy. I want you to tell me your opinions on Captain America: The Winter Soldier. 
 Did you like the movie? I really liked it. Did you like it? But I liked the movie Godzilla better. 

00:02:33.978 --> 00:02:40.980
And the new film from 20th Century Fox X-Men Days 
 of Future Past was also a fantastic film.

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:41.700
In English, we like to say...

00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:56.800
The third Kinder Surprise Chocolate Egg Marvel Heroes Edition 
 from Disney's Marvel Avengers is next! 

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.880
Are you ready? 1-2-3. 

00:03:08.498 --> 00:03:18.500
Now because we have already opened the first two eggs, and it was revealed 
 that both were Marvel Heroes toys, we know this one will not be.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:22.270
Let's see what kind of crap is in this one! 

00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:30.830
Awwww! Wow, it's so cute. Look at it. This 
 is a warning to all animal lovers.

00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:40.200
Because if you do, they will die of suffocation. Please refer to the size of the 
 squirrel's eyeballs. They are wide, which means the poor thing is struggling for oxygen.

00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:52.500
Who's bright idea was it to put this poor squirrel inside this plastic bag? Do you really 
 want to responsible for the death of an innocent little squirrel? This is called animal cruelty.

00:04:03.953 --> 00:04:17.950
We need to save this squirrrel! How's the little guy supposed to breathe! He's losing all oxygen! This is 
 called suffocating! Please don't do this. They will die! Take him out! Take him out! Don't! OK! 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:27.060
Now I feel so relieved. He can breathe again. Everything is all good. Now 
 his eyes are wide because he is happy. Side profile. His backside. 

00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:36.020
This Kinder Surprise Toy Egg is so cute.
