00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.020
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.780
think about exponents in a
slightly different way that

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.940
will be useful for
different contexts

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.210
and also go through
a lot more examples.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.370
So in the last video, we
saw that taking something

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.630
to an exponent means multiplying
that number that many times.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.780
So if I had the
number negative 2

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.740
and I want to raise
it to the third power,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.230
this literally means
taking three negative 2's,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.100
so negative 2, negative
2, and negative 2,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.360
and then multiplying them.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.350
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.834
So what's this going to be?

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:36.500
Well, let's see.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.310
Negative 2 times
negative 2 is positive 4,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.800
and then positive 4 times
negative 2 is negative 8.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.030
So this would be
equal to negative 8.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.480
Now, another way of
thinking about exponents,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.772
instead of saying you're just
taking three negative 2's

00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:58.313
and multiplying them, and this
is a completely reasonable way

00:00:58.313 --> 00:00:59.980
of viewing it, you
could also view it

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.770
as this is a number
of times you're

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.880
going to multiply
this number times 1.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.450
So you could
completely view this

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.930
as being equal to-- so you're
going to start with a 1,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.210
and you're going to multiply 1
times negative 2 three times.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.080
So this is times negative
2 times negative 2

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.350
times negative 2.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.012
So clearly these
are the same number.

00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:29.470
Here we just took this, and
we're just multiplying it by 1,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.120
so you're still going
to get negative 8.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.640
And this might be a
slightly more useful idea

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.410
to get an intuition for
exponents, especially when you

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.040
start taking things
to the 1 or 0 power.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.250
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.940
What is positive
2 to the-- based

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.770
on this definition-- to the
0 power going to be equal to?

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.330
 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.470
Well, we just said.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.740
This says how many times are
going to multiply 1 times

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.920
this number?

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.250
So this literally says,
I'm going to take a 1,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.179
and I'm going to
multiply by 2 zero times.

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.280
Well, if I want to multiply
it by 2 zero times,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.160
that means I'm just
left with the 1.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.440
So 2 to the zero power is
going to be equal to 1.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.590
And, actually, any non-zero
number to the 0 power

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.551
is 1 by that same rationale.

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.300
And I'll make another
video that will also

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.050
give a little bit more
intuition on there.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.430
That might seem very
counterintuitive,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.330
but it's based on
one way of thinking

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.812
about it is thinking
of an exponent as this.

00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:35.270
And this will also
make sense if we

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.315
start thinking of what
2 to the first power is.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:41.900
 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.830
So let's go to this definition
we just gave of the exponent.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.840
We always start with a 1, and we
multiply it by the 2 one time.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.440
So 2 is going to
be 1-- we're only

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.690
going to multiply it by the 2.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390
I'll use this for
multiplication.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.700
I'll use the dot.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.160
We're only going to
multiply it by 2 one time.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.700
So 1 times 2, well,
that's clearly

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.380
just going to be equal to 2.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.530
And any number to
the first power

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.379
is just going to be
equal to that number.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.670
And then we can go from there,
and you will, of course,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.710
see the pattern.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.370
If we say what 2 squared is,
well, based on this definition,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.180
we start with a 1, and we
multiply it by 2 two times.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.630
So times 2 times 2 is
going to be equal to 4.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.880
And we've seen this before.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.710
You go to 2 to the third,
you start with the 1,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.150
and then multiply
it by 2 three times.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.050
So times 2 times 2 times 2.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.780
This is going to
give us positive 8.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.940
And you probably
see a pattern here.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.200
Every time we multiply by 2--
or every time, I should say,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.420
we raise 2 to one more power,
we are multiplying by 2.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.920
Notice this, to go from
2 to the 0 to 2 to the 1,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.965
we multiplied by 2.

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:13.630
I'll use a little x for the
multiplication symbol now,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.970
a little cross.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.440
And then to go from 2
to the first power to 2

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.329
to the second power, we multiply
by 2 and multiply by 2 again.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.620
And that makes complete sense
because this is literally

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.640
telling us how many times are
we going to take this number

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.400
and-- how many times are we
going take 1 and multiply it

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.534
by this number?

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:33.200
And so when you go from 2 to the
second power to 2 to the third,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.580
you're multiplying
by 2 one more time.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.740
And this is another intuition
of why something to the 0 power

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.899
is equal to 1.

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:43.440
If you were to go
backwards, if, say,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.410
we didn't know what
2 to the 0 power

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.420
is and we were just
trying to figure out

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.965
what would make
sense, well, when

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:50.390
we go from 2 to the third
power to 2 to the second,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.630
we'd be dividing by 2.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.170
We're going from 8 to 4.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.650
Then we'd divide by 2 again to
go from 2 to the second to 2

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.519
to the first.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.060
And then it seems
like we should just

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.830
divide by 2 again from
going from 2 to the first

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.760
to 2 to the 0.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.550
And that would give us 1.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.223
