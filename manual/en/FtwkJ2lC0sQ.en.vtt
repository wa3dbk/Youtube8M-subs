00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.260
Anything, Norton?

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.020
*Everything is quiet.*

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.920
Broom?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.390
I'm falling asleep here.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.620
Berion?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.100
*Piloting with my eyes shut.*

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.290
*What is it?*

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.280
- Dirk, what happened?
- *An enemy patrol helicopter.*

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.290
- *It has been shot down.*
- Any other hints of enemy presence?

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.220
*I don't know, sir.*

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.970
Exterminate them as soon as you find them! Their HQ cannot know that we are here!

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.360
*Roger that!*

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.270
*I owe you, Norton.*

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.740
My interests are high!

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.270
The sooner we're back, the better. Let's move!

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.990
A comms probe!

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.560
- Got it!
- *Well done!*

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.470
Nah.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.500
*My turn now!*

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.060
*Bravo!*

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.190
*I don't even have to aim like this!*

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.020
*Norton!*

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.180
We're too close! Scatter!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.080
*Take cover! One shot and it's over!*

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.100
From below?

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.050
Jump!

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.280
There must still be more. Watch yourselves!

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.540
According to schedule, Captain Boyd's forces should reach Kardinal soon.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.000
*Third Company, Fourth Company, move out!*

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.640
Captain, the enemy has four combat mecha!

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.490
Dirk, there are four Crab Gunners! We'll deal with the one in front,

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.770
*you take care of the rest!*

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.400
Understood! Broom, Berion, the three machines in the back are ours, got it?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.330
*Roger that!*

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.650
Let's go!

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.260
Damn their heavy armor!

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.810
*Stop firing like a fool, Berion! Aim for their rear!*

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.340
They're close!
*Stop firing like a fool, Berion! Aim for their rear!*

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.410
They're close!

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.810
*I know that already, but it's not that easy!*
They're close!

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.430
*I know that already, but it's not that easy!*

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.960
There?
*I know that already, but it's not that easy!*

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.150
*I know that already, but it's not that easy!*

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.090
Listen! On my mark, fire on the cockpit! Take it out in one shot!

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.650
5...

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.700
4...

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.890
3...

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.790
2...

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.570
1...

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.670
Fire!

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.090
*I can't----!*

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.950
*Broom, the back!*

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920
*Attack!*

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.370
*Got it!*

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.500
It's coming, step back!

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.500
Berion, are you done yet? We're in danger here!

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.340
*Roger!*

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.160
Dammit!

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.600
Young Crinn!

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.220
Crinn!
