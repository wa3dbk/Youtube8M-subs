00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.150
Word Up Food Tubers, Mr Oliver here.
Ok, it's a very, very important day in the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.990
annual calendar. Yes, we're very close to
Valentine's Day and I've had a little shout

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.500
out from a fellow You Tuber, Jim Chapman,
over there.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.300
Hello, how are you?!

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.369
I'm engaged to a beautiful lady, Tanya, she's

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.920
also on You Tube. She does makeup tutorials
and also sort of fun, cute videos. And she's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.460
just delightful to behold.
This will be our eighth valentine's day and

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.860
I need something to impress her that might
get me lucky later.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.379
Ok, so we've got a beautiful meal.
We're gonna do marinated, seared tuna with

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.120
a nice spaghetti with a simple tomato sauce.
Perfect for Valentine's Day. Let's do it!

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.770
So grab your pestle and mortar. I want a nice
pinch of salt Jim.
Ok

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.980
That's for seasoning and to give a nice bit

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.899
of abrasion.
Like it, good word.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.350
What is it?!
Abrasion.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.350
Yes, very nice. We're gonna grab a wad of
basil and we're gonna make a basil oil.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.959
I think actually when she sees me doing this
anyway I won't even need to cook anymore.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.690
She'll just come in and go - Wow!
That's my boy!

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.369
Job done!
So, olive oil. A couple of good tablespoons.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.330
So half the zest of a lemon goes in, just
about 3 or 4 strokes. Just the juice of half

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.789
a lemon is probably more than enough.
I only want you to put half on this tuna.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.209
And then I'd keep this for sort of drizzling
on the end because it's fresh and alive!

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:42.200
Sustainable fish! We do not want to be using
Bigeye or Bluefin tuna. So Yellowfin or Skipjacks

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.899
are really, really good to use. We are gonna
do something very special. Jim, I want you

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.690
hold that pack and smash it like a man on
that board.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.770
This is where it's all gonna go wrong isn't
it?!

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.600
Dominant!
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.100
Yeeeeah!

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100
Wooooah!

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.100
Next, 200g of tomatoes. We're just gonna cut
them into half.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.080
Once upon a time, I cooked

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.080
naked for my wife. I was like you. I was young,
vulnerable and looking for love. And not married

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.200
yet. And I actually cooked whole sea bass
in my new oven. As I opened the door to check

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.090
my sea bass, a jet of hot steam shot into
my penis, my whole night was ruined! So that's

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.300
a warning!
Or wear clothes when you cook!

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.190
Or just wear pinny.
Yeah.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.810
So we've halved our tomatoes, good job. We
want some garlic, just a couple of cloves

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.310
of garlic each.
Tell us all about your channel.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.500
So essentially what I do every week, on a
Friday, I'll upload a video where I embarrass

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.860
myself in some way.
So people basically tune in to see you squirming

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.430
at your own sort of self...
Yeah, self-loathing, self-pity, that sort

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.130
of stuff.
Ok, it's time to cook the Tuna.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.450
A lot of people think that Tuna has to be
cooked all the way through.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.350
No I don't like it like that, bit tough.
A little bit pink is good.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.819
Let's make a two minute tomato sauce. I wanna
go in with a whole pinch of fennel seeds.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.260
Go in with some olive oil, garlic, grab a chilli.
So I reckon about half a chilli is going to

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.430
be good for you and your Mrs. And then go
in with your tomatoes as well. Now if we look

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.130
in the pan now, see I'm just gonna turn this
Tuna over.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.880
Oh yeah!
Beautiful!

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.040
So tuna on, sauce on, pasta's on with a nice
pinch of salt, nice pinch of pepper.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.760
If you look in this pan, see how we're just
softening up those cherry tomatoes.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.420
We've had about a minute and a half on each
of these Tuna so here's your one. And like

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.709
a piece of meat, we're gonna let that rest.
Now Jim, if you can get a little bit of that

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:46.700
lovely, fresh basil oil. Divide up our pasta.
Just grab some basil and just tear a little

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.880
bit, or chop a little bit through. You don't
need much.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.990
Right at the last minute.
So we're gonna just drag that onto a plate.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.470
But I think it's quite nice to have this as
a share plate.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.270
Yeah, then there's more chance of you getting
that sort of Lady and the Tramp moment isn't there.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.530
Yes! and are you gonna make this for her on
Valentine's Day.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.130
Yeah! Yeah, that's the reason I'm here.
Ok, so over here we're just gonna tear that

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.230
open and you see how that's blushing in the
middle?! That's what we want.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.709
And we can just tear that up and it gives
you more surface area to have that lovely

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.160
marinade.
So Jim look, you've done a great job mate.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.789
I'm very proud of myself.
You're good!

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.539
I've entered manhood.
So how are we gonna test this?

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.500
I dunno, you know?!
Hmmmm...

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.000
You are the best! No, you are the best! I've

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.919
made this meal for you because I love you.
Because I love you.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.000
And you are gonna get to try every single
bit of it!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.100
Ha ha ha
Why do you look nervous?

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.470
I'm petrified!
We're just doing role play here alright?!

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.400
I'm scared! Behind your eyes it looks like
you're curious!

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.300
Up you go, with confidence.
Up, across, nailed it!

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.100
Mmm, wow!
Pasta's very good Jim.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.370
I'm impressed with myself.
A really nice plate of food, well-cooked my

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.850
