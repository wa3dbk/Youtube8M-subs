00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.680
this is weird

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
this is my first time to talk to a camera

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900
this is the question

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.920
Is it possible to come be here in the Philippines

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960
to learn how to speak tagalog in just one year?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
this is just the original concept of my project

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.200
and then I realized

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.060
how complicated it is to speak tagalog

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880
and how intriguing is this language

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.060
boom! right away

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.880
i was interested in Filipino because

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.320
i noticed that is it's like

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680
a language that made up of many other languages

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880
as if it is made up of three parts

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.700
me the which is that the collar

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.740
and I studied four years of Spanish

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.000
in school (escuela) and there!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.700
that's spanish

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.800
'escuela"

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.360
and I am fluent in English because

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.760
that's my first language

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.500
So I thought this should be easy

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.240
I only need to learn the third remaining

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.340
part, the Tagalog part

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.440
right?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.340
susmarya (jesusMary) I am completely wrong

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.680
there's so many many many many

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.540
many, many, many

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.740
reason why it is hard to

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.880
learn Tagalog

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.720
and we will go back to that another time

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.580
or else

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.420
we will be here for as long as we live

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.360
forever

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.400
forever

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520
But one of the biggest

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.940
reason why

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.780
it is hard to learn is

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.340
there are are so many style of Tagalog

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.980
If you dont know what I am pertaining to

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.900
Find out on this series

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080
which bring us to the title

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.180
of this series

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.180
it is like a movie

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.200
focuses on the different styles of tagalog

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340
and at the same time I will master

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.960
all of it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680
so I made this prologue to explain to you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.740
and I would like to reply to your future questions like

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.540

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.100
