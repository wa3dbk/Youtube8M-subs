00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:11.530
In a large bowl, mix the spices, cilantro, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar. 

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:21.680
Add a little bit of water, just enough 
 to make the marinade more liquid. 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.660
Get the beef (or lamb) liver already cleaned and sliced from 
 your butcher so you dont have to do extra work.

00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:45.710
Place the liver slices in the marinade and mix well.

00:02:46.968 --> 00:02:53.550
Cover the bowl and place in the fridge for 
 at least 2 hours (ideally overnight).  

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:20.150
Pour some olive oil in a flat pan, enough 
 to cover the surface of the pan.

00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.720
Place some all-purpose white flour in a plate.

00:03:28.426 --> 00:03:34.830
Place the liver slices on the flour on both sides. 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:54.480
Shake the excess flour and place the liver in hot olive oil. 
 Cook each side of the liver slide for a few minutes.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:17.400
Poke the liver with a fork to check if it is done - 
 you should not see any pink liquid coming out from it. 

00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:29.790
It has a very light pink tint but not brown, 
 otherwise, it's overcooked and it will become chewy. 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:43.960
Serve hot or cold, along with mashed potatoes, rice, or in a sandwich.
