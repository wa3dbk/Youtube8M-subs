00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:12.780
I wander through this undawning night on an endless journey

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.500
By a road that reaches far into the distant sky

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:36.420
The moon again tonight shines its light upon the world

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:46.010
O how I cannot escape this dreamlike tale!

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.600
“This red thread…

00:00:52.150 --> 00:01:01.210
Where does it lead? What is it pointing to?”

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.100
Without a sound,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:15.800
I swallow these meaningless questions

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:28.520
Under the drifting clouds, even though the ages may fade

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:41.450
With this unchanging life, I can keep shining for you…

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:05.380
Moistening the earth, your tears

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.870
Sank into my heart and for an instant, reflected it…

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.230
I’m overflowing with emotions

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.900
More than I can convey in words

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:39.440
From now on, let’s face the coming morning

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.890
Together

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:57.340
Overcoming even time and space, may my gaze, though fraught with sin

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:09.950
Lead you on to happiness…

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:53.790
Under the drifting clouds, even though the ages may fade

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:05.560
With this unchanging life, I can keep shining for you…

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:17.400
Overcoming even time and space, may my gaze, though fraught with sin

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:32.750
Lead you on to happiness…
