Hey, what's going on, YouTube?

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.310
This is El Tiro, and
today's Tutorial Thursday,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.510
where we give you a
new concept or move

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.760
to add to your freestyle.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.250
Today we're going to give
you three different concepts

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.860
to add to your footwork.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.350
All right, let's get started.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.200
So the first concept
we're going to get to

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.610
is a nice way you
can do a 180 turn.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.610
So to do that, it
looks like this.

00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:30.825
So this is pretty simple.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:33.420
All you got to do is
take your right foot,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.860
and then lift the heel up so
you're kind of on the toe.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.830
Then my left foot is going to
slide underneath that area.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.830
Then I'm going to
twist to the right.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.406
Now, both my toes are
pointing in this direction.

00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:50.650
They're exactly facing the same
way, parallel to each other.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.680
And then this is where I'm
going to twist to the left.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.240
And that's going to make me
able to twist all the way around

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.520
in a 180.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.344
Again from the back side.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.925
Now that you got that one
down, number two is going

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:10.050
to be a nice hot move
and then some really

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.970
cool flip switches
to get us back.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.740
And so it looks like this.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.605
So this one is really
simple if you break it down.

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:25.940
All you're going to be doing
is hopping with your feet

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.200
out, wider than your shoulders.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.220
You'll bend in naturally.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.815
And then all I'm
doing really fast

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:34.370
is I'm moving my toes
and my heels separately.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.180
So go one, two, three,
and then back to begin.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.065
Could take you a little more
or less, more than three

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:42.190
or four steps.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.010
Depends on how wide
you jump and then

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.730
how fast you're
bringing in the end.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.280
So really slow,
you got your hop.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.350
You're sunk in like a
mini squat position.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.010
And now we're going toe,
heel, toe, heel, toe.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.510
Pop.

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:00.810
The third concept I'm
going to give to you guys

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.320
for some footwork is a fancier
and smoother transition.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.570
It involves putting your
foot and wrapping it

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.300
around your body
to kind of twist.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.600
So breaking it down,
it looks like this.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.320
So here's how you do it.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.570
You're going to take
your right foot.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.160
You're going to swing
that around your body.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.330
Everything else is pretty
much staying still.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.192
When I get to where a point
where I can't go any further,

00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:34.025
I'm actually going to
twist as far as I can,

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:35.940
my heel facing forward.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.024
Now, I can get my heel
facing right in front of me.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.976
Sometimes your flexibility might
not be able to go that far.

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:42.976
So go as far as you can.

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:45.620
From here, all I'm
doing is having

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.580
my body follow my heel patterns.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.980
So I'm just twisting
to the right

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.860
until my feet are
aligned up center again.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.000
One more time.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.840
Right here we have
your right foot.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900
It wraps around your body.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.251
And then you get to a point
where you cannot go any

00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:03.750
further.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.234
You twist your heel.

00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:06.900
And then the rest of
your body is simply

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.930
going to be turning to
match your right foot.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.090
And then you're back
to the center again.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.924
So those are the three
concepts for footwork

00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:16.423
that I'm going to
throw at you today

00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:18.110
for today's Tutorial Thursday.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.850
I actually just made
a freestyle video,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.150
and I incorporate
some of these moves

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.770
and other types of
transition of footwork.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.677
You can click right
here to check that out.

00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:29.260
Other than that, if
you have questions

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.966

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:32.910
how to dance in the
style of popping,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.590

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.130
I try to comment to every
single comment back to you guys.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.274
So questions,
comments, feedback,

00:03:42.274 --> 00:03:44.690

next tutorial, all you gotta to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.000
