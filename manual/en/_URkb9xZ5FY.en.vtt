00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.537
Lexus has always been

00:00:46.537 --> 00:00:48.325
the outsider in its class

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:50.334
They want to offer something different

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.843
from their German competitors

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:55.671
just like Jaguar does with the XF

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:57.863
and every time I drive a Lexus

00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:00.495
it manages to surprise me

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:02.447
it really speaks to me

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:06.203
a while ago, we drove an IS300h F-sport

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:08.871
which on paper is not very exciting

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:10.125
but when you see it

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:11.379
in real life

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:13.204
it looks fantastic

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:15.965
it was also very nice to drive

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:17.689
there were a few flawes

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.542
but I could forgive it for those

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:22.642
today, we have the GS

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:23.928
also the 300h

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:26.469
because we were impressed by that powertrain

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.391
very interesting to lease (in NL)

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:32.928
and of course with the F-Sport package

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:37.393
which makes the GS really stand out

00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:02.630
every line is a bit sharper

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.983
big 19" anthracite wheels

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.433
they do that very well at Lexus

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:09.283
it does come with a price tag though

00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:13.212
the GS starts at around €47.000,- (NL)

00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:16.284
an F-Sport will set you back €67.000,- (NL)

00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:18.298
you might think €20k is a lot of money

00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:20.582
and it is

00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:24.258
but you get everything you might wish for

00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:27.362
and I think you'd pay more with a German car

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:30.496
you'd be at around €30k worth of extra's

00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:32.099
it has everything

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.672
heated steering wheel

00:02:33.672 --> 00:02:35.955
radar guided cruise control

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:39.816
a beautiful 12.3" screen

00:02:39.816 --> 00:02:43.457
that looks so damn good

00:02:43.457 --> 00:02:47.441
also ventilated and heated seats

00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:49.365
LED headlights

00:02:49.365 --> 00:02:51.595
adaptive ride control

00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:52.688
you can set it here

00:02:52.688 --> 00:02:54.569
with the sport button

00:02:55.744 --> 00:02:59.356
you can change from ECO mode

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:05.031
to sport and sport plus

00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:07.385
it means the dampers tighten up

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:09.358
the steering gets heavier

00:03:09.358 --> 00:03:11.739
and the engine sharpens

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.903
and you notice that difference

00:03:13.903 --> 00:03:16.063
inside here it looks fantastic

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:17.533
also feels great

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:21.078
the entire car is about comfort

00:03:21.078 --> 00:03:24.784
the dampers are very comfortable

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:30.029
it filters everything out on the highway

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:34.443
you can feel it does that amazingly

00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:39.208
I feel like I'm in an expensive Tokyo hotel

00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:41.717
gorgeous red leather

00:03:41.717 --> 00:03:46.357
if you get it, go for this with contrasting stitching

00:03:46.357 --> 00:03:48.614
it's also very soft

00:03:48.614 --> 00:03:51.151
I keep touching it

00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:55.382
these aluminium accents

00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:57.395
and these buttons here

00:03:57.395 --> 00:03:59.599
in a single frame aluminium facing

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.582
all look incredible

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:25.985
In the IS300h we had the moving rev counter

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:28.607
that slides towards one side if you change a setting

00:04:28.607 --> 00:04:33.729
that was how it grabbed me

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.638
and in this, it's the big screen

00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:38.057
when you change settings

00:04:38.057 --> 00:04:40.285
it's so sharp

00:04:40.285 --> 00:04:45.054
it's almost Ultra HD sharp

00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:48.133
it's a pity it's connected to

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.360
Lexus' mouse system

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.938
it doesn't work very well

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:56.510
it takes some getting used to

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.845
when you look at the 0-100km/h time

00:05:08.845 --> 00:05:10.287
9,2 seconds

00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:17.222
that's not very quick

00:05:17.222 --> 00:05:19.972
but it feels and is quite a lot quicker

00:05:19.972 --> 00:05:24.330
it delivers 223hp from both engines

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.343
and with the inexpensive lease costs

00:05:28.343 --> 00:05:31.702
that is a great combination

00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:34.272
at a great price

00:05:34.272 --> 00:05:35.721
you really feel that they've done

00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:38.922
over 1.6 million km to test it

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.370
to get it all balanced

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.812
that's something you feel

00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:45.920
everything is so well balanced

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.085
and that is very typical of the Japanese

00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:58.900
as you drive this car

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.217
one thing is very important

00:06:00.217 --> 00:06:01.888
and that is a system that works well

00:06:01.888 --> 00:06:05.392
which is intuitive to operate

00:06:05.392 --> 00:06:07.748
this doesn't

00:06:07.748 --> 00:06:10.229
i can't get used to it

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.649
it's not intuitive at all

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:17.063
but if you'd ask me if I'd take this car

00:06:17.063 --> 00:06:18.769
over a German competitor

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:19.749
I would say yes

00:06:19.873 --> 00:06:23.101
I think this is a fantastic car

00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:26.554
I love the exclusivity

00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:30.892
the E-Class, A6 and 5-series are so common

00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:32.300
these days

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.438
and I love the fact that people notice this car

00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:37.319
also because of the F-Sport package

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:38.669
and they appreciate it

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.088
they think it's special and so do I

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:43.220
and that is exactly what it is

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.657
it is an outsider, sure, but a great one!
