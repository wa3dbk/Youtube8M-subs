00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.960
I need to sew this closed and I am going to
do a top stitch on it, but I think at the

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.500
same time I am going to go around and make
a decorative stitch on the edge of this. If

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.330
you can look at this one, that is what I did
on this one too. I just think it looks really

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.890
cute, the teal on one side and the black on
the other side. I just think it looks really

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.609
good and finished. I am going to start right
here at the opening and from when I did the

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.189
casing I still had the purple on top and the
black on bottom and that is what I want. I

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:39.980
am just going to start right here on the edge
of it.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.360
This is probably the most difficult part of
this is keeping these two together, but since

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.730
you pinned it, it should be real easy. You
can use as many pins as you want. Just try

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.720
not to run over them, you do not want to break
a needle. Okay, so that is the closing and

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.380
now I am just going to go all the way around,
put a decorative stitch. I am going to stop

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.580
and make sure it looks good. Yes, no purple
showing through. We do two colors at once

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.040
like one color on top one color on bottom.
Sometimes you can adjust the tension on your

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.580
sewing machine to make the threads meet were
they are suppose to and not where one shows

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.480
up on the other side. That looks good. If
your fabric tries to roll a little bit, don't

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.190
worry about it. We will press it down. Some
of it likes to roll like that, but that is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:55.550
okay. When you press it it lays down nice
and smooth. Okay, and there it is closed up

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.880
and as soon as I get a little press I think
I am going to start running the drawstring

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.750
through the casing and then we will really
get to see what it looks like.
