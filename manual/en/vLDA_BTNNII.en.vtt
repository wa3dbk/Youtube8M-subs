Hi, this is Hillary from Blue, and let’s
check out Yeti.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.360
Yeti is a multi-pattern USB microphone. 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.950
As a plug and play USB microphone, it connects directly to the USB port on your laptop or desktop computer, 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.630
and without having to download any other software will work with your favorite recording program,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.500
 whether you’re recording to GarageBand or Audacity, podcasting, dictation, or even Skype.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.660
Yeti features three condenser capsules. 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.760
A condenser capsule delivers that rich, detailed audio you typically find in studio recordings.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.100
As a multi-pattern microphone, Yeti offers four polar pattern options 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.540
 – or, directions in which the mic will pick up sound.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.540
 Yeti will record in cardiod, which is directionally to the front,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.180
great for instruments or single-person
podcasts.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.490
Yeti will also record in omnidirectional,
which is 360 degrees around the mic. 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.479
This is great for band practice, a chorus, or a multi-person podcast.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.719
Yeti will also record in stereo, which is
right and left. 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.180
This is great for instrument recording to get your right and left separation.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.420
Or, for voice and vocals, it gives you an open, natural room sound.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.940
And last, Yeti will record in “figure of
eight” – or, bidirectional,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.140
which just means front and back. This is great for duets or interviews.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.680
Yeti features some studio controls directly
on the mic. 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.820
On the back, above your polar pattern selection, you have analog gain control,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.140
which allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the microphone. 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.800
You can also plug headphones
directly into Yeti for zero latency direct monitoring, 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.400
which is great for multitracking
or just being able to hear exactly what you’re recording 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.180
without any echo or delay. 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.380
Yeti features headphone volume on the front, as well as a mute button,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.000
 in case you have to sneeze in the middle of a podcast.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.809
Yeti comes with this desktop stand 

00:01:56.809 --> 00:02:01.469
but also has a standard thread for connecting to a traditional mic stand,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.499
 or Radius, which is
Yeti’s custom shock mount sold separately.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.279
