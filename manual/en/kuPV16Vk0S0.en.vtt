Rashad Hussain:
Hello, my name is Rashad Hussain
and I am the President's Special

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.834
Envoy to the Organization
of the Islamic Conference.

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:09.100
I want to take a couple of
minutes to introduce myself and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.667
describe what I will be doing to
help implement the partnerships

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.900
that the President described in
his visionary "new beginning"

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.033
address in Cairo last summer.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.967
As the President said in Cairo,
Islam is a part of the American story.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.400
And just as we must speak out
against negative stereotypes of

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.633
Islam, we must also speak out
against negative stereotypes

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:29.533
that depict America
as hostile to Islam.

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:32.934
Indeed, my own personal story
demonstrates how Muslims enjoy

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:36.233
enormous opportunity within
the United States to pursue

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:38.867
their dreams while
practicing their faith.

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:40.867
I was born in Rawlins,
Wyoming, where my father

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:42.567
worked as a mining engineer.

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:45.300
My father, who grew up in a
village with no electricity,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.867
came to the United States from
India in 1970, after he was

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:51.333
fortunate enough
to land a work visa.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:55.033
When I was very young, my
family moved to Plano, Texas.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.166
I had a fairly normal childhood
- I was on the basketball team

00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.567
in high school.

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:02.633
I was in the orchestra,
and did debate.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.500
I even played George
Washington in a school play.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.767
Although I was always one of the
only Muslims at the schools I

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.266
attended, I remember my
classmates and teachers being

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.667
interested in learning
more about Islam when they

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.367
observed me praying or
fasting during Ramadan.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.233
While my mother is a doctor and
both of my siblings went into

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.800
medicine, I always had a
passion for government and law.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.533
After graduating
from high school,

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.633
I attended the University
of North Carolina,

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.934
where I studied political
science and philosophy.

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:32.500
And I remain a loyal Tar Heel
basketball fan to this day.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.967
Growing up, going to school,
and working in America,

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:37.300
I've spent time and practiced
my faith with Muslims wherever

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.367
I have lived.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.500
I've met Muslim athletes,
artists, doctors, entrepreneurs,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
law enforcement officers,
military servicemen and women,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.133
politicians, students, teachers,
and workers of all types.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.100
And I have seen people of all
faiths work together in inner

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.200
cities and rural towns to
serve their communities all

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.934
across the country.

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.300
I first became involved in
government working for former

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.600
House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.700
I later joined the House
Judiciary Committee,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.133
and it was during my time on
Capitol Hill when we were

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:08.133
attacked on September 11, 2001.

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:11.100
Like my fellow citizens, I was
shocked and saddened by what

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.767
took place on that day, but
determined to help make sure

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.433
that such attacks
never happened again.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:19.200
As I pursued the study of
national security in law school,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.100
I focused on coming up
with solutions that would

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.033
protect our country without
disrupting our way of life.

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.800
I continue to be committed
to this task today.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.533
It is a job that is not always
easy and one that has sometimes

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.300
been a source of
tension between the U.S.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.233
and Muslim communities
around the world.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:35.834
But it is a challenge that we
share and one we will work

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:38.734
together to meet insha
Allah, God willing.

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.633
As someone involved in the
fields of Islamic Studies,

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:43.967
government, and foreign policy,
I am also keenly aware of the

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:46.834
broader set of issues that form
the basis for relations between

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.867
the United States
and Muslim communities.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.600
The President has eloquently
laid out a vision for how we can

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.066
address some major issues of
concern shared by the United

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.400
States, these communities,
and all people of the world.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.066
It is a comprehensive,
government-wide,

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.900
and people to people approach
to resolving not only political

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.000
differences and security issues,
but also creating strong

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.533
partnerships in a number of
areas that matter in peoples'

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:10.967
daily lives, including
education, entrepreneurship,

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:13.800
health, and science
and technology.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.900
It is a vision based on the
premise that people of all

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.834
faiths share the same
fundamental aspirations - to

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:22.233
live in peace and security; to
get an education and to work

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:24.400
with dignity; to
love our families,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.900
our communities, and our God.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.467
These are the principles and the
areas of partnership that the

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:31.734
United States stands
for around the world,

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:33.567
and that I will
continue to pursue.

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.100
We are already moving forward in
many of these areas and as the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.700
President has reminded us,
progress will be judged not

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.166
based on words, but our actions.

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:44.500
I am honored to serve and I look
forward to updating you on our

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.367
progress in the coming months.

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:47.967
Thank you. Assalamu alaykum
