00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:17.920
The 
Super Nintendo saw some of the best Kirby

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.970
games we’ve ever had with fun games like
Kirby’s Superstar and Kirby’s Dream Land

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.930
3 and then there’s Kirby’s Dream Course,
which was that warped version of Miniature

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.460
Golf.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.640
But do you remember Kirby’s Avalanche from
1995?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.050
The first time I played Kirby’s Avalanche
was when I rented it from the video store

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.050
for a weekend.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.930
My friend had also rented for his Genesis
Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine at the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.050
same time, and it really didn’t take us
too long to notice….we were playing the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.350
same game.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.870
Whether it’s Blobs in Avalanche or Beans
in Mean Bean Machine, the core of the two

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.210
titles are basically identical.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.670
Both titles are versions of the Japanese puzzle
game Puyo Puyo, developed by Compile.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.910
Kirby’s on a mission to defeat king Dedede
and his toadies in an Avalanche Competition,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.270
and trash talks his foes all the way.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.640
In any other game that Kirby is in, he’s
a cuddly, whole-person-swallowing pink puff

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.380
ball, but in this game, he’s got a bit of
a backbone and attitude.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.130
His message is downright clear: Don’t get
in his way.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.090
Different colored blobs fall from the top
of the screen and you need to make matches

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.759
of 4 or more blobs to string together combos.

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.859
Like other falling-block games, if you fill
up your area, it’s game over.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.000
Unlike Mean Bean Machine, there’s no password
here, so you’ll be moving colored blobs

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.259
and sending Garbage to your enemy’s well
till the ultimate showdown with King Dedede

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.259
in one run.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.549
Good thing you can pause, because this game
can be very difficult.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.929
That’s one thing about puzzle games that
I really like: they sometimes start easy but

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.429
get really hard later.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.240
Kirby’s always been a short and easy series
of games to me, never presenting the kind

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.340
of challenge that some gamers want.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.179
But there’s more here than a short, easy
colorful puzzle game; there’s some great

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.130
challenge in the later levels.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.570
Even on normal difficulty, the last 5 or 6
levels are very challenging and you may get

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.110
have to play them over a few times before
moving on.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.270
I got stuck on Bugsy here for a while recording
this.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:26.500
And that guy is a jerk.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.250
Is there a reason to play Kirby’s Avalanche
over Mean Bean Machine?

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.360
While there’s are no major differences between
the two games, Kirby’s Avalanche is a lot

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
more colorful and bright than its Genesis
counterpart, and the music’s a nice remix

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.020
of the familiar Kirby tunes But Mean Bean
has a password system, and it’s available

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.590
on Genesis, Master System, and Sega Game Gear
so you can take it on the go.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.210
…. The choice, is ultimately yours, but
any of these games are a great addition to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.520
your puzzle collection.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.940
But if you’re a big fan of Kirby, Kirby’
s Avalanche has all the characters, and it’s

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:05.200
a lot of fun.
