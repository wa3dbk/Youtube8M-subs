00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:10.369
I'd like to reconvene the meeting of the board
of trustees. Thank all of you for being here

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.679
today this is a historic day in the life of
Kent State University. Our community has waited

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:23.480
patiently for the presidential search to reach
its conclusion, and I am delighted to announce

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.039
that today is that day. Ladies and gentleman
I am pleased to recognize President-elect

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.710
Dr. Beverly J. Warren as the next President
of Kent State University. Dr. Warren would

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650
you please stand and be recognized.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.600
A university
is really formed by its people and I have

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.339
been so impressed with the people of Kent
State University. I have much more to learn

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.740
and looking around this room I know I have
much more to learn. And I'm so gratified that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.009
so many individuals are very interested in
the future of this institution. I want to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.229
thank the board of trustees for your confidence
in me and the trust that you have invested

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.469
in me. My pledge is a 24/7 high energy commitment
to this institution and to the ideals that

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.579
I know you articulated to me and want to see
the best future for this university. 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.300
This is just a wonderful moment for me. I have
followed Kent State for many, many years and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.391
most recently looking at the trajectory of
what Kent State has accomplished in recent

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.869
years much to the credit of the current President,
Lester Lefton. It's an exciting place I know

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.210
that Kent State is becoming a destination
university. It's moving forward in its research

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.060
trajectory, and I think this is really an
exciting time to come and be apart of this

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.720
wonderful experience. We all owe a deep gratitude
to President Lefton I was a attracted to this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.510
institution Lester because of what you have
worked to build over the last eight years.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.080
This is an institution on the rise and I won't
say that lightly. I come from a similar institution

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.400
with similar aspirations, and I know the hard
work that it takes for us to continue to move forward.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.900
I think parents can expect that I
take very seriously the education of their

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.560
children. Their safety will be first and foremost
for me. We will make sure that this is a safe

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.420
environment that they can feel good about
where their children are attending. And they're

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.479
going to learn in a classroom. They're going
to be engaged. And what I hope every student

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.569
will say when they walk across the stage and
go and see their parents they're going to

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.229
say this place changed my life. 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.140
 I have so
much more to learn about Kent State University

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.269
there are at least 100 or so people in here who have
points of view. There are at least 42 thousand

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.590
students who have a point of view and there
are many more faculty and staff from whom

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.610
I need to learn what you believe is the hope,
the promise, the dream of Kent State University

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.370
because to me what a President does is to
articulate 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.370
to the world your desires for your university.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.480
 Kent State University President
Dr. Lester Lefton and please welcome Kent

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.220
State University's new President-elect Dr.
Beverly J. Warren. 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.440
The first thing I want to do is to listen and to learn.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.500
I think I need to meet many, many people, and I am looking

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.360
forward to meeting faculty and students and
staff. I'm looking forward to hearing what

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.319
others say they think is the brightest future
for Kent State this will be a collaborative

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.180
process. I'm really looking forward to that
journey of finding out more about Kent and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.060
more about the people that make up Kent.
