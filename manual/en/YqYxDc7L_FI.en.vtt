00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
finally tonight small talk

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.500
very small talk

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.450
scientists have long studied how various

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.249
creatures communicate: dolphins in the

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.589
water chimpanzees on land birds in

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.810
flight but insects could they possibly

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.759
have anything to say?

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.620
Well when it comes to the tiny ant

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.960
it turns out the answer maybe yes!

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.820
Here's Nick Watt.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.760
Ants live in highly structured societies. They are masters of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.890
architecture and even agriculture and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.700
now, scientists tell us, ants actually talk

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.360
to each other! (ants making noise)

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.140
Speaker: Were you surprised about what you've found? 
Scientists: We were, yes! Absolutely, yes we were surprised!

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000
With an iPod an old pair of headphones they

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310
discovered worker ants are indifferent

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.889
to rock music but stand guard when a

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.320
distressed queen makes this particular

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.620
sound.
(ant sound)

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.980
They stand on the speaker with their

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.020
drones and mandibles opened something

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.990
like saying: I'm defending my queen!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.780
Now no one is saying these little

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.340
creatures talk like they do in the movies.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.840
Ant: Now stay calm we are going around the leaf! 
Other ant: Around the leaf? I don't think we can do that!

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.040
But they do have a kind of language.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.700
Scientist: Look at the back end of the end

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.999
that's the abdomen moving up and down

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.550
vibrating. That's how ants make noise

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.680
that's how they talk to each other.
(ant noise)

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.660
Scientists made these startling

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.060
discoveries by accident while studying

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.910
the large blue butterfly. They watched

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.550
butterfly pew pie trick and into taking

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.680
them to ant nests and nurturing them

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.570
until they hatched!

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.210
Why? Well amazingly the butterfly

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.630
Pewpie imitate the ant queens distinctive

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.510
voice. Butterflies have learned to speak

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.980
this mysterious ant language,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.500
a language humans have only just discovered.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.380

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.560
I hope you understood what they had to say. That's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.460
all news for this Tuesday. I'm

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.410
Charlie Gibson and i hope you had a good

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.000
day! For all of us at ABC News:

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.480
Have a good night!
