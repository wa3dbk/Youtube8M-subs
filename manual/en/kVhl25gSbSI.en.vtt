00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.950
As they say, one man's trash is another man's
treasure.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.000
You know, my friend Mitchell is very, very
clever.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.560
She's come up with a way to do a unique bulletin
board using things that most would ordinarily

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.020
toss out.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.280
Hey, somebody's throwing away this perfectly
good memo board.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.710
That's what I see anyway.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.680
Spray paint is awesome.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.450
And I like an industrial look for this.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.890
You know how you get just piles of stuff on
tables.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.719
And then you go "Oh, no, I need that phone
number," "I might need that beret."

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.930
Well, I'm about to make a solution for all
of that.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.850
It's not just a normal cork bulletin board,
but with these little slots and holes and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.480
wire, it's a good size, we'll be able to hold
all kinds of things.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.770
Everything else I need, besides this great
find, is in my house right now.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.490
Alright, I'm gonna get a good first coat of
this.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.319
Some paint, you might wanna do another coat,
but a lot of times one coat will do it because

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.619
it's metal and it's spray paint.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.140
Yep, it's dry.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.770
Let's go hang it.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:36.009
Okay, so I have three nails to support it,
and it hangs on its own.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.789
Here's the magic thing about this: You can
pretty much use anything to hang and hang

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:42.789
it.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.420
So I got clips.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.719
Put that there.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.929
You can use a clothes pin.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.149
Hanging that there.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:02.340
I'm gonna use these s-hooks to hang a little
shelf for all the little catch-all things

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.350
that end up laying around.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.069
Throw a paper clip in when I go by.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.200
Now I know where my stamps are.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.340
Now I know where something I need to not forget
is.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.250
You can use this hook for something.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.590
Found picture of some lady that I found years
ago that I absolutely love.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.650
She reminds me that life is amazing.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:38.590
You can even weave a scarf through, hang your
scarves on this.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.130
Or hang your shirt up here on the corner.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.900
There's so many things that you can do with
this.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.560
This can be your catch-all for everything
that you don't have a regular place for.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.859
And I made this from something I found outside
and stuff I already had around my house that

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:23.340
you probably have too.
