00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:04.340
When setting up the rotary table the first thing we need to do is make sure

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.440
the spindle is over the center of the point we wish to rotate about

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.880
which will be the center of the rotary table we've created a hole here that we

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.929
can indicate

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.019
first thing we'll do is eye ball it up
and make sure with the tool were roughly

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.679
over center of our hole which is over
the center of the rotary table

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.689
so by eye we will get close and then we will
add our indicator

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.650
to the spindle

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.939
and indicate the hole

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.750
until it's exactly on center

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.640
once we have indicated the hole
 so that the indicator

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.700
reads the same all around

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.000
we then now know we are on center

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
set the digital readout to read X/Y zero

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.770
now we can set up our part

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.370
the center of the rotary table and the part

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.820
we no need to do

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.270
is move the Y axis

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.910
so that the edge of the tool

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.750
will be past the edge of our part

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.870
we will feed our  y axis into the appropriate number

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.610
and then engauge the rotary table to go around

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.580
in this particular case

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.470
we have a half-inch diameter cutting
tool

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.030
and we require a
 three-eighths radius on our part

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.340
so we will move our tool way out in the Y axis
turn on the spindle

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.909
lower down here in the clearance of the  fixture

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.830
then feed into our numbers
 are numbered we're going 
to feed into on the Y axis

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.280
leaving the X on zero

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.800
is the radius of our cutter plus the
radius of the part

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.409
so we have a 3/8 part radius

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.130
plus a 1/4 inch tool radius

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.130
three-eighths and one quarter is five eights

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.980
once you reach 5/8's

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.980
lightly lock the Y axis
the tool should be just touching the material

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.669
we want a full 180 degree arc
so we will rotate the table

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.149
from 90 degrees

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.739
plus 180

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.329
to 270 degrees

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.140
and then again

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.140
feed the tool off of our part in the Y axis

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.389
once you have reached exactly 270 degrees

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:08.389
unlock the Y axis and feed the tool away

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:10.039
stop the spindle

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:11.509
and we are done our part

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.979
we have now made a 3/8's radius into the end of our part
