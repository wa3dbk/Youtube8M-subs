00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.950
Today on this 2003 Buick Rendezvous were going
to install part number 118383 from Tow Ready.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.360
The first thing we need to do is go ahead
and open up the hatch and remove the two taillights

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.940
and disconnect the electrical from them.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.501
With the lights removed well go ahead and
loosen up the wire harness that goes into

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:22.501
the body.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.090
Pull the grommet out and move it to the side
for now.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.840
Next well go on the interior of the vehicle
and well remove the floor coverings, the threshold

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:42.810
and loosen up the panels on the side.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.930
Now we can go ahead and start installing the
wire harness.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.670
Well take the T connector half with the green
wire and route that through the jack storage

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.690
compartment.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.600
Well take the one half of the connector with
the green wire and route it from the jack

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.880
storage compartment to the outside.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.059
Well also make a slit in the grommet to run
our wire through and then reinstall the grommet.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.860
Well pull it through and then well go ahead
and hook it up to our wire harness and then

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.259
well go ahead and take the white wire with
the ring terminal and ground it to the body.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:32.279
Next well take our four pole harness, well
fold 

00:01:32.279 --> 00:02:03.020
the wire up and put it 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:37.250
up out of our way for now, and keep it with
the jack.
