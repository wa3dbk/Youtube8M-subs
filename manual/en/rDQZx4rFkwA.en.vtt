00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
I found out that

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.160
woolly mammoths

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.300
and Giants,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.580
you can capture their souls

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.460
and put them in the black soul gem.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.820
This woolly mammoth camp here called 'Blizzard Rest'

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.700
That's where my current location is.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.700
So here it is...

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.480
These guys are really tough.  Tough to kill

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.900
and if you don't have very good weapons

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.300
or you haven't progressed enough to get any good spells to work

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.420
this is a way that I found that was pretty easy.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.520
First you gotta get their attention.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.060
I usually just shoot an arrow at them.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.370
okay and then that kinda gets his attention.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.300
What I do is I run up to this mill up here.  There's a mill up here.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.320
I should have told you that before but I get ready to run to this mill

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.000
and they run pretty fast so you gotta kinda sprint there.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.600
These guys are really tough if they hit you like twice your dead.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.900
but there's kind of a secret little area here.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.100
It's this little fenced off area right here where the cattle are.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:42.480
I go in here.  Once you're in here you can shoot arrows at them.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.920
I don't normally like to waste my arrows because you gotta

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.840
shoot like a fn 100 arrows at these guys.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.980
but they can't come in

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.140
but they think they can and they keep thinking that they can come in.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.900
Whoa that was close.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.100
Oops I didn't mean to get that cow like that.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.700
Maybe he's got some beef on him.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.180
Yeah

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.340
Uhh he got me see.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.000
So I like to keep my distance and hit him with some fire.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.400
but the key thing to remember is that he can't come in.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.020
I just dont want him to hit me again.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:19.500
I usually wait until he's almost dead before I cast my soul trap spell

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.200
because once you cast the soul trap spell you only have 60 seconds to kill him

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.980
and these guys usually take a few minutes of punishment before they die.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.420
I found this to be pretty easy because

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.900
these guys are tough.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.000
Ok so let my magic regenerate

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.340
I'll hit him with the bow again.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.300
I'll hit him with some arrows.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.160
Cow's going to get hurt if he stays out there.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.060
Well he's only after me though.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
That doesn't even do much.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.640
If you hit him with that, the Unrelenting Force.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.600
He could hit you right after you hit him with that

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.100
so it doesn't really do much.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.820
It stuns him for like 5 seconds just to get you to either

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.580
jump over the fence or whatever.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.620
Ok so he's almost dead

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.180
I'll hit him once more just so I know he's

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.880
gonna be ready to eat it

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.400
when I cast the soul trap.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.900
Cast soul trap there

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.800
and you'll see it's working because

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.160
the magic went down.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.380
See if I can get him with the mace.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.200
There we go.  See pretty painless.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.300
Probably trapped the soul.  Sometimes it doesn't work though.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.100
The way to find that out is you check your soul.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.520
Yeah there we go so it's filled with grand soul.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.860
That's all you have to do

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.740
and then you take it back to Fallion.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.080
Fast travel.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.580
This is where Fallion lives.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.000
Down here.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.600
The rest is pretty easy.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.320
Ok so you talk to him

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.140
and I've filled the black soul gem.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.440
Now all you have to do is meet him at this place

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.040
and yeah it's pretty close by.
