00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.050
Next, let's add a comping move before the
little routine we've got going on here. What

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.110
usually happens in a sabar solo circle, is
the soloist enters the circle doing some sort

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.309
of comping move that the drummer is echoing.
They can do the move as much as they want,

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.789
the drummer can then either give a break to
sing on the beginning of the solo, or the

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.689
dancer can simply go into the solo, and just
be as possible about the intentions of what's

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.240
coming next, so that the drummer can echo
it. So let's pretend that our solo is going

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.039
to start with our foot twisting move, that's
going to be our comping move, where going

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:41.070
to do our foot twisting move on our way into
the sabar circle. And if we want to count,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:51.910
and, 1 and 2 and 3 and 4; and 1 and 2 and
3 and 4; one more, 1,2,3,4; now the jump,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:05.700
1,2,3 and 4, 1 and 2 and 3 and open, and crown.
Lets try the whole thing again. We'll go into

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.930
our circle with our comping move; and 1 and
2 and 3 and 4; and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4; one

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:29.720
more, 1 and 2 and 3 and 4; and 1,2,3 and 4,
1 and 2 and 3, up, 1,2 and 3. One more time,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.470
we'll go over the whole thing counting it
out; and 1and 2 and 3 and 4; 1 and 2 and 3

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:55.170
and 4; last time, 1 and 2 and 3 and 4, and
then, 1,2,3 and 4, 1 and 2 and 3, 4, 1,2 and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.200
3. And that is our nice little combination
that we can use as a solo into the sabar circle.
