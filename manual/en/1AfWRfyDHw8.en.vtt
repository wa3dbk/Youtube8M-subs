"Changing Our Taste Buds"

00:00:06.457 --> 00:00:09.103
How can we overcome our 
built-in hunger drives 

00:00:09.103 --> 00:00:11.368
for salt, sugar, and fat?  

00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:14.325
We now have scientific evidence 
to back up the claim that 

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:15.667
if you go a few 
weeks cutting down 

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:21.943
on junk food and animal products 
your tastes start to change. 

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:24.840
We now think humans may 
actually taste fat, 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.173
just like we taste 
sweet, sour, and salty.

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:30.039
And people on low fat 
diets start liking 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.649
low fat foods more and 
high fat foods less.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.840
Our tongues may actually become 
more sensitive to fat. 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.932
And the more sensitive 
our tongue becomes, 

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:43.390
the less butter, meat, 
dairy,and eggs we eat. 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.300
Whereas a blunted taste for fat-

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.097
if we pile too much 
of it in our face-

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:49.500
is associated with eating 
more calories, more fat, 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.102
more dairy, meat, and eggs, 
and being fatter ourselves. 

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:57.205
And this change in sensation, 
this numbing of our fat sensation,

00:00:57.205 --> 00:01:00.506
can happen after 
just a few weeks.

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:04.358
Put people on a low salt diet, 
and over the weeks 

00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:07.699
they like the taste of salt-free 
soup more and more, 

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:10.493
and the taste of salty 
soup less and less. 

00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:13.013
Your tastes physically change. 

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:16.373
If you let them salt 
their own soup to taste 

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:20.385
they add less and less the 
longer on the low sodium diet. 

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:25.309
Tastes just as salty 
with half the salt. 

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:30.710
A control group liked lots 
of salt in their soup,  

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.968
but for those who've been 
on sodium restricted diets 

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.293
regularly salted foods, 
taste way too salty, 

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:38.624
and actually preferred 
soup with less. 

00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:41.060
People should be assured 
that their diet 

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:45.540
gradually become more acceptable as 
their taste for salt diminishes. 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.500
The longer we eat healthier 
foods the better they taste.
