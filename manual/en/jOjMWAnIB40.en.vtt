00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.700
&gt;&gt; ON THE SOUTH EDGE OF DALLAS,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.734
IS A FAVORITE SPOT

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:05.100
FOR MOUNTAIN BIKERS -

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.667
CEDAR HILL STATE PARK.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.100
&gt;&gt; IT IS AN ESCAPE RIGHT HERE IN

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.700
THE MIDDLE OF THE METROPLEX.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.700
(tires on bridge)

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.934
THERE'S A THREE MILE LOOP,

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:16.333
AN EIGHT MILE LOOP,

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.700
AND A TWELVE MILE LOOP.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.533
THIS IS A TRAIL FOR EVERYBODY.

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.867
WE WANT EVERYBODY TO COME OUT

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:22.233
AND BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT AT THEIR

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:23.600
LEVEL, TAKE THEIR TIME IF

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.533
THEY WANT TO.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.500
&gt;&gt; IT GOES RIGHT BY THE LAKE.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.266
WE'RE RIGHT HERE AT THE

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.033
TRAILHEAD.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:27.767
&gt;&gt; BUT EVEN FOR THE

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.233
MOST ADVANCED RIDER,

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:31.166
THERE'S PLENTY OF CHALLENGE.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.266
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT SOME REALLY THICK

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.066
WOODED SECTIONS, SECTIONS THAT

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.834
YOU GO ALONG THE LAKE,

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:39.533
FOLLOWED BY SOME PRAIRIE, SO,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.433
A GOOD VARIETY.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.600
AS YOU RIDE AND AS YOU RUN

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.633
THROUGH THE PARK,

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:45.867
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ENGAGED.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:48.066
YOU WON'T BE BORED.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.834
&gt;&gt; I LIKE THE DIVERSITY

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:49.800
OF THE TRAILS.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.867
REAL TECHNICAL,

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:54.834
BUT THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:57.200
WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHBACKS,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.233
A LOT OF CLIMBING, SOME LONG

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:01.400
SLOPES THAT'LL WEAR YOU OUT.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.166
BUT OF COURSE THEN THAT

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.000
MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOT

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.233
A NICE DOWNHILL COMING.

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:05.133
THERE'S ALWAYS A REWARD

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.800
AT THE END OF IT.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.000
(bikes whizzing by)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.467
&gt;&gt; ONE REASON CYCLISTS ENJOY

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:12.266
THESE TRAILS SO MUCH IS THAT

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.133
THEY BUILT AND MAINTAIN THEM.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:14.967
&gt;&gt; DORBA DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:16.333
OF ORGANIZING THE TRAIL

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.300
WORKDAYS.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.333
(group talking)

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.533
&gt;&gt; DORBA IS THE ACRONYM FOR THE

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.166
DALLAS OFF-ROAD BICYCLE

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.433
ASSOCIATION.

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.367
(chainsaw starting)

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.567
THE TRAIL ITSELF HAS BEEN 100%

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:29.633
MAINTAINED BY VOLUNTEER HOURS.

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:30.934
LAST YEAR WAS A RECORD YEAR FOR

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:34.100
US, WE HAD OVER 10,000 HOURS

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.233
CONTRIBUTED TO TRAIL

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:36.734
MAINTENANCE IN NORTH TEXAS,

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:38.400
AND ON THIS TRAIL ALONE,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.066
WE EXCEEDED OVER 750 HOURS.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.967
THAT'S IN ONE YEAR.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.200
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN HIT THOSE MESQUITE

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.266
STUMPS WITH YOUR WEEDEATER.

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.934
MOST OF OUR WORK IS IN CUTTING

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:51.233
BACK THE VEGETATION.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.767
(weedeater)

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.667
IT'S A LABOR OF LOVE.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:55.533
&gt;&gt; ESPECIALLY AS MUCH AS

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.867
WE'RE OUT HERE, WE OWE IT.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.367
BUT YOU KNOW, WE'VE PAST THAT

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:00.467
NOW, I MEAN, THIS IS WHERE

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:01.467
WE WANT TO BE.

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.300
(people chatting)

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.166
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A GOOD WAY

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.200
TO STOP WORK.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.000
A COLD DRINK OF WATER

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.233
AND BREAKFAST.

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:09.700
(music)

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.500
WE TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.200
IN THE TRAIL.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.567
WE'RE OUT HERE ANYWHERE FROM TWO

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:15.266
TO FIVE TIMES A WEEK, RUNNING,

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.533
RIDING THE TRAILS,

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:20.266
OR MAINTAINING THE TRAILS.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:22.166
&gt;&gt; THIS PLACE IS JUST LIKE

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:25.100
A GEM IN THE METROPLEX.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.266
I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:30.533
OH MY GOSH, LOOK AT THE SUN.

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.967
WOW!
