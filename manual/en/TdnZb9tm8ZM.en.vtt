„Prestige to Hungarian fashiondesign”

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.100
This may be the subtitle of the series 
of events called Designers’ Lounge.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.900
These events have been aiming to
 introduce local designers their works

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.800
their works to an audience interested in
unique, innovative designs.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.200
Designers' Lounge is showcasing Hungarian 
designers on a monthly basis.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.000
It’s target audience is ranging from
 mid-to top managers, both women

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.400
and men, aged between 25-50, 
including many expatriates living in

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.600
Budapest. We would like to  provide
 them with exclusive exhibitions,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.000
all day programs, interesting 
happenings that take place every

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.600
month satisfying their needs to meet
and know more about Hungarian designers.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.900
The location, the professional fashion
photoshooting in the background

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.900
were  all contributing to the 
exclusivity of these events.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.700
The showcased items were carefully
 picked by Agnes Bartolf image

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.200
consultant and were presented on
 professional modells.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.300
This dress was inspired by the
rococo, and was created with the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.100
support of a scholarship at the
University of Applied Arts. 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.400
The given theme was creating forms by
pleating which means folding the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.500
material and sewing each pleat
down. This skirt comes with a corset

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.800
and was inspired by the motifs of 
leafs, nervation and waves.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.100
The youngest exhibitor was Engi 
Xenia Petronella  (EXP), who brought

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.900
along her own modells to showcase
 her latest collection.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.100
She drew attention to her elegant 
dresses by brave patterns.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.600
I have mainly exhibited from my latest collection. 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.100
I have also brought along some of my most elegant
pieces, dresses, evening gowns.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.100
The spider as a theme came from a 
material that had spider web

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.300
patterns, this inspired me to do my
 latest collection that i showcased at

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.900
the Budapest Fashion Week with the
 title: ARACHNOFOBIA.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.200
I don’t think Hungarian fashion
designers are as well known in

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.100
Hungary as they should be. People
only hear about those who managed

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.100
to open their own shops or were
able to appear at fashion shows.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.700
They can normally open their 
showrooms too and attract customers.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.000
We want to give the opportunity to those who have not

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.000
been able to finance their way but
their works are surely representing

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.600
quality, creativity and deserve more attention.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.700
