00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Ð¡over version song:  "I love you baby"  Frank Sinatra  

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You're just too good to be true - Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be live heaven to touch - I wanna hold you so much

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:15.000
At long last love has arrived - And I thank God I'm alive
You're just to good to be true - Can't take my eyes off of you

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:29.800
You're just too way that I stare - There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak - There are no words left to speak

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:44.000
But if you feel like i feel - Please let me know that it's real
You're just to good to be true - Can't take my eyes off of you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:13.900
I love you baby - And if it's quite all right
I need you baby - To warm the lonely night
I love you baby - Trust in me when i say

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:28.900
Oh, baby baby - Don't bring me down, i pray
Oh pretty baby - Now that i found you, stay
Let me love you, baby - Let me love you..... 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:42.700
You're just too good to be true - Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be live heaven to touch - And i wanna hold so much

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:57.600
At long last love has arrived - And i thank God I'm alive
You're just to good to be true - Can't take my eyes off of you

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:26.800
I love you baby - And if it's quite all right
I need you baby - To warm the lonely night
I love you baby - Trust in me when I say 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Oh, pretty baby - Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby - Now that I found you, stay

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:45.000
               Let me love you, baby ...
Let me love you, baby ...  -  Let me love you ...
