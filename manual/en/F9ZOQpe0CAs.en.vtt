00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.470
Not all SEO companies are made the same.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.830
If you're looking for a company that's going
to promote your specific business, ask around.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.250
It doesn't have to be a local company.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.930
It doesn't have to be someone that's going
to come sit down and review it in person with

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.930
you.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.570
But you should always ask them for their group
of customers.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.369
Ask them for the list of companies that they've
already worked with.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.460
Try to look for companies which are in your
specific niche.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.310
Because oftentimes when these SEO companies,
they go out and they get links for website,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.850
it often depends on the niche that you're
in.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.540
It's a bit complicated to explain, but I can
give you an example.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.930
It's a company that is very good at promoting
Software as a Service.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.440
If they've promoted companies which are in
this specific niche, they probably have contacts

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.020
with news websites, with forums, with blogs,
and with other infinite properties which are

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.680
also in that niche.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.310
They will be able to go to these specific
sources which they've used in the past to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.259
promote your company which is also a Software
as a Service company.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.689
Use common sense.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:15.689
Ask around.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.490
Whenever you find a company that is a company
name, do your due diligence.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.189
Enter their name in Google.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.700
Enter it in quotes so they appear first, and
try to look in places not just web results.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.020
But also try to look in the discussions.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.840
Because oftentimes when people talk about
websites and they're basically venting their

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.700
frustrations, instead of using a news website
they're going to be talking about it on forums.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.210
They're going to say XYZ company was crap,
or XYZ company was actually very good.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.170
Ask people around in your network as well,
and see what type of service they provide.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.240
They should tell you that they're not just
going to be working outside of your website.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.710
What I mean by that is an SEO company approaches
you.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.710
They tell you, "OK.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.889
You've got this website.

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:00.889
Everything is created.

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:01.889
We're just going to take care of it.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.290
We're not going to touch your actual website.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.569
We're going to do everything on the outside."

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.840
It's most probably a sign that the company's
not going to do a good job.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.470
If someone comes in and they're doing SEO
for your website, most of the time they require

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.170
doing changes to your website.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.520
Some people are a bit touchy about that.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.521
"Oh, I don't want them touching it.

00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:19.521
It's perfect."

00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:20.670
It's actually not the case.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.030
They're going to be optimizing your h1 tags.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.880
They're going to be optimizing your title
tags.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.200
They're maybe sprinkling additional keywords
around your articles.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.980
They're going to be writing new content for
your website.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.000
They may be even doing things like creating
small applications on your website or writing

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.060
these ultra-detailed articles, which are also
known as link bait.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.230
Those are the type of articles that people
want to link to.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.230
It's so informative.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.330
It's so well written that people will actually
want to link to that content on your website.
