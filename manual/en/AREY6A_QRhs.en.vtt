Hi I'm Charles Stewart, Jr. and I'm going
to show you how to troubleshoot a computer

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.960
that won't start. I know this sounds really
kind of stupid sometimes, but you want to

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.130
make sure that the computer is plugged in
or may that the power strip the computer is

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.920
plugged into is turned on. Because believe
it or not that tends to be the to fix a problem

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.150
most of the time. So if you're hitting the
power button on the computer, and it's not

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.810
turning on. Go over and you know that somehow
that the outlet didn't get you know the cord

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.399
didn't get pulled out of the outlet. Or maybe
the power strip someone accidentally you know

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.530
or it might of flipped the breaker in the
power strip so you might need to turn it back

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.269
on. That's usually I'd say most of the time
will fix your problem. Also you know if you've

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.070
done that you might want to check if someone's
flipped a switch in the house that that outlet

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.430
might be on, which you probably don't want
to have a computer on that outlet if that's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.979
the case. Or go check the breaker and make
sure that no breakers have been flipped, that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.839
that outlet could have been on. And if you've
done all that and it's still not booting up

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.640
or turning on, then it's probably the computer,
and in that case you're most likely running

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.741
into either your power supply has died. Or
the motherboard itself is shorted out and

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:16.670
not working anymore. Because at the very least
if your power supply is working, it should

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.939
boot up. If one of those two are working it
should at least boot up and if it's the hard

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.880
drive you'd get an error. So the best thing
to do if you are savvy enough, go buy a new

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.979
hard drive or take it down to Best Buy to
their geek squad and bring your computer in

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.761
and have them swap out the power supply. Probably
the first thing I would do, and then see if

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:42.649
that solves your problem. If your computer
cranks right back up then you know it's a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.370
power supply, and usually they'll die eventually.
That's just one of the things that will happen

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.631
over time, your power supply will die. Hopefully
your computer will be around long before it

00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:58.909
does decide to go out. The next thing would
be the motherboard. Now if that happens, you

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.280
might as well go ahead and get a new computer.
Because that's kind of the back bone of the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.110
computer, is your motherboard. So if something's
gone wrong with that then you'd have to swap

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.040
that out. Which could be if you built the
computer a fifty dollar or a one hundred dollar

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.550
part, but if you have a manufacturer computer
like a Dell or a HP, that's not a good thing.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.390
Granted if you are still under warranty you
want to make sure you haven't void the warranty

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.530
by opening the case or anything. Send it back
and have them replace that for you. Again

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.420
the geek squad over at Best Buy they'd probably
be able to tell those questions, and help

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.370
you out with that most of all. And that's
pretty much it for troubleshooting a computer

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.530
that's not starting up.
