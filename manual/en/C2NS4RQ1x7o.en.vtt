YAN WAN: Typical Wi-Fi has a granted limit of 100 meters.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.900 position:97%
This is not as efficient when we are talking about either high

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.830 position:91%
speed or drones. What we're doing here is we're having the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.500 position:75%
directional antenna that can extend the distance

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.470 position:94%
significantly. So the key thing in our [] is the directional

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.130 position:88%
antenna and also the [] control. These two work together

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.000 position:88%
to be able to extend the distance up to five kilometers.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.770 position:98%
So this would be very useful in for instance disaster scenarios

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.900 position:88%
when the cell tower is down so there is no communication

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.470 position:86%
infrastructure. However, in order to enable information

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.200 position:97%
dissemination, the coordination among the rescue teams and the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.230 position:97%
control centers, we have to have a structure available to make

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.130 position:89%
all of this happen. This is what we're trying to provide.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.530 position:97%
When we use directional antennas there's a key challengeâ€”the key

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.900 position:89%
challenge is that when the direction are not aligned, the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.330 position:97%
communication is []. So when the drones are moving or there is a

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.000 position:95%
big wind or things like that, the communication can be easily

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.370 position:56%
disrupted. So what we have here is a

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.070 position:95%
directional control that can self-align the directions of the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.570 position:98%
antennas to make sure that the antennas on different drones can

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.270 position:73%
be aligned to establish the communication link.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470 position:89%
I have a project from NSF [] physical systems on the next

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.330 position:95%
generation aviation system so the purpose how to manage flows

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.500 position:73%
to equate the safety and efficiency of the next

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.000 position:91%
generation aviation. We cannot rely all the communications

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.800 position:84%
through the ground or satellite so if we can have this

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.030 position:89%
technology developed for the drone-to-drone or fly-to-fly

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.800 position:70%
communication, we can have better sensing and

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.000 position:59%
better coordination and better safety.
