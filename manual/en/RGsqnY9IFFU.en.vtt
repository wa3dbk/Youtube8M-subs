00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.060
Hi, I’m Jack Hayes, director of the
National Weather Service. Thank you for stopping

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.059
by to review with us the past year of historic,
record-breaking extreme weather.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.820
You know, in my weather career spanning four
decades, I’ve never seen a year quite like 2011.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.810
Sure, we’ve had years with extreme
flooding, extreme hurricanes, extreme winter

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.349
snowstorms, and even extreme tornado outbreaks.
But I can’t remember a year like this, in

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.169
which we experienced record-breaking extremes
of nearly every conceivable type of weather.

00:00:33.169 --> 00:00:38.810
NOAA scientists have been at the forefront
of advancing weather and climate science,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.670
forecasting and public preparedness for decades.
We have a leading role in understanding changes

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.060
in weather and climate extremes. And our science
helps save lives and livelihoods.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.720
Yet, 2011 was a challenging year for
America. Twelve separate disasters claimed

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.489
hundreds of lives and each caused a billion
dollars or more in damages.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.489
Extreme weather and associated societal impacts
have increased in recent years. With our changing

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:13.609
climate, the nation must be prepared for more
frequent extreme weather in the future.

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.200
To combat increased vulnerability, communities
across the country must become more resilient

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.950
to extreme weather.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.630
And the good news is there are things we can
do as a country, as a community, as a family,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.520
and as individuals to bolster our ability
to protect our lives and property when severe

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.579
weather threatens. This year we launched a
new initiative called “Weather-Ready Nation.”

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.950
Through this project, NOAA is redoubling efforts
to improve our science and service to America.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.899
Research, education, and outreach are
essential ingredients to improving preparedness

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.499
and our forecast and warning accuracy. Realizing
a “Weather-Ready Nation,” in which society

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.569
is prepared for and responds appropriately
to severe weather, is a vital goal to which

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.259
we must all commit ourselves.

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.170
As you click through this 2011
weather retrospective, I hope you’ll take

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.440
a moment to consider your personal readiness
for severe weather. Visit Ready.Gov to learn

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.810
how you can protect yourself, your family
and your property. We look toward 2012 with

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.000
hopeful optimism for a calmer and safer weather year.
Let’s not forget the tragedies of 2011,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.610
but rather – let them fuel our resolve
to become a more Weather-Ready Nation.
