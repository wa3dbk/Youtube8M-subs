00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.049
The S12 is the second shotgun you unlock in
Black Ops 2 as soon as you unlock create-a-class.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.430
It is the only semi-automatic shotgun in Black
Ops 2 with a very high fire rate cap which

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.290
you are unlikely to hit.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.279
As with every shotgun you only have a limited
range beyond which pallets disappear and you

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.160
cannot get a hitmarker.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.199
Also the pallet spread becomes slightly tighter
when you aim down the sights of the S12 which

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.159
can be useful when enemies are further away.

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.119
When using the S12 you have to manoeuvre the
map so that you only encounter enemies at

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.119
close range.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.610
This is the most difficult aspect of using
shotguns.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.600
Use the mini map to get an impression of where
the enemies are likely to be and try to evade

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.780
enemies that have spotted you but are too
far away.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.460
It is also tough to take on more than two
enemies at the same time, unless they have

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.030
their back towards you, so in combat put cover
between you and any enemies you aren't currently

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.540
shooting at.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.120
If you don't have a choice in taking on an
enemy at the edge of your effective range

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.239
aim down the sights to increases your chances
of winning.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.280
But if enemies are close it is better to fire
from the hip to increases your mobility which

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.260
makes you much harder to hit.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.300
The perks I found most useful with the S12
where Ghost, Toughness, Dexterity and Tactical

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.400
Mask.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.110
Because you have to be close to enemies you
will often have to flank the enemy team.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.470
Ghost will stop a UAV from uncovering your
flanking manoeuvre and ensure that enemies

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.510
can't get ready for you.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.310
You often have to shoot at enemies multiple
times so when they shoot back at you flinching

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.210
will often cause you to miss.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.640
Use Toughness to reduce the impact flinching
has on your aim.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.750
Dexterity makes it easier to climb and lets
you get ready for enemies much faster after

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.010
sprinting.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.439
Often when you flank enemies they have set
up counter measures to try and stop you from

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170
shooting them in the back.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.250
Tactical mask prevents you from being trapped
by tactical equipment.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.950
Fast mag reduces the time it takes to reload
the S12.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.580
I found that this can be useful when enemies
come at you in waves, but fast mag doesn't

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.320
help if you run out of ammunition in the middle
of a gun fight.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.370
The stock increases your movement speed whilst
aiming.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.969
This makes strafing much more effective and
lets you get close to enemies easier whilst

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.010
aiming down the sights.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.869
But both of these situations are unusual and
should be avoided as much as possible since

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.180
even with the stock you will be hard pressed
to win such engagements.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.520
The suppressor is a potent attachment for
the S12.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.040
You have to keep in mind that your range is
somewhat reduced so you need to be closer

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.269
to enemies.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.000
Use cover and restrain from firing when you
are too far away to make sure you get close

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.320
enough to get the kill.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.459
With the suppressor you will be best off in
the flank or coming up from behind enemies.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.290
Pick them off one by one as their teammates
usually won't know you are there.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.590
Quickdraw lets you aim down the sights faster
with the S12.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.370
This is another powerful attachment to the
S12 allowing you to be much more accurate

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.550
very quickly even after sprinting.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.159
When using it aim down the sights straight
away and often you will get a one hit kill

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.159
instantly.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.879
The S12 has two optical attachments.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.560
The reflex sight makes it slightly easier
to aim and the MMS can show you enemies through

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560
walls.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.450
Neither of those features are particularly
useful when you are aggressive and at close

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.650
range and the iron sights are easy enough
to use that I don't recommend using an optical

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.950
attachment on the S12.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.000
The long barrel increases the range of the
S12 making it an all-around better weapon.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.090
The laser sight gives you a tighter hip fire
spread.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.090
This reduces the accuracy loss of firing from
the hip compared to aiming down the sights

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.970
without having to give up any much needed
mobility.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.810
However, it is still a good idea to aim down
the sights at the very last part of the S12's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.810
range.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.290
Extended clip lets you take on more enemies
one after another.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.299
I often ran out of shells in the magazine
when I had to take out more than two enemies

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.920
in quick succession, but with extended clip
you can easily take out three or more enemies

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.650
without reloading.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.819
So there you go.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.049
That is the class setup I recommend for the
S12.

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.670
Leave a comment on this video with your favorite
class setup with the S12 for a chance to be

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.470
featured on next Wednesday's feedback video.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:06.100
Thank you very much for watching and until
next time.
