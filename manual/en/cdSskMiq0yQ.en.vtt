00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.270
00:06 Matthew Dolman: If you reside in Florida,
especially in Tampa Bay area or in South Florida,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.470
the Miami-Dade County, Broward County, Palm
Beach County areas, you're inundated by advertising

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.820
by personal injury law firms and lawyer referral
services.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.010
And you probably ask yourself, "Are these
good attorneys?

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.930
Who should I call if I'm involved in a personal
injury accident if I'm physically injured

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.700
as a result of someone else's negligence?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.160
Do lawyer referral service have any special
ability as compared to the attorneys who are

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160
not members of such?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.480
And are the attorneys on billboards any more
competent than the lawyers that I can find

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.460
by doing my own research on the internet?"

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.219
00:42 MD: Keep in mind the following: I'm
not here to cast views on attorneys that advertise.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.219
I advertise.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.079
I do a lot of work on the internet.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.710
Most of it's non-paid; I don't pay for...

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.710
I don't do pay-per-clicks.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.450
I do a lot of blogging.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.309
You'll see a couple of my billboards in town
so I can get some word-of-mouth.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.680
I started my practice four years ago after
leaving a prominent personal injury law firm.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.550
But I understand the need for advertising.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.080
At the same point, keep in mind that advertising
is a lot of fluff.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.290
It's a lot of hype.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.030
Picking an attorney off of a billboard because
he or she looks very good posing next to a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.420
motorcycle or they promise that they're gonna
do the best for you and give you personal

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.470
attention, that might not always be the truth.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.130
Some of them are telling the truth, but are
they all?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.840
01:30 MD: That's a question you need to ask
yourself.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.040
And the way you find out the information is
by going online and doing research.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.380
Look at the reviews that attorney has generated.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.790
Go to Avvo.com, A-V-V-O.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.680
That's an attorney database.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.380
Go online, look at their Google reviews.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.080
Look to see what former clients have said.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.369
Look to see what other attorneys in the community
say about that attorney.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.810
Figure out their reputation, learn about it.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.470
Learn about their experience.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.990
Learn about what they write and publish on
the topic they're speaking of.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.710
How common they are in terms of personal injury
litigation.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.790
Do they litigate their own cases or did they
outsource it through another lawyer when the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.950
going gets tough?

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.580
Are they very well-versed in medical information?

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.930
How competent is your lawyer?

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.790
02:13 MD: Throwing up a billboard does not
mean you're competent.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.140
Calling yourself a motorcycle injury lawyer
does not mean you're a motorcycle injury lawyer.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.450
Riding a motorcycle does not make you any
better in court handling a motorcycle injury

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.500
claim.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.900
Lawyer referral services, we see them all
day long.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770
Are their lawyers any more competent than
anyone else?

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.770
No.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.770
Absolutely not.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.150
It's not to say that every lawyer who belongs
to a lawyer referral service is incompetent.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.970
Many of them are very competent.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.540
In fact, I don't pass any generalizations
on them.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.400
But less than a year ago, 411-Pain, which
is a prominent lawyer referral service, entered

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.000
into a settlement with the Florida Attorney
General's Office for misleading advertisements.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.930
One of the biggest problems was they made
advertisements in which and did, one could

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.680
infer, that their lawyers had some type of
specialty, some type of skill.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.300
And they were told not to do that again.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.209
03:04 MD: Recently, a 411-Pain advertisement,
a non-attorney spokesperson gets on and says

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.650
they've cultivated a network full of attorneys,
and if there's only one 401-Pain, but there's...

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.769
And she named the exact number of attorneys
that are registered with the Florida bar,

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.830
an approximate number of the thousands of
attorneys, why call them when you can get

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.200
all your information by calling 401-Pain and
that they cultivated this network of attorneys.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.769
One might infer that those attorneys are better
than the others.

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.580
03:30 MD: The majority of the lead attorneys
in the state of Florida, the ones you'll often

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.890
see that are honored by Florida's legal elite
from Law &amp; Politics Magazine or Super Lawyers

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.140
or members of the Million Dollar Advocates
Forum, they're not members of lawyer referral

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.140
services.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.599
A few of them are but most of them aren't.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.980
So is that saying special skills?

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.769
Absolutely not.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.650
Do lawyers that get on the air and radio ad
nauseum and telling them they're your personal

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.810
attorney, is it likely that that's gonna be
your attorney when you actually call their

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.230
law firm or that you'll ever meet that lawyer?

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.349
04:01 MD: Find out.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.349
Go do your research.

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.569
I'm not here to provide you with an answer,
but there's plenty of research to be done

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.760
online.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.760
Read their reviews.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.440
And don't form your view off one review, there's
always an angry client.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.310
We can't make everyone happy in life.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.950
But the majority is the rule.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.630
When you see a lot of poor reviews, then they
raise some questions.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.520
If you see a lot of positive reviews, that
tells you something else.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.729
04:25 MD: But just having enough money to
throw up advertisements or making it a mode

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.860
of your business operation, your business
model to throw up advertisements everywhere

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.389
around town, does not make you any better
than the next attorney.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.389
Okay?

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.600
Sometimes it actually might make you worse.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.630
You might be a volume shop.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.360
Are you capable of providing quality representation
to the quantity of clients you have.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.030
That's an important question.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.889
At my law firm, we attempt to give personal
attention to all our personal injury clients.

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.230
And that's not just lip service.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.210
04:54 MD: I'd like you to find out more about
my firm.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.290
Check out the reviews online.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.990
I challenge you to do so.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.479
Call me; you'll get me on my phone.

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.900
I provide my cellphone on my business card.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.300
This isn't an advertisement for Dolman Law
Group or Matt Dolman.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.640
This is just an informational service trying
to explain that you can find the best personal

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.780
injury attorney by doing research.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.780
You owe it to yourself.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.400
You only have one day in court.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.230
You only have one chance to resolve your personal
injury claim and maximize the damages that

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.410
are owed to you.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.410
This is it.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.410
It's your one shot.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.600
Put your best foot forward and do your research.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.960
Thank you.
