00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:03.523
(phone buttons toning)

00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:06.036
(old-time piano music)

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:06.722
- [Greg] Yeah.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:07.668
- And then he told me where it was

00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:09.713
and I went out there and they're like, uh.

00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:11.327
It looked really nice too.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:12.767
- It did? Good, good.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:14.966
I was hoping it would look good.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.676
- Yeah, I'm sure I'll get
the free food and whatnot.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:19.592
- Yeah, yeah. It's great
to get the free food.

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:21.031
Hmm?

00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:21.849
- Are you answering what I'm saying?

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.790
- No, no, no. I'm on
the phone with somebody.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.359
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.274
- Okay. Um, what was that?

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:30.708
- I just said I was on
the phone with somebody.

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:34.079
The guy next to me asked
me if I was talking.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.645
It's a guy, he's talking about
me on the phone or something.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:37.732
- (laughs) I don't know.

00:00:37.732 --> 00:00:39.706
- Yeah, I don't know either. It's weird.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.372
Yeah, no, we're getting on pretty soon.

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:44.114
- Yeah, I'm waiting for my plane.

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:45.664
- Yeah, me too.

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.655
- Do you know what
terminal Spirit arrives in?

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:51.598
- Yeah, I think it arrives
in like Terminal 3?

00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:54.234
- Okay, so you could just
text me which terminal it is?

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.806
- Great, yeah, I'll text you
later if you didn't believe me.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.919
I'll double-check and I'll just text you.

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:01.111
- No, maybe it'll be okay.

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:02.613
I'll just look when I get there. (laughs)

00:01:02.613 --> 00:01:04.067
- Yeah, you can just look
it up when you get there.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:05.816
That's probably a better idea.
(woman laughs)

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:07.068
- [Man in Hat] How late
is your flight delayed?

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:09.501
- It's like 20 minutes late, I think.

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.425
I think it's probably
gonna be about 20 minutes.

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:12.760
- [Man in Hat] Is that
your sister with you?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.002
- No, no, I don't have a sister.

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.380
Why do you ask?

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.685
- You're like answering
the same question. (laughs)

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:21.981
- I'm sorry?

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:23.370
- I feel like you're
answering my question.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.664
- No, no, no. I'm talking to somebody.

00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:26.861
It's my friend.

00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:27.784
- I'm at the airport.

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:30.060
- Yeah, me too. I'm sitting
here at the airport.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.425
Just waiting to get on the flight.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:32.925
- [Man in Hat] Yeah.
- [Greg] Yeah.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:34.562
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:36.903
- I got a B-plus on the anatomy--

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:38.988
- Oh, a B-plus, that's good!

00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:40.377
Congratulations, that is not bad.

00:01:40.377 --> 00:01:42.369
You know what? Reception's
kinda bad over here.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.412
I'm gonna move over. Oh, it's better here.

00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:46.339
It's definitely better here.

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:49.608
No, it's delayed for probably 30 minutes.

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:50.997
- What do you want for dinner?

00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:52.087
- Oh man, I can go for anything.

00:01:52.087 --> 00:01:53.675
Maybe a burger tonight or,

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:55.060
burger and fries, pizza,
you know, something--

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.287
- Where are the kids at?

00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:58.868
- I don't have kids. Why do you ask?

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:03.012
- Hey, you wanna go out later?

00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:04.351
- Yeah, definitely.

00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:07.393
Like, as soon as I land,
you know, let's go out.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.598
- I'll meet you about
6 o'clock at the house.

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:11.688
- Okay, fine. Six at the house is great.

00:02:11.688 --> 00:02:13.360
That'd be perfect.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.283
Gotta take the flight first.

00:02:15.283 --> 00:02:16.252
Oh, huh?

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:17.621
- Oh, are you talking to me?

00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:18.370
- No, no, no, I'm on the phone.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.202
- [Woman] Oh, okay.
- [Greg] Sorry, sorry.

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:20.765
No, that was just a girl next to me.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:21.482
She was just talking to me while--

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:22.959
- Okay, well I'll talk to you later then.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.175
- Okay, perfect. Talk to you later, great.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:26.064
- [Woman] Okay.
- [Greg] Okay.

00:02:26.064 --> 00:02:27.382

- [Greg] Love you too.

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:28.628
- [Woman] Bye.
- [Greg] Buh-bye.

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:29.849
Okay.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.431
- I'll text you.

00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:33.588
- Great, text me.

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:35.255
Text me and I'll text you back.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.587
That sounds perfect.
(woman laughs)

00:02:37.587 --> 00:02:38.582
- Okay, talk to you soon. Bye.

00:02:38.582 --> 00:02:40.545
- Okay, talk to you later. Buh-bye.

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:42.074
- [Woman] Bye.
- [Greg] Buh-bye.

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:43.718
- Were you listening to my conversation?

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:44.758
- [Greg] No, no.
- [Woman] All right.

00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:47.353
- No, I was on the phone with my buddy.

00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:49.513
- [Woman] Wow, that's weird.
- [Greg] Yep.

00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:50.743
Yeah, okay, maybe I was a little bit.

00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:51.997
See? There's a hidden camera right there.

00:02:51.997 --> 00:02:53.762
You see that? That's a camera.
(woman laughs)

00:02:53.762 --> 00:02:55.108
That's my wife holding the camera.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.618
We do this for YouTube.

00:02:56.618 --> 00:02:57.789
Is that cool with you?

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:58.486
- Yeah.

00:02:58.486 --> 00:02:59.757
- Oh, (laughs) that's so awesome.

00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:01.740
Thanks a lot for being in the video.
