00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.450
I'm JÃ¸rgen

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.000
And I'm Mr. Matias

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.200
Together we are walking across Lebanon, from North to South.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.000
And we are walking for a new cause every day.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In the previous episode of Walk of Causes

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.200
We started our trip in the North of Lebanon,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.200
where we made a friend that gaves us a cause to walk for.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.000
Peace and health
If you have good health, and there is peace in the country, this is everything you need. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.200
Walking with no proper mountain map, we got lost in the fog.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The press in Lebanon is concidered one of the freest in the Middle East

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but around the world, hundreds of journalists live their lives in jail for telling the truth.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.200
Therefore we dedicate this episode of our walk across Lebanon to the freedom of press. 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:59.300
Because, on the map he showed me, there was clearly ... a road.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.000
Only one ridge?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.300
There was one ridge, and one road.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Yeah, but, there is clearly impossible to see anything here.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.300
It's so exhausting to be lost, man.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.300
We also have another problem though. We will not be able to reach our destination before it gets dark.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.000
No, you don't think so?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.300
I don't think so.
We have two more hours of daylight.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.300
Ahh... fuck man. I'm so tired.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm so tired. I just want to roll out my sleeping bag, but...

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.300
... it's gonna rain tonight, don't you think?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Yeah, for sure man.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
OK. Come on. Let's go.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.300
To show them that we come in peace...

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.000
We are a bit lost.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300
Where do you sleep? In the forest?

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.300
Maybe. We don't know.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.300
We find a place.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.300
I hope.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.300
Because here, maybe there is wild animals...
... wild dogs, and wild animals.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.300
Thank you very much.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300
Do you understand?
Yes.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.000
Sukran habibi!
(Thank you buddy)

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.300
That's great!
Now we have a map!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
After a long day of walking, we finally found shelter in an unfinished house.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.300
Eight hours no?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.450
We walked for eight hours...
I am so, so, sooo tired.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.000
But it didn't take long before some wild dogs freaked us out.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm gonna be so scared... I'm gonna be so fucking scared right now.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.150
We didn't get much sleep that night, and in the morning we got woken up by one of the guys working on the house.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.000
(Are you cold?)

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.300
(Have you been here?)

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.000
We've been sleeping. It's OK.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.300
We are walking to Tachea.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.300
(I don't speak French)

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.300
Tachea? This way?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.000
Tachea?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
(I don't know)

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.300
We tried to find our way to Tachea, but pronouncing Arabic seems to be harder than it sounds.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.000
Tashai? Tachea? 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Tachea? Tachea? Please Tachea?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.400
Techea? Tachea?

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.400
(How can you come here without speaking Arabic!?!)

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.300
I think he got angry when we don't speak Arabic.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.300
Sorry sir.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.300
Tachea? 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.150
Techea? Is Tachea... 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.300
(What?)

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300
Tachea? Tachea?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.150
Tachea? Tachea?

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:49.400
(No. No.)

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.300
Tachea?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.300
Techea?

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.000
(I don't know)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.300
But finally, in the middle of nowhere, we met some guys that could understand our poor Arabic pronunciation.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.150
Tachea?

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.000
Techeaa? (yes)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.300
(Thank you)

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.000
OK. You've been great help.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.300
Thank you so much. These are good news.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.300
(Take picture)

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.300
(Take picture of him)

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300
(Are you French?)

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.300
(Norway)

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I think maybe this could be the strongest coffee I ever tasted in my life.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.300
Ahh... very strong!

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.150
Techeaa.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.000
(Up there is Aamoa. Don't go there.)
(Tacheaa is over there. It's OK.)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.300
(But don't go up there to Aamoa)

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.300
OK... I think that he's saying that we shouldn't go the other direction.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.300
Ahh... OK... NO...

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
What is he saying?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I have no idea.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.150
In the next episode of Walk of Causes.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.300
Jorgen gets a flower from an old man.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
Then, he gets a new FaceBook friend.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.300
She's gonna be on my FaceBook.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.000
It's not that cool actually, because I want a new FaceBook friend too.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.300
Watch the next episode of Walk of Causes.
