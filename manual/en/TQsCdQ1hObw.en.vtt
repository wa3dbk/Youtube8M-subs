<i>(music plays)</i>

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.989
Maria: It's an opportunity to meet new people, to advance on your

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:12.500
developmental courses, and to get familiarized with the campus.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.850
Krystal: It's a great opportunity to learn about the school.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.441
Jillana: I also met one of my really good friends at CSUN, who

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:23.119
I'm still really close with, and that was all through the Early Start Program.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.999
<i>(music)</i>

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.400
April: College is an exciting time. And it can also be kind of stressful

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.205
and intimidating, especially when you're a first time freshman coming onto campus.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:42.874
What I like about Early Start is you get to come in while everything is calm and quiet

00:00:42.874 --> 00:00:47.795
and feel your way around and get to know what this new environment is going to be like.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:53.442
<i>(music)</i>

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:58.723
April: Remember that campus policy requires you to finish all of your developmental coursework

00:00:58.723 --> 00:01:05.399
within one year. So by participating in Early Start, you're able to get a jump on that.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.766
David: One of the things I like about the University 100 class I teach is that

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:17.740
in my class you'll have a chance to get to know how to be an effective college student.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.409
<i>(music)</i>

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.278
April: One problem that a lot of students encounter is that they have trouble

00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:30.192
with the transition from high school to college. It can be quite different,

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:33.679
and they don't always anticipate what to expect.

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.687
Now when you're in college, there aren't going to be any bells.

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:41.472
There are no whistles or anything to indicate that it's time for you to

00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:46.185
make it to your next class. You really have to take control of your own schedule.

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:50.735
You have to organize, plan, and manage to make sure that you're

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:53.825
wherever you need to be at the specific time.

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:57.299
Maria: The aspect that helped me the most is probably talking to professors

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.616
and not being afraid to go to them when I need help.

00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:05.076
Krystal: Learning how to use a syllabus and actually looking at it

00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:08.244
because I never really thought about it in high school.

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:11.650
I really understood what the teachers wanted for you to learn.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.405
David: So University 100 is a great opportunity for you to get a chance to

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:21.027
learn about yourself, get a chance to really connect to the campus.

00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:25.302
And during the Early Start Program, I think it's a true hidden gem.

00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:28.811
April: Courses that you take during Early Start do count towards your units

00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:32.999
for graduation. And if you take University 100 during Early Start,

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:41.474
you get three units towards your lifelong learning general education requirement.

00:02:41.474 --> 00:02:44.611
Melody: Math, whether you like it or not, is going to be part of your life.

00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.784
Even in art, music, you would always see math.

00:02:48.784 --> 00:02:53.325
This class is going to be a class for students that never felt confident

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:58.109
in their basic math skills. With one-on-one interactions with their teacher

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.597
and the tutors available to them in the classroom, they're going to gain

00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:07.238
that self-confidence they may not have had before. We try to make sure

00:03:07.238 --> 00:03:11.396
students gain the solid foundation they need to have in their university-level

00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:16.423
mathematics courses. You might be able to complete all your requirements for

00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:21.141
remediation math classes in Summer and not be worried about it in Fall.

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:26.329
Jillana: I just got my math class out of the way, which was a huge relief

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.516
because it is every day. So you have a lot of time to do it over summer.

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:34.276
I had a lot of time to do my homework, because there's homework

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:38.979
every class, and there are quizzes, and you want to pass the class.

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:45.477
So, I definitely recommend this class because I can imagine it would be really

00:03:45.477 --> 00:03:53.263
hard to take it along with several other courses. You just want to get it out of the way.

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:57.184
Amy: One of the things I've discovered over time is that students come to us

00:03:57.184 --> 00:04:01.900
having been rather successful in high school but not having read that much.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.758
They're able to get away with Spark Notes or Cliff Notes or that sort of thing.

00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:09.467
Those strategies won't work for them in college here at CSUN.

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:14.953
So my goal is to show them and work with a variety of different kinds of texts.

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:19.559
We'll be looking at literature. We'll be looking at websites. We'll be looking at textbooks.

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:24.308
We'll be looking at articles, journal articles, scholarly articles, newspaper/magazine articles

00:04:24.308 --> 00:04:28.239
Because all those require different kinds of approaches and strategies.

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:32.649
We'll be teaching critical reading skills that will help students in all the classes

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:36.912
that they're going to be taking, and this will provide a good foundation for

00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:39.672
them throughout their career as students here at CSUN

00:04:39.672 --> 00:04:42.955
all the way past graduation, I think.

00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:46.327
<i>(music)</i>

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:49.524
Jillana: Because I had been at CSUN for a month before, every day,

00:04:49.524 --> 00:04:53.941
I was really comfortable with attending CSUN, and I wasn't nervous

00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:58.062
going to class my first day, because I knew where all my classes were.

00:04:58.062 --> 00:05:03.781
And I really knew how the system worked -- where to park, when to get to CSUN.

00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:07.843
David: As a professor I see it with my other students who aren't in University 100.

00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:13.322
It's stuff they sometimes do not learn about or know about until they're seniors.

00:05:13.322 --> 00:05:17.988
That's something that I think is a true advantage and benefit of

00:05:17.988 --> 00:05:20.251
being involved in the Early Start Program.

00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:24.555
At Early Start you'll be free to explore the campus at your leisure

00:05:24.555 --> 00:05:30.922
with your classmates and really make it your own. Feel at home at CSUN.

00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:31.922
