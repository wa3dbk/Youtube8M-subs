00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.528
There's nothing left here!  - No way!

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.260
There are at least three beers left of the six-pack.

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:19.971
There's nothing!

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:22.041
I gave... took...

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:25.629
used it to put out the steam room door fire last night.

00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:27.772
OK, but is there any vodka?

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:32.057
Nope, no vodka. Just pumpkin salad.

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:34.927
Fuck! - What are we going to do now?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.454
We have to go to the store. - Yeah, definitely.

00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:43.148
I know a place, it's about 4-5 km.

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:45.943
But we're not gonna walk there, are we.

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:48.382
There's no way I'm driving - I'm so pissed!

00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:52.966
Hello? Which one of us is sober?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.924
Not us!

00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:57.328
I can go!

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.254
You?

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:01.535
Yes, me.

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:03.024
But you're comatose!

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:04.819
Don't worry, I've got a car!

00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:11.044
K.I.T.T., gear yourself up! We're going shopping!

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.476
OK, get me some money!

00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:22.977
K.I.T.T., why aren't you running?

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.965
Michael, I don't think we should be driving to at the moment.

00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:30.773
According to my sensors, your blood alcohol is over 1,5 per mil

00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:31.882
and your liver is damaged 0.8 per cent compared to yester-

00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:33.884
K.I.T.T., shut up! Let's go shopping!

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:35.120
But Michael...

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.381
Stop messing around! The others are waiting!

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:41.916
Michael, a short drive in this cold is not good for my electronics.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:45.718
It's only about 4-5 km, you're shell-proof,

00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:47.316
and whining about cold? Stop being a bitch!

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:49.504
Michael, I'm not a bitch. I'm an -

00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:50.913
Very good, then let's go!

00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:53.599
Michael, you're in no condition to drive!

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.433
Never mind about that.

00:01:59.217 --> 00:02:01.326
OK, you better drive!

00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:18.331
Michael, wake up! We're in trouble.

00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:21.359
Oh shit! What did you do?

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.992
Nothing, Michael.

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:24.661
Ah, no worries, then.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:37.357
Good evening! What's the problem?

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.832
Good evening. Constable Liitra and Senior Constable Pohla.

00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:42.290
You have no licence plates at the front or back,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.785
and your seatbelt is not fastened.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.479
Oh, it was such a short drive, I couldn't be bothered.

00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:50.607
I'm from around here, I'll just pop by the store and back.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.273
Have you been drinking?

00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:54.827
Well, of course, a little bit.

00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:57.726
Blow into this.

00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:06.810
Actually, I know myself that I'm quite drunk.

00:03:07.277 --> 00:03:09.655
Take the keys out of the ignition and come to out car.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.000
No, I wasn't driving!

00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:14.614
Then who was?

00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:17.006
K.I.T.T. was driving. - Git was driving?

00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:21.009
Yes... No, not git - K.I.T.T. was driving.

00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:23.653
Please step out of the car.

00:03:23.784 --> 00:03:25.832
No, wait a minute... K.I.T.T.!

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.753
K.I.T.T.? K.I.T.T.!

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:34.060
Say something! Fuck!

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:35.778
Please step out of the car!

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:39.202
No, wait, K.I.T.T. was driving, I was asleep half of the way!

00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:42.092
See? That's the turboboost here!

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:45.411
If you press it, you can jump over broken bridges and stuff...

00:03:45.988 --> 00:03:47.378
Slowly step out of your vehicle,

00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:48.820
and keep your hands where we can see them!

00:03:48.877 --> 00:03:50.769
Dammit! What the...?

00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:54.238
I'm Michael Knight!

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:55.986
What are your doing?

00:03:56.198 --> 00:03:58.029
Wait-wait, Reet, take it easy!

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.687
Fucking police state, shit!

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.439
Fucking Reet!

00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:08.063
K.I.T.T., help me!

00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:11.447
K.I.T.T., you fucking bastard!

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.651
I'll put diesel in you the next time, you bastard!
