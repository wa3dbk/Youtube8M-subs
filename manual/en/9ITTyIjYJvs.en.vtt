Rain makes my nose tickle! [giggles]

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:05.433
-What are you talking about?
You don't have a nose.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:07.663
[both laugh]

00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:09.056
Whoa, the rain is stopping.

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:12.539
-[gasps] Look Orange,
it's a rainbow! Yay!

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.333
-Whoa! It is a rainbow!

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.511
Hey, hey Charlie!

00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:17.369
Hey, Charlie, hey!
-You're not gonna see the rainbow.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.900
-Hey! Hey, Charlie, wake up!
It's a rainbow!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.599
-God, you guys.
This had better be freakin' important.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.451
Is the kitchen on fire again?

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.266
-We have to go see the rainbow!
-Yeah, we have to go get the pot of gold!

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.629
Come on! The pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow; let's go!

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.440
-Pot of gold. Sure.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.614
I'm going back to sleep now.
-No, Charlie!

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:36.386
You have to get up and
take us to the rainbow!

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:38.150
-Please stop jumping on me.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.937
-Yeah, I want my pot of gold, Charlie.
Let's go. Hurry!

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.143
-I love rainbows and
puppies and kittens

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:46.811
and flowers and rainbows and
clouds and bunnies and rainbows!

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:49.133
-All right, fine!
I'll go with you to see the rainbow.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.852
-No, you're doing it
wrong, Marshmallow.

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:53.104
It's like this.
Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya...

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:55.055
-Oh, okay!
Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya...

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.609
-(both)
Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya...

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.466
-Oh, God,
would you guys knock it off already?

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.463
-Geez, won't don't you stop horning in?

00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:03.321
[both laugh]
-[groans]

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:04.946
-Hey! Hey, Charlie!
-What?

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:06.711
-Hey, Charlie, hey!
-What?!

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.267
-What are you gonna buy
with your share of the gold?

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.706
I'm gonna buy a pot of gold.

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:12.028
-You guys do realize that
there actually isn't a pot of gold

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:13.282
at the end of the rainbow, right?

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.024
-I'm gonna buy more rainbows! [giggles]

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:16.438
-You can't buy a friggin' rainbow!

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:18.661
-Then I'll buy a rainbow machine
that'll make millions of rainbows!

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.086
-(both)
Yay!

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:22.292
-Oh God, wait. Who is that?

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:23.995
-It's Pear and Midget Apple!
-(Orange) Come on, guys.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:26.161
We're gonna go get the pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow!

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:27.980
-(together)
Yay!

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.861
-Charlie's giving us a ride.
Hop on!

00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:31.812
-Yay for Charlie!
-Oh, no.

00:01:31.812 --> 00:01:34.552
I am not carrying all you
guys and those suitcases.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.199
-But they're important, Charlie.
-Yeah, they're important, Charlie.

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:38.344
-Oh, come on, Charlie!

00:01:38.344 --> 00:01:45.024
[all yelling "Charlie" repeatedly]

00:01:45.024 --> 00:01:46.974
-Okay! I'll carry the stupid suitcases too!

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:50.782
[fruits making annoying noises]

00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:52.640
-Oh God, would you guys shut up?!

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.405
[laughter]

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.402
These suitcases are freakin' heavy!

00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:58.734
And this isn't very sturdy.
We shouldn't be on it.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.139
-Oh, come on. Stop horsing
around and just go, Charlie.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.776
[laughter]

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:03.971
-Uhh...seriously guys,

00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:05.542
[bridge crumpling]
this bridge is starting to break.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.058
We need to get rid of
those friggin' suitcases.

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:09.474
-Wait, we can't do that, Charlie.

00:02:09.474 --> 00:02:12.122
-Yeah Charlie, we can't.
-Why? What's inside 'em?

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:13.817
-Parachutes.
-What?

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.417
[bridge tumbles over, fruits scream]

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:18.925
[crash!]
 [Charlie groans]

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:23.012
Ohh! Oh... Ow!

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:24.058
My friggin' leg.

00:02:24.058 --> 00:02:25.682
-[gasps]
It's not just a rainbow,

00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:28.016
it's a double rainbow! Yay!

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:29.838
-(Orange)
And a double pot of gold!

00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:31.417
-(Midget Apple)
What does it mean?

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.555
-I'll tell you what it means.

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:35.574
It means those pots of gold are mine.
[laughs devilishly]

00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:40.156
[all commenting on double rainbow]

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.371
-You guys just shut up!

00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:49.088
I swear, I didn't even want to come here.

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:52.013
Now I've got a freakin' broken
leg thanks to you fruit baskets.

00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:53.732
Just shut up!

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.094
-Hey, hey Charlie!
-What?

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:01.139
-Knife!

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.693
-Oh, God! Right in the other kidney!
