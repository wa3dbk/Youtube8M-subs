00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.320
&gt;&gt;Adam - This is the closest matchup for me
to feud personally as I think both these installments

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.500
are vastly underrated by the community. Although
they both stumble a bit I think they also

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.620
contain some of the most exciting and memorable
scenes in the franchise. Order of the Phoenix

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.620
vs Half-blood Prince! Expeli-puncounter! Yes,
this was inevitable.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.120
&gt;&gt;Adam - No movie nor spell is completed without
a cast [pun1]. The kids have grown up and

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.149
Emma Watson becomes legal in one of these
so it’s ok to comfortably perv out I believe.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.479
She also continues to stay one of the best
characters in the franchise. Hermoine is sharp

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.679
witted, quick on her feet, smart as a whip
and the only kid who appears to know any spells

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:56.699
outside of stupify. Recently Daniel Radcliff
spoke about his performance in these films

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.699
and specifically about his weakest entry,
Half-blood Prince. Personally, I thought he

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.510
was fantastic in the film but I’ll touch
upon that more in story. Ron is much more

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.800
pleasant to be around as his whole jeleousy
phase is over and now he’s more loyal to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.410
Harry than ever before. Rupurt also manages
to get his rediculus [pun2] facial expressions

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.720
a bit more under control.
Newcomers to Order of the Phoenix include

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.800
Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsly Shacklebolt, Luna
Lovegood played by the lovely Evanna Lynch

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.700
but the main draw in this entry is the cat
loving, arm torturing, rule delivering, superbitch,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.090
Delorus Umbridge and once again the casting
is nailed by Imelda Staunton. Apologize for

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.060
butchering names. I certainly wouldn’t have
been teachers pet [pun3] in Umbridge’s classroom.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.420
Half-Blood Prince gives us Professor Horace
Slughorn as potions master played by Jim Broadbent.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.280
Then there’s raving bitch Belletrix Lestrang
coming from no other than Helena Boham Carter.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.070
A few versions of Tom Riddle are a welcome
inclusion as well.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.960
[ROUND 2 : STORY]

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.320
&gt;&gt;Adam - Things get a bit “harry” [pun4]
right out of the gates in Order of the Phoenix

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.750
when Dementors show up at the local playground.
This is my favorite intro in the series. I

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.140
love the eerie tone and drab color pallatte.
Radcliffe does some fine acting in this film

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.979
as he’s constantly being torchered by visions
through the eyes of the enemy. We are introduced

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.540
to Dumbledor’s secret society, the order
of the phoenix where we find out Lupen, Moody,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.749
Serius and others are part of. A second secret
group, an army, if you will, is put into place

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.090
by Harry and the students to combate Umbridge
and her goons. There are a lot of really memorable

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.670
events in this film from the always amazing
Snape training Harry to keep Voldermort out

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.670
of his head to the tragic death of Serius
Black. God I hate Beletrix. Then there is

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.099
the confrontation between Dumbledore and Voldy
himself. It’s a very cool specticle and

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.709
I wish it never ended. Love how Dumbledor
not only goes toe to toe with the dark lord

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.680
but also how he stays concious of Harry’s
well being by chucking his ass out of the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.680
way of danger. I can’t forget the franchise
high point which is Harry’s first kiss to

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.079
Cho Chang. She’s the worst.
Half-Blood Prince has it’s equal share of

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.999
moments. There’s the bloody brilliant use
of the pensieve to learn about Tom Riddle’s

00:02:55.999 --> 00:03:00.290
troubled past. We get great exchanges between
Horace and his troubled student when getting

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.310
the knowledge of Horcruxes. This leads to
my favorite line of dialogue from the franchise

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.540
from Sloghorn. “Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom!
Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.799
person? To rip the soul into seven pieces...
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:03.109
academic? I saddly use that quote a lot as
the number 7 pops up more often than one would

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:03.889
think.
Speaking of favorites. Half-blood also contains

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:09.040
my favorite isolated moment too where Harry
fucking lays Malfoye out with SectumSempra.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.549
He only knows one other attack spell so it
was refreshing to see something a bit more

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.819
agressive than stupify.
Dumbledor steals the finale portion of the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.139
film with his drinking game with Harry. Bad
enough he has to choke down every drop of

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.489
that poison but then to have to battle waves
of dead corpses whilst half-in-the-bag was

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.389
just cruel. That cave portion is a spectacle
to say the least and unfortunately the death

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:38.059
of Dumbledor at the hands of Snape doesn’t
quite live up to the rest.

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:45.059
I do love the final scene where Snape bitch
slaps Harry’s attack out of the air. "You

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.370
dare use my own spells against me, Potter?
It was I who invented them — I, the Half-Blood

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.049
Prince!
Tom riddle me this.[Pun5] Which film has the

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.099
better action and effects. Let’s find out
together in round 3!

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.689
[ROUND 3 : ACTION/EFFECTS]

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.939
&gt;&gt;Adam - David Yates takes over as the 4th
and final director in the Potter saga. He

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.430
is my favorite of the whole lot. Alfonso definitely
has the bragging rights with Gravity and Children

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.730
of Men but I love Yate’s use of shadows
and the color pallete that is somehow vibrant

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.730
yet dark, in tandem. Phoenix is closely aligned
to Goblet of Fire in terms of style but Half-Blood

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.380
goes an entirely different direction all around.
The whole film feels almost empty. The staircases

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.760
no longer move. The laughter is mostly missing
outside a fun scene at the Weezly’s Wizard

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.400
Wheezes shop. It’s a stylistic choice that
marries the book and I love it. At this point

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.220
the thrill is gone for these kids. Magic is
basically off the property. There is a looming

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.910
feeling of impending doom. This doesn’t
pretend to be anything more than it should

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.130
be which is that of a bridge film. In Order
we have a range of fantastical elements from

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.150
Thestrals to ministry rooms that appear to
go on for miles. Then there’s that damn

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.930
soul catcher door that Serius falls into.
What the hell is it? I want answers! I remember

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.930
it being even more vague in the book. A fucking
black curtain or some such nonsense. One of

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.740
you knows. Tell me dammit! Thanks to Umbridge
the film also contains more pink than a season

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.360
of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. That’s
a thing some of you are still into, right?

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.760
This round really comes down to preference.
Do you like the high energy that Phoenix brings

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.930
complete with dragon fireworks and wand dueling
or are you more the toned down type with a

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.030
grittier, Nolan-esque look? That’s not for
me to decide.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.540
Have you had enough or would you like to hear
voldeMORE [pun6]. Sorry, that may be my worst

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.430
pun to date.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.290
[ROUND 4 : MUSIC]
&gt;&gt; Adam - Fresh faces all around it would

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.080
seem as the composer has been replaced for
the 3rd time. Nicholas Hooper steps in and

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.270
provides a completely new playlist that arguebly
is the worst of the series. Still a solid

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.800
lineup of orchestrational pieces but nothing
that holds a broom handle to the John Williams

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.720
entries. The only time I was even remotely
griphooked [pun7] was at the end of the movie

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.640
when Harry was owning Voldemort about friendship.
Hedwigs Theme is still there in some fashion

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.860
as Hooper mixed it in with his new style which
is more dark and menacing. Where entry 5 may

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.090
have been a misstep #6 surely makes up for
it and then some. Half-blood was nominated

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.540
for an Emmy in the music department and for
good reason. The soundtrack is critically

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.060
acclaimed in is my personal favorite. It’s
also no surprise to find out that Hooper embraced

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.970
Williams sound more effectinately this round
by encorporating portions into his nearly

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.160
2 hours of additional music. I think I appreciate
the music hear on a larger level because everything

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.570
else in the movie is so flat by design. So
the orchestra really gets my undivided attention

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.310
to help tell the story.
Let’s wrap this thing up. How we doing pun-wise?

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.250
Seven? Merlin’s Beard. Seven Tom? This is
all hypothetical of course. All educational.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.100
[CONCLUSION]
&gt;&gt; Adam - Sadly another week of Potter has

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.580
come and gone. It saddens me that I only have
one more to go but I guess that’s the way

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.950
the chocolate frog croaks.
I really don’t want to choose between these

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.190
2 as they both have so many great moments
that set them apart. Gut reaction is to go

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.480
with the underdog here, Half-Blood Prince
and so it shall be.

More than just reviews, this is Movie Feuds.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.490
Really low pun numbers this week. I was all
poly-juiced up [pun8] to use the counter but

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.890
the writing on this show is deathly hollow
[pun9]. Step it up or next week I’m giving

you all serius black and blue eyes?[pun10]
