00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.920
*Doorbell*

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.270
VICTORIA: I'm here...strictly on business.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.770
LOUISE: Hi Victoria!

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.130
VICTORIA: We're gonna have a New
Year's Party!

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.260
LOUISE: I like parties!

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.460
VICTORIA: We're having it...

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.790
...here.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.090
CAIRN: Uh-uhh

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.290
VICTORIA: And...

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.460
it's going to double as C.B.'s birthday
party.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.920
LOUISE: Uh-uhhh

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.000
VICTORIA: Well, we have to...

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.250
she doesn't have family nearby.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.250
It's the right thing to do.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.250
LOUISE: We should have it at the bowling
alley!

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.000
CAIRN: Her name is "Canadian Bowler"

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.940
VICTORIA: League night.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.730
CAIRN: What about at Lezbots?

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.020
VICTORIA: C.B. was 86'd from there...
4 months ago.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.830
CAIRN: I'm gonna have to get out the
plastic slip covers for the couches.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.580
...and the vinyl carpet-runners.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.020
VICTORIA: Be nice to C.B.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.920
she has no one.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.970
CAIRN: 'cause she talks with a plugged nose.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.290
VICTORIA: My place is too small...

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.420
the party WILL happen here...

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.790
the end.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.460
CAIRN: Vicki does this once a year...

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.230
she picks a day during the holidays

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.040
and spends the entire time being sweet.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.800
It makes everyone uneasy.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.880
*Doorbell*

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.240
*Party ambience*

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.820
CB (OS) yeah...cleaning potatoes...
cleaning the latrine...

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.940
VICTORIA:Whoop...got it!

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.100
CB: (OS) ...overseas, that kinda stuff
happens all the time.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.340
CB: In the service, they made me 
chocolate cake with bananas...

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.980
*door slams*

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.350
*grocery store ambience*

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.130
every year, for my birthday.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.250
*Door slams*

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.240
VICTORIA: With bananas!!

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.420
CB: Thanks, Victoria!

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.090
*Washing machine running*

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.340
*banging on machine*

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.790
CB: I'm a specialist...

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.470
so I've noticed that your washer spin
is irregular

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.210
and found that it was simply, the 
drum weights were loose.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.340
VICTORIA: (OS) Let me get that for you.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.280
CB: It'll be fixed in a jiffy.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.530
*banging on washing machine*

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.200
*washing machine starts*

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.570
*faucet water running*
*banging on pipes*

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.030
VICTORIA:  Let me get that for you.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.400
*toilet flush*

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.110
VICTORIA: (OS) Be right there!

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.370
*Door open &amp; close*

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.480
CB: I replaced the gaskets in your sink 
and shower faucets.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.490
Oh...and the float valve in the toilet tank.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.530
I did a little plumbing in the service.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.830
VICTORIA: (OS) No, no...let me get that
for you.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.690
*motor buzzes*
*rattles*

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.740
CB: The reciprocating compressor from
your refrigerator is overheated.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.230
I ran a few diagnostics and determined
that it needs to be replaced.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.710
I can have this fixed in 
two shakes of a lamb's tail.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.620
*electric drill*

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.920
VICTORIA: (OS) Let me get that...

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.620
*Crowd cheers*
*alarm buzzes*

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.540
*party horns*

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.290
*instant silence*

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.980
*door opens*

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.750
*footsteps*

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.250
*dog barks from outside*

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.250
*door closes*

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.590
*can rattles across the floor*

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.040
VICTORIA: That's it....done!

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.370
...and I'm out of here.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.730
*door closes*

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.610
CAIRN: I wouldn't mind having C.B. over
every year, for her birthday.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.130
LOUISE: I would!

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.110
CAIRN: She fixed everything
and did Preventive Maintenance.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.360
I'm surprised the military let her leave.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.440
*door open*

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.560
VICTORIA: (OS) Oh, Louise...?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.980
Who's walking me home?

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.040
LOUISE: I thought CB was going to 
walk you home...

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.200
'cause it's her birthday.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.670
VICTORIA: I'd prefer you do it.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.730
Plus...she's busy changing the oil on your
car.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.920
*SMOOCH*

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.970
*door closes*

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.830
*Rumba music*

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.750
*CROWD CHEERS*
*FIREWORKS EXPLODE*
