I'm Candi Cane Canncel with Expert Village.
In this clip we're going to be sewing our

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:12.900
inseam pockets to the seam. What you want
to do is take one layer of each and you're

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.080
going to be sewing the front of the pocket
to the front of your garment and the back

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.849
of the pocket to the back of the garment.
How you're going to be doing it is sewing

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:32.130
a line just straight down the seam. So you
want to match it up and just make sure that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:48.300
you're putting them both at the same point
and then you want

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.900
to pin it. Do the same for the back and once
you have it pinned you're ready to take it

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:14.960
to the machine and stitch up a line right
along the seam. (sewing) You are going to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:45.219
do that same thing to the back (sewing) once
your seam is done take out the pins and you

00:01:45.219 --> 00:02:03.020
are going to be pressing the seam over again.
You just want to press it open and make sure

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:17.500
that it's flat as possible. (ironing) Once
you have that done the next step is going

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.220
to be actually stitching up the pocket.
