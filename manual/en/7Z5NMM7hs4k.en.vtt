now i'd tell you as much as the you know

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.300
get on the president for not doing
enough which i don't think he has

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.480
everybody's alike when you'd say that
they like

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.940
officers so demanding phenomenon

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.800
i wanted to try

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.880
that i was asking for that much

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.140
i wanted to say hey you know what can we
try to remove the inflows of money from

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.369
politics he didn't do that at all what
bill that he propose on that

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.080
what any fight for campaign finance

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.379
buddy worked around and it's anyway

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:40.760
but that's not why bring it up in this
crap ever have in this context

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.420
the winning campaign slogan is not big
changes don't happen overnight

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.630
i'm only be one of the courtship
throughout the speech there's like four

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.570
different quotes where the presence of
whatcom as it slowly style forty one

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.280
million who didn't get much done what
can i do

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.919
going camping in that way

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:02.010
secondly campaign like that

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.170
the way you win the campaign he is you
can't act your opponent invoke after the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.980

were to go after the republicans on
creating jobs and that i'd have a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.989
proposal to create three million new
jobs

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.180
some of the bridge republicans won't let
me do it uncommon for that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.069

strength you're going to a rally in six

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.009
thank you so it's not so sure that i
agree with the republicans intend to go

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.819
by the way

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.230
in the couple of weeks when we announce
our big spending cuts will agree with

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.629

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.739
then she says quote

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.060

by god and i got a united usually

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.109
it's a lot of excuses for not doing
anything

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.890
terrible political strategy

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.939
much more importantly terrible policy

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.919
george bush and dick cheney that a lot
of things done

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.009
now those were all disastrous for the
country but they made the country that

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.909
we had

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.299
no business entity

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.129
and they shouted down our throats then
made out whatever they had to make got

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.200
it done right

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.830
the passenger and did the
record-breaking tax cuts

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.479
okay did it make sense no

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.219
the date women when the bar initially
nobody system they pledged

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.349
and they find out that the senators and
they got pitching to break the tie and

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.330
they did

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.549
they poser welp on the country

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.669
and they got things that you can imagine
them being gutted our work

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.009
regulatory laws that are protections of
saturn

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.050
but they got it done

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.259
these state what do you mean they change
their or no would change is slow i kid i

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.919

country

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.739

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:34.199
no he said uncommon

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.750
and i didn't like his policies in the
bosses were terrible for the country

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.349
but at least he had the strength

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.289
to pushes ideas through

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.549
on our side we have the right policies
