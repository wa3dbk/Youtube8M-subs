00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.160
When you look at footage or
photographs of astronauts

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.980
in space, it doesn't look like
there's any gravity at work

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.510
here.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.080
Everything is not falling
down in one direction.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.810
In fact, it's not even
clear what up or down is.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.390
Everything just floats around.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.900
If I were to push
off of this wall,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.920
I would just float
in that direction.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.250
So it doesn't look like there's
this overarching influence

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.550
like gravity that's trying
to pull everything down.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.760
But the question is that
these astronauts are still

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.880
not too far away from
a supermassive body.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.190
In fact, the space shuttle
gets up only a couple

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.834
of hundred miles above
the surface of the Earth.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:41.000
So the space shuttle, if I
were to draw it to scale,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.640
would probably be
right about there.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.680
And we know that the force of
gravity between two objects

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.670
is equal to big G, the
gravitational constant, times

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.000
the mass of the first
object, times the mass

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.060
of the second object over
the distance between the two

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.830
objects squared.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.550
And if the space
shuttle is right here,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.590
only a few hundred miles above
the surface of the Earth,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.570
this r isn't that different.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.515
It's a little bit
further than if you

00:01:10.515 --> 00:01:11.890
were at the surface
of the Earth.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.266
Remember that r is measured from
wherever you are to the center,

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.890
from the center of
the Earth, or really

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.100
the center of the object
to the center of the Earth.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.951
The center of the Earth
represents most of the distance

00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:23.450
here.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.230
So if I'm at the
surface of the Earth

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.440
or if I'm just a few hundred
miles above the surface

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.880
of the Earth, it's not going
to change r that dramatically,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.600
especially in terms
of percentage.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870
So when you look at it this
way, it seems pretty clear

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.760
that the force of
gravity for someone who

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.050
is in space only a few
hundred miles above the Earth

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.140
should not be that different
than the force of gravity

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.900
for someone who is on
the surface of the Earth.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.540
So my question to
you is, what gives?

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.960
If there should be
gravity in space,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.520
how can we see all
of these pictures

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.660
of people floating
around like this?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.030
And the answer is that
there is gravity in space,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.150
and that these people
actually are falling.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.400
They're just moving fast
enough relative to the Earth

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.709
that they keep missing it.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.750
And let me show you what
I'm talking about there.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.030
Let's say I'm sitting
here in Africa,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.760
and I were to shoot
something, if maybe I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.310
have a really good
sling shot, and I

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.830
were to sling something super
fast and maybe at a 45 degree

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.970
angle, it might take
off a little bit

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.702
and eventually
hit another point.

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:32.160
And this would actually already
be a super duper slingshot.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.860
I just made it travel a couple
of thousand miles or at least

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.180
over 1,000 miles.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.120
If I make it go a
little bit faster,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.620
if I put a little
bit more force on,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.660
if I just propelled the
projectile a little bit faster,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.190
it might go a
little bit further,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.340
but it will eventually
fall back to the Earth.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.480
Let's try to propel it a
little bit faster than that.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.630
Then it'll still
fall to the Earth.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.920
Let's propel it even
faster than that.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.930
Well then, it's still eventually
going to fall to the Earth.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.680
I think you might see
where this is going.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.210
Let's go even faster than that.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.942
So if we go even
faster than that,

00:03:02.942 --> 00:03:04.400
eventually it'll
fall to the Earth.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.490
Even faster than
that, so if you were

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.630
to throw an object
even faster than that,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.115
it would then go really far
and then fall to the Earth.

00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:15.490
I think you see
what's happening.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.810
Every time you go
faster and faster,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.640
you throw this projectile
faster and faster,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.070
it gets further and
further, up to some velocity

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.540
that you release
this projectile,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.050
and whenever it's trying
to fall to the Earth,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.730
it's going so fast that it
keeps missing the Earth.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.710
So it'll keep going around and
around and around the Earth,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.910
and a projectile like that
would essentially be in orbit.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.380
So what's happening
is if there was

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.140
no gravity for that projectile,
if there was no gravity,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.440
the projectile would just
go straight away into space.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.320
But because there's gravity,
it's constantly pulling it

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.750
towards the center of
the Earth, or the center

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.020
of that projectile and
the center of the Earth

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.781
are being pulled
towards each other,

00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:03.530
I guess is a better
way to think about it.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.460
The force of gravity
is doing that.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.430
And so it's curving its path.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.450
And if it's going fast enough,
if the projectile or whatever

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.450
object we're talking about
is going fast enough,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.700
it'll just keep going
round and round the Earth.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.190
And since there is almost,
pretty much, for most purposes

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.190
no air if you go high enough,
especially the altitude

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.050
that the space shuttle
is, no noticeable drag,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.900
this thing can
just keep on going

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.370
for a substantial
amount of time.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.203
Although there is just
a little bit of drag,

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:37.030
and that's why over time you
do have satellites slow down,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.740
because there is just a
little bit of air resistance.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.470
So the answer to
this conundrum is

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.260
that there actually is gravity.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.410
It's not a gravity-free
environment.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.660
It's just that the astronauts
and the space shuttle

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.760
and everything else that's
in the space shuttle,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.230
it's all falling,
but it's moving

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.450
fast enough that it
never hits the Earth.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.770
It keeps missing the Earth.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.570
It keeps going round
and round and round,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.860
but it is completely under
the influence of gravity.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.470
If they were to just
slow themselves down,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.180
if they were to just brake
relative to the Earth,

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.240
and if they were to just
put their brakes on right

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.910
over there, they would all
just plummet to the Earth.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.600
So there's nothing special
about going 300 or 400 miles up

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.500
into space, that all of a
sudden gravity disappears.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.580
The influence of gravity,
actually on some level,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.460
it just keeps going.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.660
You can't, it might
become unnoticeably

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.849
small at some point,
but definitely

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.890
for only a couple of
hundred miles up in the air,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.941
there is definitely
gravity there.

00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:38.190
It's just they're in orbit,
they're going fast enough.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.870
So if they just keep
falling, they're

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.460
never going to hit the Earth.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.960
And if you want to
simulate gravity,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.970
and this is actually how
NASA does simulate gravity,

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.980
is that they will put
people in a plane,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.960
and they call it
the vomit rocket

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.920
because it's known
to make people sick,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.030
and they'll make them go
in a projectile motion.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.290
So if this is the ground,
in a projectile path

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.700
or in a parabolic
path I should say,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.370
so the plane will
take off, and it

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.800
will do a path exactly the
same as something in free fall

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.520
or in a parabolic path.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.490
And so anyone who's
sitting in that plane

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.570
will experience free fall.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.010
So if you've ever been
in, if you've ever right

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.120
when you jump off of a
or if you've ever bungee

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.850
jumped or skydived
or even the feeling

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.940
when a roller coaster is
going right over the top,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.731
and it's pulling you
down, and your stomach

00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:28.780
feels a little ill, that
feeling of free fall, that's

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.720
the exact same feeling
that these astronauts feel

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.190
because they're in a
constant state of free fall.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.390
But that is an
indistinguishable feeling from,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.570
if you were just in deep space
and you weren't anywhere close

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.740
any noticeable mass, that is
an identical feeling that you

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.290
would feel to having no
gravitational force around you.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.335
So hopefully that clarifies
things a little bit.

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:54.460
To someone who's just
sitting in the space shuttle,

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.280
and if they had no
windows, there's

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.020
no way of them
knowing whether they

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.000
are close to a massive
object and they're just

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.650
in free fall around it, they're
in orbit, or whether they're

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.300
just completely far away
from any massive object,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.080
and they really are in
a state of or in a place

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.275
where there's very
little gravity.
