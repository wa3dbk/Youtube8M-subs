00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.180
Once upon a time there was a girl who loved
burgers

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:11.280
When she realized that they weren't particularly
nutritious, she was devastated

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.100
But she wasn't one to give up so easily the
foods she loved

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:39.180
She vowed to make a guilt free, portion controlled
burger substitute, and she did just that...

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.230
Hey fit fam!

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.149
Today I'm gonna make you my burger bites which
are packed with flavor

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.579
At only a fraction of the calories of the
real thing

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.210
My secret?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.850
Wonton wrappers!

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.930
Wonton wrappers are little sheets of dough
that are often used in asian cooking&nbsp;

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.080
But they're a great option for anyone because
they're super low cal, only 20 calories per

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.080
sheet!

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.540
I use them all the time for sweet and savory
dishes

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.109
Now burgers are generally made with ground
beef which is delicious, but not so nutritious

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.759
Red meat is higher in fat and not quite as
heart healthy&nbsp;

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.959
So for my recipe I'm gonna use ground turkey,
which is leaner

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.030
Lower in calories, and it still packs the
protein

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.450
Have you ever noticed when you buy ground
turkey that there are two options?

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.670
Lean and Extra Lean!

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.729
One may be significantly cheaper than the
other

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.859
Primarily because it has more fat&nbsp;

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.889
While it's still leaner than ground beef

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.959
It's less lean than the extra lean turkey
option

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:37.959
Keyword: Extra

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.579
Both are healthy choices, but if you can afford
it

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.929
Go for the extra lean

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:53.349
In a skillet over medium heat add olive oil,
and your extra lean (or lean) ground turkey

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:54.349
breast

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.670
Break up the meat and add finely diced garlic
and onions&nbsp;

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.880
Then add salt and pep, and seasonings

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.069
Stir to combine, then add spinach, tomatoes,
and diced pickles or relish

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:18.040
Cook six to ten minutes, or until completely
browned and cooked through, stirring frequently

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.510
Now that I have my meat mixture, I'm gonna
stuff it in the wontons with a little bit

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.510
of cheese

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:46.439
And once I bake it, it's gonna be just like
a cheeseburger turnover, yummy!

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:57.219
These.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:08.010
Babes.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:18.790
Cook.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:29.579
Fast.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.340
Anything with wonton wrappers does, that's
what's great!

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.239
But since there isn't quite enough time for
a home workout today

00:03:35.239 --> 00:04:38.690
I'm gonna show you a few of my favorite plank
variations

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.400
Perfectly browned and crisped!

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.240
Just let them cool for a few minutes, and
you're ready to chomp!

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.430
And so it was, the determined girl stayed
true to her vow, and crafted guilt-free burger

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.430
bite

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.210
That was more mouth-watering than any fast
food burger had ever been

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.510
She also created a dipping sauce that was
pretty much off the hook

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.550
Proving once and for all, that it really is
all just a matter of Mind Over Munch
