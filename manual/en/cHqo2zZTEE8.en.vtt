00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.300
If you have been considering installing a
hitch on your MDX for a trailer, bike rack

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.129
or cargo carrier we will show you how easy
it is.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.081
Some may back off when they see the instructions
call for lowering the exhaust and removing

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.081
the heat shield.

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:11.081
You can do this!

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:12.860
The video will show you how and you will save
so much money doing this on your own

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.970
The first thing we want to do that will help
the install is lower the spare tire.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.179
Next we need to lower the exhaust and take
off this heat shield too.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.869
These both go back up when we are done, but
we need room to slip up the hitch so it will

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.140
go up on the side of the frame here and mount
in these four holes.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.250
At this point we will start removing the exhaust
brackets and then we will move on to the heat

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.160
shield.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.160
This is pretty flexible, we can move this
out of our way a little bit to give us more

00:00:43.160 --> 00:01:21.660
working room.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:34.770
We 
have 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:03:06.470
this side finished, now we will repeat for
the other side.
