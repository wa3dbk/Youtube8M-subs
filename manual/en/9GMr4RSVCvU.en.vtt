00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.090
Hi, Jim Thompson here.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.680
In today’s video, I’ll go over the second
set of steps to build this pine sofa table.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.650
Like I mentioned in the first video, this
project has been popular for me over the years

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.050
for gifts, customers even my own house.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.439
So if you're looking for a versatile project
to add to your line-up, why don’t you give

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.330
this table a try.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.619
Now today I’ll cover the build for the top,
the aprons as well as the two small drawers.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.800
And if you missed the first video for this
project, you can check it out by clicking

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.370
right over here.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.240
I’ll start with the table top today.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.210
After rough-cutting the lengths with the skill
saw, I’ll layout a grain pattern that looks

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.210
decent.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.120
I also try to minimize any cupping on the
top by alternating the natural curve of each

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.230
board.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.070
With positioning done, I’ll mark the order
of the stock for the glue-up.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.500
Next, I’ll rip each piece to equal dimensions.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.900
I want my rough-cut top to end-up one half
inch over the finished width.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.960
Then a couple passes on the jointer and we’re
ready for glue-up.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.060
As always, I’ll do a dry run with the clamps
first to get things set-up correctly.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.630
As I set-up the clamps, I’ll use scraps
on the outer edges to minimize any clamp marks.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.909
Just like the leg glue-up in the last video,
I’ll add glue to both surfaces being jointed.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.770
If the joints look good, I’ll mill the top
to the finished dimensions and set it aside

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.340
for the routing and sanding work.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.319
Now for the aprons.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.429
Milling three of the four aprons is quick
work on the table saw.

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.299
My dimensions are ten and a half by six for
the ends and forty and a half by six for the

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.130
back apron.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.850
Once I’m done on the table saw, I clean-up
the edges on the jointer.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.100
With the two drawer openings, my front apron
requires a bit more work though.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.750
I’ve got five components milled and jointed
for the front apron.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.040
I started with the top and bottom, milled
to one eighth inch over the final dimensions.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.470
Next, I’ll mill the three upright segments.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.180
The two ends are also oversized an eighth
of an inch.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.130
Now, I’ll mark and drill dowels to joint
all the components together.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.250
After a quick dry run, I’m ready to glue-up
the apron.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.320
You want to be sure the assembly is seated
flat in your clamps, so it doesn’t end-up

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.300
warped after drying.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.440
Once the glue has dried, I’ll trim the apron
to the final dimensions.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.230
Next, I’ll mill two biscuit joints into
each end to mate with the legs.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.270
Finally, I’ll mark and drill the holes that
receive the half inch guide dowels for my

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.310
two drawers.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.900
With the aprons done, I’ll start on the
drawers next.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.370
I’ll use half inch plywood for the drawer
sides and inside front.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.910
The back of the drawer width is one and a
quarter inches larger than the sides to offer

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.480
room for the guide dowel hole.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.620
With the components for the second drawer
pre-cut, I’ll start milling the rabbits

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.060
to joint things together.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.890
My rabbits are slightly oversized, so I can
flush trim them after gluing.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:44.460
Now I’ll cut the dadoes to accept the drawer
bottom.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.290
The dado depth is the same as my rabbit depth.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.260
With that done, I’ll drill counter-synch
holes for the two drawer pulls before I assemble

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.070
things.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.310
Now I’ll drill a three quarter-inch hole
straight through the drawer back for my guide

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.490
dowels.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.320
Just like the other glue-ups for this table,
I’ll start with a dry run to work out any

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.440
snags.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.480
Once the drawer glue has dried, I’ll flush
trim each rabbit joint with the router.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.460
Next I’ll mill my drawer faces.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.599
I recommend cutting your two faces from a
single piece of stock, so the grain pattern

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.030
is consistent.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.280
In the next sofa table video, I’ll mill
the corner braces and top fasteners and take

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.870
care of the rest of the routing and assembly.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.520
