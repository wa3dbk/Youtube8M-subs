00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.680
Safeguarding prevents access to dangerous
moving parts in machinery.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.800
Failure to implement safeguarding on this
potato harvester cost a farm worker her forearm.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.500
The farm used an old potato harvester pulled
by a tractor

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.700
and powered through the power take-off.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.600
One worker stood on each side of the harvester
to remove potato tops and potatoes from the conveyor

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.740
while two more workers on the back
collected potatoes, putting them into a bucket.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.000
A fifth worker followed and picked up any
potatoes left on the ground.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.500
It was cold the day of the incident.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
Worker 1 wore two pairs of gloves --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.030
an inner knitted pair and an outer pair with rubberized palms.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.579
She had reported to the farmer that the outer
pair was too large.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.200
Smaller gloves had been ordered but had not
yet arrived.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.400
Four workers were on the harvester.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.820
Workers 1 and 2 were on the back picking potatoes
off the moving conveyor.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.129
A potato fell to the bottom part of the conveyor.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.030
When Worker 1 reached in to retrieve it, her
glove got caught in the conveyor.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.170
She couldn't remove her hand from the glove.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.190
Workers 1 and 2 called the farmer to stop
the machine.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.900
He did, but with the stored energy, the conveyor
kept moving.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.190
Worker 1's arm became entangled between
the conveyor and a steel sprocket.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.130
9-1-1 was called.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.959
The local fire chief arrived and called in
another fire department which had training

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.220
in extricating people from farm machinery.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.100
Eventually the worker was freed, but the injuries
would result in the amputation of her forearm.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.600
It took 1 1/2 hours after the initial 9-1-1
call before the worker arrived at the hospital.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.200
Employers, including farms, must keep up-to-date
written procedures for providing first aid

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.069
and for arranging emergency transport.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.100
The primary cause of this accident was the
failure to have adequate safeguarding.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.500
If you examine the equipment, you can see
numerous components that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.600
could catch body parts and cause injury.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.700
Lack of training, instruction, and supervision
also contributed to this accident.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.900
The farmer didn't have the training to recognize
hazards nor adequate knowledge of the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.250
safety requirements for the workplace.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.500
As a result, the workers weren't given the
training or supervision

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.300
necessary to ensure their safety.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.090
The gloves were also a factor.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.400
Too big, they increased the chance of getting
caught in machinery.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.100
Wearing the second pair of gloves likely made
it more difficult for Worker 1

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.000
to free her hand once it was caught.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.800
Hundreds of farm workers are caught in or

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.300
entangled with farm machinery in Canada every year.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.300
Prevent injuries on your farm - know when
and where to use safeguarding.
