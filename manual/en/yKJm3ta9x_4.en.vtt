00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.408
So the world has become
very diverse and

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:18.140
everybody has some
ethnic background.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.410
And when we say ethnic
facial plastic surgery.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.020
What we mean is changes made to
the face within ethnic norms.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.860
Meaning it takes into
consideration features that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.370
defines someone's ethnicity.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.090
So that you make changes
that doesn't make you fit in

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.870
the group that you belong to.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.619
This has to do with how
you reshape the eyes.

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:44.126
It also has to do a lot with
how you reshape the nose, and

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:48.010
sometimes the jaw, and
the structure of the face.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.580
So in general, ethnic facial
plastic surgery seeks to

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.840
balance the face without making
features look out of place.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.470
For example, if someone who has
an Asian background comes to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.620
me and wants some reshaping
done to their face.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.060
One has to know how the Asian
skin response to surgery and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.770
factored into, into the surgery
we are planning the surgery.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.385
One also has to take into
consideration the jaw structure

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:22.503
of people with Asian ethnicity.

00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:25.217
So that all the surgical
techniques that are developed

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.960
will be, will be congruent
with the ethnicity.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.850
It seems true for
someone of African background.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.340
They are prone to scarring.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910
So whereas in one
particular ethnic group,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.760
incisions can be liberally made.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.950
In someone with
an African background,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.640
you would be very careful
where you place the incisions.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.380
All these features and means
of wound healing are factored

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.270
into the ethnic sensitive
facial plastic surgery.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.611
[MUSIC]

00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:00.329
So ethnic sensitive
rhinoplasty is a term that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.191
is being increasingly used to
define nasal reshaping that is

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.590
ethnically congruent.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.170
What do I mean by that?

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.894
If I see anyone of
Hispanic background.

00:02:11.894 --> 00:02:14.437
There are some features
on their face that I can,

00:02:14.437 --> 00:02:17.040
tells me this is
a Hispanic patient.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.810
If I put a nose on that face
that looks African-American,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.960
that nose may look
good in pictures, but

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.710
it's totally out of place.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.460
The same will go with me
putting a classically

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.870
Caucasian nose on
an African face.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.850
It may look good, but
it's out of place.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.990
So ethnic sensitive rhinoplasty
would be rhinoplasty, or

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.230
nasal reshaping that gives
a natural looking nose

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.510
that fits the remaining
ethnic features.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.150
Of course,
everyone who comes for

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.200
nasal reshaping may not
like certain features or

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.730
aspects of their nose that
they want to reshape.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.640
And as we are considering and
planning the surgery

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.120
we have to take over
whole look of your face.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.050
And make sure that everything
that we change balances

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.030
in the end.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.910
And ethnically sensitive
rhinoplasty looks good.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.640
It looks natural,
it doesn't look operated, and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.160
it's not the center of
attraction when it's done.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.110
So people communicate with
the nice looking eyes and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.040
not with the nose.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.397
[MUSIC]

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.902
There are some individuals, and

00:03:19.902 --> 00:03:23.130
it tends to be isolated
in some ethnicity.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.780
But not exclusively, who may
have very strong features that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.810
may make them either extremely
feminine, or masculine.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.500
For example,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.030
common among Asian females
will be a strong square jaw

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.670
which are features that we tend
to see in the male population.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.680
And there are some specific
surgeries designed

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.380
to change the shape of the jaw
to make it more feminine.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.430
And various times that I've
been used to describe it,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.820
a common term is called
the Haitian V-line.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.490
And what do we do?

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.820
If you have an outstanding jaw,
angle of the jaw and

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.772
that makes it too strong for
a feminine face.

00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:06.129
We have an ultrasonic dissector
that we can go in through

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.485
the mouth and sort of contour
the jaw and make it get a nice

00:04:10.485 --> 00:04:15.900
curvature and give it a very
defined, feminine looking face.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.000
And in some cases a very strong
cheek that is just out of place.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Someone has a slender
oval looking face, but

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.450
a thick big cheek bone or

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.775
jawbone that throws all
the picture out of balance.

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:31.805
In jaw reshaping, we can,
really carefully and

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:36.715
precisely, reshape those bones
to give a feminizing look.

00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:40.348
On the opposite hand, a male
may have a feminizing look,

00:04:40.348 --> 00:04:42.097
no strong jaw, weak chin.

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:44.759
And there are things that you
can do to contour those bones to

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.900
give them a very strong,
chiseled look.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.442
[MUSIC]

00:04:52.442 --> 00:04:55.440
And to start off of it, doing
your research is very good.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.720
Number one, you want to go to
a surgeon who's very comfortable

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.220
doing that procedure.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.700
Secondly you would like
someone who really understands

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.630
your goals.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.790
Because I believe one of the
most common reasons that people

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.320
are not satisfied with facial
plastic surgery is the inability

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.510
to communicate with their
surgeons exactly what they want.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.760
It's always my goal to make my
patients happy, and to do so

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.440
I would have to know
what exactly they want.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.520
They have to have the means
of communicating with me

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.100
what they want.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.344
So first be sure that you
are comfortable with the person

00:05:27.344 --> 00:05:28.870
you are consulting with.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.160
That you can communicate your
goals with them clearly.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.490
Be open to they telling you
that this cannot be done.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.455
And also factor it as
you make your decisions.

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:43.117
Also go to someone who works
with a team that nurtures good

00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:47.087
outcome is very good that the
anesthesiologist who works with

00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:49.321
these surgeons are very capable.

00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:51.600
Because this usually is
an elective surgery.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.260
And you want to go in safely and
come out safely.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.880
The after care is
also very important.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.910
So you should look
at the whole team.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.163
The team that can work
towards getting the best

00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:03.039
outcome for you.

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:09.308
[MUSIC]

00:06:09.308 --> 00:06:13.391
So at Johns Hopkins a division
of facial plastic surgery we

00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:17.470
have a focused interest in
ethnic sensitive surgery.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.830
What do I mean by that?

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.860
We have found ways to analyze
noses of every ethnicity and

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.220
faces of every ethnicity.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.053
We've done research
to support this.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:31.660
And we always push to get the
best outcome for our patients.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.410
If you choose to have
your ethnic sensitive

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.280
surgery done here.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.840
We will do everything
to make sure

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.760
that the experience will
be excellent for you.
