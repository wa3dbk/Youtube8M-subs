00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
(upbeat music)

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.970
- Hey guys! How's it going?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.890
So, today I'm going to
make some emoji pillows.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.673
At first, somebody
requested this on Twitter

00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:15.440
and I can't find that comment again.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.150
It was a while ago, over the summertime.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.142
And, at first, I was just like,

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:22.990
mmm I'm not into making these
cutesy-wootsy things anymore.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.700
I do use these emojis a
lot, whenever I'm texting

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.280
or whenever I'm on social media.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.840
So, it only makes sense
for me to make the pillows

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.030
and Valentine's Day is coming

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.750
so I will be using two
of my favorite ones:

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.170
which is the kissing one and
the ones with heart eyes.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.210
So cute!

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.210
So, let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.800
For materials I will
be using yellow fleece

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.300
and depending on how
big you want your pillow

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.461
that should vary based on
the size of your pillow.

00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.810
Down on my list: pillow batting,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.260
for the eyes and mouth I will
be using red and black felt,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.190
I also bought brown, just in case.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.860
Have your fabric double folded

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.230
with the right sides facing in

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.190
and the wrong sides facing out.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.482
Now, look for a circular
object in your home

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:08.740
and use that as your tracing guide.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.080
I'm using this big bin
that I found at home.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.910
And it makes the perfect
size for a decorative pillow.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.120
Here, I'm tracing around the circumference

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.500
and now with my ruler
I'm going to trace out

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.460
half an inch for the seam allowance.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.670
After you've cut out your circle,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.380
take out some clothing pins

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.970
and pin the two patterns together.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.840
Now, sew the circle pattern together

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.300
and make sure to leave an opening

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.180
so that way you can turn this inside out.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.810
You can also apply the
non-sewing method to this.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.140
I have plenty of
tutorials where I show you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020
how to use the non-sewing method.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.400
So, if you have fabric glue
or you have a hot glue gun,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.360
you can do this with a hot
glue gun or fabric glue.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.894
Before turning the circle
pattern inside out,

00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:51.780
I suggest for you to
make a few triangle snips

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.290
just like what I'm doing here,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.490
to prevent any rippling
along the seam line.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.420
I hope you guys are
enjoying this DIY so far

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.920
and now we are on to
drawing the cute details.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.413
So, on the side I took
out a piece of paper

00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:10.590
and I drew some hearts
to use as my template.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.470
And then I traced that
onto my felt materials.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.350
So, now I have two red hearts.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.964
To make the rest of the face

00:02:17.964 --> 00:02:19.550
it's pretty much the same steps.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.020
But I'm drawing it out on my sketch book

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.270
and once I'm happy with the way it looks

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.142
then I cut out each piece as my template,

00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:30.160
trace that onto the felt material,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.870
and then cut it out again.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.700
Once you like the way it looks

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.750
go ahead and take out your hot glue

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.910
and glue on the eyes and the mouth.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.540
Let the glue settle, then
you can take your batting

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.460
and fill your pillow up.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.590
After you are happy with the results

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.701
take our your hot glue gun again
and close the last opening.

00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:51.640
Alright guys, that is it for today.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.260
Thank you so much for watching.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.560
Don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.320
I would really appreciate it.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.930
That just shows me that you appreciate

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.680
my time and effort that
I put into my videos.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.554
Other than that, let me
know if you like this.

00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:06.980

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.440

Instagram, or Facebook

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.660
so that way I can see your recreations.

Just tag me: DIYWITHANN.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.110
I would love, love to see your recreation.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.540
I'm going to start trying
to put together some collage

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.790
so that way I can put it
toward the end of my videos

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.960
and share it with the rest of the world.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.380
So, if you don't mind
me sharing your pictures

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.080
then hashtag me.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.980
And that is it for today.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.280
Also, comment below-

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.050
let me know what you are
doing right at this moment.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.050
It's just a really random question

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.560
but I never, you know sometimes I wonder

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.620
what are they doing

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.250
besides sitting in front of your computer

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.320
but what else are you doing?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.513
Are you eating?

00:03:43.513 --> 00:03:44.373
Are you watching TV

00:03:44.373 --> 00:03:45.860
at the same time you are on the computer?

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.223
It's just a really interesting thought.

00:03:49.223 --> 00:03:51.610
Alright guys, I will talk to
you next time (kissing sound).

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.806
Ciao.
