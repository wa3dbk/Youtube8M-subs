00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:18.835
This artist is Yirawala. 

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:24.599
He came from west Arnhem Land and he was one of the
most influential and greatest artists of the region.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.199
He was called, in fact, 'the
Picasso of Arnhem Land'.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.699
He was a man of high ritual status who
influenced a number of younger artists,

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.267
many of whom are actually represented
in the exhibition Old Masters.

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:45.599
Yirawala is one of the two key artists
in the exhibition Old Masters.

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:52.799
This painting, Totemic Crocodile, is an excellent example
of the way he introduced innovations into bark painting.

00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:56.107
Here we see a variation
on a clan pattern.

00:00:56.395 --> 00:01:00.282
On one side of the crocodile you will
see a series of parallel lines,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.093
whereas on the other you will see sections of angled or diagonal
lines, which in fact are a variation on the same clan pattern.

00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:17.664
In the history of European art, a lot of innovation
is introduced by younger experimental artists,

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:24.599
whereas in Arnhem Land, especially in Aboriginal
Australia, it is the older, more senior artists

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:29.398
who have the knowledge and the rights to actually
change things who introduce the innovations.

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:32.777
And Yirawala is precisely
one of those artists.

00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:42.899
The National Museum wanted to put on the exhibition Old Masters
of bark paintings from Arnhem Land in northern Australia

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:47.999
to show the beauty and significance of
bark painting as a form of high art.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.227
The National Museum's collection
contains over 2000 bark paintings.

00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:55.200
It is the largest
collection in the world.

00:01:55.201 --> 00:02:02.099
Old Masters focuses on 122 of these paintings, many
of which have never been seen in Australia before.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.383
In Old Masters we wanted to also explore
how traditions are passed down

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:08.699
from one generation
to the next.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:15.852
So we're looking at artistic families or dynasties of artists, and
also the relationship between master artists and their students.

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.599
This is a painting called 'Tree Spirit' by
David Malangi from central Arnhem Land.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.208
It represents the spirit of a being
that is associated with death,

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.740
and David has a particular way of
drawing these macabre spirit beings.

00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:42.298
You can see in this painting how
the claws are extending out,

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.799
and also the figure is drawn in profile so that we can
see the ribs in a style of painting we called X- ray.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.687
David Malangi was also colloquially known 
as 'dollar Dave',

00:02:53.905 --> 00:03:00.693
because one of his paintings associated with this one 
about the great ancestral hunter

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:07.499
was used on the original&nbsp;$1 note when decimal currency 
was introduced in Australia in 1966.

00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:21.598
The interesting thing about this painting
is that it is autobiographical.

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:26.218
It shows that bark painting can reflect an
artist's own experience in the modern world.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.999
The artist is Mawalan Marika from eastern Arnhem Land,
and the painting is called 'Sydney from the Air'.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:38.699
It was painted as one of a series
after he visited the city of Sydney

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.699
for the first time in
his life in 1961.

00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:47.043
Mawalan has used the traditional techniques of east
Arnhem Land painting, the use of the cross hatching,

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:53.699
to show buildings and the roads that
join them as if seen from an aeroplane.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.299
In fact, it is also
like a map of country.

00:03:57.387 --> 00:04:01.799
On one side of the picture you can see
the coast and the harbour of Sydney.

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.782
This artist is Narritjin Maymuru
from eastern Arnhem Land.

00:04:09.163 --> 00:04:12.599
He is one of the two key artists
in the exhibition Old Masters.

00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:22.799
Narritjin was renowned for the fact that he used art as a means of expressing
the significance of Aboriginal culture to non- Aboriginal people.

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:26.099
This painting is called
'Coat of Arms'.

00:04:26.213 --> 00:04:36.299
If we look at the top section of the picture, we can see two animals: one a
kangaroo representing the earth and the other an emu representing the sky.

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:42.357
What Narritjin is doing with this picture is using
elements that we see in every day of our lives,

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:49.799
things we are very familiar with, and reconfiguring them to
emphasise the importance of Aboriginal culture in Australia

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:54.298
but also that Australia is a mixture of different races,
of different cultures and of different societies -

00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:56.962
it's a place where these
different things come together.

00:04:59.218 --> 00:05:05.762
I&nbsp;think people should come and see Old Masters
because it will introduce them to an art form

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:10.818
which is one of the oldest continuing
traditions of art known to humanity.

00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:15.818
It is also, of course, an Australian
form of art, school of art if you like,

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.699
which is of great significance in
the cultural life of this country.

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:27.599
But I suppose more importantly people need to come and
see this to learn more about Aboriginal culture,

00:05:27.712 --> 00:05:34.751
to enjoy the aesthetic of art in bark painting
and also to be inspired by what they see.
