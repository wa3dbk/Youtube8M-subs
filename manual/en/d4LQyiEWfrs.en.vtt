Hello everyone my name is Frank and today I 
will be reviewing a great little tool that can help 
you determine the speed of your hard drives  

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.033
this tool can be used on a network mapped drive 
to check the speed of your network folder and it 
can also be used on an SCSI 

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:16.000
drive if you have one, or simply just a SATA drive 
connected to your machine

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.033
its interface is simple and easy to understand

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:24.000
it requires no installation and simply runs in 
memory during the time you are using the 
program.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It creates a small temp folder on the drive that it 
is testing, and it deletes that folder after the 
tests complete.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so it really bares no negative impact on your 
computer

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.033
as you see when I launch the software all I have 
to do in simply quickly click Run

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.033
and allow it to run

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:41.066
I will move this over to my main screen

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:47.033
as you can see in the graphic interface, it will 
show you all your drives, nice and easy to 
understand there is no guess work as to which 

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.066
drive you are testing or anything like that

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:56.066
for this particular test I will be using the 64 KB 
default block size I'm going to click on my V: 

00:00:56.066 --> 00:01:02.000
drive so this way it also clear as to which drive I 
am testing and I click the start button

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.033
as you can see during the test, the Read and 
Write speeds are very easy to understand 
there's 

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:12.066
no guesswork as to how fast is this drive truly 
working at our anything like that

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:18.000
and the one thing that's nice about this new 
version of Parkdale is that at the end of both 
tests the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.066
read and write, it also shows a quick latency 
test on the drive as well

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.033
now if you want to get parkdale there is a couple 
ways he can do that

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:35.066
you can go to Google and you can type in the 
term parkdale hard drive speed test that's one 
of your choices, you can

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:44.066
click on the Softpedia Parkdale link usually 
near the top and it will most likely be the default 
or the latest version I should say

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.033
if you click on that link

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:50.066
you'll notice there's on some cases you might 
see a couple different download buttons 

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:53.000
and it might be a bit confusing with which one 
we truly want

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
when we hover over this download button, we will 
actually see. Click here to download Parkdale, 
so we click on that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.066
it takes us to the download page

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:07.066
I generally choose the Softpedia Secure 
Servers just because it is probably a lot less 
likely that you are going to 

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:11.033
have any problems with the software in terms of 
Malware or anything else that you don't want

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:16.066
click on the link and of course we save it to our 
local hard drive

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:25.000
now we are not going go through that task, just 
because there's just no point in doing that. 
However you get the understanding of how that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.033
works. Your other option would be to simply go 
to Softpedia and also type in the term Parkdale

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:35.033
that should bring up your your option to 
download that software as well

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:43.033
now there is many uses for this particular piece 
software, if you have multiple hard drives on your 
computer as I do here and you are wondering 

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:47.066
which one of these drive to be the best to 
perhaps run virtual machines off of. Naturally you 
want to find the one that's the fastest because 

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:51.033
you will get the best performance off of that

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:57.066
or perhaps maybe you have an SCSI drive that 
you're connected to and it's connecting up 
across the network but not sure why it's running 

00:02:57.066 --> 00:03:04.066
slower, if it's even truly running slow. This tool 
will allow you to get a benchmark for that 
particular test

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:12.066
and best of all this tool is free! So give it a try 
and you will probably find how great the tool 
truly is. Thank you very much for watching my 

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:17.000
video I hope you enjoyed it and I plan to post 
more helpful videos in the future
