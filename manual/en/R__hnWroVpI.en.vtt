00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(Music Plays)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(Graeme) Well welcome back viewers

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Graeme) So we're gonna join David again now, and he's actually going to show us how he actually

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
prepares the paint or the glazing methods that he uses to actually

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
go onto. But you've got those little ceramic dishes there, mate. (David) Yeah,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the idea of it is once that I get a color that really works for me (Graeme) Yep. (David) I like

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to keep it. Now I have to get, you know do it in quantity and it's

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
also got to be really thin. (Graeme) Sure. (David) So basically what I really do is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I mix up a small amount, (Graeme) Okay. (David) usually about

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
something like that. And I'll

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
put (Graeme) Like a syringe. (David) yeah, actually I keep these handy cause

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I can measure just how much water I want to go in there. (Graeme) Oh okay, (David) Okay, (Graeme) really

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
precise then isn't it? (David) Well as it's as precise as you can get it, but you see then I just have to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
work it pretty much.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(Graeme) So you've really just made, you've made an acrylic wash there haven't you? (David) Well that's what

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I do. See that to me, I wouldn't work with that thickness. (Graeme) Yeah.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
(David) But to get to that stage I just have to keep

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
adding water. (Graeme) Okay.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(David) But that just gives

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
you an idea, I like to have the least amount of color and build

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it up from there, because that's were the excitement comes. (Graeme) How do you keep that from going off then? You do a lasting

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
want to do is dry it out once you've prepared it all. (David) This is the magic of it. There's two methods I use.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
One is I'll cover it in

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
clingwrap, or alternatively

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
this way if I want to keep it and if I'm happy with that, if

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I want to do a series or do another painting using that color, (Graeme) Yeah. (David) I'll go back

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to these - these are blunt by the way, these are blunt needles. You get them from the chemist. I'll just

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
draw it up. (Graeme) So you just draw it in the syringe? (David) Just draw it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in the syringe. (Graeme) Wow, That's pretty cool isn't it? (David) And

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
(Graeme) There you go. (David) take that off, use a bit of that what we call

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
blu tack or yellow tack or whatever tack you want to use.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Let the ends dry, no air gets in

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because (Graeme) It stays there? (David) it's stored. It'll

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
stay this way. Acrylics will stay that way for

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
particularly with a mixture of water for as long as I want.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Graeme) From here, we're going to airbrush, we're

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
going to airbrush the highlights. Now the detail that you've got in this is quite extraordinary.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Obviously to get the depth of field in your work you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
take off, you take off sections of the paint. (David) Well

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the best, I think the best way to treat light

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
with watercolors, I say watercolors, I mean I'm using acrylics now which

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
are - I'm using them as watercolors. (Graeme) Sure. (David) And I like

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to use, I still like to use the base white of the paper. (Graeme) Aha,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
(David) Now airbrushes - you can use them for putting paint on, you can use them for taking paint off.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and I actually use it more for taking paint off. (Graeme) Aha.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
(David) And with, particularly with Atelier the thing I like about it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
is I can leave it for three or four days, which I've done here, right.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
This I did more than

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
three days ago. (Graeme) Okay. (David) Now ordinarily this is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the trouble I had originally with acrylics years ago, I've of course come back to them,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I wasn't able to get back into it and get to the paper - now I can.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
(Graeme) Sure. (David) I can get this, this um, and I still go back to the paper

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and use that as my reflection. (Graeme) That's what Interactive does, that's why it's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
amazing, you can get the color back, you know. (David) I use airbrush probably differently than

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
most people because I tend to use the airbrush to take the paint off, rather than

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
put it on. (Graeme) Well lets, in saying that because I'm sure that the viewers really want to see

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
you at work, (David) Okay. (Graeme) lets go about the process of you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
working on one of these areas, cause the detail when you look at this viewers is

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
quite amazing. But let's work on one of these areas

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and lets just show them how you actually manipulate and manufacture the (David) Okay.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
(Graeme) end result.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
(David) It's important to also have

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
a tissue handy (Graeme) Sure. (David) because it will spread. And this is really

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
about - this is how I do it. So

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
remember I want to get back to that base color. (Graeme) Yeah. (David) The base

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
white, you can see it's coming off gradually there. (Graeme) Aha.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(David) So I tend to leave

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
my base colors on now for two, sometimes three days, so that

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
usually I'm unblocking fluid. It just gives me a

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
seems to be a cleaner, crisper finish.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Graeme) I can understand now why it takes you six months to do a painting.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
(David) Well I better hurry, mate. (Graeme) He's a dedicated

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
man. (David) Well, I better hurry. If you're going to do it do it properly, you know. (Graeme) That's great.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
(David) That's my airbrushing technique. (Graeme) That's amazing. Alright

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Dave, from right here you're actually going to show us how to do a wash on that sort of reddish area you've got there.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
How do you go about that cause I can see it's a very, very subtle situation

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
you've got? (David) Well it really is pretty straight forward, Graeme. It's,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
it's not, it's not unlike

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
normal watercolor in many ways. I

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
work wet on wet, but again it's just a matter of building

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
it up. This time I'm going to use a yellow

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
acrylic wash (Graeme) Yeah. (David) very gently.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
(David) Just get a bit more of the

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
(Graeme) Yeah. (David) Atelier from here, (Graeme) Yeah. (David) mix it into this

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
bowl which I've already used this morning. And I use very, very little

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
water, and I don't really care at this stage whether it's

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
even too light.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It's a wash, it just gives - helps me gauge, and I might

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
glaze over this area ten different times over the period of time.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
But it just helps me build up very slowly

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
an undertone. (Graeme) It's really

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
(David) It's very straight forward isn't it? (Graeme) And you don't find that you stripping

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the color up underneath? (David) No, it's not. No (Graeme) It's not.(David) because again

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
it's only light (Graeme) Yeah. (David) and whilst I could if I

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
was using, if I was using the unlocking formula (Graeme) Yeah. (David) then

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.060
(David) then fine, it probably would, but I'm only using - in this case I'm mainly using water. (Graeme) Just the water, yeah.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:48.000
(Music Plays)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
(Graeme) OK viewers, well while Dave is still proceeding  with his washers there.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.860
We'll cut away to another commercial break and we'll see him when we get back.
