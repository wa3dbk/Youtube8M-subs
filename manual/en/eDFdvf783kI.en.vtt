00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.880
what's up guys Fated here and welcome back
to my channel for another weekly video

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.790
and today I got the Lenovo U530 that
they sent me lets

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.020
go ahead and take a look at some of these
specs that we got here

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.970
the CPU in this laptop is an Intel i7
4500U

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.349
1.8 gigahertz is, it's not quite
what I wanted but

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.679
I think it'll do the job ram is also 8 gigabytes

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.899
and the hard drive is a 1 terabyte with
the also an SSD attached to it

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.530
which is 16 gigabytes and that is also a
hybrid drive as well

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.629
and a lan card which is pretty
decent I'm thinking

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.809
We will have to find out and a screen
which is great it's a great looking screen

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.030
that will make everything pop on
this one and also the battery I have heard

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.250
some really good things about the
battery on this about maybe five hours

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.510
of battery life which is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.680
which is pretty decent which it also has windows 8.1 on it for those that care

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.900
and here you can see all my serial
numbers please don't steal my serial

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.350
numbers

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.520
Just kidding haha

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.280
Also have not broken the seal so this
has not been opened this is not a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.720
fake unboxing

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.799
see it has not been broken so lets

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.799
open this thing up and break the seal

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.220
obviously a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.650
power cable, much smaller than the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.910
Y510p I have to say that is very
tiny

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.760
that is nice the other one I had was a
a very very large about the size of a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.760
DVD case

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.319
and other than that we have a little

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.189
booklet here

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.239
I like this black rapping they have, very very nice

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.550
a very slim

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.880
like the look of it the back panel..

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.880
and... the top panel

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.110
nice 15-inch screen there

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.110
15.6 I should say

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.240
does have a backlit keyboard you'll be
able to see more this in the review

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.950
video

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.780
if you wanna check that out just check it
down in the description

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.630
very very nice how slim that is

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.040
pretty good for Lenovo and how much
power they pack in there

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.730
did say that this does come the 730

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.950
Nvidia g-force

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.340
see how much you it can bend back here

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.740
pretty sturdy

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.210
alright lets go ahead and look at all these
ports that

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.210
its got on there let's see

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.140
here you have your power input

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.480
you have your USB, USB

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.170
now also an SD card slot and a battery
indicator on the far

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.820
and then a power indicator right there
lets flip it around to the other side

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.820
see what we have here see that looks like a
headphone jack or headphone and mic jack

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.540
and a USB 3.0

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.590
HDMI output and of course

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.910
Ethernet Lanport and your Lenovo

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.070
recovery button right there, show you the back side

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.750
nothing really to see you there and the
front

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.880
nothing to really see here

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.880
either nice little logo here

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.630
"for those that do" alright so I'm
gonna do a

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.500
full review of this and tell you guys
what's good about it, what's bad about it

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.100
and do some benchmarks as well going to try out Battlefield 4

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.420
and see how well it runs on that probably going to look at

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.260
something like medium settings will probably something that will be playable

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.390
and then gonna run it through some 3d
mark

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.550
maybe PC mark to just see what this thing can punch out

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.780
If I have not told you already

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.670
this is just under 1000 American dollars for this kit

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.480
there are some that are cheaper on the Lenovo website

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.500
but this one is just a bit like maybe
950 I think you can find it at

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.240
Best Buy

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.920
but you know Best Buy you know how they
are so yeah
