00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.066
Have you ever seen this search result when 
you’ve search for a book at Brock? 

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.000
No matches found. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.033
Or, when you’ve searched for an article and you 
find that we don’t subscribe to the journal. 

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:15.000
It is possible you may still be able to get the 
book or article. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.033
That’s what RACER is. It’s an online system 
that allows Brock students to order materials 

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:23.000
from other university libraries in Ontario. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.033
It means that your research is not limited to 
what the Brock Library has. 

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:31.033
That’s right, all this is at your fingertips inside 
RACER, and it’s free. 

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.033
Cool, eh? 

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:36.000
Let’s get you set up with an account and then I’ll 
show you how it works. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
From the Brock Library web site, click on 
“Interlibrary Loan.” 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then go to the “End User Registration Form.” 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.066
You’ll need to log-in with your Brock credentials, 
then fill out this form. 

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:52.033
You’ll have to make up a password that is 
unique to RACER so make sure that you write it 
down somewhere and for the e-mail address, 

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.066
use your brock e-mail. Now that you’re 
registered 

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.033
we can go back to the interlibrary loans page 
and this time 

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:01.066
click on “Search RACER and Submit Requests.” 

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:07.033
Your log-in is your student number, the 
password is what you just created, and the 
library is Brock. 

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:12.033
If you forget your password, drop by the library 
to have your password reset. 

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:15.066
Okay, now we’re in RACER and we can order 
books and articles. 

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.066
There are two ways to use RACER: 

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:23.066
you can search directly in RACER when you 
have a specific title that you’re looking for. 

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:27.033
Or, when you have all the information about a 
book or an article that you want, 

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.066
fill in this blank request form. 

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.000
I’ll start with searching for a specific title. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.033
To do a specific title search, 

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:38.066
we’ll use the Advanced Search. 

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.000
Let’s say I’d like to find this book, “Dreaming in 
Public.” 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.066
Enter the title into the “title search” field and 
click search. 

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:51.066
As RACER’s working, you’ll see from this 
screen the list of university libraries that RACER 
is simultaneously searching. 

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:54.066
Okay, so here’s our search results. 

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.000
I want this book ordered and I’ve double checked 
the Brock Library 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.033
to make sure that we don’t already own it. 

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:05.000
Remember: RACER’s only for materials we do 
not own. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
To order this, the “Get It” icon to the right of the 
titles 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
allows you to select the book you want ordered 
and it 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.066
automatically fills in information about the book 
in this request form. 

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.000
Click “Request” to submit the form. Remember: 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.033
this is a free service. 

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:24.000
However, if you do not pick up the book or article 
you’ve ordered, 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.033
there will be a five dollar charge for each item. 

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:32.033
Let’s look at the second way to use RACER 
now using a blank request form. 

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:38.000
You’ll want to use this when what you’re looking 
for does not appear in your search results in 
RACER. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.033
This can happen when you’re searching for 
specific journal articles because 

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:46.033
RACER does not search the contents of 
journals for individual articles. 

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:51.066
In this case you’ll want to search one of the 
databases or see if we have a subscription to 
the journal. 

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:55.033
Here’s the blank request form. 

00:02:55.033 --> 00:03:01.033
You’ll notice this is the same request form we 
just saw that was automatically filled in by the 
get it icon. 

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:07.033
Before filling in the details make sure you have 
selected the correct format from the drop down 
menu beside format. 

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:11.000
You’ll see you can order a variety of different 
types of items. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Mostly you’ll be ordering books and journal 
articles. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.066
Now fill in the red sections and click “Request.” 

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:24.066
Once submitted, the item will generally arrive 
within 3-5 business days. 

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:28.000
When it arrives you’ll get an e-mail to pick up 
the item at the library. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.066
That’s all you need to know to get yourself 
started with RACER. 

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.033
Let’s review a few things to remember: 

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:37.033
you can only order items that Brock does not 
have, 

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:42.000
it’s free but there’s a five dollar charge for not 
picking up the item, 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.066
and you can order journal articles in RACER but 
you cannot search for journal articles by title 
within RACER. 

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:54.033
Finally, you might ask yourself: how do you find 
out about books or articles 

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.000
that Brock doesn’t have? 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.066
We have a video called the Citation Hunt and it’ll 
teach you how to do this.
