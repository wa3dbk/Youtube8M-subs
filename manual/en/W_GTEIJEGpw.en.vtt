00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.280
okay folks I've got your responses from
the recent survey

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.379
thank you for participating and also
thank you for your generosity

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.559
I was pretty blown away by how
supportive people really are

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.820
at this point I should really realize
that and stop

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.699
underestimating the supportiveness of my
audience. I mean

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.180
on several occasions you have been very
supportive and very positive towards the

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.000
things I do

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.599
and everything so I should just realize
that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.769
and yeah again thank you very much
and

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.809
I will just go ahead and set up a Tubestart campaign (actually IndieGoGo now)

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.079
crowdfunding, it will be linked down below

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.440
in the crotch bar, belly bar... whatever. And I'll
do it via flexible funding

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.660
so that there is a certain goal, say

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.280
those 1500, well it's probably
going to be more like 1700

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.500
with sales tax included... all that "good"
stuff

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.550
But

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.150
there are still some other options for the camera

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.220
some people, actually quite a
few people, have suggested a DSLR

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.520
camera. I may considered as well, that
would be cheaper. So

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.850
another possible goal would be like, what, 600... 800

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.889
something like that. And judging by
the survey a lot of people are willing to

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:16.920
contribute at least

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.380
something like five bucks so quite a
few even said

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.689
25 or more than fifty, so that's a lot of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.530
cash that comes together so I could
definitely easily upgrade

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.180
the video equipment and depending on
exactly how much it is it may even be enough

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.869
for the

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.220
the armor project. Well, speaking of which,
the armor sponsor actually

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.840
contacted me so he wasn't dead or
whatever

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.659
he said that he are just was so busy that he
basically forgot to respond to my

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:48.360
emails so

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.600
that is in theory still on the table. But

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.380
depending on how the crowd funding goes

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.070
there is still room for other stuff... you know,
other types of armor

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.990
I like or what we were thinking about
you know

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.540
in my conversation with that armor sponsor we were actually thinking

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.679
about 16th century

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.599
Landsknecht armor and there are
plenty of other things that would also

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.550
be really interesting

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.870
you know more earlier medieval

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.730
armor or what I would also be very
interested in would be a full

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.770
Celtic outfit. Some people have
also said screw the video quality we

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.989
just wanna see more

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.560
swords and armor for review which
yeah I can understand that point of view

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.010
as well

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.209
the way I'm just going to do is I will

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.209
let you vote on whatever I

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.640
spend the money on when the
crowdfunding campaign is over

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.700
so I'll just tell you okay, I have so and so much

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.150
this would be enough or this and that, or
that and blablabla

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.600
Just give you a  number of options and you can just vote on whatever you want me to

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.640
acquire for the channel. And

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.280
yeah, we can just take it
from there. The other thing is as far as

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.700
the intro is concerned most people say an
intro

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.079
is OK its short enough, so I may come up
with something that's

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.220
like three seconds or something. But
more important

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.450
and I agree with that is an outro.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.940
I'm going to put something together. A standard outro or maybe

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.140
several which I can switch between.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.650
and finally I figured I could actually
try to help you guys with your Christmas

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.470
shopping and I actually put together a
list of knives

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.920
on Amazon which are pre-selected by

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.390
certain manufacturers which I
consider to be making generally

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.930
quality knives are so that you don't have to
deal with all the cheapo stuff.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.019
I have a link both for

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.549
amazon.com for you in the US as well as
for

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.850
Amazon.ca for those in
Canada

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.810
if you're somewhere else sorry but you
can at least look at the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.359
list and also you can probably order
from

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.430
there as well. Amazon is a bit finicky
with

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.030
what they're shipping where but it's at least worth a try

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.370
and maybe you can at least get some inspiration
from that.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.880
Plus it's also actually a way
of supporting the channel

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.730
because those are affiliate
links so if you

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.860
go through that link on Amazon and
do your Christmas shopping and buy

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.220
knives and stuff for people then I also get a
percentage of that

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.210
in store credit so I can then use that
to

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.470
get more stuff for future reviews so
everybody wins, right?

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.030
Same with Kult of Athena, I
also have an affiliate link

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.870
for that so again will be down below
in the video description, so if you want to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.110
buy someone a sword for Christmas or
they also

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.630
have other stuff, they also have armor, clothing

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.670
other weapons, axes, maces, warhammers

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.610
all kinds of stuff, so definitely interesting.
And if you do that, again,

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.650
I also get a percentage in store
credit

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.110
so I think that's it for now again

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.170
thank you very much for your supportiveness

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.950
if that's a word... I think it is. For your support.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.910
And yeah, it's highly appreciated. Definitely awesome. You're helping make the channel better and

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.230
have more content for future videos. Okay

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.230
that's it for now. Thanks for watching, and see ya.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.180
home

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.430
