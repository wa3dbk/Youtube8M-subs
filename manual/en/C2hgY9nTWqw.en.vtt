00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.580
Hi, this is Toby with HMC Electronics.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.270
We're going to be taking a look at the Milwaukee
M4 Lithium Screwdriver.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.540
Included with the 2101-21, you're going to
get the charger.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.290
It takes about 45 minutes to charge up the
battery right here.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.670
This is a 4-Volt Lithium battery.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.490
You're going to get the tool itself and one
Phillips head screwdriver.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.629
You're not going to get the HMC mug.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:34.730
Sorry.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.870
So, take the battery out here.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.429
It cannot be inserted the incorrect way, which
is kind of nice.

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.280
They did this thing where they've got this
little tongue and groove mechanism here.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.589
It does come with a slight charge.

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.559
The tool itself has a two-speed setting.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.809
Lock in your battery, right there.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.249
It has two speed settings: 200 RPM and 600
RPM.

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:06.850
The output as far as inch-pounds torque: It's
going to go all the way up to 44-inch pounds.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.930
And it has this kind of 21-position clutch
sensor.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.180
Really at the drill setting it's the highest
torque available on the tool.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.740
Couple of nice things about lithium batteries
if you compare them to a nicad battery: When

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.039
a nicad battery begins to lose power, the
tool gets progressively slower and less powerful.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.829
When you're working with lithium, it's got
full charge or no charge.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.000
So you're going to go from working, working,
working to then dying.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.049
With a nice quick charge on the 45 minutes
what you can do is if you've been working

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.179
for a prolonged period of time, you can then
plug it in while you're on break, come back,

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.170
and it's then fully charged.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.119
Your run time on a lithium battery is also
50% higher than your standard nicad battery.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.271
So if you're replacing the old Milwaukee tool
into this one, you're going to notice that

00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:06.549
you've got that increased 50% run time.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.750
The other thing that's really cool on this,
you've got a two-year warranty on the battery.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.590
You've got a 5-year warranty on the tool itself.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.080
So you've got a tool here for not very much
money is going to give you a really good shelf

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.360
life.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.140
Wondering how you're doing on your battery?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.600
You don't want to be caught in the middle
of a job.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.730
You've got a little battery meter right on
the side here.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.190
So as we plug in--like I said, it does come
with a little bit of a charge--you're going

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:44.890
to be able to see right here, there you go,
take a look and you can see that it's actually

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.610
showing you how much charge you have on your
battery.
