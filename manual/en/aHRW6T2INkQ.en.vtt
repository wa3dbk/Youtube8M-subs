00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.970
HI I’m Sean Martin President and Founder
of Donek Snowboards about four weeks ago I

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.030
got the opportunity to see a plate system
from those guys up in Canada and I got the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.690
chance to ride a plate system that most people
don’t know exists.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.130
I was completely blown away by the performance.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.220
The stability that it adds to the board is
amazing I was riding faster and feeling more

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:40.620
comfortable then I think I ever have, I couldn’t
feel the icy chopped up terrain that I was

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.589
on and felt incredibly comfortable.

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:55.469
So, I started to thinking how can I make something
like this and began making sketches and trying

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:04.960
to figure out what I could do to make an extremely
simple plate, it’s not my goal to make a

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.659
thousand dollar plate it’s my goal to make
a plate that just about anybody can afford

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:20.400
hopefully and feel what I was able to feel
so what I’ve done and mind you this is a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.969
prototype this is the first one started on
this about four days ago this is just a wood

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.820
core with fiber glass top and bottom right
now it’s got a clear top sheet on it so

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.479
you can see what’s going on its got inserts
from mounting and bindings also got inserts

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.619
from mounting hardware on the opposite side
of the core and some through holes for accessing

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:53.240
components that get mounted underneath the
plate we are using a hole pattern I believe

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:04.920
it’s similar to the Canadian hole pattern
and um we will be attempting to adapt a plate

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.930
to work a four by four but at this point this
is the most convenient way to do it so I’m

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.730
gonna go ahead and mount this to the board
and show you what it looks like when it’s

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:27.810
not and what a plate system actually does
when it’s working.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:36.870
Oh, our total weight here on all the components
on this very first prototype is about five

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.390
point nine pounds presumably we will be able
to shave off some of that weight.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.580
I’ve already identified some of the areas
where we can there’s a couple components

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.540
here that are fixes to problems to that occurred
that we didn’t anticipated on our first

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.540
build.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.700
And we’ll go ahead and compensate for those
in future designs and that’s just about

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700
it.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.620
We’ll go ahead and start assembling it.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:47.459
Unfortunately at this point we’re having
to use a four millimeter flat head screw it’s

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:57.250
the only way we can get the clints but hopefully
in the future we will find a way to do it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:06.510
with a five millimeter problem is with a five
millimeter has a button head or raised head

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:15.659
on it so we have a little bit of clearance
issue and that was ultimate taller stack.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:54.970
Right now we’ll be using a four millimeter
but hopefully…

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:16.360
(Sounds)
Okay so all mounted up now like I said we

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.780
got a pivot back here and a slider up here.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:30.740
So when we flex the board we’re gonna see
that the front end slides you can see a little

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:41.060
bit of motion there and the back end stays
fixed essentially what that does for us is

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:48.410
allows the board to flex completely naturally
underneath us and keeps our stance and feet

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:57.910
in that fixed position we spent so much time
on develop we spend all this time and energy

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.160
developing and figuring out what our angle
should be what our cant should be how our

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.590
boot should be set up and on a typical snow
board we get into a turn and the board bends

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.530
and what happens on those cants and all those
angles change you know our body adapts but

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.680
when we hit something irregular in the snow
it changes very very rapidly and that throws

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:29.410
us for a big loop, by doing something like
this our stance stays static it never moves

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:37.220
we become very very stable and what goings
on with the board underneath us is a result

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:44.380
of uneven terrain as a result of ice as result
of big balls of ice or whatever we might hit

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.440
it’s just going on with the board it’s
not happening to us anymore it just happens

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:57.270
to the board so this is an incredible advancement
it’s incredibly amazing the performance

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.170
you can gain from something like this.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:06.490
We’re gonna go up and test this up in A
basin for the first time and possibly a couple

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:15.820
times next week and hopefully we’ll be able
to release something for you next season that

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.490
you can afford to buy and that can really
enhance your riding experience.
