00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello! We are HANDS on TECHNOLOGY and we love robots.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500
That's why we organize the FIRST LEGO League -

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.700
the LEGO robot competition for girls and boys.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.200
The FIRST LEGO League is especially about:

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.500
Innovation, Teamwork, Know-How

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
and a lot of fun in science and technology.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
For over 15 years the educational program FLL

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.300
is growing and ispiring children and youth.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.500
All began 1998 with 200 teams and now a days

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
more than 23.000 teams are participating.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.000
Competitions take place all over the world.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Whether in Argentina or in Yemen, Lebanon or

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.800
Thailand the FLL is international and

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.000
organized in over 70 countries.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.000
A FLL team consists of at least one coach and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
3 to 10 children and youth

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.600
at the age of 10 to 16 years.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.000
In teams a LEGO robot is designed, built and programmed.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's go!

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.400
Additionally a research project is done,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.200
which has a very important scientific and technical meaning.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.000
Every season there is a new FLL theme.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.900
The topic of the research is based on seasonal theme.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.700
Everything fine? Let's start the competition!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.000
On this important day every team is checked
by a specialized jury in the categories:

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.200
Teamwork, Robot Design and Research.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.000
Therefore the research results are presented in a 5-minute presentation.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Mostly rather unconventional with colorful
costumes as a theater or musical piece -

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.400
it's not only fun for you. Our jugdes should be entertained as well!

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.800
Speaking of fun: The popular Robot Game is played on a FLL Table.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.300
The playing field changes every year and 
is based on the seasonal FLL theme.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.200
The LEGO mission tasks 
are placed strategically on this mat.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.500
Now the self-built robot will be used.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.500
Every team has 2 minutes 30 to fulfill as many missions as possible.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.900
Each correct completed task will be scored.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.500
Beside the category 'robotics' points are 
also given for 'research' and 'team work'.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.000
This makes the evaluation and 
awarding of the FLL Champion possible.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.600
Through the FLL children and youth are introduced in a playful way in

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.300
science and technology. According to the principle 
'learing-by-doing' theoretical knowlegde is

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.100
combined with practical experience and
stored on this way in the long time memory.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.700
The project work leads to pratice soft skills like communicative

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.900
competence, self-confidence as well as team spirit and critical faculties.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.500
Those skills prepare all of our participants for there lifes.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.800
Beside everthing the FLL is a lot of fun and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.200
creates life-long friendships.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.100
Come and be part of the largest robotics movement!
