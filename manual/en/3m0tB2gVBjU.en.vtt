00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.200
I'm here today with the Marmot ROM Jacket.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.479
The name ROM stands for Range of Motion.

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:09.370
So with this jacket, you can see you've got
this dark blue material on the backs of the

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.740
arms, underneath the armpit area.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.820
What this does, is it gives you a good amount
of stretch, so as you move, any aerobic activity,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.000
climbing, really anything that you're doing
a lot of movement, you have all kinds of freedom

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.460
of movement without your jacket sleeves pulling
up or the bottom wanting to bunch up on you.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.170
It's definitely one of the things that you
may not notice that often, but once you wear

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.399
a jacket like this that moves with you, it
makes all the difference in the world for

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.269
your comfort throughout the day.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.999
We've got 3 pockets on the jacket â€“ one
here on the chest, a great place to tuck a

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:43.999
phone.

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.589
And then two pretty large pockets down here
at a normal level.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:54.050
These are mesh-lined, so they're not particularly
warm or anything, but they do cut wind because

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.769
the center portion of this jacket, this light
blue that you see is all GORE WINDSTOPPER.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.969
The hood on the ROM Jacket is really one of
its shining features.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.220
It's super-fitted so you've got this nice
profile here.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.300
You do have adjustment in the back to adjust
around the crown of your head.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.150
But it's not oversized for a helmet.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.160
It's a hood you can put up if it's really
windy.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.360
If you do need to shed a little bit of rain.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.860
It's going to be a water-repellant jacket,
not a rain shell, but should conditions turn

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.100
on you, you've got that hood there to use.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.890
Another nice feature is the hood toggles themselves
are secured here on the inside of the jacket,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.190
that way you don't have anything bouncing
around getting in the way.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.600
And when you're not using it, it just tucks
away.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.370
The inside of the ROM Jacket has this wicking
mesh lining.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.230
You do have one interior zippered pocket here.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.650
And also right down here in the bottom, you've
got some adjustment points where you can cinch

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.000
in the bottom of the jacket to keep any breezes
out.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.660
So that pretty much covers the ROM Jacket.
