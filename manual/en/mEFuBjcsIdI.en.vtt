Hi guys!

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:10.840
Janel Torkington of Appszoom here today with
a gambling game called Fun Show Hand - incredibly

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.019
popular in Asia, and it's pretty well made.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:21.010
I've just been playing around with it a little
this morning, so let me show you how it works.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.220
You've only got a couple options here, and
the most appealing is to just tap PLAY.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.230
Let's go for it.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.619
The design is kind of cool, it looks like
little paper cutouts kind of hanging against

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.460
a theatre backdrop.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.129
We'll start with just "newbie," that's me.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.170
And you play with real people here.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.829
Fun Show Hand looks like pretty standard Texas
Hold 'Em poker.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.280
You can choose how much you wanna buy in with.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.600
I'll play it safe and buy in pretty low this
round.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.010
The system looks for real people.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.450
And here are actual other users - I have to
wait for their first hand to be over for me

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.870
to be able to play.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.180
You can see it works just like your standard
game of Texas Hold 'Em.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.990
There's a dealer in the center and each player
gets two cards.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.770
Okay, I've got an eight here.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.610
Okay, an eight is good enough that I'm gonna
stay in for a bit, I'll call.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.470
A Queen, okay.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.360
And these other cards - are... hmm, okay,
nobody else has a great hand...

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.640
I'll check.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.110
The nice thing about playing poker on an online
game is that nobody can see you - you don't

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.480
have any tells.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.990
My cards are not so good.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.479
Neither are theirs!

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.479
We'll call.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.479
Folded!

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.479
Okay.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.479
Oh sweet!!

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.660
I have to flip one card.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.490
Okay, I've got a pair.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.390
We're gonna bet.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.649
Raise 50%.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:51.750
Bet!

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.940
Oh yeah.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.380
I got a pair - I won!!

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.380
Sweet!!

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.280
Okay, there's some interstitial ads here,
which is kind of interrupting.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280
Start the next round.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280
Hell yeah!

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.459
Alright, I'm already winning, guys.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.860
It's a gooood morning.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:18.630
I've got a six - what happens if I choose
"Show Hand"?

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.090
I guess it just plays it out like it is.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.560
One pair one pair - oh, I won again!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.670
That's some beginner's luck.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.670
Alright!

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.670
Sweet.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.080
Okay, I don't know that that's a strategy
you wanna take all the time, but that's pretty

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080
cool.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.160
What happens if I tap it?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.140
Oh, then I can -- ahh, you can see of course
what your other card is, but nobody else can.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.140
A five.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.760
We'll check, we'll stay in.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.390
I wanna see how this plays out.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.090
I kinda like poker, guys.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.970
Somebody else raised?

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.970
I'll call.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.970
That's alright.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.970
I'll stay in.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.880
A three.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.090
That's kind of crappy.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.819
I think I might get outta here.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:02.910
Let's fold.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.000
And then we can watch the rest play out.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.170
Well, cool.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.950
You just can keep playing this for as long
as you like, basically.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.250
And then there are some other game modes to
explore.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.300
So let's see if - okay, there's another ad
here.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.710
That happens sometimes when you end a round.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.040
Let's see if I can go back to the menu.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040
Yes.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.250
I want to go back to the menu.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.700
So you could obviously play through the whole
round.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.840
Tired of ads?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.930
Okay, so I can pay to get rid of ads.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.290
No, I don't want to do that.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.270
So you can also look up how to play, in case
you're not sure, and how to get coins and

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.140
gems - standard double in-game currency.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.180
The coins you can win in-game and the gems
I assume you can pay for.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.070
They do different things, give different upgrades.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.390
How to Play: just gives you the rules of poker
in case you're not sure.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.510
As you see, it functions pretty standard.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.510
Let's see what we can buy in the shop.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.220
Diamonds and coins themselves, items and frames.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.200
What are items?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.780
Double experience, commission free.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.780
Okay.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.470
What's that do?

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.180
Well, okay, I don't really want that.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.600
And Frames?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.759
Is it to make...?

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:18.759
Ohhh!

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.370
Okay, so I can frame my character like holidays.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.490
That's pretty cool, actually.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.030
I can put panties on my head.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.030
That's nice.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.020
What's upgrade?

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.460
Titles or coins.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.180
Let's see titles.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.910
I can upgrade my win bonus, if I had a lot
of coins.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.910
Ahh, I'm getting there.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.370
You know, I did pretty good at that beginning
part.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.490
Quests!

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.690
So I guess these quests change daily?

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.690
I see.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.040
So, if you lose a lot or you win a lot or
you play a whole lot then you can get bonuses.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.190
What's Friends?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.020
Oh, okay, I can invite my friends and then
I'll get gems, which I can then spend on those

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.730
cool little frames, or on some other things.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.430
And I've got a little code to invite there,
makes sense.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.790
Rankings, so I can see where I am in relation
to the rest of the world.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.560
Looks like this game is popular in China.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.490
I'm not quite there yet.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.139
Dang, these people are seriously good at this
game.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.090
I'm gonna have to play for a while in order
to beat them.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.310
And the Chest maybe is a daily bonus?

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.310
Ready!

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.550
Yes, I want it.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.050
Well check it out, I get free coins.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.639
Do I like this game?

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.480
Yeah, I do like this game.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.520
Oh, it wants me to rate it.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.520
Well.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.419
I'm currently doing the video review so I'm
not gonna rate it right now, but you can,

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.030
if you enjoy this game.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.510
And then if I tap on More Games?

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.669
I see.

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.060
There's some different bonuses that I can
get.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.180
Okay, Fun Show Hand is a really solid poker
app.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.449
It's pretty fun.

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.280
It's got a bunch of mechanisms in it to encourage
you to want to play a whole lot more.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.360
The dual in-app currency of the coins and
the gems is a tried and proven method.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.220
I like that you play with real people.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.870
Let's make the buy-in a lot higher.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.870
Sweet!

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.870
Here we go.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.870
Crank it up!

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.120
I'm ready to gamble this morning.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.510
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.720
It works really smoothly.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.070
The graphics are great.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.230
If you're into gambling apps, if you like
playing poker, this is a really good bet (ha,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.389
did you get that one?).

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:34.389
It works super well.

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:35.590
Oh, I have a pair.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.590
We're definitely raising.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.790
Raise the roof here.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.230
Raise it!

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.450
Oh, players are out huh?

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.210
Oh hey, one of those guys I can see his face.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.490
Like I said, it's really solid.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.190
I can highly recommend this app if you're
into poker apps.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.680
Oh my god, I have three of a kind.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.440
We are raising the roof here, people.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.440
Bam!

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.440
Show hand!

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.440
Alright!

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.610
Oh, this is all mine.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.650
Yes!

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.770
I'm a brilliant poker player.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.560
No, I don't want the ad.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.810
Fun Show Hand is totally, totally recommended
for fans of this kind of genre.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.970
Look, I upgraded!

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.240
No, I don't wanna watch a video.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.840
It's a little bit interfering, like all the
different ads and things, but I understand,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.020
the devs have to make money somehow.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.630
It's just a really well done app.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.950
Pretty legitimately fun to play.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.060
So recommended.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.690

you like it.
