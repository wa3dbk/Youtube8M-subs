00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.180
with our branch technique results, you can
see we get a lot of color, all over the head,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.670
without having a hard line of demarcation.
This is one of my favorite techniques to use,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.400
on clients that are looking for the most amount
of color, with the least amount of effort,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.949
for the most part,and it's great because those
clients that have longer type hair, typically,

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:31.489
whether they go to the gym, or running around
the house, or running around doing errands,

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.109
and they like to wear their hair up, and pull
it back into a ponytail. You notice that we

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:42.859
don't get that heavy line or streaks in the
hair, that kind of run back. We actually get

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:50.950
a nice color, that flows throughout the hair,
while still keeping some contrast, and some

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.929
highlights going on there, as well, but we
just don't see those lines, that we typically

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.319
see, when we are using more of a horizontal
foil pattern, on the sides of the head. We

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:07.759
also don't get the problem of having to see
where the foils are, when they're placed in

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.570
the head, because as the hair is pulled back,
you can't see a definite area of where that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.659
hair was foiled, and so therefore, the clients
that don't like to see, I wouldn't say the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.420
rootage area, but definitely don't want to
see where their foils were placed, and which

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.340
you typically do with the horizontal foil
placement on top,and the horizontal foil placement

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.759
on the sides. With this, it breaks all of
that up, so they kind of crisscross over each

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.630
other, the foils do, and we don't get that
type of line, or that time of effect in the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.109
hair, by using the branch technique. This
will take the most amount of foils, usually,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.590
probably around twenty. It could be up to
twenty five, depending on the amount of hair

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.359
somebody has, and the type of sections that
you take, but this is a great technique to

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.010
use, for those clients that are looking for
the most amount of color, with the least amount

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.050
of effort, and it basically gives us a good
amount of color, over the top, through the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.000
sides, the back, and the front as well.
