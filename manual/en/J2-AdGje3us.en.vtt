00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.580
Hi. I'm Jen from Clay Cafe and on behalf of
Expert Village I'll be showing you how to

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.770
take your ceramic piece from start to finish.
In this stage I'll be explaining at what stage

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.840
your piece is ready to be painted at. Some
hobbyists prefer to paint directly on o the

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.039
green ware. Which is a piece that hasn't been
fired yet. Most people prefer to paint on

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.140
bisque ware which is the already fired piece.
It's much more durable and has a very, very

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.579
porous surface. So it accepts the glaze very,
very well. When selecting glazes for either

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.610
piece it's very important to make sure that
the glaze you're choosing is compatible with

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.490
the clay body. An easy way to find this out
is to ask your manufacturer. Most manufacturers

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.670
that supply bisque will also sell glazes that
are compatible. Another easy way to find that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.810
out is to simply read your glaze bottle. It'll
generally read something along the lines of,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.890
paint one to 3 coats to a shelf cone zero
for bisque. Fire to a cone zero six. All this

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.960
really means is your bisque fire is normally
done at a cone 04 and your glaze fire, which

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.280
is a different temperature, is fired to a
cone 06. Most popular studios will only fire

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.680
their pieces to a cone 06. Here at the kiln
we're going to talk about the different cones.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.500
I mentioned earlier that bisque fire, when
pieces go from green ware to bisque, it's

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.170
fired at a 04. 04 is a temperature that gets
up to about 2008 degrees Fahrenheit. Cone

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.860
06 which is generally a glaze fire, goes up
to a temperature, or peak at about a temperature

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.240
of 1873 degrees Fahrenheit. We use witness
cones like these ones, to make sure that we

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.369
fire the pieces at correct temperatures. And
they'll melt according to the proper temperatures

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.890
and let us know if we have any hot or cool
spots within our kiln.
