00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.040
Hi I'm Casey on behalf of Expert Village and
in this segment I'm going to show you how

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.060
to cut the sides. In the last segment I showed
you how to cut the back section of our haircut.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.519
So now we are going to move in to the sides.
At this point I'm going to hold my razor a

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.640
little bit different what I'm going to do
I'm going to pinch the hair, I'm going to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.380
slightly kind of comb through it. Using light
pressure and what this is going to do this

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:35.220
is going to help keep pieces out. I'm just
going to comb through and just cut my length

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:46.800
wherever I need it to be so there is that
part. Then what I'm going to do the same as

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.829
I did in the back I'm going to pull hair out,
I'm going to cut behind my fingers and I'm

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.239
going to take off the same amount that I did
for the back section. I'm just going to carry

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.890
this forward right to the side. I'm going
to work my way up from the bottom up to the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:21.900
top. I'm going to go ahead and comb the hair,
I'm going to move it around make sure that

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:32.490
I don't see any weak spots. Right back here
is a trouble section so what you need to do

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.420
is you need to comb hair, comb it towards
there face and then cut it. Then what that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.520
would do that would just take that weight
out of that back section of the haircut. The

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.840
other thing you want to do when you are cutting
the sides is you want to make sure that your

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.240
client is not to poofy right in here if they
are just go ahead and take a little bit more

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.659
weight out of there. Again by coming right
behind the hand using tension and pull down

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:17.529
with the razor. I'm going to come back and
I'm going to get a little bit more right here

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:21.400
cause when I look at him he looks like he
got a little bit to much right there. So all

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:32.829
I'm going to do is flip that section up, use
tension, cut behind it, comb it, and then

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.950
that side is done. Stay tune for the next
segment.
