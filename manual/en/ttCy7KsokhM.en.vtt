JEANNETTE WHITE: I'm Jeannette White for Expert
Village and Piper's Quilts &amp; Comforts, and

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.090
today, we're doing a mitered corner. In our
last segment, we did the first step in this

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.930
which was joining this down, making a fold
out to the right, and we are looking for two

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.270
things. I'm looking for a straight line that
goes across here that is uninterrupted, and

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.610
I'm looking for an L shape right here. Once
I have those two things, I am going to fold

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:40.750
my binding back so that this folded edge right
here lines up with the raw edge right here.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:50.060
And these three raw edges, one, two, three
are all together. Once I have that, I am going

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.860
to insert one more pin right here. I'm going
to make sure that these two folds right here

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.940
are lined up. I'm going to fold this down,
and this folded edge is now lining up with

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.330
this raw edge here. I'm going to take an awl,
and I'm going to feel right here. And by the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:20.040
way, this is a very necessary tool. I'm going
to stitch down until I can feel that fold

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.500
right underneath there, and then I'm going
to hit reverse on my machine and do just one

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.740
or two reverse stitches. And then, I'm going
to bring my needle to the highest position

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.400
so that my thread will move and I'm going
to pull out my quilt top just enough that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.560
I can flip this dog ear back, make my turn
and I'm going to sew right off the edge this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.890
time. Now, we're going to pause for just a
moment and you can see that we have made a

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.340
nice mitered corner. In our next segment,
we will be trimming this off and flipping

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.159
it to the back and finishing it off.
