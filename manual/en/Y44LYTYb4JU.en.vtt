00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.700
Many families and students know they need
to attend college, but simply aren't sure

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.539
they can afford it. So it's really sort of
a value proposition question, "Should I take

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.759
out student loans? Should I go into debt?
How am I going to afford to pay for college?"

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.089
So we really sort of sat down and said, "How
can we be a solution? How can College of St.

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:36.790
Joseph given it's history, given it's goal
as being an accessible, affordable institution,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.210
how can we address that larger question?" We
found that we could do that by providing a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.079
very aggressive scholarship and in return
for that scholarship students would provide

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.460
service both to the community and the campus.
So students who are in the program who come

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.199
to campus have to do several things. One,
they have to be intellectually curious. We

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.340
want to have good students in the classroom
and interested students in terms of the intellectual

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.989
life of this community. Secondly, we're asking
them to participate in a campus activity of

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.910
their choosing. Whether that's a student club,
whether it's a sports organization on campus,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.069
or an academic honorary society, we're asking
students to be involved. And when students

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:18.670
are involved on campus it just creates a far
more robust life that we can all participate

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.009
in as well. So I enjoy attending student events
and student activities. And here we're sort

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.679
of saying to students, you know what would
you like to do, what would you like to be

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.300
on this campus and see on this campus and
let's get after it. We're also asking the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.069
students to participate in community engagement
and service hours. So they have to select

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.289
an agency in the community and/or come up
some ideas in terms of how do we better the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.610
community at large and how can they be a part
of that. And build those relational skills

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.899
with the larger community. So they have to
do 15 hours of community engagement work each

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.849
semester. A total of 30 during the year. And
then finally we're asking them right from

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.259
the start to be involved in career workshop.
So they're not waiting until Junior or Senior

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.170
year to sort of say,"What do I do next?" But
they start to imagine that future right from

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.229
the start when they enter. So that's really
the educational component of the program.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.099
Any other themes that we've had from the story
so far? Or something you keep noticing? What

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.360
makes our scholarship unique is that it has
a declining cost structure throughout the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.790
four years that the student is here on campus.
Unlike other scholarships where they get a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.849
one time scholarship, this one stays with
them throughout the four years and their cost

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.510
goes down. Usually, if you look nationally
at scholarship programs at other colleges

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.890
and universities, it is often a set amount
that you get in the first year. And sometimes

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.019
that scholarship can decrease depending on
funding of each college and university. In

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.849
our case it is a guarantee that you will receive
an increase each year as long as you are successfully

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.319
meeting the requirements. Statistically we
know that most students coming out, if they're

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.459
going to enter work place in the next decade
or more and even now, are going to need some

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.319
level of post secondary credentialing. Whether
that's a two-year, certificate, or a four-year program.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.650
So part of the Provider was intended to do that.
It's really an incentive-based model for students

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.469
to be able to control cost to make a private
education affordable. Alongside that we wanted

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.829
to make sure we had a robust educational program
that went along with it. So we really looked

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.180
at best practices in education in terms of
campus commitment, community engagement, academic

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.569
coursework, and career preparedness. And put
all those together in a unique program that

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.510
students participate in along the four years.
And as they do that program successfully their

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.599
scholarship increases. So we really tried
to put both halves together in a very unique

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.849
model. I personally believe so wholeheartedly
in this program. And I'm so jealous of these

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.349
students because it's a program that if it
had been around when I was a college student

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.519
I easily would have applied for. I mean, no
questions asked, you know.  I mean like, sign me up, you

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.139
know. For the student it's incredible. I mean,
they are making a difference in somebody's

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.969
life. I mean, it's as simple as that. This
program allows them the opportunity to go

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.379
out there, make a difference in the community,
and change the world. It's an excellent opportunity

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.290
for the student to realize that they have
more of a commitment to the community at large

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.879
than just to themselves. That they have to
be involved in the total process of education.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.139
Which means getting out into the community
and recognizing how they can bring some of

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.600
their talents and skills to meet the needs
certain elements within the community itself.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.850
Oftentimes when students go to college and
declare a major and progress through that

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.850
major, sometimes they leave out getting ready
to graduate and what they're actually going

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.220
to do with that major out in the real world.
With the Provider Scholarship model they're

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.310
receiving regular career preparedness through
all four years. And so they're going to be

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.710
better positioned to get their job once they
graduate. And that'll have fantastic long

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.640
term benefits for the student. The career
preparedness program is made up of four major

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.890
components. The first one is called, Focus
where the student is allowed to interact with

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.770
the program. Where it has certain assessments
measuring their work interests, their skills,

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.920
etcetera. It gives them some idea as to what
type of career they should be looking at.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.480
And it also provides them with the opportunity
to choose what major would be best to take

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.190
to accomplish getting that career. The other
components are made up of resume construction, letter

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.230
writing, letters of introduction, etcetera.
And finally interviewing skills. I think

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.950
the long term benefits are that we are going
to be graduating students from the college

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.860
that don't just walk away with a degree, they're
walking away with experience, with new friendships,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.830
and new relationships within the community
and the surrounding areas. From the college's

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.020
standpoint we're providing better access to
higher education. A lot of families are finding

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.550
it hard to afford higher education for their
children and this is a way in which some of

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:01.350
those families can have their students attend
college and not graduate with a lot of indebtedness.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.540
I think the program allows students the opportunity
to interact with one another on a level that

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.010
may never have happened before. It's so, I
think, beautiful to me to see students who

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.370
may not have a class together; may not share
the same friend group; don't travel in the

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.000
same circles, and so would maybe never, you
know, engage with one another, come together

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.010
for a collective reason. And I think the Provider
Program offers that. The entire campus is

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.700
a learning community. It's not that I go to
class and then I go back to a dorm. Or I go

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.960
to class and then I go to work. But to see
sort of a connection between all of that.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.700
That really I'm in this space and in this
environment to learn at every level and that

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.330
every component fits together that way. And
so I really think that those are some key

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.080
elements to it. I think for the students as
well what they're going to see is that, you

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.260
know beyond going to class and doing well;
succeeding academically, they start to see

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.310
themselves in a different way as well. They
see that it's important to give back to others

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.880
just as they have been provided for. They
in turn are providing for others that have

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.660
needs in our community. But they also begin
to see themselves as professionals in that

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.070
way too. That they can design programs on
campus that they can take a leadership role.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.590
And they can start to sort of imagine what
their future looks like as they go through

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.040
career workshop. And put all those things
together and have time to reflect on it, to

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.350
discern what all that means. And to give things
a try. They won't be just doing the same community

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.770
engagement piece each year. They can alternate
and see what else might fit. So I really think

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.220
it sort of gives a path for students to see
themselves after they graduate from the school.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.230
And what we also hope of course is that will
distinguish our alumni. And they'll reflect

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.000
back on that and want to continue to support
the institution that supported them.
