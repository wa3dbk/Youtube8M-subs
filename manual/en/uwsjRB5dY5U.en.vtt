00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.929
a fifty six-year-old student at oakland
university in detroit at his name is

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.070
joseph portlet and he had is in a little
bit of trouble after he decided to write

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.979
a journal about how hard he is for his
teacher

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.559
s

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.900
but but but

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.440
all right so apparently pat if you wrote
this article about one of his

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.830
instructors by the name of pamela mitts

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.340
knits fields missile field

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.859
i mean he basically talking about how
sexy she is and how she's like

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.259
the ginger from the television series
gilligan's island

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.460
and another professors like the
character of maryam

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.000
and he talks about uh... you know
basically how much he wants them

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.290
and uh... it instructors rehnquist's and
gotten very uncomfortable so i'd be

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.910
asking to please stop

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.990
and uh... see apparently

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.320
didn't want still a key continued to
write these journal articles

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.940
and uh... as a result of one of the
instructor said look if he doesn't leave

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.920
then i'm gonna leave and now i'm this
association known as fire organization

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.890
uninspired seca pro-gun organization is
defending hand uh... because apparently

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.180
the t_v_ instructor said she's worried
because he is like a gun pro-gun

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.820
advocates she's worried that he has a
weapon you could hurt

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.390
yet the first when i first looked over
just in the space with the headline that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.530
the description

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.100
and get the the whole point is like a
college student he likes his teacher but

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.480
the more you read the details the
creeper gets first phase fifty-six

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.910
yemenese older than the professor that
makes it a bit creepy health explains

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.460
why he references gilligan's island

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.040
when looking for a hot chick to compare
her to uh... i don't think most of our

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.780
look up since we do that but

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.420
plus the fact that he wouldn't stop
after they ask them to repeatedly note

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.200
the gun it gets a bit creepy or

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.730
yet he's a sympathy feasted i don't even
know why fire would want to

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.380
defend him like that sexual harassment
you can sexually harassing teachers by

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.200
talk about how much you want to bomb
them

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.300
you know that's not acceptable you see
them saying like

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.070
ya especially after one of the
instructors asked him to stop leak

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.310
please stop it's making me uncomfortable
he continued to do after that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.540
that's not a pic

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.359
so

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.009
so i totally agree that he's wrong yet
ideas in from the point of view of these

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.340
free speech advocacy groups with
minister louis one base general uh... i

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.950
think that they're not really in the
business of picking and choosing

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.820
in his speech today and it's just that
their fingers to defend free speech and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.070
you know right now i i don't agree with
that well i think that the wrong in the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.030
states yap and that might be one of the
car i don't think that free speech

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.259
advocacy groups defend of speech if it's

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.829
speech that has sexual harassment they
don't you know it i don't see the

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.499
a_c_l_u_ defending this guy

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.049
abundant but they still have a busy lead
up the lead

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.989
takes people from all sides of the
footnote eleven of the deal with this in

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.429
a different case like the past month i
can write you letters about how sexy you

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.159
are and how much i wanna sleep with new
if

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.549
like your uncomfortable with dot that's
considered sexual harassment

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.709
so the same thing applies me ready
university but you

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.909
so i agree totally creepy

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.290
there for a year ago

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.149
for a long time

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.569
don't write creepy letters like that
instructors and let me let me know when

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.169
is the type that animal rights
