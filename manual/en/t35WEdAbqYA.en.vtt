Hi, I'm Chris Faircloth, Artistic Director
and co-owner of Salon Teez. For Expert Village,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:20.480
this is how to trim women's hair. One of the
easiest ways to create

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.230
texture in the hair is by point cutting using
a regular pair of shears. By doing this, we'll

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.050
actually use a vertical type of section because
a vertical section creates elongation. We

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.890
don't necessarily want to create any more
weight in the hair, we just want to create

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.469
simple easy, very very soft layers. So we'll
use a vertical type of section, holding the

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.960
section out and then fanning the hair out
with our fingers by rounding them out. Now

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.739
I'll use my shears to come in and point cut.
Be careful not too close on the way into the

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.120
fingers as you may cut your finger. What we
want to do is actually place the shears in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:16.229
and then cut as we're coming out.
So we'll fan the hair out, again, I'm cutting

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:28.950
on my way out
and just working around the hair that I've

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.229
pulled out. That creates a nice, soft, but
you can see the layers that I've created in

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.399
the hair. By doing that and fanning it out,
it actually creates a nice soft effect, rather

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.119
than a hard effect that we'll get when we
cut layers into the hair that look more like

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.390
steps. This is very soft and just tends to
blend in to the hair so as not to really see

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.979
the layers but once we push the hair up, we'll
be able to see more of them as they lay softer

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:51.650
and it tends to melt into the hair. We will
maintain the length of the hair but now we've

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.319
just added some nice very very soft layering
to the hair that gives the hair an extra bit

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.849
of movement.
