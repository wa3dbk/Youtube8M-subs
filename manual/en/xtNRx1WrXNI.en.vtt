00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.420
This is the incredible master bathroom.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.840
This is a retreat back here.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.359
This bathroom just says it's warm, friendly,
inviting, never leave.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.080
It's all done with Carrara marble.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.580
There are all different sizes and shapes of
marble in this bathroom.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.520
We have them set elongated vertical style,
soldier cuts on the back of the shower, we

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.420
have the same inside the shower going around
a round shower.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.270
We've got a Versailles pattern on the floor
which is a straight edge.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.039
We've got Carrara countertops and we have
this unbelievable basket weave backsplash

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.550
that goes right underneath the glass.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.899
This is Carrara so it has a little gray in
it, a little blue in it, but it's also mixed

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.090
with a cabinet section that has a little bit
of an Art Deco look.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.390
So inside the cabinet fronts, we have put
a silver antiqued glass.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.670
So it has a little touch of Art Deco.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.799
It has a little touch of sophistication, yet
it's still real warm and inviting.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.110
This room has such an open spacious feel because
of the paint on the wall and the ceiling,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.110
they're two different colors.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.939
They're just a shade off, you can barely tell.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.280
And then it's flanked by these incredible
dark stained beams which are asymmetrical

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.660
over the tub, so it has a little twist to
it.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.390
It's not totally classic, it has a little
bit of Art Deco in this room.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.549
Another spacious feeling about this is the
fact that we've taken mirrors all the way

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.079
to the ceiling, and we've pulled the lights
out of the mirrors, and that gives the ceiling

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.840
a complete two-dimensional look.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.680
It looks like the ceiling is twice as big
than it actually is.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.880
And it makes the space just open up incredibly,
and it gives a warmth to this space.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.630
Then in addition to that, we took this flooring
and went straight into the closet, and that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.909
again opens up the space.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.780
When you take your flooring from your bathroom
into your closet, it makes your bathroom look

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.140
twice as big.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.090
And so we've done that and it's an incredibly
spacious closet.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.879
We have places for absolutely everything.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.380
It was a very well planned closet, you can
put your shoes in a certain place, you have

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.390
hanging clothes that go in another space,
and it's all adjustable.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.319
So for any customer it's absolutely perfect.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.260
This is the type of bathroom that you would
want to spend an evening in, soaking in the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.930
tub, and just enjoying the cleanliness and
the beauty of the space.
