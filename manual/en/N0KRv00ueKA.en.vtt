00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.240
we got um... piece of you are male
actually from a ray of light he says

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.979
hello to you mighty i've been subscribed
to put a while and very curious to the

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.900
education in america i would like to
know if it's as bad as you keep saying

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.209
on the show i think you know moving such
studying there so if possible as much

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.400
personal info about america in general
and i guess as we can provide bubble

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.880
here uploads kelly for more thing for
your time sincerely bread as most plate

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.060
message i think we've ever gotten
discussing so you want to know as an

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.509
outsider he's heard as saying some bad
things about american university system

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.239
server campuses um... do you personally
think that it's worth and outsider any

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.790
hubris it is a super entries from should
they come here sunday

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.010
uh... and larry

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.610
traitorous back and let us know where
you're coming from i think that'll

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.720
probably make a huge difference as to
whether or not you're gonna have the

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.050
benefit you're coming from a country
lake

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.910
and somewhere in latin america having no
that a lot of people in latin america

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.030
cannot afford college uh...

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.410
that being said if you can afford
college in latin america he likely

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.490
cannot afford in the united states
either

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.710
and if you're coming from somewhere

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.890
like spain are somewhere where your
university is already

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.500
innermost they're completely funded

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.630
then you're gonna have deftly face a lot
higher costs in the united states uh...

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.020
threatens a given not knowing what
countries from but i do think

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.540
we holds up

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.860
i'm not playing a lot about that night
adn i do think that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.500
you know just i'd know that we kind of
talk about a smack about colleges the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
last thing we did something about naha
for-profit colleges and we can and get

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.310
in to help a lot of this can be great
but

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.560
overall i do you think

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.440
the value of an american education is
very high you eventually likely we talk

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.920
about the less than five percent in
played a great if you have it adi greedy

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.439
and i think that that that's and speaks
for itself

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.350
i would say uh... first off if uh... you
were being brought in this country to go

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.610
to a for-profit colleges don't do it and
secondly if you're doing one of these

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.030
programs where you're coming for the
university case she also working on the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.300
side like them

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.700
uh... hershey factory gotten some
trouble for that because a lot of them

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.700
were were outside student workers they
always end up being a horrible stands

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.990
don't do that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.349
again we don't know what country are
coming from but

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.089
in general i would say it comes out of
money if you can afford it right

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.299
i think we're number one probably not

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.879
but indicate if you come to a an
american university and you will find

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.019
yourself amending it is the medications
can anywhere else in the world and

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.219
bible have to say in general i think
that

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.959
in terms of the culture the experience
all have

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.599
i think a lot of are really fun but
people have fun at colleges uh... around

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.040
the world but i know here

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.630
uh... we have been training for sure

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.430
on display with the germs by several
beer uh... so for those reasons i would

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.760
consider coming here beginning comes out
of money like whether user can afford it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.310
he can honestly regardless of where you
come from a can imagine a lot of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.069
countries where it's

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.289
more expensive

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.539
to go to university so that's what i
would consider when when thinking about

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.859
whether
