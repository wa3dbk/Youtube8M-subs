00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.690
We associate good hearing with having big ears -

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.470
this outside bit here, because a really big ear helps you collect the

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.580
sound. But this is a tawney owl, and the
tawney owl has also got really good hearing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.470
but it hasn't got any big ears, except that it has, it's just that they're harder to see.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.980
If you look at this shape here, there's a rigid

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.110
set of feathers going around that
heart-shaped

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.279
bit on the owl's face, and inside here these
feathers are all really soft.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.140
So these are the owl's ears; they're two big sort of cups,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.660
but instead being on the outside of it's head they're back around its eyes

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.130
and when sound comes towards the owl, it's these big ears that are

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.220
made of feathers will direct the sound
down.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.500
I think about the physical environment
that these animals

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.110
are living in, so imagine this owl on a dark night,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.910
and there's no light so it can't see very well,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.009
but all around it there is sound - there are sound waves traveling past it; there might be some

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.859
sound waves from a local road,

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.389
might be some sound waves from scuttling beetles,

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:14.479
and there might be some sound waves that
come from something like a vole, a little

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.700
mammal that's scooting around in the grass.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.709
And a little mammal doesn't push very
much on the air as it moves,

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.759
so it doesn't make very much sound,

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.679
but in owl's environment those little sounds will be drifting past it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.170
from lots of different directions, so imagine this owl

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.549
with these sound waves coming at it from
different directions,

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.399
and somehow it's got to find dinner, and so it uses these parabolic reflectors

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.520
to direct that sound into its inner ear.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.499
If the vole's over here, the sound
comes towards the owl, and only if the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.799
owl's looking right at the source the
sound,

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.869
will these ears hear the sound really
loudly, and that's how the owl can

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.249
localise the sound - it doesn't listen

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:02.380
equally in all directions like reading,
it listens in a very specific direction

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.380
and that's how it finds its dinner.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.080
This is the tawney owl's

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.730
skull - it's the same bird. There's a lot of feathers on an owl - that's what I discovered the first time

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.489
I held an owl,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.010
is that you can put your finger into these feathers quite a long way before you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.100
hit the skull, there's a lot of feathers around here.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.280
So this is the owl's skulls, this is what's inside, and you can see something else

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.650
here about the way it senses the world, which is these

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.010
eye sockets here - they're enormous, they're so big

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.010
that they almost touch. There's only the thinnest

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.350
bit of bone in between the two, and
that's to help

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.060
give the owl really good night time
vision - the bigger its eye is, the more light it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.170
can collect, so if it's really dim - 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.959
there's only the tinniest bit of light around, it's got these big eyes

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.769
that will help it collect that light, but they're as big as they can physically be

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.739
inside this skull. Just look at that -  if they
were any bigger they'd be touching in

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.180
the middle.
