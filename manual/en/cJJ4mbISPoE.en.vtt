00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.580
Why has this World Cup been so pivotal for
the US and soccer going forward?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.520
Yeah there's no doubt this World Cup
is really the first time

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.870
I have seen, or we've seen, here in the
US just

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.340
you know so much support and I think the
main reason is that first off

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.800
we have a team that actually is finally
decent that has the opportunity to

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.269
potentially be a winner

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.650
and I think really what has
happened over the last several years is

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.029
that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.949
here in the US we finally can watch the
best soccer in the world

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.800
On the weekend we can turn on the Premier League we can watch the best players in the world

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.360
and that is what has captivated the kids,
the fans, and has put

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.510
really this interest behind soccer so

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.649
you know definitely when they say it's
soccer there is no doubt its on the uptake

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:51.860
here in the US

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.050
The current team is also littered with players who say they got hooked on

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.260
the games back in 1994 and 2002 so

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.059
as we push forward now over the years do you
think some of the strength you're seeing  in the team

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.050
is gonna continue

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.650
and actually gain further support? 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.890
Yeah, no doubt - look at the

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.140
the guy that scored the last goal, Julian
Green, nineteen years old and really

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.150
is supposed to be the next great

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.420
US soccer player if I can even say next
great US soccer player

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.700
may be the first great US soccer player
but in any case there's no doubt

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.140
little kids nowadays and over the past
several years

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.729
10-15 years have been watching soccer
and understanding

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.079
one day they can play in the World Cup
and what that means is

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.600
they're choosing to play soccer over
sports here like American Football

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.170
and basketball and baseball and when you
have that you're starting to get the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.420
better players

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.720
or the better athletes to play soccer
and that's going to increase the chances

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.120
of the US team having good players

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.420
You mention the crucial point here

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.960
If I look at how much TV rights, how
advertising money, is to be made

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.560
in the likes of baseball, basketball,
American football, in the US

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.719
it feels to me that soccer still gonna
have a real hard time getting funding

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.710
and the kinda support going forward? How's it going to win that air time battle

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.459
in the US

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.120
that's a great question but if you look
it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.970
what this World Cup has meant and what's
happened in terms of the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.120
following, I mean you know, even you're showing President Obama, it's kinda

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.940
funny situation

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.629
funny slide there, with him
cheering on everyone

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.340
Who could have ever imagined this? It's
really gaining this popularity

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.830
1.4 million people I think streamed the US
game versus Germany

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.060
there was a crash I mean you're
definitely starting to see

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.239
a lot of that popularity over social
media and that's going to win the

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.860
advertisers dollars at the end of the
day a lot of money is now being poured

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.610
into the social aspect of it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.170
and I've never seen an event like this
captivate the entire country

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.720
the only other event could be the Super
Bowl so at the end of the day

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.909
advertisers are definitely gonna start
pouring money

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.150
into soccer but again the one big issue
is that

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.080
when the World Cup isn't going on you
have the Premier League and you have Major

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.010
League Soccer and Major League Soccer

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.069
isn't the best players in the world so
where's that money going to go is it

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.650
gonna go overseas to europe

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.750
is it gonna go into MLS that's going to
be the big question for advertisers

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.739
but they're gonna wanna get behind
soccer
