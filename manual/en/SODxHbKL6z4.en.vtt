00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.610
Hi this is Megan with beadaholique.com
today I'm going to show you how to use

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.210
the Beadalon flat memory wire findings

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.360
the prong cup settings for the flat memory wire

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.400
This is what I used to make this bracelet

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.800
and I just did the entire bracelet

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.220
with the little flat memory wire prong settings

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.930
this is using the Crystal Lilac Shadow
SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS Chatons 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.899
You can see it's really pretty

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.949
and it's a really great easy way

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.230
to make a quick bracelet. It has a lot of
impact

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.690
You don't have to fill up the entire wire with them. You can

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.350
mix match and do whatever you want. I just like the way it looks,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.660
all of them on like that. So this is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.800
another pack of the settings. You can
use any kind of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.370
stone that will fit in that you want to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.150
I'm using Swarovski Chatons and it is
important to know

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.240
that the 1088 style works with these. The 1028 does not.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.520
So the older style is a little bit
deeper and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.250
it's too deep for the memory wire to fit through. You wanna make you're using the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.170
1088s

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.040
yes wanna make sure that your using the flat
memory wire

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.930
not the regular round memory wire, the flat memory wire

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.490
flatness is what makes sure that these all stay on the outside and don't roll

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.070
around

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.789
the Chatons that fits in here is ss29

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.250
otherwise you want about a 6 millimeter
piece

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.659
to fit into these. So the first thing that
you wanna do

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.380
is put the stones in the settings

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.100
you wanna just let it drop into place

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.859
I use the side of a pair of chain nose pliers

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.259
Hold it in. I just

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.869
push it down and then I go diagonally

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.990
to the next corner, push, do the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.070
other corners. Once I have it in place

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.980
then I go in and make sure that it's

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.290
all the way down on all four sides

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.550
that's how easy it is to set them

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.550
I'm just gonna do a couple

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.650
you do wanna make sure that you keep
your piece

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.459
nice and even in there if gets moved

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.459
out of place. You wanna stop and put it
back or else it won't sit nicely

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.310
go ahead and do as many as you want of course you want to decide

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.319
how many times around you want it to go.
This one here is just

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.540
two loops, two times all the way around. You
can do a single time

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.990
you can fill up the whole thing. So decide
how much

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.930
around you want. Be sure that you use memory wire cutters

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.370
when you cut your loops. I'm just showing
you right now the basics of how you put

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.450
them on there

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.610
I'm not gonna go into that right now

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.640
Once you got all your stones set

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.090
It takes a little bit of wiggling sometimes

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.200
otherwise they slip

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.860
right on, it's just a matter of

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.530
finding the hole at

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.180
the other end and like I said

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.690
the older style of chaton is

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.590
a little bit too deep, the point on the back goes too far down and it actually keeps

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.160
the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.750
memory wire from fitting through. Be sure you're using the 1088

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.930
if you're using a chaton

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.530
as you can see you can just

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.710
put 'em throughout, you can put other
items on

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.600
your memory wire or you can do a solid
stack of them

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.580
like I did here and they're a really fun

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.760
new way to use Memory Wire.
