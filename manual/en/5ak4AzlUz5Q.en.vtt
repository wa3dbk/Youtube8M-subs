00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Sometimes your bike just needs a really
thorough clean,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.410
particularly if you've got a big event
coming up like a sportif or a race.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.389
First of all run a bucket of hot soapy
water. I always washing up liquid because

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.710
there's always some in my house.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.490
If you've been more organized you can
use a specific bike or a car soap. I've

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.840
never had a problem with that though

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.890
so it's up to you.  It is important that it's hot though,
it gets the grease and oil

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.180
much much better. Before your bike gets wet though, first of all, decant some

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.070
degreaser into an old pot. Half an old  water bottle
works particularly well

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.420
pro mechanics tip, amazing

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.690
Now with old brush I just paint the
degreaser liberally onto the chain.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.620
Some people swear they need to take the
chain off to clean it thoroughly

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.460
I don't agree with that and more than
that i'm quite superstitious about how

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.329
many times a break it and then rejoin it
even the power link, so i try to avoid it

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.329
and just paint, paint it on.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.590
After that chain is thoroughly coated in
degreaser take a flat head screwdriver

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:15.710
and just run around the jockey wheels
just to scrape all that gunk off, and then

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.240
sparingly

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.490
I get a bit more degreaser on here too -
then finally on the chain rings as well

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.890
Now while that decreaser is actually working

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.320
it's time to actually clean the rest of
the bike using an old car sponge

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.050
I start the front of the bike and then
work backwards and downwards getting

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050
loads of soapy water on it.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.729
When you get to the area of the
drivetrain I swap my clean car sponge for a

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:15.380
greasy old one, I find having the chain on the
big ring is much much easier to clean

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.300
the outside of the chain

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.680
But to get onto the inside, you need to get your
sponge involved elsewhere

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.420
Now this has come up pretty clean

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.880
if it needs a bit more going over just
apply some more degreaser and again just

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.700
leave it to sit. Now when I come back
to again I'll use my clean sponge and it

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.700
should come up pretty spotless.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.680
Now it's time to move on to the
derailleur and the chainrings. This

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.700
little brush was an excellent buy as it gets right in there.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.620
 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.540
Make sure that when you've cleaned it
satisfactorily, that you get the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.190
degreaser off really thoroughly. Any
degreaser left on there is going to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.850
basically ruin any lubricant that you
put on afterwards so make sure it's

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.850
thoroughly thoroughly rinsed off.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.320
Now I'm going to turn my attention to
the wheels

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.230
drop the front one out and then start by
cleaning the frame and the front forks

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.180
that you can get to us the wheel was in. Pay
particular attention as well to the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.500
brake calipers

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.410
Now I turn my attention to the front wheel
I make sure, I'm a through cleaner,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.590
so I am particularly careful about cleaning the
side walls

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.270
Blackwall tires not so much of a problem
but if you've got skin wall tires, your

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.920
bike is never going to look clean

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.590
if you've got dirty sidewalls, so give it a
proper going over. Clean the spokes

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.990
next and then finish off with the hub. Now drop the back wheel out as well. If

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.150
you've not got a work stand, then whatever you do don't put the bike upside down on its

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.340
seat and it's STI's.  Instead you rest it
on the tip of the fork blades and the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.670
brakes and then lean it against something
else. Just to keep the bike a

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.990
little bit more pristine. Approach the
back wheel in pretty much the same way

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.640
that you did with the front

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.970
the only difference is the cassette

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.900
now this has already got some degreaser
on but I'm going to paint some more on

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.450
because we need that to come up. Now
unlike the chain this probably would

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.770
benefit from being cleaned. The more
expensive your cassette the more difficult

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.880
it is to actually get it clean, but in
this instance I'm just going to try with

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.130
degreaser and then a rag as well, you can
just fit between the sprockets and clean

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.130
it like so.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.060
Just pop the wheels back in, the bike should be
pretty much spotless now so all we're going

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.110
to do is replace our bucket of dirty
soapy water with clean water and rinse

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.860
the bike off

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.220
you can use a hose at this point as well. Some people do use power washes

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.670
but if you do that just be a little bit
careful, particular around delicate

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.940
bearings that you don't actually blast
all the grease out and strip the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.290
components completely

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.710
It's not necessarily a problem but it's
going to give you more maintenance in

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.710
the long run.

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.339
The bike is pretty much spotless except for
one jarring thing.

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:53.349
Now you've noticed Tom Last riding
around on filthy bar tape

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.439
now there isn't much you can do to get
it clean particularly if you're running white

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.099
bartape, and that's why most people probably
use black, but you do want to give it a

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:00.699
try

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.439
soap isn't going to work so try 
something like wd-40 and then elbow

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:07.119
grease.

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:11.079
So the bike's clean but your job's not
finished yet.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:14.469
Because this is a tune up there is a few little
bits we're going to take a look at it

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.719
so drop the front wheel again we're going
to check the tire for anything sharp that's

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.860
wedged in the carcass. If there is
something you can just take either that

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.229
or a pic and lever the object out. If it
creates a hole that's too big and you

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.159
are concerned about it, you can always just
take a dab of glue from your puncture

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.409
repair kit and just glue the tire back
together.

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.039
If it's too bad you're gonna need to
replace it hole like that it's gonna be

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.059
absolutely fine

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:43.869
now you can repeat the process obviously on your back wheel and while the wheels are out

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:48.699
just go and take a look at your brake
pads often they can get, if you've got alloy rims

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:49.479
 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.719
they'll get little bits of metal wedged
in them and then you can also lever

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:55.149
out any gunk from inside

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.509
It's really really important if you're using
carbon rims as well because that's an

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:05.469
expensive mistake if you leave any bits
of grit or anything in your pads. Now for

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:09.909
re-lubing. Use whichever lube takes
your fancy. I know that my five-minute bike

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.999
cleaning tips with my WD40 isn't
going to work because we've used

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:18.039
degreaser on the chain so that just
won't last, so I tend to use a wet lube

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:21.819
that's just because of where i live and
the kind of riding I tend to do, but if

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:26.739
you're lucky enough to live in 
somewhere dry then use dry lube. Take

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:29.739
your rag and just wipe off any excess

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:40.000
and that will take an air so and give
the derailers a bit we going over the

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.990
brake calipers

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.000
While the bike's in this position you can
always check things like the indexing or

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.020
the brakes, just so that it's properly
tuned up for your sportif or your

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.650
race

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.800
otherwise it's good to go with the
exception of that grotty bar tape which

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.630
I'm going to have to change for Tom  
Last. For a more in-depth clean and
