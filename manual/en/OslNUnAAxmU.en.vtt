00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:13.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Clarence Wells spends two
days a week rebuilding racing cars.

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:18.346
Evelyn Sanchez spends her
Tuesdays and Thursdays working

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:19.606
at a veterinary hospital.

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:23.546
And Chandelle Wilson helps
run a non-profit arts center.

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:29.406
These aren't part-time, afterschool
jobs, but school day internships

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:31.856
that allow students to
pursue their own passions

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:33.746
in real-world learning situations.

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:38.156
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: If we apply for 75, what
exactly can we get done with that?

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The internship
program is just part

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:45.436
of a unique high school concept
launched in 1997 in Providence,

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:47.566
Rhode Island at a school
called The Met.

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:49.926
&gt;&gt;Dennis: You just think
about how people learn.

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:51.176
They learn when they love something.

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:54.656
They learn when they have a passion,
when they're interested in something.

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.856
They learn-- subjects
aren't broken down.

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.056
You kind of think of home schooling.

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:02.596
If you're home schooling your
kid, you wouldn't put them

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:05.746
in a living room for 45 minutes
and then ring a bell and move them

00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:08.636
to the kitchen and study science
for 45 minutes, and ring a bell.

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:13.176
You'd have them meet great people,
read great books, do real stuff,

00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:16.106
and so that's how we said let's
see if we can create a school.

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.426
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: The word "passion,"
you know, like finding your passion.

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:21.316
I've never even heard of
it until I came to The Met.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:22.916
I'd be like, "And what
are you talking about?"

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.476
&gt;&gt;You're crazy, like, I
don't know, I'm fourteen.

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:29.256
So I didn't really
know what to expect.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:32.036
I think everything kind
of happened accidentally.

00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:33.966
&gt;&gt;Oh, look at the red cardinals.

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:36.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Chandelle,
the happy accidents began

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.286
when she met her first mentor,
photographer Therese Grente.

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:43.506
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: I-- she
had a 35 millimeter.

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:43.626
&gt;&gt;Therese: Okay.

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:48.996
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: My best experiences were
when I found someone who was able

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:53.736
to have enough time to work with me
instead of just giving me work to do.

00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:55.836
When I was with Therese,
it was great.

00:01:55.836 --> 00:01:58.916
When I had a question, it
was her that I went back to.

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:00.226
It wasn't someone else.

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:02.726
&gt;&gt;Therese: Kind of tell, so you'll
visually start seeing all that,

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:03.736
like with the negative.

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:05.966
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: We had good times, we
were able to talk to each other.

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.386
It's just very personal.

00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:09.186
&gt;&gt;Charles: So how far
have you gotten so far?

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.016
So let's say..

00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:12.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Met's personalized
learning philosophy begins

00:02:12.686 --> 00:02:13.556
with its size.

00:02:13.556 --> 00:02:18.126
It accommodates just 150 students
who spend two days working

00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:20.586
at their internships,
and the other school days

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:22.596
in a small advisory group at school.

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:26.136
Fifteen students work
with one teacher,

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:28.886
who helps them create
individual learning plans

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:31.216
and supervises their
independent studies

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.956
over the course of four years.

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:34.906
&gt;&gt;Charles: Now is there a
conclusion of some sort?

00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:36.806
&gt;&gt;I've gotten to know
each one of them,

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:38.706
each one of their learning styles,

00:02:39.516 --> 00:02:42.506
their family situations,
how they tick.

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:45.426
I know when they're
turned on to something,

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:47.346
when something's going on with them.

00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:51.616
It becomes sort of a family, and
they all refer to our advisory here

00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:54.406
as some sort of semi-dysfunctional
family,

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:56.116
but everyone cares about each other.

00:02:56.356 --> 00:02:59.646
&gt;&gt;You were doing the same
shot at different exposures.

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:00.026
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: Yep.

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:00.546
&gt;&gt;Charles: Okay.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:04.176
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: It's called equal
exposure depth of field stuff.

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:07.626
&gt;&gt;I think having a
relationship like that

00:03:07.626 --> 00:03:09.606
with your teacher definitely helps.

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:13.666
It helps me learn because
I can ask him a question.

00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:16.806
"You know, I don't understand
this, please explain it to me,"

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:18.746
without feeling embarrassed
or scared.

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:21.706
&gt;&gt;And this one's of my
brother floating in a pond.

00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:24.226
It was another spur
of the moment thing.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There are no
tests or letter grades here.

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:31.466
Instead, students study core academic
subjects by conducting research..

00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:34.376
&gt;&gt;Student: I talked to some
people up at Brown University..

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:37.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...completing
projects and giving presentation

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:41.056
to their parents, mentors, and
students in thier advisory.

00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:42.216
&gt;&gt;Charles: By the time they apply

00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:45.246
to college they've had 12
exhibitions, 13 exhibitions.

00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:47.006
They're amazing presenters.

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:50.166
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: You can use your
fingers in the water to work it off

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:53.036
of the paper backing here.

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:55.506
&gt;&gt;Charles: They blow
people away at interviews,

00:03:55.956 --> 00:03:58.436
they have portfolios,
they have resumes.

00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:03.006
They have a way to show the
quality work that they've done.

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:07.396
&gt;&gt;Chandelle: But here you have
a Polaroid emulsion transfer.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Met claims an
impressive graduation rate,

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:13.156
especially for a population
of at-risk students,

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:16.016
90 percent of whom go on to college.

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:19.626
So The Met concept has spread
beyond Providence to more

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:22.246
than a dozen other
cities including Oakland,

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:27.036
California where Evelyn Sanchez
interns at a local veterinary clinic.

00:04:27.036 --> 00:04:29.776
&gt;&gt;Evelyn: I really like being
here on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:31.756
I even come on the
weekends and I get paid.

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:34.566
I want to pursue veterinary
in the future,

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.086
hopefully when I get
out of high school.

00:04:36.086 --> 00:04:39.006
&gt;&gt;Okay. Turn on the
anaesthesia machine.

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:40.946
&gt;&gt;I would love to go to UC Davis.

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.036
I know that it's a very
competitive school,

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:44.646
but that's what I want
to do in the future.

00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:47.326
I want to hopefully become a doctor.

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:49.576
&gt;&gt;Elena: Good boy;
So we'll let him soak

00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:51.636
and then we're going
to go do the neuter.

00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:52.446
Push him toward the wall.

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:52.786
&gt;&gt;Evelyn: Okay.

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:53.596
&gt;&gt;Elena: In high school, you know,

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:55.886
what were you going to
do when you grow up?

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:56.186
Who knows?

00:04:56.186 --> 00:04:59.176
You know, I think it's better for
the kids because they have more

00:04:59.176 --> 00:05:03.746
of a track to follow, and she knows
now that you have to keep your grades

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:06.456
up from ninth grade
on, even before that.

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:08.556
They don't just look at your
last year, where when we were

00:05:08.556 --> 00:05:13.286
in high school it was more like
oh just goof off and do whatever,

00:05:13.286 --> 00:05:14.736
and then towards the end, pick it up.

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:21.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At an East Oakland body
shop, Clarence Wells is studying math

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:24.756
and science while rebuilding
racing cars.

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:28.186
&gt;&gt;Clarence: I've learned
a lot about cars,

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:33.386
like how math relates
to real-world stuff.

00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:37.666
I've been taking a physics
class, and that's tied in a lot

00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:38.586
with the stuff I do here.

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:40.746
I wrote a paper about,
like, aerodynamics

00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:43.736
and I'm learning a lot
of stuff about that.

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:45.866
My logic's getting better, and like,

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:48.666
being able to analyze
something and solve problems.

00:05:49.486 --> 00:05:54.156
Also what's important is how fast
and efficient I can do stuff,

00:05:54.716 --> 00:05:57.886
so like I think about that more
and I'm like, doing homework.

00:05:57.886 --> 00:06:00.776
Like what's the most efficient
way I can get this done?

00:06:01.096 --> 00:06:04.356
&gt;&gt;Narrators: Mentors like Dan and
Karen Gallant believe the value

00:06:04.356 --> 00:06:08.046
of Met internships goes well
beyond the work that's done.

00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:10.996
&gt;&gt;Karen: There are so many
people that are adrift,

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:14.016
and the schools don't have any
money for a lot of programs.

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:16.986
They certainly don't have any
money for vocational programs,

00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:18.026
as you've probably heard.

00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:24.066
And I think this gives them a chance
to learn different skills and also

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:27.176
to learn what they might really
want to pursue as a career.

00:06:28.246 --> 00:06:31.966
&gt;&gt;Chiem: I'm still learning, so
that's one of the good things.

00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:34.846
Being at Met West is good.

00:06:34.846 --> 00:06:40.146
They gave me opportunity to come
here and pursue my dreams and stuff.

00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:41.776
&gt;&gt;Daniel: They're having
to learn to be responsible

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:45.406
for things they wouldn't normally be
responsible for until they got a job.

00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:48.716
And we're not whip-crackers
or anything like that,

00:06:48.716 --> 00:06:52.266
but we do have a fairly high
standard that we want things done to.

00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:56.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While Met West's
curriculum is anything but standard,

00:06:56.606 --> 00:07:00.096
the school measures up
on standardized tests.

00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:01.646
&gt;&gt;Matt: We don't do
a lot of test prep,

00:07:01.646 --> 00:07:03.476
but we do take the
tests very seriously.

00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.736
Our seniors have the
highest pass rate

00:07:05.846 --> 00:07:10.746
on the California High School Exit
Exam in both English and math,

00:07:10.956 --> 00:07:12.936
for all schools in Oakland unified.

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:16.656
And I think part of this is
because we are a small school,

00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:17.986
we know our students well.

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.886
We know what they do well, and we
know what they need improvement on,

00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:23.866
and we're able to tailor
some individual curriculum

00:07:23.866 --> 00:07:24.706
to meet those needs.

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:32.246
&gt;&gt;Charles: I watch them find this
passion and develop from these angry,

00:07:32.736 --> 00:07:36.746
young kids to these
positive, socially conscious,

00:07:37.386 --> 00:07:40.496
academically high-achieving
kids who are doing things not

00:07:40.496 --> 00:07:44.696
because I tell them to do it, but
because they are just hungry for it.

00:07:45.286 --> 00:07:50.216
