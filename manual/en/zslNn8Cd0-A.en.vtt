00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.680
Augustus!

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.840
Augustus, this way!

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.060
I'm eating the Wonka bar and I taste something...

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.680
...that is not chocolate,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.820
or coconut,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.660
or walnut,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.320
or peanut butter,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.780
or nougat,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.620
or butter brittle, or caramel, or sprinkles,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.180
so I look and I find the Golden Ticket.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.500
Augustus, how did you celebrate?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.460
I eat more candy.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.560
We knew Augustus would find the Golden Ticket.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.780
He eats so many candy bars a day that it was not possible for him not to find one.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.200
Veruca, can you spell that for us please?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.740
V, e, r, u, c, a, Veruca Salt.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.940
As soon as my little Veruca told me she had to have one of these Golden Tickets,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.380
I started buying up all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.060
Thousands of them, hundreds of thousands.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.340
I'm in the nut business, you see, so I say to my workers-

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.020
Morning, ladies. From now on you can stop shelling peanuts...

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.040
...and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.680
Few days went by and we had no luck.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.020
It was terrible.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.640
My little Veruca got more and more upset each day.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.860
Where's my Golden Ticket? I want my Golden Ticket!

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.360
Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.840
I vowed I would keep up the search until I could get her what she wanted.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.780
And finally, I found her a ticket.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.480
Daddy, I want another pony.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.880
These are just some of the 263 trophies and medals my Violet has won.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.320
I'm a gum chewer, mostly.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.300
But when I heard about these ticket things, I lied off the gum, switched to candy bars.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.120
She's just a driven young woman.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.620
I don't know where she gets it.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.880
I'm the Junior World Champion Gumchewer.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.100
This piece of gum, I'm chewing right at this moment,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.540
I've been working on for three months solid.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.860
That's a record.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.480
Of course I did have my share of trophies,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.100
mostly baton.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.960
So it says that Wonka is gonna get this special prize, better than all the rest.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.080
I don't care who those other four are.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.900
That kid? It's gonna be me.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.380
All you had to do was track the manufacturing dates,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.960
offset by weather and the derivative of the Nikkei Index.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.820
A retard could figure it out.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.440
Most of the time I don't know what he's talking about.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.920
Kids these days with all the technology.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.860
Die! Die! Die!

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.780
Doesn't seem like they stay kids very long.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.000
In the end, I only had to buy one candy bar.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.640
And how did it taste?

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.380
I don't know. I hate chocolate.
