00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.760
Today we're doing the Crossbar Challenge.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.700
It's a classic football challenge and we're all going to suck at it.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.340
Yeah!

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:15.525
So Soccer AM made a challenge back in the day

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.690
and it has gone viral.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.190
All the popular YouTubers are currently doing it
at the moment.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.720
And it's the Crossbar Challenge.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:26.611
The whole idea of it is you have a football, or a
soccer ball. And you have to hit the crossbar.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:30.567
Which is the big white line at the top there.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:34.064
Now they've done it with football clubs from
around the country

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.540
They do it from the half way line because they're
professionals.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.096
Now as we're YouTubers we're not professional
footballers so we're going to do it from outside
the box.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.220
Harry, The Story So Far United. Left back, in the
changing rooms because I suck.

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:52.880
Lewis Levy. Actor, lover, professional
bullshitter.

00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:04.477
Go get the ball.

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:07.333
I'm Matt, I don't know what football is.

00:01:11.228 --> 00:01:12.293
Close.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.900
Paul Parker, a lover not a fighter.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.620
Put it back. Put it on the spot.

00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:31.760
I'm never going to get as close as I did the first
time.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.800
You got the right technique man

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.563
Again man.

00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:44.868
Fuck.

00:01:48.487 --> 00:01:49.325
Go on!

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.197
What is this?

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.860
Yes!!!!!!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.342
Oh my lord.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.914
Come on Matt, your last go.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.516
A little bit higher and that would have been it.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.800
It hit behind it!

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.829
That came to a tense finish, because obviously I
hit it.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.240
I will admit. I watched the footage back and I
just hit the back.

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:35.181
Little bit softer and I would have hit it.

00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:38.325
Been hitting the bar when we were playing around.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.960
Before we started recording we all hit it the bar

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.034
So that means I won.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.384
Well done Harry.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.500
You won that one congratulations

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.640
Finally get a win to my name.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.220
You get to keep your football.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.000
I get to keep my own football.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Not anymore.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.291
Because he's a sore loser.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.720
Anyway if you'd like to see anymore football
challenges or any sports challenges
