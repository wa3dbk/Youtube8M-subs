00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.480
Destiny: My name is Destiny and I used to
be a cheerleader.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.150
We kind of talked about this previously.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.950
We're getting back into it and I haven't done
it in a long time.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.950
It's probably been about two years since I've
been actively cheerleading and actively doing

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.950
my jumps and my stretches and whatnot.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.210
I took time off from college to have my son
and so now I'm getting back into the swing

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.970
of the cheerleading stretching and the jump.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.070
We're going to show you how with using your
resistance bands, how much it improves your

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.100
jumps and your kicks immediately.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.780
You'll definitely see a difference.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.770
Marlin: Hi, this is coach McQueen.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.059
We're going to start to work a little bit
on what I call the jump phase and we're going

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.440
to give you an idea of what the resistance
bands actually do.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.859
We'll come back and we'll go over exercises
and drills and things to give you a much better

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:46.859
preparation.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.680
Destiny has already done her stretching.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:58.059
Basically what we're going to start out with
is just having her do a leg raise or a leg

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.699
kick, actually a side leg kick.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.870
We're just going to have her come up so we're
going to get ready for the toe touch.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.740
Actually that's part of getting your body
stretched out and getting it prepared for

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
that.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.560
I'm just going to have you do a few of those.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.670
Maybe do a few left and right slow and then
let's do the rapid moves.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.670
Destiny: Okay.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.140
If you're a cheerleader at dancing you know
how to point your toes.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.140
With the resistance bands you do feel the
resistance.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.140
That's the big key word there.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.289
We're going to go ahead and do three more
on this side then we'll do five more on the

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.289
other side.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.289
These are slower.

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.850
They're not necessarily the one right after
another.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.930
You know what I'm talking about, so.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.090
Then we're going to go ahead and do your left
side.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:51.290
All right, with the resistance bands you're
going to ... you got your cardio going, you're

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.619
going to go ahead and feel the stretch in
your legs.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.579
I recommend that you do all your stretching
beforehand.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.509
Marlin: Where did you feel that ... I mean
you're getting the resistance, so when you're

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.939
bringing the leg up, I know that I feel it
sort of in the hamstring, the quad and then

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.209
back here and all those areas where we want
to work our jumps from.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.209
Destiny: Absolutely!

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.379
You feel it in your quads.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.849
You feel it in your buns.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.350
It's more of a stretch than just normal kicks
would be.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.924
Marlin: Part of that is we're just trying
to get you a little bit loose, a little bit

00:02:21.924 --> 00:02:23.330
flexible to prepare for a toe touch.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.569
One of the other things that I like to do
is the side leg raise just like that.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:38.830
Because again, when we do the toe touch we're
actually going to out a little bit more of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.409
a V, but what I want to do is just get those
muscles in the hips firing and the quadriceps.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.900
Destiny: Yeah, no matter how much strength
you have in your lengths, you're still going

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.900
to feel it burning.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.900
You feel it in your hips.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.900
You feel it in your buns and it you feel it
in your legs.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.900
It requires a lot more strength than just
a normal leg raise would.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.739
We're going to go and do it on this side and
do five more.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.900
Try not to let your leg snap back down.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.870
That's a problem that I have.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.250
I'm always wanting to just let it drop.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.659
Go ahead and slowly bring it down.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.269
The slower you do it the more of a stretch
you're going to get.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.602
Marlin: Let's do maybe about three of the
kicks with each leg and then three of the

00:03:14.602 --> 00:03:18.040
leg raises and then I want to show them the
differences when you unbuckle and then we'll

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040
go on and try the jumps.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.440
Destiny: Okay, so we're going to go ahead
and do three on each side as far as the kicks

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.430
go and then we'll go to our leg raises.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.959
Okay, and now our leg raises.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.329
Marlin: Try to hold that core in.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.920
She's kind of here right now.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.010
Remember that in jumping your abdominals and
your lower back are ... let's unbuckle.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.000
Let's just real quick try that again.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.530
Keeping in mind wherever her kick was as the
resistance was working those muscles and now

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.349
we're getting her prepared for actual jump
training.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.349
Destiny: All right.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.349
Marlin: I think you'll definitely see a difference.

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.349
Destiny: Okay.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.680
We're going to go ahead and do three on each
side just like we just did.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.489
See, it's an immediate difference.

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.310
It feels like you're flying.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.049
Your momentum increases like crazy.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:25.840
Marlin: We're getting strength and flexibility
and really also a good stretch so that when

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.030
you're ready to do the toe touch you're going
to be more comfortable.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.500
Again, Destiny mentioned that she took time
off to have her son so she wasn't quite in

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.270
a game form like she wanted to be.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.909
That's why I wanted to do this so that we'll
work back towards that.

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.310
Let's just start with the toe touch and let's
do a few without the bands then we'll put

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:59.970
the bands on, buckle them up and then we'll
come back and we'll do the same thing when

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.521
you're through with the kicks.

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:06.521
Destiny: Okay, all right.

00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:07.521
It's wearing me out.

00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:08.521
All right, so we're ready to go ahead and
do our toe touch with them on.

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:09.521
Without them on, excuse me.

00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:14.069
Just having done your simple kicks and stretches
with the bands on you feel like maybe ...

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.680
Marlin: Let's try a couple more just without
the bands.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.180
We're going to do a pre and then we're going
to do the bands and we'll come back here.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.190
It does ... you could see that she is breathing
a little bit heavy.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.250
It doesn't look like much but she is actually
getting a good workout.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.430
Destiny: Oh, definitely, definitely.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.020
All right.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.400
Marlin: Good, good.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.789
Doing all right?

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.370
Destiny: Yeah!

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.140
Marlin: Okay, let's buckle them up.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.220
Again, when Destiny has the bands on you're
going to see definitely that she's not going

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.340
to go as high.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.889
Her legs aren't going to go out as far.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.229
What you want to do is try to take it a little
bit past that resistance level.

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.849
You body will want to stop.

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.680
You want to try to jump through it.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.770
It's going to work her glutes, back here,
her hips, her thighs and her hamstrings.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.500
That's all going to be very important for
her to get her height so that she has a higher

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.000
better looking toe touch.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Destiny: Absolutely!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.759
Marlin: Let's try three or four with the bands.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.590
Don't worry about form right now.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.430
We're just working on training to jump higher
to be more effective.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:40.580
Destiny: Reminder, this is not about the form
because it's not going to look very pretty

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.669
with the resistance bands on.

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.440
Careful not to let your legs snap back together.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.330
Marlin: We want to control it so that you're
under control and that the bands aren't controlling

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.330
you.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.879
They are going to resist you but you control
it.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.620
Good job!

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.139
Destiny: It definitely feels funny but you
can feel how much of an impact it's going

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:05.139
to make.

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.240
Marlin: Two more.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.220
Destiny: Two more, okay.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:20.740
Marlin: Again, this is more training and conditioning
and just building up that leg strength so

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.760
she can jump higher.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.760
Very good!

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.760
She's doing pretty good.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.760
Now, let's unbuckle.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.410
Let's keep in mind where she was at when she
was jumping before and then while she had

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.940
the bands hooked up and then now we're going
to go back and have her do it without them

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.590
hooked up.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.900
Destiny: All right, okay.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.860
It's a lot easier going back up into it.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.840
Your momentum is a million times better it's
a workout!

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.220
You definitely feel the impact immediately.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.220
