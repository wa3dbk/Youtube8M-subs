My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show you some

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.740
really quick and easy icing recipes and how
to decorate holiday cookies. Also it's time

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.900
for a little bit more powdered sugar at this
point. We're not going to use all of it just

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.619
yet. Just like with the other recipe I've
already shown you, if you begin running into

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.260
consistency issues like if it starts looking
like it's getting a little bit too thick,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:37.170
a little dash of cold water or milk will help
you out. The reason I say cold water is that

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.799
if you use hot water in this, it'll start
breaking the shortening down, you would have

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.989
all sorts of issues. See, this is getting
really thick now so what I'm going to do,

00:00:44.989 --> 00:01:42.240
a splash of milk.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.400
Woo! Alright so you can see now, what I have
is this nice creamy consistency kind of like

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.600
the stuff you'd buy in the little jar at the
store. This actually looks a tad, a hair on

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:04.200
the runny side, so I'm just going to sprinkle
in just a tad more of the powdered sugar.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.759
That's why you add the powdered sugar in parts.
One it makes it more manageable, two to control

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:22.519
your consistency. You can see now, after I
whip all this through, I have this really

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.380
great looking frosting now. You can take this,
and you can refrigerate this, it'll stiffen

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.299
up a little bit. Matter of fact if it starts
to get loose on you, throw it in the fridge

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.269
it'll harden up just like regular cake icing
and your good. So that is our thick icing.
