Hi. My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to show you

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.630
how to make Ropa Vieja which is a traditional
Cuban beef stew. Alright and you'll see that

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.039
now our onions is taking on a nice brown color
on their edges. And it's a nice even mixture

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.142
as far as the color goes. So I want to scrape
all onions off the side here. Now I'm going

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:31.730
to grab that vinegar and what the vinegar
is going to do is it's going to pick up all

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.960
of the pan scrapings that are in there and
deglaze the pan. Which is less of an issue

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.470
in a non stick pan. But still it also does
impart some flavor. Next thing, I'm going

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.460
to take that water or chicken stock or whatever
you ultimately decide to use. I've got to

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.211
stir this up because this was a granulated
product, it started to separate. Pour that

00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:04.830
right in there and I've got to, unfortunately
I have to use my spatula to scrape a lot outside

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.440
of the bottom. Because like I said I used
like a bouillon product. When this hits a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.100
boil we are going to throw the cumin, salt
and pepper and some meat in there. So we'll

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.110
come back when that happens. Should be probably
a couple of minutes. So here we are at a nice

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.930
even boil. Let's go ahead and sprinkle our
cumin back in. Go ahead and hit it with some

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:38.120
salt. Don't go overboard with the salt though
because there's already salt in that chicken

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.800
base unless you used water. And now we're
going to stir this up. Make sure that flavor

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:54.560
gets mixed in there really well because we
have to add our meat back in. I think we're

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.880
good there. Alright so you're going to put
your meat back in, one piece at a time. And

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.190
if it's boiling, great. There should be just
enough room in here for all the meat plus

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.590
all the onions and juice. I'm going to take
my lid, put my lid on it and I'm going to

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.720
come back in three hours. Find something to
do. Watch a movie. Go have lunch. Go to the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.510
gym. Go to the grocery store. Something. Also
this would be a good time if you're making

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.490
this as a meal to work on the side dishes.
So if you're doing rice or bread or something

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.400
with it this is the time you would do that.
Because when you come back you've only got

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.460
really another 45 minutes before it's done.
So anyway 3 hours. I'll be back then.
