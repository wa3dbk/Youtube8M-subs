00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:03.214
Captain’s log, supplemental.

00:00:03.364 --> 00:00:04.957
After surviving the massive

00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:06.977
planetary explosion of Quorus Five,

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.789
Captain Glenn is making
preparations to depart.

00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:12.028
His mission is to resume exploration

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:13.782
of the remnants of that system.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.220
Starfleet hopes that
they will uncover answers

00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:18.497
to some very disconcerting questions.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.623
Thanks once again for pulling
us out of the jam back there.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.709
I feel pretty foolish.

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.394
I almost led us all to our destruction

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.113
over a petty obsession.

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:29.188
Doctor Holley is sure
that you and your crew

00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:31.247
were not responsible for your actions.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.435
And yet she couldn’t produce evidence

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:35.790
of any medical reason for our condition.

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:37.609
We all suffered something from being

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.686
exposed to that alien technology.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.242
You, Mr. Prescott? I
don’t recall noticing

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.589
you having any difficulties.

00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:46.532
My particular training should have

00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:48.337
allowed me to keep it under control.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.771
However, my performance in the lab

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:52.756
would seem to indicate otherwise.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.903
Well, in the end you
came through for us.

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:59.944
Yes. Captain Glenn, I’m... sorry

00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:02.199
for what happened on the Azrael bridge.

00:01:02.223 --> 00:01:03.909
I hope you don’t think less of me.

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.822
On the contrary. You’ve
once again demonstrated

00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:10.442
excellence in the
performance of your duty.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:13.344
Anyway, the whole thing seems

00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:16.084
somehow unreal now.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.318
Thank you, sir.

00:01:17.553 --> 00:01:20.226
I’m just sorry your
Smithfield couldn’t be here.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.955
I was rather looking
forward to meeting her.

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:25.922
No, sir, you might
not enjoy that meeting.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.487
She’s still in her engine
room trying to repair

00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:30.733
the mess that she thinks you caused.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.677
The last time I saw
her she was grumbling

00:01:32.743 --> 00:01:34.987
something that included
your name and some

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.484
choice words that I had to look up.

00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:54.427
Come.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.514
Don’t tell me you forgot about

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:02.186
our Friday night poker game.

00:02:02.716 --> 00:02:05.060
Well, to tell you the truth...

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.276
He did.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.088
I know that look.

00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:10.808
You’ve got something on your mind.

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:12.242
Don’t we all?

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:14.459
We were witness to an amazing display

00:02:14.483 --> 00:02:17.455
of power and an
incredible feat of genius.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.424
I can’t help but wonder if there are

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.489
more remnants of that
unusual alien technology.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.323
My money says there is,

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:25.704
but what I’m more curious about

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.778
is what that technology was used for.

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:30.411
When you were insisting
that we activate the device

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:31.532
you seemed pretty close

00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:33.168
to some sort of revelation.

00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:34.843
It’s like a dream now.

00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:36.734
You know how the most ridiculous things

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.560
can seem logical when
you’re having a dream,

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:40.541
but when you wake up you
can’t make sense of it

00:02:40.607 --> 00:02:42.702
no matter how hard you try?

00:02:42.768 --> 00:02:45.309
The way my engineering
systems kept acting up...

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:48.615
that certainly feels more
like a dream now than reality.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.108
At least I wish it was a dream.

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:53.249
Well, Prescott thinks it was meant

00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:55.320
to be some sort of doomsday weapon.

00:02:55.344 --> 00:02:57.779
I’d rather think that it
had a more positive use.

00:02:57.971 --> 00:03:00.579
Quorus Four is a good
orbital distance from the sun

00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:02.605
and with a little help
could be terraformed

00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:04.583
into a nice little habitable planet.

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:07.005
All it would need is a
good secondary energy source

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.410
to maintain an ideal
Class M environment.

00:03:09.434 --> 00:03:13.149
A logical possibility
if a bit unromantic.

00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:15.007
I can imagine that power being used

00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:18.327
to fuel perhaps a massive
teleportation device...

00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:20.770
one that could send entire civilizations

00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:23.241
to the other side of the known universe.

00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:27.779
Talk about the ultimate
mission of first contact...
