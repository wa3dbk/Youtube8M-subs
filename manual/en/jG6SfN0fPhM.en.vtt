00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.070
In this clip we're going to talk about staining
wood with gel stain. And we've talked a little

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.720
bit already about oil, oil based stains and
water based stains. Now gel stain is an oil

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.880
based stain, but it differs from your standard
oil stain in the sense that it's, it's thicker,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.599
it's more pigment than binder. It's, it's,
I'm not going to get too much into the technical

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.859
reasons of why it does what it does, but suffice
to say, in general terms, gel stain doesn't

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.890
penetrate as deeply into the wood as a regular
oil based stain does. But you should experiment

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.870
with it and see how it works for you. Let's
take a look at how gel stain works with various

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.500
woods. First things first, you're going to
want to stir your gel stain very thoroughly.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.989
Because it will separate even, even more extremely
than a, than a regular oil stain will. So

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.120
give it a good stirring up. And let's have
a looksey as to how it applies to different

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.400
species of wood. Here we're going to apply
some gel stain to a piece of Pine, again using

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:22.740
the circular motion to rub it across the grain.
Now as you can see the gel stain is much thicker

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.250
than the regular stain, and just clings to
the surface. So you definitely want to make

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:40.510
sure you wipe off as much of that excess as
you can. Now some folks find that the gel

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:50.010
stain sort of similarly to the water based
stain does not create as much blotching with

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.820
soft woods such as Pine. As you can see that's
a pretty, pretty even consistent stain, and

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.170
I did not condition this wood.
