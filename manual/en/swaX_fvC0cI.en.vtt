00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.880
crossfade M100 are the latest addition
in v-moda's line of headphones

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.080
these headphones show a great example of
mixing a high sense of fashion and audio quality

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.420
they have a neat and
elegant box

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.310
the headphones are placed inside the
well designed compact carrying case

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.770
along with the pair of headphone cables
and a 3.5 to 6.3 millimeter adapter

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.440
the carrying case is rigid and the
headphones are well-protected inside

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.590
the cables are a 1.3 m long smart
phone cable

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.670
and a 2 m share play cable 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.290
which allows you to connect an extra pair of headphones 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.660
though a built in plug

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.140
both cables have a 45 degree connector

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.800
the M-100 looks fashionable, I like the hexagonal shape of ear cups

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.500
the one I'm reviewing now is the shadow edition

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.010
and they come in 2 more color options
Matt Black, and White Leather

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.820
you can replace the metal side plates
on the ear cups to suit your taste

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.500
they have a variety of colors

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.629
with the possibility of laser engraving

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.160
ear cups should fit all ear sizes
unless you have extremely big ears

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.020
they are well padded with memory
foam which I found to be comfortable to wear for long hours

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.600
however they tend to make your
ears warm, M-100 are durable

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
they are built to last, cables are Kevlar
reinforced

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.400
and v-Moda have specially designed
the clip fold hinge

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.000
that enables you to fold them into the
compact carrying case

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.960
these are full size over ear DJ
headphones

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.040
with 50 mm driver inside each
cup

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.310
you can notice the V-port on the side
of each cup

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.220
in order to enhance the sound stage of the 
headphones

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.160
it took me around two weeks of listening
to break them in

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.980
but after that the sound quality
drastically improved

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.680
M-100 are able to manage all kinds of
bass

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.710
the more bass you throw on them the better they sound

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.490
their base is punchy and tight, mids and
highs are good

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.280
but they are a little over powered by
bass, they sound great with all kinds of DJ music

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.840
R&amp;B and pop

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.459
you can still enjoy other kinds of music as well but I think
if you're a classical music

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.060
or jazz fan, you'd better seek another
option

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.740
these are great for watching movies or
gaming

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.900
you can buy the boom pro microphone cable separately to turn them
into a gaming headset

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.560
in a nutshell v-moda M-100 are able
to combine high and quality audio

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.459
perfect sense of style and fashion along
with quality durable materials

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.930
and all of that with an affordable package

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.709
if you're surfing the market for a pair of
fun and cool headphones

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.709
look no more
