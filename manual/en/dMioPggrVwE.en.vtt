00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.700
ROB MCCLENDON: WELL
HERE IS SOMETHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.967
WHEN IT COMES TO THE
LANGUAGE OF BUSINESS,
ENGLISH IS THE MOST WIDELY

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:08.000
SPOKEN.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.633
BUT AFTER THAT IT IS NOT
JAPANESE, FRENCH OR EVEN
MANDRIN CHINESE THAT COMES

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:13.033
IN SECOND.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:18.033
IT IS SPANISH, WHICH IS
WHY ONE TULSA SCHOOL IS
OFFERING A BILINGUAL

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:19.166
EDUCATION.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.400
JOINING ME NOW IS
OUR ANDY BARTH.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.633
ANDY BARTH: WELL ROB, THE
AMERICAN WORKFORCE IS
EVOLVING ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.633
IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS, AS
MANY AS EIGHTY-SEVEN
MILLION BABY BOOMERS WILL

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:29.867
REITRE.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.333
AND AS OF NOW THERE ARE
ONLY FIFTY-SEVEN MILLION
PEOPLE READY TO REPLENISH

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.266
AMERICAN JOBS.

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:39.633
AND, A GROWING TREND IN
STATES LIKE TEXAS,
OKLAHOMA, AND KANSAS IS

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:43.266
THAT HISPANICS ARE A
GROWING PART OF THE
WORK-READY AGE GROUP,

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:47.533
MAKING IT NECESSARY
FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
TO BECOME BILINGUAL.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:52.166
ANDY: AT FIRST GLANCE,
IT'S YOUR TYPICAL
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:58.700
BUT IF YOU LISTEN
CLOSELY, THE WORDS BEING
SUNG ARE IN SPANISH.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.133
PEGGY MOSS: OUR MISSION
IS TO GROW SUCCESSFUL
GLOBAL CITIZENS.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:07.867
AND SO I THINK THAT
EVERYTHING WE DO WE TRY TO
TIE BACK TO THAT MISSION.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:15.767
ANDY: INSIDE THESE
CLASSROOMS YOU'LL HEAR AS
MUCH SPANISH AS ENGLISH.

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:19.533
PEGGY MOSS IS THE
SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:24.133
MOSS: IMMERSION IS
BASICALLY LEARNING CONTENT
AND ALL OF THE OBJECTIVES

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.834
AND SKILLS THAT YOU
NORMALLY WOULD IN SCHOOL
BUT THROUGH A SECOND

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.200
LANGUAGE.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.600
OUR KIDS COME IN AT PRE-K
AND THEY LEARN THE SAME
CURRICULUM AS THE REST OF

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.900
TULSA PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
THEY JUST LEARN
IT THROUGH SPANISH.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.033
AND IN THAT PROCESS
THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEARNING
THE SPANISH LANGUAGE.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:44.834
AT THIS AGE THE CHILD'S
BRAIN IS LIKE A SPONGE FOR
LANGUAGE, THEY'RE STILL

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.900
LEARNING THEIR
OWN LANGUAGE.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.633
ANDY: AND IN MICHELLE
SAENZ'S KINDERGARDEN
CLASS, THE LEARNING CURVE

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.967
IS SET PRETTY HIGH.

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:58.567
MICHELLE SAENZ: I THINK
EVERY CHILD NEEDS TO HAVE
A SECOND LANGUAGE BECAUSE

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:05.367
WE'RE SO DIVERSE AND ALSO
BECAUSE IT'S MORE
IMPORTANT FOR WHEN THEY'RE

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:10.800
OLDER THEY HAVE
MORE OPPORTUNITIES
IN THE JOB MARKET.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.767
ANDY: FOR SAENZ, TEACHING
KINDERGARDEN IS A FIRST.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.400
BUT THE PAYOFF IS BIG.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.834
SAENZ: I'VE NEVER WORKED
WITH THE LITTLE ONES
BEFORE, AND I HAVE ONES

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:22.700
THAT ARE ALREADY
COUNTING BY TENS.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.133
WORKING IN THIRD GRADE, I
DIDN'T EVEN SEE THAT UNTIL
THE END OF THIRD GRADE SO

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.367
IT'S REALLY EXCITING.

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:31.633
AND THEN I HAVE THOSE ONES
THAT ARE TRYING THEIR
HARDEST AND JUST HIT THOSE

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:36.667
LIGHT BULB MOMENTS
WHEN THEY GET IT, AND
IT'S REALLY EXCITING.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:41.133
ANDY: AND FOR STUDENTS
BRISA FLORES AND KAI
LUKENBAUGH, LEARNING IN A

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:44.533
SECOND LANGUAGE IS
JUST NO BIG DEAL.

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:47.400
BRISA FLORES &amp; KAI
LUKENBAUGH: I LIKE
SPEAKING SPANISH HERE;

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.667
BECAUSE WE LEARN HOW TO
SPEAK TWO LANGUAGES.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:56.100
I LIKE DOING THE SENTENCES
AND DOING THE CALENDAR.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.700
PEGGY MOSS: THE DUAL
IMMERSION PART IS A VERY
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.734
SCHOOL.

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:03.000
IF YOU DON'T HAVE PARENTS
AT HOME WHO CAN HELP YOU
WITH YOUR HOMEWORK, IN THE

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.734
CLASSROOM IS WHERE THEY
HAVE TO REALLY GET THEIR
SKILLS AND STRATEGIES TO

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:09.600
BE ABLE TO TACKLE THE
WORK THAT WE GIVE THEM.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.300
AND IT'S THE SAME FOR
THE ENGLISH SPEAKERS TOO
BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.967
USUALLY CAN'T HELP THEM
WITH THEIR HOMEWORK EITHER
BECAUSE THEY DON'T SPEAK

00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:16.166
SPANISH.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:19.800
SO THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME
BOAT AND THEY'RE JUST
LEARNING SIDE BY SIDE, TWO

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.066
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
THAT MIGHT NOT REALLY
BE WORKING TOGETHER

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:25.333
OTHERWISE.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:29.467
SO WE FIND THAT COMPONENT
OF OUR PROGRAM PROBABLY
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:34.633
AND ACTUALLY DEFINING
PIECES OF OUR PROGRAM.

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:39.400
ANDY: BRIDGING A CULTURAL
GAP WHILE CULTIVATING
TODAY'S YOUNG MINDS.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.133
ANDY: NOW WHEN THE SCHOOL
BEGAN, IT ONLY OFFERED
PRE-K AND KINDERGARTEN.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:48.700
BUT IT PLANS TO ADD
ONE GRADE EACH YEAR
THROUGH FIFTH GRADE.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.834
ROB: SO JUST HOW UNIQUE
IS THIS TYPE OF SCHOOL?

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:53.734
ANDY: WELL ROB, THERE ARE
TWO OTHER IMMERSION
SCHOOLS IN THE TULSA AREA.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:57.133
BUT THEY DON'T OFFER DUAL
IMMERSION, WHICH IS WHERE
STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT HALF

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:58.967
IN SPANISH AND THE
OTHER TIME IN ENGLISH.

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:00.367
ROB: ALRIGHT,
THANKS SO MUCH ANDY.

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:01.834
ANDY: YOU'RE WELCOME ROB.
