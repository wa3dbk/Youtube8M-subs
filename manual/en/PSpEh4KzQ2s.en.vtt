00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.789
Felicity from the UK is our home girl.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:22.789
She knows this.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.750
Felicity sends us more video games than I
can fathom a British girl ever owning without

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.010
being a Japanese teenager.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.490
That’s not even possible.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.340
But lately, I’ve had to review a few of
them that...frankly, I’m wondering what

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.640
her motives were.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.440
Felicity, if by sending Croc and Croc 2 for
the Game Boy Color, your intention was to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.710
drive me without warning into a state of trance-like
boredom...well, you win, m’lady.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.780
And hey, trance-like boredom?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.199
You know.

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.620
It’s whatevs.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.290
You have to hand it to Felicity.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.480
And you have to hand it to THQ.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.740
After the catastrophic failure that was Croc
for the Game Boy Color, they could’ve given

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.740
up.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.580
Looking back on the things THQ chose to spend
its money on, they probably should’ve.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.580
But they didn’t.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.490
Instead, they had Natsume develop an all-new
sequel.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.510
That’s moxy.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.110
Unfortunately, it’s also a bit...Croc-sy.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:31.600
Croc 2 hit the Game Boy and Game Boy Color
less than a year after the original.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.660
The speed of that turnaround is, unfortunately,
indicative of its quality.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.880
Croc 2 is certainly an improvement over the
first game, which was an unplayable mess of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.950
a platformer.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.110
This game is actually playable...it’s just
a little empty.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.640
And a lot boring.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.420
Breaking from its predecessor and its home
console cousins, Croc 2 is actually not a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.650
platformer on the Game Boy.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.820
It’s a kind of top-down adventure game,
I guess?

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.021
You’re Croc, you’ve at least figured out
gravity this time, you’re walking around

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.450
accepting a bunch of missions.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.910
Which then entail walking around some more.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.230
Sure, there’s rudimentary puzzle solving
and item collecting, but...otherwise?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.720
Wear comfortable shoes, ‘cause you’re
walking around.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.010
Thrilling stuff, right?

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.010
Yeah, no.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.010
It’s not.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.390
And that’s the problem with Croc 2.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.260
It’s like the team was so focused on just
doing something different, they forgot that...it

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.620
should also be enjoyable.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.239
I mean, it plays better.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.530
And to be honest, the fact that it plays at
all is an improvement.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.320
But there’s just no character here at all.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.660
It’s an empty game that feels almost unfinished,
which might be a product of its fast development.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:47.400
Of course, even in fixing the basic problems
of the original, Croc 2 still has issues of

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400
its own.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.440
Case in point, this is a game about exploration
and walking around...yet there’s no map.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.530
Since everything looks the same, you get lost
almost immediately.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.650
Listen, Croc was pretty bad on the Game Boy
Color.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.910
Again, just broken.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.549
But you know what?

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.060
I had more fun with that broken platformer
than with this comparatively well-made sequel.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.900
Yes, Croc 2 is technically an improvement,
in almost every possible way.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.010
You can play Croc 2.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.649
But it’s an improvement you won’t want
to play.
