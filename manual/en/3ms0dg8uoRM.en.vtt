Hi I'm Yolanda Vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com
and next we are going to talk about what kind

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.980
of soil should I use for organic gardening.
Now we all want an organic garden. We don't

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.350
want to use any chemicals, we don't want to
kill any bugs. We don't want to kill any broad

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.800
leaves because we realize there is other options
besides chemicals so our number one concern

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.700
when we are starting our flower beds is what
kind of soil should we use for organic gardening?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.900
So the best soil to use for your organic garden
is compost and a lot of places in the country

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.130
you can't just go to the store and ask for
compost, they don't even carry it. So my rule

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.030
of thumb if you can't find good compost just
use good potting soil and there is all different

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.810
types of blends out there. You can get truck
loads delivered from different nurseries or

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.440
garden centers or you can buy them by the
bag at different nurseries as well. A lot

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.710
of times if you find them on sale they are
not very expensive. So I always ask is this

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.200
compost that has chemicals? Does it have fertilizers?
Does it have weeds in it? So the soil that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.870
has been baked is the best so if you can find
any soil where they call it baked is where

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.570
they put it under high temperatures where
it calls all the seeds and it kills all the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.200
diseases so you are starting off with soil
that has already been treated and should do

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.369
really well for many years to come. So it
is easy to organic garden and it is just by

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.690
not using any chemicals that is all you need
to do. I have got a big compost pile myself

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.960
where I put grass clippings and leaf clippings
and I keep turning it up but it takes a couple

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.320
of years before it is ready to put into my
flower beds so you can make yours yourself

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.110
or there are a lot of different companies
that sell organic soil so I think the key

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.020
is to make sure that it is baked so it is
not full of weeds. Make sure it is not just

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.140
pine needles I have had that issue before
where it is just pine needles and there is

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.990
not enough substantial organic matter or even
a lot of the mushroom composts are great too

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.560
I'm finding because all of my plants have
done really well in them but just go on line

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.570
and search and talk to different companies
and do your research and that is all you can

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.940
do and support all your local companies because
why have it shipped in from far away when

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.470
I'm sure there is a local company that you
can support just down the street.
