00:00:34.253 --> 00:00:36.859
Many years have come and gone

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.700
I remember everything

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:43.371
Can’t remember yesterday

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.323
So take me from the razor’s edge

00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:54.734
Before I slip away, before I slip away...

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.550
Ooh

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:06.726
The dream is fading fast 

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:09.395
as a light comes in the room

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:13.207
You’re still there

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.478
Screaming never stopped

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:23.662
it just buried in my head like’a
like’a nightmare

00:01:25.706 --> 00:01:27.671
And you’re still there

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:30.563
Life will make

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.030
A mess of plans

00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:39.767
Take a bow to yesterday

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.362
Out of my hands

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:48.958
Ooh

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:02.739
“If I could heal you with my voice I’d sing sweet mediciner”

00:02:04.664 --> 00:02:06.865
“ in your ear”

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.176
You can never be free

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.461
While you’re still plugged in

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.840
gonna leave my skin

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.562
Life will make

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.671
A mess of plans

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.942
Take a bow to yesterday

00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:36.749
Out of my hands

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:45.562
Take me away from here

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:57.207
Take me away from here

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:19.091
The dream is fading fast

00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:25.000
The dream is fading fast

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:31.320
Heaven help me now

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:36.849
Heaven help me now

00:03:37.578 --> 00:03:39.255
Lost my way

00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:42.688
Heaven help me now

00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:45.599
Find my aim

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.059
Heaven help me now

00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:55.000
Heaven help me now
