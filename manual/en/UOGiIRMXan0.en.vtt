00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.740
Now, we're going to take a look at the designated
hitter, or the DH. This is a specialized position,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.259
a modern invention of baseball that only exists
in the American League of professional baseball.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.100
It's a little different DHing in little league
or AAU, legion ball and on the collegiate

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.000
level. We'll focus primarily on the major
league designated hitter. Again, it only exists

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.800
in the American League and this is a person
who doesn't play defense. His sole responsibility

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.630
is to hit the ball. David Ortiz is a very
prominent designated hitter for the Boston

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:42.440
Red Sox. Jason Giambi has filled that role
for the NY Yankees lately. The DH is generally

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.910
a power hitter who can also hit for some average.
He's generally a larger player who can hit

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.660
the home run. You're going to expect your
DH to hit between 25 and 35 home runs a year.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.430
You really want this guy to be a big bopper.
In the American League he'll generally bat

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.930
either 4th or 5th. He's generally not very
skilled at defense or at least his hitting

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.660
skills far exceed his defensive skills and
there are better defensive players on the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.340
field. The DH, again, is a modern invention.
It did not exist in baseball prior to the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.560
1970s and it does not exist in the National
League. A lot of people consider the National

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.750
League pure baseball because the pitcher bats.
In major league baseball, the American League,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.681
the designated hitter takes the place in the
batting lineup of the pitcher. The pitcher

00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.850
is generally your worst hitter on the team
because he has the least opportunity to practice

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.200
hitting. Most of the time he's going to practice
pitching. So, in the American League they'll

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.360
let the DH take the cuts instead. The DH does
serve the purpose of allowing some of your

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.750
aging power hitters to remain in the game.
Rafael Palmero was an example of that as was

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.790
Jose Canseco and Juan Gonzales. These guys
would have been out of the game earlier in

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.460
their careers had they not been able to go
play in American League ballparks and play

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.130
DH because their bodies just couldn't keep
up with the day to day grind of playing in

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.480
the field. So, while the DH may not be a purist?s
choice it does serve a great purpose allowing

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.010
some of these superstars play and extend their
careers. Again, the DH bats every inning.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.560
He takes up a regular spot in the batting
lineup, generally 4th or 5th and he does bat

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.209
every inning. His responsibility is just to
hit the ball.
