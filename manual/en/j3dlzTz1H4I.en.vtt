Blue Band President Stephen Payne: Alright
guys, just a special announcement. We have

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.100
the “favorites show” coming up for Michigan
State, and I just wanted to, on behalf of

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.660
the band, present our ballot for the “favorites
show.”

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.700
So, by a vote of the band

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.140
we will be opening with “James Bond Medley,” 1983
Sugar Bowl design, designed by Dr. O. Richard

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.240
Bundy -- he’s right here! [LAUGHTER] Concert
feature: “007: A View to a Kill,” arranged

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.800
by O. Richard Bundy, 1987, revised 2011. And
then we’ll be closing with Chicago’s “You’re

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.420
the Inspiration,” arranged by O. Richard
Bundy, 1985. [APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.160
I just want to make sure it’s official, so, all in favor, please
say “Aye!” Band: Aye! Blue Band President

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.500
Stephen Payne: And opposed? [SILENCE] Well,
it sounds like it’s unanimous! [LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.690
Mr. Drane and the staff have been preparing
some of the drill, replicating exactly…

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.690
Bundy: Are you serious? This is for real?
Greg Drane: Yes.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.280
Bundy: This is for real?? [LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:40.000
Blue Band President Stephen Payne:
So we’re incredibly excited and we can’t wait for Michigan State. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:51.000
O. Richard Bundy: I thought this was like a joke, you know. You’re serious? You want
to work that hard next week? [LAUGHTER]

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.000
It’s not that this stuff is that hard, but oh my
goodness. [PAUSE] So, seriously? [LAUGHTER]

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.940
Alright! Thank you very much! I guess I’d
better pull those arrangements out to see

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.700
if there’s anything I need to fix on them.
That’s very nice. That’s very sweet of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.520
you. That James Bond thing from 1983 was the
show that I wrote as a graduate assistant

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.540
that they took to the national championship
game at the Sugar Bowl, which I thought was

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.860
my last game at Penn State. My wife was up
in the stands bawling [LAUGHTER]. I was on

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.080
the sidelines like this [SLOUCHES] you know.
So that would be a great… wow, thank you

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.090
very much. I don’t know what to say. [APPLAUSE
AND CHEERS].

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.160
Now you’ve got to sign the drumhead if you didn’t. Whether you want
to or not, you’ve got to sign the drumhead.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:58.920
Thank you very much. I don’t know what to
say. Thank you. Let’s carpe the heck out of next week! [CHEERS]

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.600
Drum Major Christopher
Siergiej: To the ready! Band! Ten-hut! Band:

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.860
Dig-it-Kapow! LET’S GO STATE! Bundy: Beat
Illini! [APPLAUSE]

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.960
 Bundy: Beat
Illini! [APPLAUSE]
