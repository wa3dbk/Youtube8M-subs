00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.780
Alright bitches, let's crawl our way to success,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.740
I'm gonna fucking do some baby shit

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.620
And I'll probably shit like a fucking baby.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.800
What is this? Look at this.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.220
This is- is this like human evolution?

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.480
The baby will consume the baby and be reborn as the baby?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.940
Dude, this baby can walk, he can fucking crawl/stand,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.500
he can climb, HE CAN DRAG SHIT?!

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.520
Get to the thing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800
Woman: I will sing you a song my mother sang-

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.140
Michael: SHUT UP AND GET TO THE FUCKING THING!

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.920
This is already pissing me off, I'm looking at a black fucking screen.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.300
My baby vision is obscured, I can't look left.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
TURN LEFT! I don't have full mobility of my head-

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.160
Alright, well that's interesting.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.340
Uuuuuuuuh-alllllllright...

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.060
Am I gonna get fucking murdered here in my crib?

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.660
Can I start playing before I get killed?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.000
On my own little baby legs-

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.360
look at-look at his little baby hands, look at 'em!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.080
I'M A FUCKING BABY, LOOK AT ME!

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.000
Goo goo gaga bitch, give me some breast milk,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.600
I wanna suck them titties!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.100
Got some fucking letters here?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.900
Alright, I'll-I'll waste 19 minutes trying to fucking set some stupid joke up.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.900
Grab it, grab the fucking block, baby.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.600
FLIP IT OVER! FLIP THE FUCKING BLOCK OVER!

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.560
I'm trying to spell - I was gonna spell fuck.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.420
Fuckin'- How do I crawl again?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.260
Alright, I stood up, and now-

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.700
I'm just - I'm like Godzilla!

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.800
*rawrs*

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.040
Fuck yo' blocks, bitch!

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.180
Guess I'm gonna walk on out the door now.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.100
Like a baby does.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.700
This game is fucking dark as dicks.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.820
Fucking sweet painting of a parrot,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.700
sitting on the, uh, the wall there for me to admire.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.320
I NEED A FUCKING KEY?!

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.100
God-I CAN'T EVEN REACH THE KEYHOLE!

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.380
How do I do stuff again?

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.240
I don't-Oh my god!

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.580
After, uh, briefly checking the, uh, controls,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.800
I've realized, the "Ctrl" is crawl,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.340
and I will now crawl like a bitch.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.800
Can I do some shift-crawl?

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.180
No? I seem to be moving at the same speed.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.680
Why am I not going faster?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.800
Maybe I need to be stand up-get up.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.640
Aw, dude, I'm tearing ass now! Look at this!

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.000
Hide your sharp corners, 'cause I'm coming to fuckin' bash my head on 'em!

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.080
Uh, I fell down! I FELL DOWN!

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.560
GET UP BABY, GET UP!

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.560
I'm already lost, I'm, like, three feet into the game

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.800
and I need a fucking key, I guess.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.900
Where's the fucking key?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.000
Is it back in my room?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.400
Why would you key in the baby's room?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400
That's just fucking stupid.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.000
Oh my god, that elephant scared the shit out of me.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.380
I thought he was going to fuck my shit up.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.200
What the fuck good is this? There's nothing up here.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.040
NOOOO, YOU'RE STANDING ON THAT! DON'T CLOSE IT!

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.280
Holy shit, I have a lot of fucking clothes in here.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.200
I don't WANT THIS SHIT! WHERE'S THE FUCKING KEY?

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.640
Baby bowling right here.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.800
No bumpers required.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.320
Stop rubbing your belly, grab the ball.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.020
Ok, ready? 1, 2, hwugh!

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.180
I DIDN'T GET ONE PIN?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.680
I got one, I got one!

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.200
And that one counts, that's two!

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.880
Oh look at this! I can climb the fucking stool?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.400
Holy shit, this is- this is like "Baby Geniuses 3".

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.320
Is there a light switch too? Can I get the fucking lights going in here?

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.540
No? 'Cause usually it'd be on the wall.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.420
That's how light switches work.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.040
OH MY GOD! I DIDN'T NEED A FUCKING KEY AT ALL?!

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.120
WELL, WHY WAS THERE A FUCKING KEY ICON?!

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.100
ARE YOU SHITTING ME?!

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.600
Fuckin' finally in the second room, we're blazing through this alpha thing.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.280
HELLO?! IT'S LOUD AS SHIT IN HERE!

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.640
ARE YOU IN THE WASHING MACHINE?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.820
Alright, that's locked too, is there a fucking key on it?

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.380
Pull the plug.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.220
PULL THE PLUG!

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.140
Oh, you can actually pull the plug?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.820
Jesus Christ!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.200
Bear: Thank you... 
Michael: Oh, god...

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.540
Why would I want this thing?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.540
Bear: We need to find your mother...
Michael: Hoooh my god...

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.940
Michael:  Wh-what the sh- is this bear talking to me?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.060
Where'd the bear go? I picked it up, I'm not holding it anymore.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.680
Where the hell is it?

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.660
Is it in my asshole? Did I put it in my diapey?

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.400
Dude, get a fork. Get a fork and fucking stick it in there.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.300
Don't mind me, just uhhhh...

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.020
just a baby walking down the fucking stairs.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.880
Nothing to see here.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.300
This baby lives in the most terrifying fucking house I've ever seen.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.360
Get up, no, GET UP! I was already up, STAND UP!

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.580
Where's the fucking remote. I'll play the Nintendo.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.200
*Super Mario theme*

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.280
Oh shit, oh shit, I heard something break.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.380
Holy shit, someone's gonna kill a baby.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.240
Someone is gonna fucking kill me.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.780
Look at my baby shadow. Look at this.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.440
*psychotic impression of a baby*

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.540
Get up, get on the bed, see if anybody's banging up there.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.880
You bangin'?

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.080
No, what is-this is not-this is the  table. That's not a bed.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.800
Babies are fucking dumb.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.000
There's the, uh, there's the teddy I found earlier,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.320
and absorbed into my body.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.880
Ohhhhh shit, oh shit, something's in the fucking kitchen,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.720
something's in the fucking kitchen.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.340
Holy shit.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.000
Holy shit.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.020
Oh my god, hide in the fucking cabinet.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.240
Hide in the- oh my god, oh my god, it's above me.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.460
It's on the counter above me.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.640
What the fuck is it?

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.780
No- Why is there fucking dolls everywhere in the corner?

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.580
Oh my god, Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.320
Mama? Papa? G-go-goo goo?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.220
Milkey?

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.760
Oh my god, I'm terrified.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.680
Oh my god, this is so scary.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.020
Fuckin' close the door too, you're letting all the fuckin' cold air out.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.300
Can I just climb in the oven?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.880
Baby! You don't go in there!

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.880
Great, another locked door scenario.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.440
So I guess that's not a lock, that's like a handle.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.360
I've now come to realize,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.780
since I ran around the first fucking room for twelve mintues,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.800
looking for a fucking key,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.820
until I decided to climb on top of a stool,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.440
and just, "Oh, I can just open the fucking door!"

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.280
I have super baby strength, by the way.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.620
I'm just fucking moving this chair like it's nothing.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.880
Get up there. Get your ass up there.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.080
Open the fuckin'-we're fuckin' pros now.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.660
We're the dead people. There's gonna be dead people.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.340
I'm gonna be a baby covered in dead goo-goos, I swear to god.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.720
That's-that's not even safe!

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.240
Why would you leave that right here for the baby to get to?

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.420
I can fuckin' go to town and spray this shit all over the place.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.660
Idiots.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.680
Ow. Whacked myself with the door.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.420
My tiny little baby heart is pounding.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.080
Oh shit, oh shit.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.100
More dolls, fuckin sittin' in the corner there, it's fine.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.600
Mama? Mama?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.180
*gasps* *screams* *sighs*

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.400
Is this a shovel? What is this?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.700
Baby.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.320
HOW BIG IS THIS FUCKING HOUSE?

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.100
Play with that pot, play with that pot.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.000
Break it, break the pot. Run into it.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.500
So I can move a chair across the room, but I can't knock over a pot?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.420
Were any fucking lightbulbs installed in this house?

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.960
We gonna ever turn any fuckin' lights on?

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.400
I'm gonna get killed in here, I'm gonna get killed in the dark.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.600
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.000
This is fucking terrifying.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.780
Like a baby Nathan Drake, he just crawling over everything.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.340
Get- get- ok, except I can't get up there.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.300
REALLY?! I MADE A STEP?! THAT WAS A STEP?!

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.360
THAT WAS, LIKE, HALF AN INCH!

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.800
Who would fuckin' put a dresser this close to the door?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.600
That's fucking insane!

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.480
You'd walk out of the bedroom and slam right into this every morning!

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.740
Gonna...investigate the bedroom now

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.940
and try not to shit my diapers.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.600
Are you serious? Really?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.000
This is a fuckin' IMAGINARY LUMP?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.220
Shit- *shit-spewing scream*

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.380
OH GOD, IT'S COMING! WHAT IS IT?!

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.020
Hide in the closet, hide in the closet, HIDE BEHIND THE SHOES!

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.360
GET IN THERE!

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.420
Get under the bed. Go.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.820
Go, go, go, go, go. Aw, dude.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.840
What is this? There's a fucking head?

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.660
There's a decapitated head? Fuckin' sittin' under the bed?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.280
OH SHIT!!!

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.460
OH SHIT, OH SHIT!

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.020
I AM NOT PREPARED FOR THIS!

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.660
JESUS CHRIST!

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.300
Put the shoes on, put the shoes on, put the fucking shoes on,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.060
PUT THE SHOES ON AND RUN!
