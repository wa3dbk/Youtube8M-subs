00:00:02.646 --> 00:00:09.803
Hi. In this tutorial, we’ll look at how to transfer and manipulate UV texture coordinates using ICE in Softimage.

00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:17.806
This scene might look familiar to you. It’s a modified version of the auto-fence builder shown on the xsisupport blog.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:22.237
The parts of the fence are duplicated and transformed based on a curve,

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:25.950
and the fence updates when you add and move points on the curve.

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:36.448
If you unhide the original fence parts, you can see that their materials and textures are not being transferred.

00:00:37.652 --> 00:00:43.171
The factory compounds that are used to copy the fence parts have built-in options for transferring materials,

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:46.556
but they only work with materials applied using ICE.

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:53.548
So, the first thing to do is to use ICE trees to apply the material to the polygons of the fence parts.

00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:10.020
There’s only one material used by all parts of the fence, so we just need to add it to the Materials attribute.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.915
Then we need to set the MaterialID so that all polygons use this material.

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:34.184
Set the material ID to 1 to use the first material in the Materials array, instead of the material applied to the object.

00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:42.627
Normally "Is True" is driven by a condition on the polygons, but in this case set it to true for all polygons.

00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:46.495
Now we need to do the same for the other parts of the fence.

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:53.030
Right-click on the root to insert an Execute node so that it’s easier to copy and paste these nodes.

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:30.875
The fence is now using the correct material, but not the correct UV texture coordinates.

00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:37.911
The factory compounds copied the UVs to a custom attribute, but the material isn’t using them yet.

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:40.953
We can fix that in the render tree.

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:49.236
The default scene material is applied to the fence panels object.

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:52.933
But we want to edit the Wood applied locally to the polygons.

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.473
The render tree lets you switch between all materials used by an object.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:02.263
When you select the Image shader, the projection controls become available.

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:06.006
These controls are also available in the shader’s property editor.

00:03:07.177 --> 00:03:10.810
Specify the custom attribute to which the original UVs were copied.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.919
Repeat this for the other parts of the fence.

00:03:24.055 --> 00:03:26.976
Something is still wrong with the fence rails.

00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:39.062
The factory compounds copied values from the default cluster and projection name.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.860
However, the original fence rail uses a different projection name.

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:01.480
So, you need to change the source projection name to match.

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:05.801
Alternatively, you could rename the source projection instead.

00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:12.604
So far, we’ve transferred the materials and texture coordinates from the fence parts to the complete fence.

00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:19.591
In the next video we’ll use ICE to make some adjustments, like getting rid of the repeating pattern in the fence panels.
