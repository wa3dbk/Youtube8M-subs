00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.130
Greetings, fellow Captains!

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.930
We have already shown you how to control carrier aviation in World of Warships.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.360
Today we will talk about the different types of aircraft and their efficient use in battle.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850
The game has four types of aircraft.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.240
Reconnaissance planes are stationed on battleships and cruisers,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.970
fighter planes are designed to destroy enemy aviation,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.830
while torpedo bombers and dive bombers make up striking squadrons

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.250
that attack enemy ships.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.510
Reconnaissance planes are the eyes of battleships and cruisers,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.300
increasing their view radius.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.130
Press T to launch a reconnaissance plane.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.420
It will take off and fly around your ship.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.590
It may be extremely useful for detecting enemy ships

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.180
with low visibility or approaching torpedoes.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.760
After a reconnaissance plane uses up its fuel,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.590
it will automatically return to the ship for refueling.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.920
Once refueled it may be launched again.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.060
Like any other aircraft in the game

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.160
it can be destroyed by fighters or by enemy antiaircraft artillery.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.060
The main tasks of fighter planes are to defend allied ships

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.790
and to destroy striking squadrons of torpedo bombers and dive bombers.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.970
If a striking squadron comes under attack, it loses speed and accuracy.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.120
This means, even if you don't manage to destroy the squadron,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
your attack will increase the spread of its bombs and torpedoes,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.690
thus helping an allied ship to evade assault or receive less damage.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.920
Another important mission for fighter planes

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.270
is the defense of your striking squadrons against enemy fighters.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.080
Don't forget that in a battle between fighters, the higher Tier wins.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080
With that in mind,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.720
try to engage the enemy in the effective area

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.430
of antiaircraft artillery of allied ships.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.760
Fighter planes are also quite efficient in reconnaissance.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.180
Torpedo bombers are the main striking force of aircraft carriers.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.080
Their reticle looks like a circle with a green sector of torpedo spread.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.680
The best way to increase the efficiency of an attack is to launch torpedoes at a ship's side.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.760
The enemy, however, will try to maneuver their bow or aft to your salvo.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.680
For this reason, the initial aim needs to be adjusted.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.810
You can do this by moving the indicator of the attack vector.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.640
The landscape is another thing that you must keep in mind

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.480
as islands may easily prevent your torpedoes from hitting their target.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.240
A successful torpedo attack not only damages the ship, but also causes flooding -

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.300
the enemy ship will lose survivability points for a certain period after the hit.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.740
Do not forget that a quick and maneuverable vessel may evade a torpedo spread more easily.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.890
With that in mind, aircraft carriers and battleships should be priority targets for torpedo bombers.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.220
An attack on a ship that has powerful antiaircraft armaments may result in heavy casualties.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.200
A good idea would be to send several striking squadrons against such ships.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.280
Seasoned players prefer using area attacks.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.570
Press and hold Alt to switch the reticle mode.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.980
Now you may launch torpedoes at any arbitrary point on the map.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.600
This mode gives you the advantage of a smaller spread

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.020
and the ability to attack from a close distance,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.930
making it difficult for the enemy to take evasive action.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.180
On the other hand, you will have to calculate the target lead yourself.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.080
If you order a launch over an island, the torpedoes will fall to the ground.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.450
If the distance to the target is too small,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.420
the torpedo fuses will not be able to arm and detonate upon impact.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.840
Another efficient trick is to put your adversary between the devil and the deep blue sea.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.680
Increase your chance of hitting an enemy ship by attacking it from two sides simultaneously

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.150
with two torpedo bomber squadrons flying at approximately 90 degrees to each other.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.900
While the enemy maneuvers trying to evade one salvo,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.950
it will most certainly get struck by the other.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.220
The reticle of dive bombers looks a little different.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.960
It has the same circle as torpedo bombers,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.240
but the effective area is marked by a bright green oval.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.130
This type of aircraft has an advantage when attacking a ship from bow or stern,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.690
maximizing the chance of hitting the target.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.590
Remember that controlling your aim during an attack is still very important

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.030
as the enemy might take evasive action to escape the bombing area.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.060
In addition to the damage dealt by explosions, bombs may cause fires.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.340
You may increase the efficiency of your attacks, as well as other ships' characteristics,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.400
by installing additional equipment available in the Port.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.870
Stay tuned for the next episode to learn more about it.
