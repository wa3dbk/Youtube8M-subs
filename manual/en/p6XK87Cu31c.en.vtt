Hey guys, this is Spencer,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.120
and I just got an ocarina here,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.460
basically this is a Songbird Ocarina, but I got it from Amazon, but you can basically get it at 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.309
songbirdocarinas.com.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.480
It has six holes:

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.589
four in the front,

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.189
two in the back.

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.189
It plays in the key of C. In fact, the lowest note you can play &lt;lowest note&gt;

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.289
is the C.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.479
Its quite a nice instrument, ceramic,

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.870
handmade,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.650
and he comes with several books and it's 45 dollars.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.450
This is a Zelda Songbook that is included

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.710
and also there's a little

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.900
song sheet right here that has several songs as well.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.350
It's quite nice,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.260
six holes,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.260
a scale would be like this: &lt;Plays C scale&gt;

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.630
and the ending note is actually a C.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.670
and also it can play a D and an E after that.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.670
Now I am going to play some songs for you.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.429
These are three songs, and they are all in the songbook.

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:40.519
They're very easy to play, it's very noob-friendly.

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.689
So, in my opinion, if you were to get this for a Zelda fan, it would definitely be worth it. 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.639
Alright, see you! Thank you for watching the video.
