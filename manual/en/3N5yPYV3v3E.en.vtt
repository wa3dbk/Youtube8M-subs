For Expert Village, I'm EJ John Erickson with
Vital Flame Productions and thank you for

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.180
joining us on our sessions focusing on the
baritone saxophone. Okay, in this session

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.300
we're going to start making noise. Finally,
lots of noise. So, I mean the first thing

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.500
you should do without even knowing any technique
or anything else, is just put the thing in

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.320
your mouth and try making noise. Put your
teeth on the top of the mouthpiece and just

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.369
try and make duck noises if you can. I mean
you just want to start doing that anyway.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.570
Now, let's talk about maybe a little bit of
technique to do that correctly. So everything

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.280
that you generate is with your breath. So,
one thing you want to do when you're breathing,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.550
breathing is important, obviously you want
a big breath for a saxophone, especially a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.670
Bari even more, is when you breathe in, if
you raised your shoulders, you're breathing

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.620
incorrectly. You want to breathe through your
diaphragm. So down up, think, like that. So

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.769
big breathe in. And then, what you're going
to do for your support is you want to kind

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.160
of tighten up your tummy. So, if I hit on
my tummy, I should be nice and smooth and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.070
my speaking, while I'm talking that's because
I'm forcing the muscle of my diaphragm out

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.690
so that it's nice and tight and firm and supported.
If I'm not doing that then and it's not supported,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.290
you'll start hearing that kind of sound. So,
nice, supported, firm breath. Now, we're bringing

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.780
the mouthpiece up to our mouth, our embouchure.
What do you do? The word is embouchure. So

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.150
O. So, you want to think O. O and its corners
tight. And it's this corner of your mouth

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.670
and this corner of your mouth are tight into
the middle as much as possible. You don't

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.210
leave your lips up here, you still bring them
in nice and tight, but you're making an O,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.000
so you'd talk like this. One of the things
for lifting weights you can do to develop

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.081
those corner muscles, which will take time,
is you can use a pencil. And you and do that

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:59.130
while you're driving in the car to build your
muscles up. So when you're ready to put your

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.290
on the mouthpiece, you actually want your
teeth to rest on the top of the mouthpiece

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.920
and you bring this in a lot. A lot of people
when they first start to play, they want to

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:18.681
kind of get on the end here. Don't. Shove
that mouthpiece in. Get the O and you can

00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:26.420
do that all day long and wife and kids and
friends will love you. If you want to have

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.530
fun putting your finger in the end and changing
the pitch, you can do that too. But you want

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.850
a nice, strong, solid sound. That will not
change when we put it on the Bari. Let's do

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.150
that.
