hey guys Joe Kistel here wanted to make this
quick video because doing this was a life

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.510
saver for me. I recently got laptop with a
high definition 4 k resolution screen so i

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.020
was real excited about it This laptop was
primarily to use Adobe Production cs6 the

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.530
computer is an awesome computer thought it
works well its a Toshiba W 50 Tecra model

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:30.619
fantastic machine awesome display and so i
went ahead installed my Adobe Suite and went

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.739
ahead to play around in Photoshop and opened
it up and this is what i got and as you can

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:46.480
see it is super douper tiny and um i cant
work with this and so I was like ok whats

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.260
the big deal whats going on here did i install
something wrong bla bla bla so of course i

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.000
went to the internets and found out that for
whatever reason Adobe with high definition

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.399
laptop displays seems to be somewhat problematic
fortunately i came across a website by Dan

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.639
Antenelli and he went through step by step
on a way to fix it and i'm just going to show

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:14.689
you that process how i did it and again a
big thanks to Dan I'm going to leave a link

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.569
to his webpage that shows by step in text
form. we have to do two things here we have

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:29.289
to go down and make a windows registry file
i guess is what you would call it and then

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:35.959
we have to go head and manifest file and stick
in the folder where our application is. now

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.499
i am going to show this demonstration for
Photoshop but this actually works for all

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:46.219
the applications you see here or all the Adobe
applications. so here we go first step we

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.380
want to go windows button and R and that's
going to bring up our run and you want to

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:05.509
type in r e g e d i t hit OK and you are going
to say yes right click machine were going

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:14.710
to go to software and then we are going to
go to Microsoft and then once we are in Microsoft

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:24.470
we want to go to Windows looking for windows
that is a w windows and then we want to go

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.610
to current version right here and then we
want to go to side by side which is right

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.390
here now we want to right click OK we want
to go new and we want to go d word 32 bit

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:56.270
and OK now here we have to type in prefer
external manifest OK then we want to hit enter

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.720
that's there OK now we have to go ahead and
right click on that click modify want to change

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.670
this value from zero to one click on decimal
so we want to close this out . OK so now we

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.770
need to do is make a manifest file and place
it in the program folder where the application

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:27.310
is so basically how this works is this here
is some text that you want to make a manifest

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.750
file out of so you go to file save as ok and
here is the trick we want to name this the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.010
same exact thing as the executable file for
our adobe applications so we are working with

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.710
Photoshop so we are going to go Photoshop
you can see i have it in there already dot

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:58.720
e x e dot manifest OK and we are going to
go save OK then we can close this out now

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.430
we have made our manifest file OK and here
it is right here so now what we need to do

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.420
we need to go into basically our program files
and click on Adobe to find the application

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.319
so we want to find out where that executable
file is so we are going to click on here and

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:27.580
then scroll down to see if that executable
file is in there and sure enough there it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:37.460
is OK so you can see we have our Photoshop
file here we want to go ahead and copy copy

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:50.270
our manifest file into here so were going
to right click paste it and then hit continue

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.710
OK so now you can see our manifest file is
right underneath the Photoshop file and if

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:04.039
we did everything right if we now open up
Photoshop look at that it is normal people

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.259
human being size so i am pretty stoked about
it and a big thanks to Dan again for this

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.189
now that is just i just showed how to do Photoshop
now what you do with the other programs as

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.919
well you would need to do this for all of
these for example Premiere Pro you want to

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:28.330
go into here and as you can see down here
i have got a copy of a manifest file as well

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.020
so it works for those so you need to that
for every Adobe application and again all

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.340
you have to do to make that file is just go
to the text file and then rename it to the

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:48.770
exact same name as the executable Adobe program
and then copy and paste that file into the

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:55.169
same folder that the executable program file
is in thanks for watching guys if you thought
