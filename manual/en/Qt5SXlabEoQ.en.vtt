(Intro) This Christmas we hypnotised people to bring back the joy of the holiday season

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.000
But first we needed the perfect candidates…

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.500
(Hypnotist) Is that a strange feeling? - sleep, just relax all the way down

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:42.000
You will find that when that hand touches your head you will fall into a deeper sleep. 
Let go you have nothing to do now

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500
(CASTING) We tested all forms of Christmas emotions

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.800

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.500
(Hypnotist) When I touch you on the shoulder you will get these off your head and you will feel incredible 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000

(THE SHOOT) The cast are hypnotised again to believe that they are children on Christmas morning…

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And we created some more hypnotic thoughts for fun

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
(Hypnotist) One, two, wide awake

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500

(Hypnotist) You will feel an overwhelming sense of jealousy and anger

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
When I clap my hands you will all shout for joy

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And sleep - SLEEP.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.500
Stay exactly where you are right now. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.900

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
(ENJOY!) Watch the magic
