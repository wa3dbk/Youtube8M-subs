I'm Curt Parker, telling the continuing story of Penn State and the surrounding community.

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:13.999
This is In Motion.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:22.101
Now that March is upon us, one question begs to be asked. Have you made good on your resolution to get into shape?

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:27.066
For many people who had made pacts to eat less and exercise more, the promises

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:33.446
and determination have fallen by the wayside. Many give up, and succumb to so-called quick fix remedies

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:39.047
such as pills, restrictive diets, or gadgets supposedly designed to melt the pounds away.

00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:43.277
Beyond all the fodder that litters the landscape of what is called the diet industry,

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:49.488
there's one tried and true simple fact: to lose weight, your caloric solution at the end of the day

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:55.036
must be in the negative. Simply put, burn more calories than you take in.

00:00:55.036 --> 00:01:00.072
While there are many different eating plans on the market, most depend on eating only certain foods

00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:06.075
and restricting the amount of calories taken in. In both cases, satiety, or the sensation of fullness

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:11.081
may not be reached, thus making it difficult to maintain any diet.

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:17.088
Penn State researcher Dr. Barbara Rolls has been studying satiety and the types of foods that cause it.

00:01:17.088 --> 00:01:23.862
Well, the components of foods that affect satiety, or that feeling of fullness that you get at the end of a meal,

00:01:23.862 --> 00:01:31.102
are the energy or calorie density. Because, you get good satisfying portions of food.

00:01:31.102 --> 00:01:36.543
Surprisingly, we've found and others have found that over a day or two people tend to eat a pretty consistent weight

00:01:36.543 --> 00:01:44.985
or volume of food. So, if you lower the energy density you can have a full plate of food without very many calories

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:53.789
and that appears to be really important for weight management. The other components are the protein

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.629
content, calorie for calorie we think that lean protein is more satisfying than carbohydrates or fat.

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:09.112
And the other important component for feeling full is the fiber content. High fiber foods have

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:12.982
been shown to help with hunger control and to help with weight management.

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:17.187
So basically this boils down to eating more fruits and vegetables.

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:24.474
According to her research, Dr. Rolls found out that lowering the energy density or calories per gram in food

00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:30.948
would allow enough food to be consumed for satiety to be reached, which means fewer calories are consumed.

00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:36.054
She synthesized these findings into her new book, The Volumetrics Eating Plan.

00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:43.328
The new book, The Volumetrics Eating Plan, is really a consumer friendly, practical guide, step-by-step,

00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:49.702
here is how you manage you weight. And it's based on the dietary guidelines the Institute of Medicine reports.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:55.651
So it's not a gimmick, this is me telling you in a rateable form how to do it.

00:02:55.651 --> 00:03:02.493
The plan works like this--by simply taking every day foods, such as pancakes, for instance, and extracting some of the

00:03:02.493 --> 00:03:10.267
high, energy-dense ingredients, such as syrup, and white flour, and replacing it with whole wheat flour, rasperry sauce, and fruit,

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:17.680
a higher volume of food is eaten while the caloric intake is lowered. Her plan is stocked with useable alternatives

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.023
to the common energy dense choices that many of us make every day.

00:03:22.023 --> 00:03:29.187
It's very easy to overeat high energy density foods, those are the foods that pack a lot of calories into a portion

00:03:29.187 --> 00:03:37.080
and typically they're high fat foods; fat has nine calories per gram whereas carbohydrates and protein have just four.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.615
But the other thing that really can affect the calorie density, in fact has the biggest impact on calorie

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:52.118
density and on the portions of food that we eat is the water content. Water is the biggest component of food, and

00:03:52.118 --> 00:04:03.069
because it adds weight, and volume, and no calories, it lowers the calorie density. So if you bulk on foods with high water content

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.242
foods, like fruits and vegetables, you get a much bigger portion for the same number of calories.

00:04:09.242 --> 00:04:16.520
Dr. Rolls is one of the many researchers around the country that are fighting the epidemic of obesity: an epidemic that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.219
now endangers more than just adults.

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:25.493
We are in the midst of an epidemic of obesity, it's really quite frightening to those of us who have worked in

00:04:25.493 --> 00:04:33.636
this field for a number of years, because the kids are really becoming obese at an alarming rate, starting

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:45.114
at frightening ages. Age eight, we're seeing obese kids, by early teens we're seeing kids with diabetes, heart disease.

00:04:45.114 --> 00:04:56.160
So we need to be responsible. As parents we need to set an example to our kids and eat a good balance of nutritious foods.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.109
