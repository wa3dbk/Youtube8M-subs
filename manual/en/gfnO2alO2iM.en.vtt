00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Scald

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.520
hello, from Mütevazi Lezzetler kitchen with love and respects 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.360
in this section we have a sweety recipe which is consumed in blessed Ramazan month after  breaking a fast... 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.080
a pretty light sweety 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.080
its name is "Scald" 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.000
but firstly we learn the ingredients, then start cooking

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.760
3 glasses of milk 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.800
1 bowl of curd cheese without salt (approximately 250 grams) 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.880
1 egg 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.800
1 teaglass of wheat starch 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
1 teaglass of riceflour 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.040
1 glass of granulated sugar 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.040
grated peel of 1 lemon 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.920
1 pocket of vanilla 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.080
to pour over; 1 tablespoon of saltless butter 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.920
and 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.480
after learning the ingredients we can start cooking "scald" 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.600
firstly we transfer the saltless curd cheese to a container 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.400
we add the half of the milk on it 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.080
we mix until the curd cheese loses its shape 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.000
now we can add the sugar... 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.120
and the egg 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
we mix for a short time 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.040
now we add the riceflour... 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.960
and the wheat starch 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
mix for a short time more again 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.200
as you remember we have used the half of the milk 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.680
now we add the remain milk... 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.960
the peel grated of lemon, that will provide freshness 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.680
and vanilla 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.480
we obtained a nice mixture 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480
now we shall take the mixer 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.240
and transfer the mixture to a oven container like this 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.640
by the way we have started to heat the oven at 200 degrees

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.200
we melted the butter without burning it 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440
and we pour over 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.160
after the butter we sprinkle the powdered sugar and the butter provides the sugar stick 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.720
we sprinkle it to be light 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.240
now we give the sweety to the hot oven 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.800
we bake at least for 15 minutes 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.520
after that we turn on only the above part of the oven 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.480
and we cook until it turns red
 
42 
00:04:04,880 --&gt; 00:04:07,880 
"scald" has pretty burned 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.600
we will put it into fridge when it comes to the room temperature 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.000
and wait 1 nigth, then service 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.520
the day later 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720
"scald" waited in the fridge for a nigth 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.400
we take the sides like this 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.520
and chop in square shape 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.880
we take by the help of a spatula, always we forced for the first square 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.480
leave this such a side, take the second 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.520
anyway one slice is never enough 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.720
let's leave the second near the first 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.440
a wonderful breaking fast sweet 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.560
yes another taste from the kitchen Mütevazi Lezzetler 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.080
"scald" 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.080
as you see it is fresh sweety 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.480
i wish you try in Ramazan and remember us 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.920
