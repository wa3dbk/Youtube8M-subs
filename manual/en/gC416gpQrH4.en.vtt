JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey, it's Jacob.

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.924
Every day we bring you guys
the best videos around.

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:06.840
Today we got Dude Perfect
in Rio, a pigeon's worst

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.580
nightmare--

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.530
-I'm faster than you.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.280
JACOB SOBOROFF: And
Vsauce hits a billion.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.465
-That's amazing.

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:14.102
-Hi, I'm your first
black girlfriend.

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:18.980
-No, way, dude.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.480
He fell.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.864
He dove.

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:22.780
JACOB SOBOROFF: Dude
Perfect made it to Brazil

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.545
for the World Cup.

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:25.086
But instead of trick
shots, this time

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:26.260
they're throwing red cards.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.870
And their flopping
skills are on par

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.953
with anything we've seen
so far in the tournament.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:30.836
-Hey, I need a medic!

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:31.336
Medic!

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:33.332
He's hurt!

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:33.834
-I'm sorry!

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.500
JACOB SOBOROFF: They're
even handing out

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.420
penalties for beach
fashion infractions.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.920
-What's your name?

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.920
-Agusto.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.420
-Agusto?

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.702
That's a lot of Agusto for me.

00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:43.201
-Yeah.

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:43.967
Mucho Agusto.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:44.550
-Mucho Agusto!

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.150
JACOB SOBOROFF: If you want more
World Cup videos, the sports

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.770
channel, The Whistle,
is down in Brazil

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.900
with the Dude Perfect crew.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.441
They're posting a
ton of great stuff.

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:52.480
Check out the link
in the description.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.980
MIKE FALZONE:
Everyone here has been

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.146
talking about the World Cup.

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:56.580
Hey, Mike, offsides.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.160
Look out in the corner
he's taking that kick from.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.850
Stop.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.500
It's Wimbledon season, baby.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.360
Historically, pigeons
have been all up

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.000
in Wimbledon's business,
until Rufus showed up.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.430
-I've been a member of
Wimbledon security for 14 years.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.098
I wake up at 5:00 AM every
day to patrol the grounds.

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:14.640
I am an athlete.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.140
MIKE FALZONE: This is one of
the newest videos from Stella's

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.890
Perfectionist series,
which has recently

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.180
been taking a look at
the men, women, and birds

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.800
behind the scenes at Wimbledon.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.730
-I don't mind what
you do, as long

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.421
as you don't do it on my turf.

00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:28.920
MIKE FALZONE: Real quick, if
there are any pigeons watching,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.477
Rufus is a lot like Liam
Neeson's character in "Taken,"

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:33.560
so if you're thinking about
flying over to England

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.677
and watching some
tennis, umm, don't.

00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:39.010
JACOB SOBOROFF: Hip hop may
have been born in the Bronx,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.380
but Pierce Freelon
and Apple Juice Kid

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.060
took beat making back to
its rhythmic home-- Africa.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.160
Beat Making Lab is a
series that follows the duo

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
around the world as they
collaborate with locals

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.076
and teach them the basics
of music production.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:53.170
-Our goal here in the Congo was
to create a sustainable studio,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.740
and the training
for these kids to be

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.952
able to make their own beats.

00:02:04.954 --> 00:02:06.370
JACOB SOBOROFF:
The series travels

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.949
to places like Panama,
Senegal, and Ethiopia.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.300
Head on over to their
channel for more.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.360
Vsauce, the kings of
making information fun,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.781
just crossed a billion views.

00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.280
And to celebrate,
earlier this week,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.190
they threw a party
at YouTube Space LA.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.640
We stopped by to congratulate
them and find out

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.556
what's coming up next.

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:21.450
-Hey, YouTube Nation.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.540
We are from the network of
YouTube channels, Vsauce.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.540
We are here in the
YouTube Space LA

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.985
to celebrate a billion total
views across all of our videos.

00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:30.610
That's amazing.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.447
We have an Albert
Einstein impersonator.

00:02:32.447 --> 00:02:33.780
-Benjamin Franklin impersonator.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.270
-Giant video of myself
playing at all times.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.635
-And we have food.

00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:38.673
Do you guys like food?

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.780
Coming up on Vsauce Two, you'll
see more exciting science

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.724
and technology news.

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:48.890
-Vsauce Three, I'm doing a
video about "Watch Dogs,"

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.960
the video game, and
if you could actually

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.135
hack in real life the
way you can in the game.

00:02:52.135 --> 00:02:53.260
-Vsauce One, you know what?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.390
I've got a lot of really neat
collaborations coming out.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.510
I don't want to
spoil all of them.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.510
But Derek from Veritasium
is already here.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.840
And we're working on
something right now.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.540
We couldn't have done all
of this without you guys.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.440
You make it possible.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.340
We do this for you.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.280
So let's end with our tagline.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.710
-And as always,
thanks for watching.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.580
JACOB SOBOROFF: A
billion views is crazy.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.600
Congratulations, guys.

00:03:12.647 --> 00:03:15.230
CARLY: Thank you so much for all
of your Woman Crush Wednesday

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.850
suggestions.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.570
We cannot wait to cover people
like Mamrie Hart and Mary

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.050
Doodles, but this week we're
all about Smoothiefreak.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.552
You may recognize Akilah
Hughes from her huge video

00:03:23.552 --> 00:03:25.010
"Meet Your First
Black Girlfriend,"

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.750
which has gotten
over a million views

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.230
since it was
uploaded in December.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.430
-You can get fried chicken.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.570
I don't care.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.280
That is not what ashy means.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.447
That's not what nappy means.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.571
CARLY: And if that's all
you know of Akilah Hughes,

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:36.950
you are in for quite the treat.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.590
She's a comedian,
actress, vlogger, blogger.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.840
She's been featured everywhere
from Huffington Post

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.380
to HelloGiggles,
where she's also

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.660
a contributor and columnist.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.360
And if you ever have
questions about how

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.920
to bake lonely
Christmas cookies,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.170
Smoothiefreak has you covered.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.540
-This is half the heart
that I have left now.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.450
You can also make it into,
you know, future shapes,

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.040
like all the cats
that you're going

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.790
to have when you get
older, because you're

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.550
going to die alone.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.190
CARLY: If you want
to know more Akilah,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.404
our very own Angela did
an amazing blog post

00:04:02.404 --> 00:04:04.570
about her, which includes
an interview with the very

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.170
funny lady.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.460
The link is here and also
attached in the description.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.860
JACOB SOBOROFF:
Akilah's actually

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.693
stopping in soon to
talk about her new video

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:11.130
and to drop a love
note of her own

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.340
for the next Woman
Crush Wednesday.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.548
Who are you guys crushing on?

00:04:13.548 --> 00:04:15.621
Let us know below
by using the #WCW.

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.079
Are you guys going
to be at VidCon?

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:17.959
We're going to be
there on Thursday

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.940
shooting an episode of the show,
so be sure to stop by and say,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.440
what's up?

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.369
Now play us out, Grouplove.

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:24.819

 YOU"]
