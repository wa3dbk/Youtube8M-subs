00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.940
The moon is old - at least, it looks old,
since its entire surface is strewn with the

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.860
rubble of broken down rock and pockmarked
with scars from ancient asteroid impacts.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.309
We know that rocks weather here on Earth too,
and that meteorites have made some considerable

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.090
dents over the years, but today Earth looks
reasonably fresh and new without widespread

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.090
craters.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.830
Earth owes its youthful appearance to the
fact that its outermost layer is constantly

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.529
renewing itself - hiding its age.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.580
New rock spills onto the planet's surface
from the mouths of volcanoes; magma is released

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.750
at the seams of ocean floors and cools to
become part of those floors; rocks metamorphose

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.750
(and mountains form) when continents collide;
and the sea floor is recycled as continents

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.829
ride over it.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.130
The process of remaking rock doesn't just
make it look young, it makes it young - at

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.379
least, to us, because our best tool to date
rocks is to measure the amount of decay of

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.789
certain radioactive elements in the rocks.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.260
And when rocks melt and reform anew, all evidence
of that decay is destroyed.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.710
Normally this is great, because it means rocks
carry around a record of their age - the time

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.710
since they formed.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.970
For example, we can tell that ocean floors
are spreading because their rocks are youngest

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.770
near mid-ocean ridges and get progressively
older as you head towards land, where they're

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.260
often recycled by sinking under continents.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.470
However, because the earth remakes its rock
so much, and because remaking rocks resets

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.270
their built-in clocks, it's hard to look really
really far back into our planet's history

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.270
- most of the first solid rocks that formed
ages ago on Earth's fiery surface have probably

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.230
long since been remade.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.250
That's where a resilient little mineral called
zircon comes in.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.370
Zircon is similar to quartz, both in its chemical
structure and in its durability, so it sticks

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.310
around a long time after other minerals weather
away.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.130
But zircon also has two things quartz doesn't:
zirconium, which gives it its name, and small

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.760
traces of radioactive uranium.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.610
Uranium atoms are similar enough to zirconium
that they can occasionally slip into the mineral's

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.730
crystal lattice in zirconium's place, but
unlike zirconium, the unstable uranium atoms

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.880
eventually radioactively decay into lead atoms.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.770
Which is weird, because lead isn't similar
to zirconium, and so would never have ended

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.459
up in a zircon crystal on its own - so the
more lead you find in a zircon crystal, the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.890
older it is.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.739
And one of the oldest terrestrial minerals
ever found, quite possibly the oldest piece

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.200
of the earth we know of, happens to be a very
lead-filled grain of zircon found embedded

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.069
in sandstone in Western Australia.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.769
Somehow, this crystal has managed to escape
destruction by erosion and volcanic eruptions

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.579
and asteroid impacts over the millennia, and
while we don't know whether it formed in the

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.860
very first rock on Earth, if it didn't then
by definition the first rock must be even

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.860
older.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.239
So despite earth's best efforts to hide its
age from us, uranium-lead dating of little

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.799
bits of zircon tells us our planet formed
at least 4.4 billion years ago.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.980
There's also other evidence from meteorites
that suggests the earth is even older, but

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.749
at bare minimum, this zircon lets us say with
confidence that the earth is literally older

00:02:51.749 --> 00:03:18.620
than dirt.
