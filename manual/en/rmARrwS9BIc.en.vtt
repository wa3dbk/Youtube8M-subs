00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.939
Hi I'm Steve Owens, welcome to Steve's Kitchen, today we're making potato skin

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:06.710
chips not the soggy sort that you have
served in a bowl

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.170
these ones are crispy they are delicious
and they stand alone with a wonderful

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.559
dip

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.559
let me show you how I'm going to make them

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.119
Now I have four large russet potatoes
here

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.050
and I'm just going to puncture them with a
fork, now you could use any potato that's

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.320
suitable for french fries

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.489
just going to put a couple of holes in there to release the pressure as they cook

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.670
I'm  then going to take a paper towel

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.140
wrap it around, now these are little bit
larger potatoes so I'm gonna pop these

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.500
in a thousand watt microwave on full
power

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.210
for about 10 minutes just to get the
cooking process started

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.860
now when they come

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.710
out of the microwave they'll be very hot we're just going to take the paper towels off

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.350
I'm now just going to pop these in an oven
at 180 degrees Celsius that's 350 fahrenheit

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.010
for twenty minutes to finish off the
cooking process

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.440
now whilst our baked potatoes are cooking I'm just going to take about a cup

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.940
of sour cream I'm going to make a simple
dip to go with our potatoes

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.280
just pop that in the bowl and into that
I'm going to add about a quarter cup of a nice

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.080
sharp cheddar cheese which I've

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.740
finely grated and then some chives fresh from the garden

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.810
I'm just going to chop these chives up
nice and fine

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.200
we'll just pop those in there as well a
little bit of seasoning with some pepper

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.990
and salt

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.850
and we'll just keep this a mix through

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.280
give it a little taste and adjust the
seasoning

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.450
and then we'll just move this into a smaller
bowl

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.820
and set it aside ready to go with our potato skin chips

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.399
now when those baked potatoes come out of the oven they going to have a nice

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.289
little crispy skin on them but we need
to leave them to cool down for about half

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.240
an hour until they can be handled

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.780
now our potatoes have cooled down they're not completely cool but I'm just going to cut

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.530
these in half

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.550
on the long edge like that and then what
we going to do either using a

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.180
ice cream scoop I actually prefer to use
a spoon we're just going to scoop out

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.000
the flesh

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.070
and try to get close to the skin without
damaging it

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.090
and try to keep this flesh in one
piece because we're going to use this

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.420
for another little recipe

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.780
so I've scooped the flesh out now and don't
forget we're going to use this to make a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.110
wonderful little potato salad once it's
cooled down

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.180
and with these halves now I'm going to
cut these into quarters

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.500
and then we're just going to take those
potato skins and put them in a baking

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.060
tray you could also put these onto a
cookie sheet

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.580
and I should point out that we laid
these skin side down flesh side up

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.310
now we want to season this side of the
potatoes I'm going to be putting pepper

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.780
I'm also going to be putting salt on to these

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.459
and I've got a little garlic salt and mixed
herbs which I'm just going to sprinkle

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.540
now you can put anything you like really
on at this point

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.920
if you want  a little bit of red chili on there
as well just to give it a hot

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.049
edge whatever are your favorite herbs and
then I'm going to drizzle some olive oil

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.049
little bit of extra virgin olive oil
over the top of these

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.560
Now our oven should be still hot but we want it back up to 180 or 350 degrees

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.250
Fahrenheit

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.370
we're going to pop these in there and let them roast off for 30 minutes

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.930
now remember the potato flesh we're not
going to waste this either

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.220
I just want you to get the largest
pieces out of here  cut them up

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.290
into little cubes and we'll  pop those
into a little mixing bowl

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.390
so our potato pieces and diced up there I've got a little white onion here I'm just going to

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.060
finely chop this up

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.610
and pop that in there some finely
chopped chives just to add some color

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.769
and flavor

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.079
I'm just going to drizzle some extra virgin
olive oil over there as well

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.969
couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.719
and now we have to season this with
plenty of salt

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.810
and black pepper

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.389
and then gently fold that together try
not to break the potato too much up

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.430
and there we have it and there you have
it we have a  lovely course potato salad to

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.599
serve  with our  potato skin chips

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.719
now will you look at those they've just come out of the oven and they are piping hot

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.569
I need them to cool down now they'll look
like they're cook after just 20 minutes but

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.439
trust me to let them go the full way

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.459
and the reason we haven't put cheese
over these or anything is because we want

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.799
them to crisp up we can cheese them up
afterwards

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.120
now serve these up with your sour cream
dip and your potato salad you've got a

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.930
whole meal

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.520
and look at these don't they look great and I can tell you they're not like a normal

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.509
potato skin

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.660
they're really crisp here I'll take a little
bit of dip here you can see how strong

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.250
that is

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.830
listen to this my goodness they are
fantastic

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.039
absolutely delicious you could make
these as spicy as you want you could even add a little

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.729
sugar on there if you wanted to sweeten it 
up slightly

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.809
they are great give them a try, please share the love, give this one a thumbs-up
