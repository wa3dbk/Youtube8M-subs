00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.520
For most women shopping is our favorite past
time but when it comes to shopping for a bra,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.910
I'd rather have a root canal.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.320
With 70% of women wearing the wrong bra, now
wonder there is so much frustration.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.730
Here to show us how to bust loose from our
bust blues is style expert Alison Deyette.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:38.620
Well women don't realize that as exciting
as it is to lose weight through exercise,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.710
your breast size changes.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:49.370
Same goes for pregnancy, weight gain, weight
loss, gravity and age but all of those are

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.210
factors in what can change the breast size
and shape.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.150
The fit can also be very wrong.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:07.820
They change very often, so we found two women
who were having bra fit issues.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.260
Brooke was 34B pre pregnancy but then she
went through the breast feeding and this is

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.670
what she has now.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:31.600
She's drooping and sagging so let's see the
proper fitting bra now.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:40.010
This is from Bali, One Smooth U Side Support
for 36 dollars.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:48.280
National retailers carry it, she gets full
coverage, the lift and support she needs and

00:01:48.280 --> 00:02:03.150
it is virtually smooth underneath her clothes.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.400
It's pretty too because when you are a little
more curvy you don't want to feel like you're

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.810
wearing a grandma's bra.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:24.780
Also you got cleavage so the husband may be
saying to put the baby to bed early.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.469
You can literally give the illusion of losing
ten pounds if you are wearing the right bra.

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.469
Thanks Brooke.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.069
Now let's take a look at Kim.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.700
Kim had a drawer full of bras that were all
the wrong size.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.349
She had been doing cardio and was really excited
about losing weight and being fit but then

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.620
she realized that she is no longer a B cup.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:04.120
As we see, she has a swimmers body which happens
and went down a size, so I said we can get

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.449
you lift and support and a little cleavage
so Kim come on out!

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:22.359
Such a dramatic difference, this is the Barely
There Balconette bra which is giving her lift

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:36.340
and frame, almost reminds me of the Victorian
age when it lifts you up.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.269
Her before bra was flattening her but now
she has lift, a flexible frame and it is pretty.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.349
I like this topic!

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.469
No one talks about making us look good under
the clothing!

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.469
Right?

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:57.980
I always say that that is the first step,
I take people shopping and I have to see their

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.459
body shape so they take their clothes off
and I often say we have to first go bra shopping

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.519
to make sure that the clothes we put on top
look great.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.889
I grew up with the best designers and the
first thing they did was foundation.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:40.870
It is important to have that shape 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:05:27.260
underneath 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:06:03.610
the clothing 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:21.450
and it 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:44.210
is 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:08:02.780
also important in making you feel good.
