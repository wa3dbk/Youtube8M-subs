[Trevor Paglen: Power &amp; Perspective]

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.880
[Griffin Editions, Photography Printing Studio]

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.600
--[PAGLEN] We can just put them over here,
if you...

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.500
--[MAN] Okay.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.000
[PAGLEN] Yeah, there's a little bit of drama
around this picture.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.160
We called up the NSA and said,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.390
"We're going to fly a helicopter over your
headquarters—take pictures."

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.309
Which is perfectly legal.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.629
They said, "We don't want you to do that."

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.390
We said, "Well, we're not asking permission,"

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
"we're just telling you that we're doing this—and
don't shoot us!"

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.899
And the NSA sent a bunch of guys—I think
seven guys—

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.019
and posted them up at all different places
in the airport to watch this flight.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.440
And I think they were making phone calls to
the headquarters,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.329
having certain lights turned on and off.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.010
The woman who owns the helicopter had baked
a bunch of brownies,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.859
and was actually driving around the little
airport,

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.179
like, playing "spot the NSA guys" and, like,
feeding them brownies.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.860
One of the reasons why you typically actually
don't see photographs of the NSA headquarters

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.070
is because it's surrounded by trees.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.360
[NSA Headquarters, public domain image]

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.480
There's only a couple of photographs, and
they're the couple that everybody uses.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.300
--[MAN] I'm going to load this up.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.980
--[PAGLEN] Okay.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.240
[PAGLEN] I generally don't like these so-called
"bird's eye" or "God's eye" perspectives.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.960
That perspective implies a, kind of, mastery
over something.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.200
It implies that perhaps you can see this,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.420
and that it's transparent and we can understand it,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.500
and this is a, kind of, insignificant thing
which is on the ground below us.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380
[Mike Vorrasi, Senior Retoucher]

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.790
--[PAGLEN] Whoa! [LAUGHS]

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.100
--[VORRASI] So this is just me trying to do
some...

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.910
--[PAGLEN] What have you got going on there!?

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.990
--[VORRASI] So the red channel was really
bright,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.460
--so I was just, sort of, just blending in
the blue channel a little bit.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.060
--And the same with the blue.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.450
--The blue was a little heavy, so I just sort
of was blending back in to see,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.980
--then I was going to put that on a luminous.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.600
--[PAGLEN] The next one is your profile?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.120
--[VORRASI] Yeah, exactly.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.880
--[PAGLEN] That's either your profile...

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.620
--[VORRASI] That's in our profile right now.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.930
[PAGLEN] It does look like we're at a shopping
mall.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.909
It seems like a very, kind of, normal kind
of looking place.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.569
And I struggle with that, because on one hand,

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.560
the extent to which the NSA's tendrils are
in our everyday lives,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.680
perhaps this perspective is at odds with that.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.569
But what I like about the perspective in this
particular instance

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.239
is that it puts you in the situation where
we can look at a building like this and,

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.109
to some extent, perhaps imagine that in fact
these are civic institutions,

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.299
and that you, as a member of the public,

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.900
should be able to exert the same kind of power
over this institution

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.560
that we can symbolically do by looking at
a photograph shot from this perspective.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.620
--[PAGLEN] Cool, so we'll save some variations
on this one for next time,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.980
--and let's see, like, back on that Reaper
image...

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.260
--[VORRASI] Oh, yeah.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.380
--[MAN] You want that up there?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.120
[PAGLEN] This is about as big as it gets for
me.

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.420
There was only a couple of things that I've
done at this size.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.640
So, I was just shooting, like, directly into
the sun with the four-by-five camera.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.020
The idea for it actually came from a Turner
painting called "Angel in the Sun".

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.680
These drones are called Reapers, so this is
"The Reaper in the Sun".

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.360
--[PAGLEN] Cool. So this is the range of stuff
that we're looking at...

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.230
[PAGLEN] One of the advantages of using, like,
traditional kind of film

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.930
in a situation like that is that you can do
weird stuff

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.099
like over-expose a photograph, shooting directly
into the sun,

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.200
and still have some wiggle room--

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.599
have something to play with.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.379
--[PAGLEN] Like, I wonder if there's, like,
a magenta ring around here,

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.200
--or if it's just like my eyes doing stuff.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.680
--You know what I'm talking about?

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.439
--[VORRASI] Yeah.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.920
--[PAGLEN] Yeah, it's super weird!

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.720
[PAGLEN] We've done tons of stuff where we
put two prints right next to each other,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.389
and then we're like, "Oh, the one on the right.
Oh, it's cooler or whatever."

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.650
And then we'll shift them back over, and then
we're like,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.139
"Oh, the one on the right!" [LAUGHS]

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.879
--[VORRASI] Yeah, yeah! No, definitely.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.560
--Even, like, putting white magnets as opposed
to black magnets...

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.539
--So, I'm just, like, "If we could just cut
down on some variables, like,"

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.680
--"we can kind of concentrate on what is changing,
and how to, like, address those things."

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.780
[PAGLEN] In the sky, there traditionally is
a promise of, kind of, openness,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.200
or a kind of freedom.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.040
But the sky itself has been turned against us.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.040
The drone is just the punctuation mark.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.460
--[VORRASI] The drone looks great.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.240
--[PAGLEN] Yeah.
