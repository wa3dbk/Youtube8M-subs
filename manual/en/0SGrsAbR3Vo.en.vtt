00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.920
I believe in the power of images.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.590
I think I wouldn't be a photographer if I
didn't believe in the power of images.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.309
I think there's an immediacy to an image that
obviously text or writing doesn't have.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.429
They both are incredibly powerful tools but
they hit you at different moments.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:22.550
So an image that can speak to people really
can bring them to that place or transport

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.570
them to that moment of pain or that moment
of urgency or whatever that emotion is I'm

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.439
trying to convey in that image.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.820
I think that an image has the ability to take
the viewer there immediately.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.420
Sometimes I feel like a hunter like I feel
like I walk into a scene and I kind of the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.920
first thing I do is look at the light and
I figure out where is the light interesting?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.550
Where is the light source and where is it
falling?

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.170
And then I look at the expressions on people
and their faces and I'm trying to think about

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.660
what is the story I'm trying to tell or what
is the story that's being conveyed to me?

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.550
And then I have to look for details.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.350
I'm looking for sort of anything that might
be interesting or might sort of convey a message

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.090
and I often kind of circle around that scene
several times.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.790
So I'll look at from the front, from the side,
from the back.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.480
I'll go around it a few times and see how
the light changes, if it's backlit, if I'm

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.870
shooting straight on.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.690
And then often I'll shoot the hell out of
it.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.980
I mean I'll shoot it every which way I can.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.070
I'm kind of very unconventional on how I learned
to compose pictures.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.450
It was really trial and error.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.370
So for me I'm often trying to fit a certain
amount of information into a frame.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.310
I'm trying to tell a story with each picture.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.720
So that has a lot to do with how I compose
a picture.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.900
And then I'm trying to make it beautiful.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.250
Even if it's a horrible scene I'm trying to
sort of bring the viewer in and make them

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.250
interested.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.700
So I don't want to take something and make
it so horrendous or capture it in such a way

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.680
that the first thing they do is turn the page.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.200
I want to engage the viewer.
