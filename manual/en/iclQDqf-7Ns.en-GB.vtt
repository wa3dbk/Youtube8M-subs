00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.970
Let's face it, with the size and fragility
of phones these days they need protecting

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.460
from themselves which is why some form of
case is always recommended. But you want something

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.759
that's not going to inhibit or restrict the
phone in anyway and this is why the Official

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:24.160
Samsung Galaxy S Protective Cover + comes
may come in handy. Even if does have an incredibly

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.750
long name.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.500
Now with it being the official case it is
pretty pricey costing Â£15 or around $20,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.620
but what you guarantee with such a purchase
is that it will fit perfectly and it will

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.830
sport some nice official logos.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.710
This particular version of the case has black
trim that surrounds the the edge of the phone

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.760
while the back is comprised of a navy blue
colour with light blue logos. The case is

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.440
also available in pink, green, light blue,
and white.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.810
Putting the case on is an absolute doddle
as I'm showing you right here. The edges of

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.590
the case flex nicely enough to slot the phone
into position and then tightly wrap themselves

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.640
into the phone. It's a nice, snug fit with
zero chance of the phone popping out.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.810
And this is what the phone looks like with
the case on. The general impression is understated.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.910
Perhaps even a little boring. Other than a
slightly different colour scheme the phone

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.910
doesn't look any different. Crucially, however,
it certainly feels different.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.430
First of all the sides of the phone have a
nice rubbery texture to them which increases

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.550
grip but at the same time the phone doesn't
feel any bigger or fatter which is very important

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.650
consider this is already a beast of a phone.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.670
The phone feels as free and mobile as it would
do without a case. It doesn't get in the way

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.740
of how you would normally use the phone. As
I said earlier, it's understated and quietly

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.020
does its job.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.390
The back of the phone feels rock solid (or
at least as rock solid as hard plastic can

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.119
feel). I have already noticed a few scuffs
and scratches on the back so it does mark

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.890
easily but this texture is a million times
better than the rubbish backplate that comes

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.629
with the phone which is thin, flimsy and seems
to attract moisture for fun, making it a very

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.170
slippy surface.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.409
Now for a crucial aspect of the case. I have
mentioned before that I feel the power button

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:21.299
on the Galaxy S4 is too shallow and not sensitive
enough. Thankfully the Protective Cover Plus

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:27.079
case completely solves this issue, Power and
volume buttons are moulded into the case and

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.709
if we look on the inside of these buttons
they have rounded edges which focus the pressure

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.900
point directly onto the buttons. That means
that you can easily feel the tactile buttons

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.640
and when you press them they always register.
It might sound like a small detail, but you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.840
take stuff like this for granted and when
it's not done right, you really notice. Without

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.840
this case I was noticing it a lot.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.560
And of course, if the case is really easy
to put on, it's really easy to take off.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.720
So if you're looking for a case that does
all the importing things like protecting the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.010
phone without interfering with the way you
handle it and fixes that silly power button

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.819
issue, this is well worth purchasing. However,
if you're looking for something a little more

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:17.929
exciting and cheaper then stay tuned for more
case reviews in the near future.
