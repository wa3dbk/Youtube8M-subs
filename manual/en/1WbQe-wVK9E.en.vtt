00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.300
For the fifth straight month, the U.S. economy
lost jobs, 324,000 so far this year.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.690
Meltdown in the mortgage industry.
This is the biggest point drop that has ever

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.349
been seen in a day.
The worst financial collapse since the Great

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.519
Depression.
This is cataclysmic.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.070
American workers were laid off in numbers
not seen in over three decades.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.119
Whoever wins in November is going to come
into office in January facing a deep recession,

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.470
facing trillions of new liabilities.
This is a once in a half century, probably

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.470
once in a century, type of event.
Today I say to you that the challenges we

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.230
face are real, they are serious and they are
many. They will not be met easily, or in a

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.359
short span of time. But know this America:
they will be met.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.359
On the day Barack Obama took office, America
had already lost 4.4 million in jobs, an economic

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.059
disaster the worst in a generation. Some said
America's best days were behind us. But like

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.410
America, he dug deep, fought back and never
lost faith in our ability to meet the challenge.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.820
The president's stimulus plan saved up to
4.2 million jobs, including teachers, construction

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.490
workers, police and firefighters working to
build a stronger America. And when a flagship

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.240
of the American economy was going down, his
auto rescue forced companies and workers to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.060
retool and restructure, saving 1.1 million
jobs.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Today, since the first time since 2004, all
three U.S. automakers are operating at a profit.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.140
Don't bet against the American worker.
And now, instead of losing jobs, we're gaining

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.990
them. The first increase in manufacturing
jobs in a decade. And over the last 25 months,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.710
4.1 million new private sector jobs. And while
there's still more to do, there's been real

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.860
progress, because President Obama never stopped
believing in us, and fighting for us. He took

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.290
on the credit card companies, stopping unfair
fees and hidden penalties, took on the Wall

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.290
Street banks too, fighting for tough new reforms
to make sure they never again wreck our economy.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.550
He passed historic health reform, and now
insurance companies can't deny children coverage

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.920
for preexisting conditions. Seniors pay less
for prescriptions, contraception coverage

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.920
guaranteed, and by 2016, 32 million more Americans
will finally have health coverage. Wind and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.700
solar power has doubled. But that's not all.
Middle class taxes at historic lows, college

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.990
loans more affordable and easier to repay,
equal pay for women protected by a historic

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.990
new law, "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" history.
Hard work, determination, real results.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.069
But instead of working together to lift America
up, Republicans were waging a campaign to

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.120
tear the president down. Virtually every Republican
has decided to just say no to anything the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.380
president proposes.
Put me in the no column.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.340
Vote no.
Vote no.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.600
Republicans are getting a rap as the party
of no.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.459
Yesterday in the end, not a single Republican
voted for the bill, and apparently the relative

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.790
merits of the legislation had nothing to do
with it.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.000
Our top political priority over the next two
years should be to deny President Obama a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.660
second term.
And still he persevered, here at home and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.380
as commander-in-chief.
Over the last two years you've seen a depletion

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.020
of the senior bench for Al Qaeda.
Anwar Al-Awlaki has been killed.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.959
Another huge victory in the war on terror.
And then, there was the victory no one saw

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.959
coming.
Tonight, I can report to the American people

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.380
and to the world that the United States has
conducted an operation that killed Osama Bin

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.940
Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, and a terrorist
who is responsible for the murder of thousands

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.680
of innocent men, women and children.
This is truly one of those moments. People

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.680
will remember where they were when they heard
Osama Bin Laden is dead.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.639
And now, the war in Iraq is over.
Fore nearly nine years, our nation has been

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.639
at war in Iraq. So as your commander-in-chief,
and on behalf of a grateful nation, I'm proud

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:52.789
to finally say these two words: welcome home.
A promise kept by a president who understands

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.539
America's promise, who understands America's
greatness comes from a strong, secure middle

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.490
class. That's the America President Obama
believes in, and that's what he's fighting

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.490
for, every day.
This is a make or break moment for the middle

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.110
class, and for all those who are fighting
to get into the middle class, because what's

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.879
at stake is whether this will be a country
where working people can earn enough to raise

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:41.960
a family, build a modest savings, own a home,
secure their retirement. I believe this country

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.999
succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when
everyone does their fair share, when everyone

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:53.789
plays by the same rules. And I believe America
is on the way up. Thank you, God bless you,

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.929
God bless the United States of America.
