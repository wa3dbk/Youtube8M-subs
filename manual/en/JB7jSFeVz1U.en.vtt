00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.000
[Robert Winston]
It's amazing to consider that I'm holding in my hands

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.340
The place where someone once felt, thought, and loved

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.000
For centuries, scientists have been battling to understand

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.250
What this unappealing object is all about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
[Vilayanur Ramachandran]
Here is this mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.470
[Carl Sagan]
The brain has evolved from the inside out

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.000
Its structure reflects all the stages through which it has passed

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.240
[Jill Bolte Taylor]
Information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.000
Through all of our sensory systems

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.150
And then it explodes into this enormous collage

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.500
Of what this present moment looks like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What it feels like, and what it sounds like

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500
It explodes into this enormous collage

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.800
And in this moment we are perfect

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.000
We are whole and we are beautiful

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.600
[Robert Winston]
It appears rather gruesome

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.050
Wrinkled like a walnut, and with the consistency of mushroom

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.000
[Carl Sagan]
What we know is encoded in cells called neurons

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.400
And there are something like a hundred trillion neural connections

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.500
This intricate and marvelous network of neurons has been called

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.100
An enchanted loom

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.700
The neurons store sounds too, and snatches of music

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.000
Whole orchestras play inside our heads

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.650
20 million volumes worth of information

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.000
Is inside the heads of every one of us

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.100
The brain is a very big place in a very small space

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.660
[Jill Bolte Taylor]
Information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.050
Through all of our sensory systems

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.540
And then it explodes into this enormous collage

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.600
Of what this present moment looks like

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.000
What it feels like, and what it sounds like

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.900
[Carl Sagan]
No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we can change ourselves

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.500
Think of the possibilities

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.800
[Bill Nye]
Think of your brain as a newspaper

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.210
Think of all the information it can store

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.000
But it doesn't take up too much room because it's folded

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.550
[Oliver Sacks]
We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.000
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.600
[various]

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.400
[Jill Bolte Taylor]
And then it explodes into this enormous collage

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.000
And in this moment we are perfect

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.600
We are whole and we are beautiful

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.500
[Robert Winston]
It is the most mysterious part of the human body

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.000
And yet it dominates the way we live our adult lives

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.000
It is the brain.
