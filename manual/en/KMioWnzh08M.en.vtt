00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.889
davis wrote a recently wrote this great
piece about the public education system

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.429
and how some politicians and some
corporations are really fighting hard to

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.840
make sure that they can switch public
schools to try our schools

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.530
now charter schools are not private
schools are still publicly-funded

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.710
however they do not have uh... union
representation and uh... you know they

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.669
don't abide by the same rules that
certain public schools too

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.489
their companies like amazon and
microsoft that are really finding this

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.769
push for charter schools and a lot of
times when the media talks about this

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.019
they make it seem as though uh... you
know these corporations are doing it

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.260
because they're really want to case
reforming really care about the children

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.449
well-coached but is david sort of points
out perfectly of course it's all about

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.780
the money now cos like uh... amazon and
microsoft have tablets that they want to

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.010
sell to these school districts to these
charter schools of core

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.060
of course

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.660
all turns out they have a profit motive
why didn't see that coming huge profit

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.600
motive so

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.210
some might argue well cap public schools
signed contracts with these corporations

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.920
and you know do the same thing knelt
there are certain rules that prevent

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.530
public schools from signing contracts
with microsoft or amazon

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.249
but with charter schools as i've
mentioned they don't necessarily have to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:20.890
abide by the same rules so these cup
corporations are hoping that they can

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.149
cash out big time by getting these
charter school society's contracts and

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.200
by the way some might argue well
technology is good it's gonna improve

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.229
the education of these young people but
not so fast studies indicate that a lot

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.270
of these charter schools on average do
not perform better than our public

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.469
schools to so that i was really
surprised but it's not always assume

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.400
that the charter schools we're gonna do
that honestly

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.880
uh... and parties is that we've been
competition and i believe that he in

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.079
diversity so

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.930
if you ever want to give a speech trying
different ways

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.970
i thought that

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.610
the cream would rise to the top and you
see what works and what does it and that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.050
on average the charter schools would be
available schools dot was proven wrong

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.479
that's not what happened

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.359
but this story begins to explain

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.990
part of the reason why

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.310
because this is the reason why there is
some of the rooms not all the rules the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.790
some of the rules of the public schools
now we take away those

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.269
rose what winds up having trouble
schools

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.200
well these for bridges come in they go
by this by that by this by that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.520
forget the rules committee begin date
but it turns out the charter schools

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.780
wind up being totally inefficient

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.780
yes in fact the administrative costs
uh... are extremely high a relatively

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.910
speaking in charter schools

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.470
uh... so that's really a big problem in
david sort of points to that perfectly

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.680
but uh... of course i would berber doc
is also getting in on the action which i

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.370
thought was really interesting so let me
read you are a small part of davis read

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.929
this piece

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:47.119
he says the los angeles times reported
that music american eight donated a

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.520
quarter million dollars to the reform
slate

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.650
that's the same news america that is the
for-profit education technology arm of

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.250
rupert murdoch's newscorp it's the same
news america that was recently died

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.569
trumpeted by the new york times for
rolling out it's an expensive tablet

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.079
that will be targeted at middle school
children that is if the company can

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.129
convinced the school board candidates

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.219
that'd under rights to divert money away
from firing teachers and into the news

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.529
america's coffers

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.469
if you are well public corporations

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.989
unlimited rain in all of our affairs

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.979
will they do removed

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.109
who's the rules to their kind of like
this

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.619
they have to they their charter is make
every single red set you can

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.829
okay that is you only obligation

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.629
ecstasy showed us knew that he will be
removed

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.830
and they will have a new one

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.260
that's why we need the government to
look out for its citizens

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.989
to represent its citizens had to put a
check on corporations knowing that that

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.840
is the nature of corporations say hey
wait a minute up to protect the citizens

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.730
sewing at a balance here i think you
should have corporations but the way the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.280
ballots but that balance has been taken
away because of corporations also

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.809
figured out hey you know i can make the
most money

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:01.189
right after the government

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.300
mhm iso

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.819
i think after the government you set up
a system

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.589
where the politicians absolutely depend
on you to get reelected

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.549
as we told you i believe yesterday on
the show

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.459
therebetween race in the senate

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.609
stat ten and a half million dollars

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.729
has an average guy in town

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.619
with democracy red than at any time at
the only way to invest in a race

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:28.650
is if you play ball with these guys

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.200
this is how you play ball and this is
how we destroyed our system of

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.430
government our schools and everything
else involved

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.740
so we gotta fix the system of hope is
worse for
