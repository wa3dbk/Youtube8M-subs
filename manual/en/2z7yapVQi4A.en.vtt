00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.960
Okay, right now we are on a port tack and
what that means is that the wind is coming

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:19.190
over our port side and the boom and the jib
are over on the starboard side and as, as

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:26.779
we, in order to go upwind we have to tack
back and forth and change tacks and so we

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.270
may want to go from a port tack, which we
are on there, where the wind is on the port

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.192
side, to a starboard tack where the wind is
on the starboard side. And the way that we

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:48.910
would do that, is there's commands that you
need to communicate with your crew and make

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:57.059
sure that they know what you're about to do,
and the command is "prepare to come about",

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.890
and when they are ready, and I'll explain
that in a second, what that is, when they're

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:11.829
ready, they will say "ready", if they're not
ready, they will say "no", and as we, they

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.420
will be ready when the person, you have a
working sheet, the one on, which is on starboard

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.459
right now, where Ed is, and is, that's where
the tension is on the jib sheet. And then

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.740
you have a lazy sheet, or the one on port
right now, where Kelly is. You see how it's

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:39.439
slack by the jib and so what we are going
to do is, when we come about, Ed is going

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.849
to have to release his side on starboard.
Okay. And Kelly is going to pull in on her

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:53.200
side, and "ready about". "Ready", Ed is over
here, ready to release. "Ready", and Kelly

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.479
is ready to pull. And then the command is
"Helm, to lee", I am going to put, turn the

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.450
tiller as, or the wheel, so that the boat
turns into the wind. I'm turning into the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:20.860
wind now, and Ed releases and Kelly pulls
it in on the other side. And as soon as the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.750
main sail is on one side, we release, we stop
turning and we are sailing now on a starboard

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.980
tack. And as you can see the wind is now coming
over the starboard side of the boat, and the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:45.120
sails are on the, have changed sides of the
boat and they are right now on the port side

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:55.430
of the boat. "Helm to lee". Okay, talk us
through it Steve, talk us through it. Okay,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:05.319
the sail comes over on the aft, I put my additional
wraps on at the very end. If you do it quickly,

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:21.659
you don't need to winch it in. I was a little
slow on that tack, so I'm going to winch it

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:33.090
in a little. When you are around the winches
you want, you always want to keep the heel

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.780
of your hand toward the winch, don't point
your fingers down here, keep the heel in that

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.819
direction.
