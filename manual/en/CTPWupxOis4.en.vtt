hello namaste

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.490
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.430
Vahrehvah.com. Today I'm going to make a it's not a soup it's not noodles it's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.210
a combination in between its popular in lot of places in India

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.349
especially I had it when I went to Nepal you know today I'm going to show you a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.730
dish which is called Thukpa you know you can make many variations because i have

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.230
seen at different locations they make it differently i actually seen Indianized

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:42.960
version even in Nepal they added ginger
garlic paste they add chilli powder, turmeric

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
and so on so i'm going to make it the
way i like to eat so this is very simple

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.190
all we need to do is you know make sure
the pan is really hot especially if

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.449
you're making this at home so just add
one and half teaspoon of oil, in this we're going to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.890
add chopped garlic and onions

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.580
wow I don't want anything to burn here
in this i'm going to add chicken

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.159
oh see this is what makes me happy you add littele extra chicken to this and let me tell

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.810
you that chicken has to be brined whenever you're making something like

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.380
this because you want the chicken to
literally melt in your mouth

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.450
that's why I keep telling you take the
piece of chicken put it in the water add little

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.670
salt and lime juice and leave it there for overnight in the fridge next day you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.399
cut them into thin slices and use that
chicken will be soft and tender and now

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.470
you can put all the ingredients in this
I'm gonna add little bit of turmeric this is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.719
optional if you want you can little bit
now in this add cabbage carrot you're

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.670
pretty much you want to add you know
green chillies also cut in julienne, I've

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.909
got bell pepper that's cut into juliennes

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.110
ok now if you add noodles by adding little bit of seasoning and flavor you can

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.750
convert this into noodles but we're going to make this is not a soup it's not just

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.090
noodles it's in between so I'm just going to saute this for little bit now

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.360
we're going to add soy sauce, little msg, some chili powder

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.690
I told you there's a store like indian
version and a little bit of salt i'm

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.930
going to add little later if you want
you can also add little bit of chili

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.300
sauce the store bought one now we're
going to add stock if you're making a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.290
chicken you can add some chicken stock with this you know that's what makes

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.870
this very very tasty

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.990
ok that's it i think that should be good
enough

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.390
see when you add chicken stock
especially to make this, it becomes very

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.370
very tasty you know if you want you
can make it vegetarian even vegetarian

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.660
what I do is I take a leftover
vegetables especially onion pepper or

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.590
anything carrots and put it and let it
boil you know even that can add good

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.420
flavor to your thupka and now we're
going to check the taste and adjust the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:28.709
seasoning, huh haha awesome i'm going to squeeze little bit of lemon juice to

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.610
give the freshness along with this some
chopped coriander and spring onion but

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.340
you know usually people eat this
noodles and other things you know

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.300
just take some freshly this are just boiled noodles

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.940
I'm just going to take some of the
noodles here now I'm gonna sprinkle some

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.280
more of spring onion here some more
cilantro that is coriander now just

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:05.910
before adding what I do is I take one
egg and add it into my thupka you can

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.519
avoid this if you don't want but i love
it when haha slowly i'm going to let

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.340
this cook i just want the white to be
slightly set and then that'll go into

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.299
my noodles

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.430
that's it what I do is

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.759
I just take my egg even though this is
not ready yet it is going to form

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:37.350
something really really nice some more egg that's it my thupka plate is ready

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.759
you know with the noodles mm I'm just

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:55.410
hmm what makes this very special is nice and juicy

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:05.669
all you need to do is just take a piece
of chicken along with some noodles i

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.210
