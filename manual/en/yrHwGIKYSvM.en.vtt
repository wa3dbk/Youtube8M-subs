00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.770
A Deoxys giveaway, the new Plasma Freeze TCG
expansion, a special Dragonite on the Pokemon

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.770
Global Link, and more!

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:15.780
Hey guys, I'm Jess, here with your Pokemon
update!

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.369
First up, the mythical Pokemon Deoxys is going
to be given away on Pokemon Black 2 and White

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.580
2 from May 8th through the 31st!

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.060
You'll receive the pokemon at level 100, with
4 awesome moves.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.720
Nintendo hasn't confirmed, but there's speculation
that the moves will be the same as the ones

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.200
from the Deoxys giveaway in Japan - Nasty
Plot, Dark Pulse, Recover, and Psycho Boost.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.680
Since this event is meant to coincide with
the release of the Plasma Freeze trading card

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.200
game expansion (which we'll get into in a
moment), it's likely that the Deoxys giveaway

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.770
will be available in Europe and Australia,
although so far it's only been confirmed for

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.770
North America.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.890

how to claim your Deoxys!

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.670
Anyway, Black and White: Plasma Freeze is
the newest expansion to the Pokemon Trading

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.530
Card Game, which like I said will be released
on May 8th.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.660
It introduces over 120 new cards, including
Deoxys EX, Thundurus EX, and Tornadus EX.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.920
The past two weekends have seen prerelease
tournaments, where players could battle each

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:18.509
other using only the new cards.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.950
Next up, active players in local Pokemon Leagues
now have access to a special Dragonite if

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.700
they have their Pokemon Trainer Club account
tied to their Pokemon Global Link account.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.090
The Dragonite can be received from the Promotions
tab of the Pokémon Global Link if you've

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.759
participated in the Nimbasa Gym Season of
a local Pokémon League and comes with the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.100
moves Dragon Rush, Safeguard, Wing Attack,
and ExtremeSpeed, as well as its Hidden Ability,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.100
Multiscale.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
Moving on, all last week, Sephazon brought
together over three dozen awesome Pokemon

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.270
fans and video creators from YouTube and hosted
a week-long stream for charity.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.219
The stream surpassed its goal and raised over
$16,500, which will go towards bringing clean

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.729
water to places in the world where it is not
otherwise available.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.740
Well, that's all we have for you this time!

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.790
I'll see you again in two weeks with the next
Pokemon Update - until then, thanks for watching,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.169
enjoy the game!
