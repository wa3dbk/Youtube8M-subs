00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.500
-Hi, I'm Mindy from
Cute Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.850
And today we are going to
film the long awaited French

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.760
fishtail.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.430
Everybody's been
asking about this one

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.560
and I think you're
going to love it.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.620
So difference between a
regular fishtail and a fishtail

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.370
is on a regular
fishtail, you're just

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.000
changing the hair over itself.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.610
On a French fishtail, you're
actually pulling extra hair

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.230
into the braid as well.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.130
So I'm going to just show one
French fishtail, just a very

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.161
basic one, while we're learning.

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:38.660
I'm just going to
pick up some hair.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.310
And when I get the chunk of hair
I want, just divide it in half.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.810
OK.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.900
Now we're starting with
our normal two pieces,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.670
just like a regular
fishtail braid.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.560
And I'm going to go ahead
and cross a little chunk over

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.840
from the left to the
right, and a little chunk

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.060
from that outside edge
on this side over.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.070
Just to start the braid off.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.319
Now, here's where it
becomes a little different.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.540
I'm going to pick up
some hair just like you

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.750
would on a regular French braid.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.720
And then I'm going to pick
up just a tiny section

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.200
on the outside of the
hair I have there,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.700
and then cross that
whole piece over the top.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.840
And I'm going to
take my ring off,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.590
because it's
snagging in her hair.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
Now I'll show it on this side.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.330
Pick up hair like you
would with a French braid.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.600
Grab a little chunk
from that outside edge

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.460
and cross the whole thing over.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.770
So you will just continue to do
this until you run out of hair.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.950
Now, like any other
fishtail, the more hair

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.910
you take, the bigger the chunks,
the less it looks fishtail-y.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.050
The more it looks
like a French braid.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.390
So the smaller the
chunks, the better.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.050
I'm doing medium
chunks, just because I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.770
am trying to keep this
video from being crazy long.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.070
Sorry.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.710
So let's show it again.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.410
Take a piece.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.110
Pick up a piece of hair,
grab just a smidgen

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.780
off that outside edge,
cross it over section one

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.440
and into section two.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.310
Now we're going to
pick up a piece.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.150
Pick up a section off of section
two on that outside edge,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.280
cross all the way over section
two and over to section one.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.760
Now, we're only working
with two sections which

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.630
is a little easier
than a French braid.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.060
However, it's just a
little bit different

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.020
how you hold your hands.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.920
So if you're not
used to it, it just

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.500
takes some getting used to.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.700
And then when you learn
what's comfortable for you,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.900
it'll become pretty easy.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.680
And on the other thing
with French fishtail,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.700
or fishtails in general-- all
these F's are throwing me off--

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.850
they take a long time.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.180
Because you're trying to
pick up such tiny sections

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.540
to make the fishtail
look good that it

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.900
takes quite a bit of time.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.400
OK.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.090
Now I'm on my last
section of hair.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.080
I'm going to add it in.

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:33.970
I must have said
something funny,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.930
because I can hear my
husband laughing behind me.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.080
OK.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.260
So now once I'm done
picking hair up,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.230
I'm just going to start
a regular fishtail.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.860
So crossing over.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.100
And again, the
smaller the sections,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.490
the longer it's going to take,
but the better fishtail effect

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.190
it will have.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.780
So you can just keep going.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.920
This is what takes forever,
is just the tiny little chunks

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.010
all the way down.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.570
And there's not really a
good way to speed this up.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:23.400
So you'll have to excuse
the lengthy video.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.170
You can see my black nails.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.820
I play on a volleyball team
with some of my church friends,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.700
and we're called the All Blacks.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.800
So I painted my nails.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.820
It was tournament last night.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.130
We are quite a funny team.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.160
We never win, ever.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.540
We won, I think, three
games this season.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.190
And it was all by forfeit.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.740
And we won officially
our first game yesterday.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.510
And that was awesome.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.990
We were so excited.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.680
You can see how this is
just taking so much time

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.270
because it's very
slow and detailed.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.720
Again, if you want to speed
it up, take bigger chunks.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.530
But then it doesn't look as fun.

00:05:12.886 --> 00:05:14.260
And then when you
get to wherever

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.890
you want to stop,
go ahead and stop.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.030
I'm going to keep
going for a minute.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.365
And I'll show you a
fun thing you can do.

00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:33.450
OK.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.920
So when you get down
a little bit farther

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.429
and you're ready to be
done-- for the sake of time,

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:43.345
I'm probably not going
to finish this one out.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.080
OK.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.430
So if I were going to put
the rubber band right here,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.520
one fun thing you can do is
just go back and give these

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.850
a little tug.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.320
See how I'm just tugging,
tugging, tugging.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.080
And that just is going to
loosen the fishtail up.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.140
Make it just pop
a little bit more

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.020
and become a little more
puffy, which is kind of fun.

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:17.095
And soft looking.

00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:25.005
OK.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.210
And there you go.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.686
Grab a rubber band.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:56.154
And there you have a really fun
soft, loose looking fishtail.

00:06:56.154 --> 00:06:56.820
French fishtail.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.915
Of course, you can hairspray or
bobby pin any really loose fly

00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:06.370
aways, but I think
this looks fun.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.640
And there you go.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.460
A French fishtail.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.430
OK.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.330
So now that you've
learned this basic one,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.420
we'll put up a few videos
showing a little bit

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.460
more intricate hairdos using the
French fishtail technique, too.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.310
See you later.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.270
Want to say bye?

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.820
-Bye.
