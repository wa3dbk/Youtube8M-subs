00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.870
Hi today I'm going to go over a few different
baits that we use for different cuts of fish.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:14.059
And there's a vast array of different baits
for fish, for different species of fish. For

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:26.690
bass fishing we have spinner baits, like so.
There's all different sizes, different colors

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:37.590
for different situations. And then we have
the ever popular plastic works, this is probably

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:52.370
one of the best fish catchers for bass of
all time. And along with that we also have

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.239
crank baits which resemble little fish, and
these can be fished at all kinds of different

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:11.100
depths. And them of course for bigger fish
we have different kinds of lures. For pike

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:25.830
and muskie you have gigantic spinners like
this one here. Then we have even bigger, even

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.460
bigger spinners for muskie and pike, soon
as I can get this unraveled. This is a tandem

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:43.360
spinner, two treble hooks. And these are generally
used for pike, muskie big fish. They're heavy

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.729
gage, heavy pieces of steel holding these
things together, because they are extremely

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:58.270
strong fish. We have spoons which can also
be use for pike and muskie, and of course

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.920
they're all in different colors, sizes, all
depending on the type of fishing you're doing,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.389
and the structure you're fishing. And what
time of year. And then of course we have typical

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:21.230
baits, our bobbers that we put worms or anything
else for pan fish or catfish or anything like

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.780
that. And there's a general array of different
fishing styles for different types of fish,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.129
different lures, different colors, different
sizes. All depending on what kind of fish

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.950
you're looking to fish for. I hope I helped
you out a little bit, give you a little insight

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.829
into the type of fish baits that there are
out there.
