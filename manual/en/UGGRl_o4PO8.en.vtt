00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.067
- Have you ever want to
look like a total badass

00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:03.786
in front of all your friends?

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.502
Well, this video isn't really
gonna help you with that.

00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:10.484
But it will up your nerd
quota by at least 50 points.

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:11.529
True facts.

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.861
(intro music)

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:16.185
So why would you want to be able

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:17.984
to recognize typefaces anyway?

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.690
Well, it does make you look super

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.467
cool in front of all your friends.

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:23.568
But it also just makes you more aware

00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:26.563
of the graphic design that
surrounds us every day.

00:00:26.563 --> 00:00:28.781
You can begin to ask
yourself, "Was this the right

00:00:28.781 --> 00:00:31.184
"typeface for the message they
were trying to get across?

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:33.528
"Would I have designed this differently?

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:35.387
"Did they do any super cool things

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:36.907
"to the typeface that I can steal--

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:37.987
(coughs)

00:00:37.987 --> 00:00:41.527
"I mean, 'be inspired
by' for my next project?"

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:43.420
Of course you have the easy ones.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.287
I'm not even gonna show you
what Papyrus and Comic Sans

00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:47.983
look like, in the hope that they'll just

00:00:47.983 --> 00:00:50.188
be erased from our memories completely.

00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:51.779
When you're looking for Helvetica,

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:53.648
look for the capital R, which has that

00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:55.470
funny little swish at the end.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.129
Notice how the lower-case C and S

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.893
have perfectly flat terminals,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.844
which differentiates it from Helvetica.

00:01:01.844 --> 00:01:05.188
Futura has the distinct,
gorgeous capital A.

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:09.031
The A, B, D, G, etc.
are all perfectly round,

00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:11.793
and the lower-case J
is perfectly straight.

00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:13.547
You can always spot Times New Roman

00:01:13.547 --> 00:01:16.263
by the lower-case E, which gets
really thick at the bottom.

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:18.330
Gill Sans has the funny diagonal T,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.628
and a very distinct lower-case G.

00:01:20.628 --> 00:01:23.472
And Clarendon has those
rounded, thick serifs

00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:25.458
that you can basically spot anywhere.

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:27.802
Sometimes though, it can
be tough to differentiate

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:30.938
between two typefaces that
look similar at first glance.

00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:32.922
But when you look at the
details, you'll be able

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:34.676
to find a lot of differences.

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:38.379
Impact and Univers Bold
Condensed may seem similar,

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:41.177
but look at how much thicker
the strokes in Impact are,

00:01:41.177 --> 00:01:43.940
and how much more open
Univers Bold Condensed is.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.320
Bodoni and Didot are also pretty similar,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.945
but take a look at the terminals.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:51.498
Bodoni has a slight curve while
Dido is perfectly straight.

00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:53.596
Bodoni, overall, is just a bit heavier,

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:57.539
and take a look at the Q and
the W, completely different.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.045
And finally, one that even I
have trouble with sometimes,

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.050
Garamond and Baskerville.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.755
Garamond has a very distinct
A, while Baskerville's

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:07.613
is a bit more generic-looking.

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:09.597
Garamond's strokes are bit thicker,

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:12.183
and take a look at the
counter in the lower-case G.

00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:15.027
It's closed, while the one
in Baskerville is open.

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:18.046
The upper-case Q's in
both of these typefaces

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:21.343
are pretty distinct, but if
you can't find an upper-case Q,

00:02:21.343 --> 00:02:23.085
look for the upper-case A.

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:25.685
Garamond's has this funny
little notch taken out

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:28.344
of the top of it, while
Baskerville's is perfectly smooth.

00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:29.725
So that's how you can spot some

00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:32.639
of the more common typefaces,
but how do you find

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.404
some of the lesser-known ones?

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.145
I would suggest downloading a program

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:39.291
like Linotype FontExplorer,
which is like iTunes,

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.708
except for typefaces.

00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:44.040
Organize your fonts into
serif, sans serif, etc.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.060
so you can easily find
what you're looking for.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.521
It'll take a bit of an
investment of your time

00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:51.098
at the beginning, but
it's so helpful later on.

00:02:51.098 --> 00:02:54.604
Look for a distinct character,
like a Q, an R, or a W

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:56.682
when you're trying to identify a typeface.

00:02:56.682 --> 00:02:57.959
Make sure you also pay attention

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.014
to what the serifs are
doing and what shape

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.603
the counters are, so you don't
get tricked into thinking

00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:05.784
it's one that's similar, but
actually completely different.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:09.162
I know a lot of this probably
seems unnecessarily specific

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:11.995
to those of you who
don't do it all the time,

00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:13.597
but the little details in a typeface

00:03:13.597 --> 00:03:17.080
can really alter how it reads
and what feeling it sends out.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.100
If you really want to identify a typeface,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.841
you just kinda have to do your research

00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:22.420
and look until you find it.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.800
You can also check out some
of the sites I linked below,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.600
and they might give you a head start.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.515
I feel like this is the
end of a makeup tutorial

00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:31.192
or something, but good luck!

00:03:31.192 --> 00:03:33.747
See you guys next week,
with a really exciting video

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:35.372
that I can't tell you about right now,

00:03:35.372 --> 00:03:36.586
but it's gonna be awesome.

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:41.147
