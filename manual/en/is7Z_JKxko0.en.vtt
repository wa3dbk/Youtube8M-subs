00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.780
THE HOLIDAY SEASON IS MEANT TO HAVE FUN, SPEND
TIME WITH LOVED ONES, AND RECHARGE FOR THE

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.820
NEW YEAR, BUT FOR SOME SERVICE MEMBERS, IT
CAN BE A STRESSFUL TIME.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.910
REAR ADMIRAL MICHAEL ANDERSON, THE MEDICAL
OFFICER TO THE MARINE CORPS, WANTS YOU TO

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.039
DO YOUR PART AS A SHIPMATE AND HELP THOSE
IN NEED.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.599
"TALK TO AND LISTEN TO YOUR MARINES AND FELLOW
SAILORS ASSIGNED TO YOUR CARE OR THAT YOU

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.350
SEE ON A REGULAR BASIS. AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE,
LOOK THEM IN THE EYE AND ASK THEM, 'HOW ARE

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.930
YOU DOING TODAY?'. IF THEY RESPOND WITH CONCERN
OR CAN'T MAINTAIN EYE CONTACT, BE INTRUSIVE

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.540
AND TAKE ACTION TO FURTHER EVALUATE THEIR
STRESS LEVEL. BE OPEN TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.570
OF CONCERN TO YOUR SHIPMATE."

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.180
HE ALSO SAID THAT IF YOU NEED HELP FROM A
PROFESSIONAL, DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.610
"IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS
TO INCLUDE MARITAL PROBLEMS, ARE DRINKING

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.360
MORE ALCOHOL THAN YOU WANT TO, CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND PLEASURE IN THINGS YOU USED TO ENJOY,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.090
OR HAVE THOUGHTS OF HURTING YOUR SELF, REACH
OUT AND ASK FOR HELP. TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.090
AND AND TREATMENT WORKS. GETTING HELP FOR
STRESS DOES NOT MEAN LOSING A CAREER OR SECURITY

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.079
CLEARANCE. IF YOU FOLLOW THIS SIMPLE GUIDANCE,
WE WILL KEEP FAITH IN OUR MARINES, OUR SAILORS,

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.890
AND OUR FAMILIES BY CARING FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL
MARINE AND SAILOR WE CARE FOR OUR NAVY AND

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.579
MARINE CORPS TEAM. I WISH TO EXTEND TO YOU
BEST WISHES AND HOPES FOR A PROSPEROUS NEW

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.219
YEAR FROM THE HEADQUARTERS OF MARINE CORPS
HEALTH SERVICES STAFF."
