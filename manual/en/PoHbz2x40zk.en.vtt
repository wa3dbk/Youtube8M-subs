00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.140
[Music is playing]

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.359
So the first step is to take a teasing comb
or just any brush you have near you and then

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.060
backcomb all of your hair until you look like
a crazy person

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:39.120
[Music is playing]

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.380
So now you are going to take a brush ans smooth

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.460
out the top of your hair so we dont look that
crazy

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.940
[Music is playing]

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.380
So the next step is to section your bangs

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.960
away from the rest of your hair

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:04.860
[Music is playing]

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.880
When you have done that, then you are going
to take the rest of the hair into a low ponytail

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.400
[Music is playing]

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.020
So now you are going to pull your hair out

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.610
just a little bit to create the puffy part
of your ponytail

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.770
[Music is playing]

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.140
And this is the finished look of hairstyle number 1

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:42.880
[Music is playing]

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.090
So the first step is to take a small section
of hair in the front and then braid it like a normal braid

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:59.880
[Music is playing]

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.540
So when you are done braiding you are just
gonna take a bobbypin and pin it to the back of your head

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.380
[Music is playing]

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.720
So now you are going to pull out in the braid
a little bit, to make it a bit more messy

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.680
and a little bit bigger

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.820
[Music is playing]

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.260
And now you are just gonna do the exact same
on the other side

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:43.420
[Music is playing]

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.280
and this is the finish look of hairstyle number 2

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:54.850
[Music is playing]

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.480
So the first step of this hairstyle is to create
a ponytail and it can be high or low, that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.610
depends on where you want the ponytail to
be

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.530
[Music is playing]

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.280
So if you want the ponytail to look bigger, you an just pull in your hair a little bit to create some volume

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.290
[Music is playing]

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.690
Then you are going to take a small section of hair from the bottom of your ponytail and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.110
then wrap it around the elastic and secure it with a bobby pin

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:36.730
[Music is playing]

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.810
and this is the finished look of hairstyle
number 3

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:55.490
