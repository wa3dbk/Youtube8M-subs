Hi girls! Today, I will show you how to make flowers with the one stroke technic.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.950
I’ve placed them at the end of my nails, like a French manicure.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.140
This tutorial will help you if you’re new to the one stroke technic.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.240
Since we don’t make an entire flower but only parts of it.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.240
It is quite easy.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.240
I hope that you’ll enjoy this tutorial.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.970
First, I’ve applied this base: England – Tristam.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.160
To do this nail art, I will use red and white acrylic paint

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
And a one stroke brush.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.090
I’m using a square brush but you can also use a beveled brush

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.850
I dip one side of the brush in light pink - obtained when mixing red and white color.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.050
Then I shade off on my palette.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.910
And I draw the simple petal.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.160
If your brush is too wet, like here, the paint won’t hold on the nail polish.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.770
Try to avoid this.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.280
Have a look at my video “One stroke for beginners”. You will learn how to do it.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.510
Just click on the annotation

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.530
So I draw three petals on each side.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.010
It is easy to do since we’re not doing an entire flower.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.200
It is quite difficult to draw an entire flower with the one stroke technic.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390
When the paint is dry.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.260
Apply another coat to darken the color

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.770
And if needed, like here, apply a third coat.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.100
Now I dilute as my white paint to be able to make very thin lines.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.510
You can find the reference of this detail brush in the description.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.890
To highlight the drawing, I’ll draw the outlines.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.450
Then I add two big drops on the sides.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.020
And now I fill the drawing with a grid.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.600
To be able to do so, I have diluted my paint much with water. That's not shown in the video.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.110
I have diluted my paint a lot in water so that the white paint is barely visible.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.330
And to obtain very thin lines, as you can see here.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.820
I make a quick grid.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.490
And then I use my doting tool to add some dots in the middle of it.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.800
Then to make it shine, I use a top coat.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.310
I add it inside of the flowers

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.600
And now I sprinkle it with tiny glitter flakes.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.140
Do not use the normal glitter flakes because they are too big. It will mess up your design.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.200
Use glitter flakes that look like powder.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.780
You can use for example, glitter flakes used for makeup.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.580
And finally, I use the rhinestone glue to apply the rhinestone.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.280
So I apply a few of it and then I apply the rhinestone.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.500
And then I apply some top coat all over the nail to protect the design.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.080
The nail art is done. I hope that you’ve enjoyed it!

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.460

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.460
See you soon.
