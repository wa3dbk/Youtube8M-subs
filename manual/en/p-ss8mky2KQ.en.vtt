00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.349
Hello I'm Bruce Zimmerman host of the Open Line Garden Show

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.660
and certified horticulturalist

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.380
for rittenhouse.ca.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.880
One of the trends were seeing at Rittenhouse is the theft of water.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.930
It's becoming an issue because water is no longer cheap. We've got people

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.090
saying my neighbor is stealing my water to wash his cars or go and fill his pools.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.579
We also have construction companies and landscapers working in other people's

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.250
homes stealing their water.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.540
And of course we do have the issue of vandalism where people are just coming

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.980
and turning on their taps and of course

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.499
flooding

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.100
the whole yard and garden.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.500
So this is a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.290
Hose Bibb or what you call an outdoor tap. The threads on here are standard

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.220
North American thread that's why all your different hoses fit and so will

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.560
these.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.300
Now you take this which has a rubber diaphragm to prevent anything from 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.260
going by.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.150
And you simply thread it on.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.500
And in doing so you only have to get it nice and finger tight. Now this little

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.610
tang right here is loose. It's supposed to be it'll twril, it'll jiggle

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.840
and that's exactly what you're looking for.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.640
Line it up

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.500
so that you can line it up to get it through the slot in the sleeve.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.590
The sleeve goes in through like that. You simply take your lock in this case a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.670
nice Brinks lock

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.600
slip it through and lock it.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.820
And you're done.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.510
Even if they turn the water on, no water comes out, that was the purpose of the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.140
rubber diaphragm.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.110
And of course

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.850
walk away. That's going to save you more money

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.090
than it cost you the first time someone tries to take your water.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.510
It also comes in a barrel key format. Now, again we have the thick rubber

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.730
diaphragm here.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.730
And all you do with this one is take it and you thread it on finger tight.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.079
Now you can still undo it but you can take

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:22.269
and the put the barrel key in here

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.309
like that

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.430
turn it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.919
and you can turn this or any part of this

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.499
till the cows come home.

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:35.959
And of course it won't undo. Of course it's got the rubber diaphragm it's

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.489
not going to leak. And like this one it's already turned all the way open doesn't

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.059
matter which way

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.399
it's not going to leak.OK.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.339
So

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:52.009
Hose Bibb lockouts prevent garden theft. Very very important it's going to save

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:57.809
you a lot of money; a lot of headaches and aggravation.

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.749
