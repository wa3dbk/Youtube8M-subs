00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:02.834
- [Voiceover] Camilo Vergara's photographs

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:04.297
are part of a long-term project

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:06.682
begun in the early 1970s.

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.085
He documents buildings
in poor urban communities

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:11.651
in New York, Chicago, Newark,

00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:14.552
Camden, Los Angeles, and Detroit.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:17.925
- [Camilo] I didn't do

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.338
what other photographers would have done,

00:00:20.338 --> 00:00:22.689
which is to concentrate on the people

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.553
who live in those places,

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:29.369
because the people are the
least revealing in some ways.

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:33.177
Buildings can speak much more eloquently

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:35.199
because there's so much more

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.760
that you can see from the buildings.

00:00:38.557 --> 00:00:40.731
One of the things that
attracted my attention

00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:43.266
is that there were so many churches.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.135
Then, of course, the churches
became very important

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:49.330
because the churches are such
signature buildings there.

00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:54.132
They allow for the
greatest assertion of haste

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:56.381
from the people themselves.

00:00:57.138 --> 00:01:00.689
Almost everything had a
chance of becoming a church.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.587
Most of them were really storefronts.

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:05.091
They're dry cleaners.

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.204
They're butcher shop,

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:09.515
oftentimes the banks.

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.750
I realized that the
buildings had the imprint,

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:16.731
not just of the people who
live in the neighborhood,

00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:18.433
but also of time.

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:21.505
So in the buildings you could read

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:24.006
a little bit about the history of a place.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.892
Then later on I got the idea

00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:28.007
of coming back to the same place.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:32.553
The same Rest Church in Chicago

00:01:32.553 --> 00:01:35.152
at the first picture taken in 1980

00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:38.202
looks like a power
station, just two doors.

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:40.469
But the second time around,

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.720
they put some stone siding on the facade.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.889
And the sign goes up on the top.

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:50.201
And the doors, instead of
being two side metal doors,

00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:52.939
they have a front entrance.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.710
So the building's slowly
becoming less threatening

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.650
and a little bit more festive.

00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:05.010
Much of the interest of this work

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.798
is the element of surprise.

00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:08.667
It's what am I going to find next?

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.841
What is this building going to turn into?

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:12.913
What's going to happen in this corner?

00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:14.338
Who's coming here?

00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:15.735
And so on.
