Hi, I'm Danny Oberman, and I'm the founder
of CathMaps+.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.930
On a warm afternoon in June 2013, I felt a
pain in my chest that I kept telling myself

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.590
would go away. But it didn't. Like anyone
else who has a cardiac history, I knew that

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.460
meant that I needed to get to a hospital.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.420
Ninety minutes later, I was in the catheterization
lab having a new stent inserted. When my cardiologist

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.829
eventually discharged me, apart from telling
me to lose weight, exercise more, and take

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.040
my medication, he asked me if I knew what
type of stent had been inserted and which

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.620
artery it had been planted in, because in
case of a future cardiac emergency, it was

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.989
vital that the attending cardiologist know
that ahead of time. I had no idea!

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.399
He told me that if I felt symptoms again,
I was to rush to the nearest cath lab, and

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.090
I needed to have my cardiac medical history
with me. He suggested carrying around a note

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.090
with the details. A note?! I thought "Surely,
there must be an app for that!" But there

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.810
wasn't, until CathMaps+ was born - a mobile
app that helps people with a cardiac history,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.130
like me, live life with greater freedom and
peace of mind.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.380
CathMaps+ can help save precious minutes in
a cardiac emergency when time is critical.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.890
Firstly, by showing you the nearest hospitals
with cath labs, wherever you are in the world.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.380
Secondly, securely storing all your medical
history, so you can easily email or show it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.460
to the cath lab physician. And thirdly, allowing
a family member or friend to also have your

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.930
medical records readily available if they
are accompanying you to the hospital.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.740
Now, I'm not a doctor, but I do have some
successful cardiologists backing this venture,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.740
and their input has been invaluable in perfecting
CathMaps+. The CathMaps app is a reliable

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.100
cardiac care solution in your pocket, that
lets you live your life with greater peace

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.299
of mind no matter where you are in the world.

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:15.299
I wish you all good health 
and safe travels!
