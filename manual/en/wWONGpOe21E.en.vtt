00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.798
(bright music)

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.353
(light chimes)

00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:17.357
(bright music)

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.942
- Hi, loves. How's it going?

00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:24.157
So, if you guys haven't
watched my last video,

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.326
this is my second DIY of the week.

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:29.328
I'm basically uploading a new

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.827
holiday home decoration DIY.

00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:34.955
And next week, I'm going
to do something else

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.038
and that is holiday gift guide.

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:39.334
So, for this second one,

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:40.993
we're going to make some icicle branches

00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:43.082
and this is really pretty
to decorate in your home

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:45.371
because it would add like
a nice winter wonderland

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:48.294
feel to your house.

00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:49.875
So, let's get started.

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.266
What I love about this DIY

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.724
is that it is very simple to make,

00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:57.853
yet it is gorgeous to have in your home.

00:00:57.853 --> 00:01:00.566
So, to make this, you will
need some tree branches

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.816
and I have these stripped
down tree branches

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:05.990
that are nice and clean, and ready to use.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.073
Next up, you will need some white paint

00:01:08.073 --> 00:01:10.369
and this will definitely
give you that nice

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.329
winter wonderland look.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.570
White sand or Epsom salt
and you can find this

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.628
either at your craft store or pharmacy.

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:21.371
Down on my list, I will
be using Mod Podge.

00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:23.534
You can any other types of glue.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:27.588
I will also be using tacky
glue later in this video,

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:29.965
since it does a better job.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.555
And lastly, I will be using silver

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.060
to give my DIY that extra sparkle.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.466
This next step depends on
your personal preference.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.803
I like to paint my tree branch

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:45.696
because I want to give it
that nice, frosty look.

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:49.282
So therefore, I will be
painting all areas white.

00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:53.415
With a separate tray, mix
some of that white sand

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:55.579
and silver glitter together.

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.326
Then, take out your glue

00:01:57.326 --> 00:02:00.502
and sweep that onto your branch.

00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:02.507
Then, take some of that sand mixture

00:02:02.507 --> 00:02:05.591
and sprinkle onto where
you placed the glue.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.470
Make sure to cover all your
branches with some glue

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.426
and sprinkle on that
white sand and glitter.

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:13.668
And then, have this stand up in a vase

00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:15.688
so that way it can dry nicely.

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:17.435
So, I thought about mixing my branches

00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:19.893
with these old LED branches that I bought

00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:21.976
a few years ago from Target.

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:25.694
And now, I'm going to hang
on some crystal ornaments

00:02:25.694 --> 00:02:27.573
that I found from online.

00:02:27.573 --> 00:02:31.068
And this display looks so beautiful.

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:33.079
I love it in my home.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.827
I have it in my living room

00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:37.454
and I just can't stop staring at it.

00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:40.993
All right, so I hope you guys
are ready for this next DIY

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:43.086
and I love this one.

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:45.918
I'm repurposing my old candle holder.

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:50.715
And I just basically, simply
cleaned the surface area

00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:52.259
with some rubbing alcohol.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.138
Then, with a brush and white paint,

00:02:54.138 --> 00:02:57.054
I'm coloring or painting on the icicles

00:02:57.054 --> 00:03:00.223
all around this candle holder.

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:02.225
And this is pretty easy to paint.

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:04.815
You just want to go like
an up and down motion.

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:08.239
Think of water dripping off of this.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.530
Very easy to make and
once your paint dries,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.613
which it dries very, very, quick,

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:15.370
take some glue.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.693
I'm using tacky glue here

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:19.291
and covering all the white surfaces.

00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:22.583
Then, I'm sprinkling on
the white sand and glitter.

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:25.295
This turned out very, very nice.

00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:28.343
I would let this set for and hour or so,

00:03:28.343 --> 00:03:30.090
for it to dry completely.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.884
Then, you can use it immediately.

00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:35.470
(light piano music)

00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:40.432
Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:42.311
I hope you guys enjoyed this DIY.

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.902

to give it a thumbs up

00:03:44.902 --> 00:03:47.279

00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:05.337
