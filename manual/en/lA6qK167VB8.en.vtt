00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.570
There are really simple steps that you
can do to help prevent damage and

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.530
improve aging skin.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.990
Most of the negative changes that we
see in our skin are due to external

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.890
factors like sun exposure.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.580
So the real secret is preventing damage,
which you can do and should do

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.650
at any age.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.020
Great.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.800
Because I have no real regimen.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.931
And I need some real guidance on it.

00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:29.390
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.299
I know you're good about doing your
simple cleansing, and your

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.500
moisturizing, and sunscreen.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.540
And that's perfect.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.900
It's a great foundation.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.200
But to bump it up, you've got to think
about protecting the skin with

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.010
antioxidants in addition
to your sunscreen.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.570
You want to keep the foundation of
your skin strong by stimulating

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.910
collagen production.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.740
And you want to exfoliate in order to
remove dead, dry, and oftentimes

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.950
damaged cells, leaving you with
smoother, brighter skin.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.200
Sounds simple enough.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.600
Simple.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.000
Simple.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.510
Great.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.430
Very easy.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.030
In the morning, you're going
to do your normal cleanse.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.610
But then you're going to follow
with a Vitamin C serum.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.430
And Vitamin C is really great because
it's a potent antioxidant.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.900
It helps improve the appearance
of brown spots.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.490
And it plays a significant role in
collagen synthesis, so a real

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.910
powerhouse ingredient.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.070
OK.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.180
So you're going to apply
your Vitamin C serum.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.220
You're going to take a couple of pumps
on your fingertips and do a nice, even

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.980
application on your neck and
face, sort of gently

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.990
massaging it into the skin.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.396
Such a small amount goes so far.

00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:26.595
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:27.510
It's really concentrated.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.770
It's really like--

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.245
it's smells good, very natural.

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:33.130
Great.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.790
You're going to then follow with
a moisturizer and your SPF.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.590
And you're good to go for the day--

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.310
really simple.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.710
So nighttime, same sort of thing,
you're going to start

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.990
with a thorough cleanse.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.310
But this time, you're going to apply
a retinol or Vitamin A serum.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.625
And I love the MyChelle
Vitamin A Plus Serum.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:54.340
Vitamin A is great because it speeds up
cell renewal and exfoliates, which

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.010
makes your skin really smooth and
bright, and makes it look great.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.670
You're going to do this two to
three times a week at night.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.240
And you don't want to use it, though,
if you're pregnant or nursing.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.820
So just keep that in mind.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.060
OK.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.370
So you're going to apply the Vitamin A
serum as well, just a couple pumps.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.880
OK.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.085
A nice even application.

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:13.830
Same thing?

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.130
Yeah.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.430
Neck?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.130
Neck included.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.300
And face?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.720
Like that.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.180
Might feel a little tingly.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.640
A little.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.770
Feels good, though.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.370
Feels really good.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.960
It's working.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.570
That's what I feel.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.500
Uh-huh.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.500
If you really want to go for it, on the
nights that you're not using the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.970
Vitamin A, you have to try the
Supreme Polypeptide Cream.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.440
Peptides are a newer way that they've
found to keep the skin firm and tight.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.160
Wow.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.790
That sounds fantastic.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.080
It couldn't be any simpler.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.330
No.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.760
And it's really effective, so it's
going to take your regimen

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.050
to a whole new level.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.340
Great.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.330
I'm in.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.020
Thank you.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.486
Perfect.

00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:45.700
I love it.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:56.476
