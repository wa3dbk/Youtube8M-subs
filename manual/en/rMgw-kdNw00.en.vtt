00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.899
All right we are back to continue on with
the made from scratch crab cake recipe and

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.850
we've got 1 pound of regular crab meat. We've
thrown in our fresh chopped herbs which consisted

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.210
of basil, thyme and dill and we've got some
green onions in there, scallions if you will.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.230
You soak those in some white wine vinegar
as well as some lime juice to take some of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.150
the pungent aroma off of those and I strain
the juice off and threw in the scallions.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.391
I folded in about a quarter cup of mayonnaise
and this is about the consistency that we

00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:36.110
are looking at right now. So what you want
to do at this point is just kind of taste

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.580
for seasoning as far as that goes and I have
done that. So I've got some fresh ground sea

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.950
salt and I am just going to grind that kind
of fine over the top of this and mix that

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:56.470
in just a little bit further. Now that I've
got some wet ingredients in there which is

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.400
just the mayonnaise it is real nice and moist
now. I am going to go ahead and put in a whole

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.680
egg, drop that in there and get rid of the
shell. I am just going to kind of fold this

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.150
in with my fingers and scramble if you will.
Again, taste this before the egg goes in of

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.310
course and then taste for the seasoning. The
crab cake recipes all across the nation will

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.140
run the gambit. So depending on what you want
to throw in there. The biggest trick is just

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.700
to use good ratios to wet to dry ingredients;
the egg, mayonnaise and the dry being the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.840
bread crumbs. So you still have a nice rich
flavorful crab cake that actually has crab

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.260
meat that you can see in it and they are not
just biting into a bready crab cake with just

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.530
a little bit of crab meat That's the main
complaint that I hear from people from restaurants

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.030
and things like that. So I've got that egg
nice and beaten if you will. So at this point

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.679
I am going to go ahead and throw in the first
half of my dry bread crumbs which was 2 tablespoons

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:18.360
worth and fold this in. You can throw a shot
of Tabasco in there before you throw in the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.810
egg and bread crumbs. That would work too
and make them a little Cajun if you want.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.791
So again these recipes run the gambit and
I've had some great ones. As long as you are

00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:34.890
using fresh crab meat that is not pasteurized,
I will eat whatever you got. I love crab cakes.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.620
So this is a pretty good consistency with
regards to the bread crumbs and the egg mixture

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.090
that is in there. So I am just going to kind
of mold it into a little bit of a cake and

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.380
just take a look. You can see crab meat in
there when you break it open. It's not too

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.530
bready, it's nice and moist. I'll probably
just dust this with just a little bit more

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.220
of those bread crumbs. I'll do that right
now for you; just a dust. Just a little bit

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.610
more and that will be that. So I am going
to go ahead and finish folding these and then

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.470
I am going to form these into patties on the
next video and come back. I am going to finish

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.480
breading these in a light Panko crumb, which
is a Japanese bread crumb and we will let

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.670
those sit in the refrigerator and we'll show
you that process.
