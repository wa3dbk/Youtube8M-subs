00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.280
Hi! I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now I am
going to show you how to melt the sugar. I

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.380
am going to take a half cup of sugar, turn
the fire into a medium size not a high size.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:26.349
We are going to take the half cup of sugar
and melt it. If we put on a high fire, it

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:38.000
might burn and we don't want that so the fire
is on medium and we are going to wait for

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.520
it to melt. While it is melting, we are going
to take the nuts that I have peeled up already

00:00:47.520 --> 00:01:01.230
and cut them in half. You need a sharp knife.
Otherwise it is going to be very difficult

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:15.350
and very small and hard. It doesn't take too
much effort to cut it in half. It takes a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.420
little bit longer for the sugar to melt because
I mention again because the fire has to be

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:34.990
on a medium heat because otherwise it is going
to burn the sugar too quickly. As you can

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:51.530
see, the sugar started to melt and once it
is all melted, we need to bring it to a boil

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:06.590
to get the finer results which is getting
it into a caramel color.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.150
Until the sugar melts, we are going to mix
it up. But once it is all melted, we are going

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:24.550
to start mixing it up and let it boil getting
it to a boiling point. You can see it is all

00:02:24.550 --> 00:03:23.510
melted now and I am going to start mixing
it. I'm going to let it boil. You turn the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:38.319
flame now to high and wait for it to boil.
As you can see, it is boiling now. We are

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:54.069
going to put inside the nuts and let it boil
together just a little bit. Going too close

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:04.530
the fire and we are going to take the nuts
out and put on a baking sheet separated. If

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.711
the nuts are going to be together, they are
going to be stuck and we don't want that.

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:46.810
We are going to put them on a baking sheet
and separate it. It's a little bit sticky

00:04:46.810 --> 00:05:11.600
but we are going to separate them like so.
We are going to let them cool for about 15

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.539
minutes while they get hard.
