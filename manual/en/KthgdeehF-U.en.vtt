Hello, my name is Jose Zuniga. I'm representing
expertvillage.com. Basically what we are going

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:12.900
to be talking about is watering and controlling
the water drainage on your indoor or outdoor

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.910
herb garden. Let's start with the inside.
For the inside, they're all going to be in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.240
pots. One thing you need to be careful with,
in order for you to control the water drainage,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.820
be sure that all of your pots have this little
hole. If they don't have one for drainage,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.430
if it is plastic, create one; otherwise just
monitor the water when you water your plant.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:42.350
With your finger, try to see what the moisture
level is. Also raise the pot, and with your

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.960
fingers you could of kind of see where the
moisture is, and try to keep it dry as possible.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.309
So this is how you would do it for the indoor.
Now it is a different story when it comes

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.410
to outdoor. What you are going to do is get
your garden claw and just go around circular

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:08.450
around the plant. There we go. Get a hold
of some soil and just kind of feel for the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.300
texture. There needs to be more water. Know
your plants okay, because... when do you water

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.280
them: is it everyday, every forth day? When
it comes to aloe, for some reason this plant

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.750
would survive up to 3 weeks without watering.
Now oregano is a different story, you got

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.549
to water this plant at least every other day.
Now when it comes to basil and thyme, that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.880
is a little bit more fragile of an herb. So
it is going to have a schedule every other

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.149
day, just water the plant. Now when it comes
to mint, trust me mint would survive torture.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.320
You know you don't have to water it every
other day; you would be fine. This is how

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.130
we water, we check for the drainage for indoor
and outdoor herbs.
