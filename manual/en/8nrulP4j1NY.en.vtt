00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.343
Now I can really let off steam with this next work,

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:22.125
because this pretty new street will turn into a really shabby and old street.

00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:26.252
I'll go at this street with sharp tools, a cutter and a screwdriver,

00:00:26.448 --> 00:00:29.911
to scratch some roadway damage and cracks into it.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.218
And I'll create road patches that you often see on old streets.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.840
First, I'll carve a manhole cover into the street.

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:44.492
I'm using something makeshift, the experts may forgive me.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:47.843
Now I have the indentation for the manhole cover,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.948
so it's lower than the street and I can glue the cover into it.

00:00:52.275 --> 00:00:55.363
The manhole cover was implemented later,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.539
that's why they had to tar around it.

00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:03.520
What's special is that I'll carve along here with the screwdriver

00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:06.438
and then I press down on the outer sides,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.820
so it appears as if the patch is higher than the actual road.

00:01:11.954 --> 00:01:15.444
Of course, the street is a little teared here.

00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:19.552
Then I'll deepen and carve out this edge

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.430
because I'd like to glue some gravel on it later.

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:24.947
As a speciality, I'll do this:

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.894
Because the manhole was done later on,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.500
I'll show the repair patches for the laying of the pipes.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.225
So I'll draw another trail on the other side of the street.

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:39.827
Just imagine that the pipes would disappear somewhere on this side.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.900
Now the advantage of the soft plywood becomes noticeable,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.749
it's very easy to manipulate.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.821
Remember to be careful, a slip with the screwdriver could have dire consequences.

00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:57.465
A small detail: Old streets are very brittle at the sides,

00:01:57.472 --> 00:02:02.388
so I'll mess those up even more than in middle.

00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:07.944
Now I'll mix the piant for the patches and potholes.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.996
I don't have a set mixture ratio.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.727
I just use different colour hues, so it becomes very colourful.

00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:20.126
The patches are painted with a steady hand.

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:23.524
It doesn't have to look rectangular, it may also be some free form.

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:27.051
The paint is more easy to work with when it's thinned with water.

00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:31.817
The paint for the potholes is applied with a fine brush

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.999
and quartz sand is sprinkled onto the wet paint.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.924
The result still looks a bit spotted and the contrast is to high.

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.900
The next work step is the glazing.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.395
I'll use a very dark paint mixed out of black and brown,

00:02:48.462 --> 00:02:52.115
thinned with a lot of water, and apply it on the whole surface

00:02:52.497 --> 00:02:55.020
and dab it off again with a damp sponge.

00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:57.875
That way, the different shades of colour mix together.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.224
Then I draw some stress marks with the damp sponge.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:08.295
To make the gravel look like gravel, I'll brighten those spots with a light colour.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.270
I'll use white, a little black, that results in light grey, and a little ochre,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.356
to achieve a slightly sand-like character.

00:03:18.192 --> 00:03:21.645
I drag the tip of the brush over the sandy areas until they turn light grey.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.624
I also go over the side of the road to make it look dusty.

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:29.136
Now you can see how the bright gravel contrasts with the dark soil.

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:33.499
This easy process leads to a very pretty gravel effect.

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:38.279
To make the meadow look unkempt, I'll dapple wood glue on the brown soil.

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:42.800
To simulate weeds I'll sprinkle foam rubber flakes into the wood glue.

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:47.924
I'll spray the grass fibres on the prepared surface with the spray bottle.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.689
I obtain diversity by using different grass colours.

00:03:52.188 --> 00:03:56.385
A noteworthy detail is the overgrown gravel path.

00:03:56.754 --> 00:03:59.507
Weeds are growing by the wayside and in the ditches.

00:03:59.932 --> 00:04:02.749
The bushes are from a model railway shop

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.871
and are cut into stripes and then attached with all-purpose glue.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.470
The model trees have to be resistent against wind and weather.

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:15.637
That's why i drill holes into the board with a screwdriver for the the trees.

00:04:16.143 --> 00:04:22.346
I place the trees together, so that the branches form a portal over the path.

00:04:22.883 --> 00:04:28.372
I draw a line with all-purpose glue and sprinkle bright grass fibres on it.

00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:31.684
It looks as if it was recently mowed.

00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:37.889
To highlight the street, I've greened around it, placed trees and bushes,

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:42.962
adorned it with a fence that seperates the ditch from the meadow,

00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:46.010
and decorated it with cows and figurines.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.954
And there you have a gorgeous little diorama.
