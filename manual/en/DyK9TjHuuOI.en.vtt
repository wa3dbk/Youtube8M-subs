00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.120
TROUSERS

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.360
I would like to show you
several parts of the trousers.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is a Glencheck.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
We can check the precision

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.200
with which trousers are made.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.400
If we start from the pocket,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.400
we see that the edges of the pockets

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000
all match perfectly,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.640
both horizontally and vertically.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.040
The belt loops
have all been sewn by hand,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240
stitched above and below.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.240
At the bottom there's a cuff

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.440
with a button.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.240
The fabric is not cut

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.640
but there's an opening in the seam,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.040
two stiches
hold the thread of the seam

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.840
and there's a small button

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.040
which is no bother
when the trousers are pressed.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.800
Inside, they're lined English-style.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
There's a strip at the waist,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.200
the pocket goes
all the way under this strip,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.600
where there is no pocket,
there is material

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.640
that covers the seam.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.720
It takes more time to do
and is very different.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.400
Trousers are worked,
first with an iron,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.920
to give shape to the leg.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.000
It turns a bit at the calf,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.400
and then comes in at the back...

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.800
And now we'll see
how trousers are made

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
before they're sewn.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.760
These processes are done well

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.160
with an iron like this,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.600
with a heated, suction surface.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.200
Therefore, first I steam

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.200
and try to loosen
or bring back the fabric.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.600
After the steaming,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.800
I fix the fabric with suction

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.800
and make it come back.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
Then a crease is given,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the final one.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.800
If it changes,
it does so very little.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.560
Also the back is worked,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.360
turned a bit toward the front

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.760
and brought back

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.360
following

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.120
the crease in the trousers.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.720
It is turned over

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.400
and brought back at this point.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.400
If I put the trousers

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.200
on the table,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.600
you'll see it already has the shape

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.000
of trousers turning forward
for the calf.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
It's then finished off like this.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.800
You can see that it's not straight,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.400
but curved forward

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.800
and brought in at the back.
