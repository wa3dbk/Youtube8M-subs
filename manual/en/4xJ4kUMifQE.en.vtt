00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.660
This video shows how to print a test page
for your HP printer.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.880
A test page provides useful information about
your printer. In addition, printing a test

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.160
page from the printer's control panel is
often a helpful troubleshooting step.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.610
First, align a stack of paper by tapping it
on a flat surface.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.890
Slide out the input tray.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.790
Load paper into the input tray until it stops.
Slide the paper width guides inward until

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.359
they stop at the edge of the paper. Do not
push the guides in so tightly that they start

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:38.899
to bend the paper.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.410
Slide in the input tray.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.070
Press the power button to turn the printer
on.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.909
On the printer's control panel, press the
down arrow and scroll to Settings.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.159
Press OK to enter the Settings menu.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.969
Using the down arrow, scroll to Tools.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.500
Press OK to enter the Tools menu.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.420
Press OK again to print the test page.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.790
The test page prints.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.790
The test page can provide helpful information
about your printer.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.550
For example, if the test page prints successfully,
you know the printer itself is working correctly.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.020
However, if you are still having problems
printing from your computer, the causes might

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.190
be your connection, your computer, or the
printing software.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.290
If the test page prints, but shows smearing,
lines, or some other error, other documents

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.780
you print will likely have the same problem.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.980
The test page can also give you valuable information
on model number, serial number, firmware version,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.060
and other helpful information for troubleshooting.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.560
