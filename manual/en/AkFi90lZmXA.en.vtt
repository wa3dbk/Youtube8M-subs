00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:17.214
Do you remember when you first realized

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:18.635
that your computer was more

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.718
than just a monitor and keyboard?

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:23.301
That between the mouse click
and the video playing,

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:25.659
there was something
that captured your intention,

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:26.404
understood it,

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:27.880
and made it real?

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.246
What is that something?

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.983
Is it gremlins?

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:33.769
Let's imagine that we can shrink down

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:35.117
to the size of an electron

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:37.870
and inject ourselves
into a click of a mouse.

00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:39.507
If you took your mouse apart,

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.169
you'd see that it's really
a very simple machine.

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:43.420
It has a couple buttons

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:46.723
and a system for detecting
motion and distance.

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.224
You might have an optical mouse

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.844
that makes these measurements
with lights and sensors,

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:53.107
but older ones did this
with a hard rubber ball

00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:54.552
and some plastic wheels.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:56.301
Same concept.

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:57.890
When you click the button on your mouse,

00:00:57.914 --> 00:00:59.692
it sends a message to the computer

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.801
with information about its position.

00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:03.467
When your mouse click is received,

00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.856
it's handled by the basic
input/output subsystem.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.420
This subsystem acts like the eyes and ears

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.029
and mouth and hands of the computer.

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:14.196
Basically, it provides
a way for the computer

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.419
to interact with its environment.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.066
But it also acts like a buffer

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.477
to keep the CPU from being
overwhelmed by distractions.

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:23.787
In this case, the I/O subsystem decides

00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:25.918
that your mouse click is pretty important

00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:28.915
so it generates an interrupt to the CPU.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.075
"Hey, CPU! Got a click here."

00:01:31.952 --> 00:01:34.303
The CPU, or central processing unit,

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.498
is the brains of the whole computer.

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:39.048
Just like your brain doesn't
take up your whole body,

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:41.553
the CPU doesn't take
up the whole computer,

00:01:41.577 --> 00:01:44.238
but it runs the show all the same.

00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:46.482
And the CPU's job, its whole job,

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.420
is fetching instructions from memory

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:50.427
and executing them.

00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:52.356
So, while you're typing, typing, typing,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.586
maybe really fast,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.064
like 60 words a minute,

00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:57.066
the CPU is fetching and executing

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.113
billions of instructions a second.

00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:02.152
Yes, billions every second:

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:04.958
instructions to move your mouse
around on the screen,

00:02:04.982 --> 00:02:07.121
to run that clock widget on your desktop,

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:08.868
play your internet radio,

00:02:08.892 --> 00:02:11.273
manage the files you're
editing on the hard drive,

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.876
and much, much more.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.160
Your computer's CPU
is one heck of a multitasker!

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.589
"But oh my gosh

00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:18.885
there's a very important mouse click

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.006
coming through now!

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.560
Let's drop everything now
and deal with that!"

00:02:23.207 --> 00:02:24.779
There are programs for everything

00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:26.312
that the CPU does.

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:28.034
A special program for the mouse,

00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:29.068
for the clock widget,

00:02:29.092 --> 00:02:30.279
for the internet radio,

00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:33.112
and for dealing with letters
sent by the keyboard.

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:35.664
Each program was initially
written by a human

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.882
in a human-readable programming language,

00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:38.741
like Java,

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:39.774
C++,

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:41.195
or Python.

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.717
But human programs take up a lot of space

00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:47.426
and contain a lot of unnecessary
information to a computer,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.212
so they are compiled and made smaller

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:52.629
and stored in bits of ones
and zeros in memory.

00:02:52.653 --> 00:02:55.386
The CPU realizes that it
needs instructions

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.387
for how to deal with this mouse click,

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.697
so it looks up the address
for the mouse program

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.072
and sends a request
to the memory subsystem

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:04.179
for instructions stored there.

00:03:05.287 --> 00:03:07.335
Each instruction
in the mouse device driver

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.718
is duly fetched and executed.

00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:12.089
And that's not nearly
the end of the story!

00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:14.630
Because the CPU learns
that the mouse was clicked

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:16.274
when the cursor was over a picture

00:03:16.298 --> 00:03:18.153
of a button on the monitor screen,

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:21.224
and so, the CPU asks memory
for the monitor program

00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:23.329
to find out what that button is.

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:25.577
And then the CPU has to ask memory

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.413
for the program for the button,

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:28.924
which means that the CPU needs

00:03:28.948 --> 00:03:30.664
the monitor program again

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:32.836
to show the video
associated with the button,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.718
and so it goes.

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:37.463
And let's just say there
are a lot of programs involved

00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:39.583
before you even see
the button on the screen

00:03:39.607 --> 00:03:41.355
light up when you clicked it.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.824
So, just the simple task
of clicking your mouse

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.192
means visiting
all of the critical components

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:48.172
of your computer's architecture:

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.214
peripherals,

00:03:49.238 --> 00:03:51.023
the basic input-output system,

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:52.355
the CPU,

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.130
programs,

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.116
and memory,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.133
and not one gremlin.
