00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.597
[Introduction Music]

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.220
Hello everyone! This is the Smart ForTwo ED Prototype

00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:23.924
 It's not the model which is going to be released later this year...

00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:28.808
...this is the earlier smart with the Zytek battery in it, 

00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:32.718
which is not the battery that the poduction model will have. 

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.966
The production models  are going to use the batteries that are made in conjunction with Tesla.

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:39.158
Yes! The people who made that famous electric sportscar.

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958
This is just one of 200, Zytek-built Smart ED prototypes based on the 2006 Smart ForTwo

00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:51.084
If you wanted to take part in their test scheme

00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:54.278
You had to have a huge wad of cash and be willing to part with the test car after three years.

00:00:56.502 --> 00:00:59.502
You hear nothing in the Smart ED. When you pull away, you're thrown back in your seat!

00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:07.038
Like This!
WOAAA!

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:12.884
This particular Smart was not designed to be a motorway car

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.933
However, I'm going to take it on the Motorway 

00:01:16.512 --> 00:01:19.512
because any car, in my opinion, 

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:23.518
should be capable of motorway travel.

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:27.518
Okay, I'm doing 60 mph on the motorway but I do feel quite vunerable.

00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:33.598
Very vunerable!

00:01:34.118 --> 00:01:37.118
Okay, so the new Smart ForTwo ED will have a higher top speed of about 70 mph

00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:41.118
but at slow acceleration it doesn't stop you feeling vunerable.

00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:44.158
I've got someone bearing down on me in a Merceedees truck.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.970
It's scary!

00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:54.198
The new Smart is not going to win any prizes when it comes to speed.  

00:01:55.905 --> 00:02:01.905
However, all those batteries down low give the Smart ED an advantage over it's gas-burning counterparts

00:02:02.118 --> 00:02:04.118
It feels much more stable in the wind

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:07.358
I think that's because of the weight of the batteries. Which is good, really!

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:12.638
The good news doesn't stop there.

00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:15.638
There's one thing that you will never need in an electric car...

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.420
Petrol!

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.420
Bye-Bye petrol-station!

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.478
Hello Motorway!

00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:30.118
How does an electric car work?

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:33.398
An electric car works by taking power from the batteries

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:37.174
and sending it through a motor - which converts that electrical power

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:41.038
into mechanical energy, pushing the car along. Simple!

00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:44.541
No burning dead animals, which is what a regular car does!

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.008
Time to stop tooling around on the freeway and put the smart where it's happiest

00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:52.952
...the urban jungle.

00:02:57.078 --> 00:03:02.078
I've had about one hour off for lunch and in that time I recharged the car a little.

00:03:03.198 --> 00:03:09.198
When I stopped the car had 20% charge left. It's now got a shade over 38%

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:17.918
So expect a full recharge to take about eight hours, which is what Daimler Smart are saying.

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:22.053
This Smart has a hill assist function

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:27.695
When you take your foot off the brake the car keeps the brakes on 

00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:29.882
for a little, tiny amount of time 

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:32.998
enabling you to put your foot on the accelerator.

00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:40.118
I actually feel more confident pulling away in this electric smart then I do in my Diesel powered smart.  

00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:43.891
because this smart has more torque and more power from standstill

00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:52.398
There's just that little moment when you put your foot down when you think "What's going on?" 

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.933
and then...
 It kicks back!

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.442
This is how a smart car should have been from the word "go".

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.125
The smart should never have been petrol. They should have been electric!

00:04:16.862 --> 00:04:19.862
This is where the Smart ED is at home

00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:21.336
In Town.

00:04:21.668 --> 00:04:24.668
And for a city like Milton Keynes, I could drive this car all day quite happily.

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:29.971
It's quiet. It's economical to run.

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:37.882
And it's electric, which means I'm not burning any fossil fuels. If I recharge it from

00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:40.942
renewable energy sources such as wind or solar then 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.920
it's a very very very very very very low carbon emission vehicle!

00:04:47.158 --> 00:04:50.158
So, no good on the motorway, but what's the real verdict 

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:55.075
of this little city runabout?

00:04:55.653 --> 00:04:58.653
In conclusion, 

00:04:58.788 --> 00:05:01.788
The Smart ED is a great vehicle for around town.

00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:07.393
It's clean, It's green. It's got awesome acceleration to 30 mph.

00:05:07.853 --> 00:05:10.853
When it reaches 40 or 50 mph, acceleration is a little slow. 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.020
Anything above 60 mph is impossible.

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.689
It can go on the motorway, as I've illustrated

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.850
but I can't wait to try the newSmart ED

00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:25.847
The one that everyone is going to get a chance to try later on this year. 

00:05:28.097 --> 00:05:31.097
They've changed the battery and the motor for that one, 

00:05:31.676 --> 00:05:32.676
I really hope I get to try it out. 

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:43.918
