00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.060
Today on this 2007 Honda Ridgeline, were going
to install part number 70754 from Hidden Hitch.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.450
This is what the hitch looks like when its
installed on the vehicle.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.750
Next well go ahead and give you some measurements
to help you out in selecting some accessories,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.330
such as a ball mount, bicycle rack or a cargo
carrier.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.650
From the top of the receiver opening down
to the ground will be 16 inches, and from

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730
the center of the hitch pin hole to the edge
of the bumper will be three and a quarter

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.730
inches.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.650
Now well go ahead and show you how the hitch
is installed.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.710
Our first step is to go ahead and lower the
exhaust and get it out of the way to give

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.610
us some more working room so we can slide
the hitch into place.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.230
Well go ahead and spray down the rubber hangers
with some lubricant and then pry off the hangers

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.059
and get the exhaust out of our way.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.579
Our next step is to go ahead and clean out
the existing threads that are in the frame

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.579
and the bumper.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.600
There will be three threaded holes on the
frame on each side.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.460
There will be two threaded holes on the bumper
structure in the center.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:15.250
Once again well spray it down with some lubricant
and use a tube brush 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:02:09.639
to clean 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:56.849
out 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:07.029
the threads.
