00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:32.600
You're living the good life, you've made it on your own.
You've got everything you've ever wanted, you planned it all alone.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:43.440
You've climbed every ladder and opened every door.
But there's a feeling deep inside you that's wanting so much more.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:53.440
Just take a look into the middle of your heart.
There's a place in there that only Christ can fill.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:03.060
Take all your burdens and humbly lay them down.
Move into the center of God's will.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.800
It's your decision.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:10.665
It's your decision.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.480
Yeah!

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:25.520
You make choices everyday that effect your life.
Some are good and some are bad, some just get you by.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:35.600
Jesus stands at the door and wants to come in.
But the way you choose to live your life is never up to Him.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.380
Just take a look into the middle of your heart.
There's a place in there that only Christ can fill.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:55.180
Take all your burdens and humbly lay them down.
Move into the center of God's will.

It's your decision.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.840

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.860
It's your decision.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.060
Your decision.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.280
God wills that none should perish.
Eternal life He gives.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.180
He's given us a will to choose.
If you will go to Him.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.660
It's your decision.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:05.640

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.360
