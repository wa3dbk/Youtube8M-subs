00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.850
Hey kids, you remember Star Wars right?

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.590
Tatooine ring any bells?

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.080
Lots of sand tuskan raiders walking single
file.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.699
Banthas sweating all over the place like some
crazy mammoth-goat breeding experiment gone

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:17.850
horribly awry?

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.680
Tatooine was an arid desert planet, it had
2 suns and 3 moons.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.180
It's not the only fictional planet to orbit
multiple suns.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.719
In Nightfall by Isaac Asimov, planet Lagash
had 6 suns.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.129
Could something like this be possible?

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.210
Interestingly, most stars in the Milky Way
are in multiple star systems.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.229
You can easily have double, triple, or quadruple
systems.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.539
There are even star clusters with hundreds
or even thousands of stars.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.319
Just imagine the crazy chaotic gravitational
interactions in a multiple star system.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:02.399
So, could they have planets?

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.159
Yes.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.600
There are circumbinary systems, where stars
orbit each other their planets orbit outside,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.700
circling them both.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.500
Since the stars orbit one another so closely,
it's the gravitational equivalent of a single

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.680
star.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.480
From an orbiting planet, the stars would always
appear together in the sky.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.110
To date, we have discovered 17 of these systems.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.710
Then there are wide binary systems, which
are far more dangerous for planets.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.960
Here the planets orbit one main star, and
there's another star which maintains a distant

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.900
orbit much further out.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.650
You don't want to live there.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.490
The gravitational interactions are chaotic
and lead to mayhem.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.510
In simulations, planets which aren't tightly
orbiting a star are ejected out of the system,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.770
or crashed into other planets or stars.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.770
We might already be detecting highly elliptical
orbits from disrupted planets just like these.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.209
A triple star system was recently discovered
in the constellation Cygnus: HD 188753.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.910
Here, a pair of stars are tightly bound, and
these are in a wide binary arrangement with

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.660
a sun-mass star.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.129
A planet closely orbits the primary star,
but all other planets were likely ejected.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:34.680
In the year 2012, a planet was found around
Alpha Centauri B, and PH1 was the first quadruple

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.519
star system to be discovered to have a planet.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.680
Kepler 47 is a multi-star, multi-planet system.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.109
Two stars orbit one another every 7.45 days.

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:54.709
Here, the gas giant Kepler 47c orbits the
stars every 303 days and is even located in

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.639
the habitable zone.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.560
This sounds like perfect concept art for a
Vin Diesel film, or artwork airbrushed on

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.150
the side of a van.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.980
Finally, In 2011, the Kepler-16 system was
found to have a circumbinary planet in the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.220
habitable zone.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.370
So, two stars, closely orbiting each other
and a Saturn-mass, Kepler 16b orbiting the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.879
two.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.150
Astronomers informally called this a real
Tatooine.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.010
What do you think?

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.060
Would you want to live on a desert world like
Tatooine or Arrakis?
