00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:10.906
&gt;&gt;Lukas: Mom, is it ready?

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:10.996
&gt;&gt;Mom: Yup.

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:11.386
&gt;&gt;Okey dokey.

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:27.776
&gt;&gt;Lukas: I get up five thirty in the
morning every day and I get ready

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:30.836
for school, takes about an hour.

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:38.976
My brother Rob and I jump into the
van and I go down to jazz band.

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:43.566
[band plays]

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's zero hour,
seven AM, an hour before most

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:49.446
of his fellow students
show up for first period

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:51.976
and Lukas Bratcher is already
doing what he loves most.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:57.496
&gt;&gt;Lukas: My school has an
outstanding music program

00:00:57.576 --> 00:00:58.786
and I just love to play.

00:01:02.936 --> 00:01:04.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition
to the jazz ensemble,

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:06.996
Bratcher also plays
his euphonium horn

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:09.036
in Mead High School's concert band.

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:13.066
[Lukas plays euphonium] And in
the Spokane school's award winning

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:14.476
marching band.

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:18.656
[band playing]

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:24.176
&gt;&gt;John: It's been very cool that
we've been able to make this happen,

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:27.276
because the marching band is set up
with stationary instruments up front,

00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:29.426
which are typically percussion but,
but, you know, he's right down there

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:30.716
with them, set up with
his euphonium and is able

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:31.976
to play a hundred percent
of the musical show.

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:35.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: That Lukas can
play anywhere is a testament

00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:38.696
to his perseverance and
the support of many people

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:40.466
who help make his playing possible.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:44.936
It has been an uphill battle ever
since he was born with a condition

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:47.496
that renders his limbs
nearly useless.

00:01:48.516 --> 00:01:53.576
&gt;&gt;Lukas: It's called amyoplasia
arthrogryposis multiplex congenita,

00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:57.636
and it's throughout my four limbs.

00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:01.936
And it's basically, I have
stiffness in my joints and some

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:03.056
of my muscles aren't there.

00:02:03.276 --> 00:02:05.216
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Well, what's another
name for one over sine theta?

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:05.896
&gt;&gt;Cosecant.

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:06.806
&gt;&gt;Cosecant theta.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lukas hasn't let
his disability prevent him

00:02:09.706 --> 00:02:11.656
from participating fully at school.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:14.576
&gt;&gt;Times one over cosine theta.

00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:17.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: He takes four
advanced placement classes,

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:20.196
and does his homework on
a laptop without the aid

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:22.916
of the voice recognition
software the school provided.

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:27.346
His daily routine includes a
session with a physical therapist

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:30.576
who also happens to be
Mead's football coach.

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:33.176
&gt;&gt;Lukas: I love Vic,
he's cool, he's the best.

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:40.916
And it's really nice 'cause
he's used to working with teams.

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:43.216
&gt;&gt;Fifty-eight, you're at one fifteen.

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:47.876
&gt;&gt;Lukas: He's used to pushing people,
so he pushes me too and it's great.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.416
&gt;&gt;And time, four fourteen.

00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:55.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A tenacious
competitor, Lukas is captain

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:58.616
of a winning chess team he
helped start at the school.

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:00.066
&gt;&gt;I like that pawn.

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.116
&gt;&gt;You can keep it?

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:03.656
&gt;&gt;No.

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:07.396
&gt;&gt;James: He likes to win, but he's
a good sport when he doesn't win.

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:11.636
I think he likes the game, he likes
the fight, but he always seems

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:12.996
to have something positive.

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:15.656
&gt;&gt;Lukas: What can I
learn from this loss?

00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:18.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lacking manual dexterity,

00:03:18.306 --> 00:03:22.296
Lukas learned to play music his
own special way, to the amazement

00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:23.706
of his first band director.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:27.646
&gt;&gt;Lee: He looked very eager and
excited about being a member

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:32.926
of the band, and quite honestly,
my thought at that time was,

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:35.976
"Oh my goodness, how
could this possibly work?"

00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:39.886
And as we took the students
through their method book,

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:43.806
I noticed that occasionally,
he would play on his horn.

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:48.086
His hands were not able to activate
the valves on the instrument,

00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:52.626
so it was apparent to me that what
he was doing was just being selective

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:54.326
about the notes that he was playing.

00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:59.176
He was willing to sit there and just
wait for that one note to come along

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:02.826
in the music, and when it came,
he played it with all of his heart

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:07.116
and enthusiasm and capability to
make the best sound that he could.

00:04:07.256 --> 00:04:10.876
That was enough for him, initially.

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:14.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But Lukas
knew he could do more,

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:17.156
and that's when serendipity
led his mother

00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:19.686
to the instrument repair
shop of Robin Amend.

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.816
&gt;&gt;Robin: I love repair, I mean, it's
always different, always working

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:25.026
on a different instrument.

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:26.406
There's always different problems.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.686
My grandfather was a
Vaudeville musician.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.756
He lost his arm in a
lumber mill accident.

00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:35.756
He put an ad in the Portland
paper asking one armed people

00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:37.286
if they were interested
in learning music.

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:40.216
He taught them how
to play instruments.

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:43.476
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The senior Amend also
patented a device that allowed people

00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:47.836
with missing hands to play the piano.

00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:50.976
&gt;&gt;Robin: I'd always wished
that I could make something

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:54.086
that could make a person who had
lost an arm be able to take the place

00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:57.846
of their fingers, and then one night,
I woke up in the middle of the night

00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:00.646
and I realized that
joysticks aren't just

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:02.576
for putting electrical
things on screens.

00:05:02.576 --> 00:05:04.396
Joysticks can do other things.

00:05:04.396 --> 00:05:05.966
Joysticks can do mechanical things.

00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:12.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Amend's dream became
a small box with a joystick

00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:16.406
that triggered solenoids and
operated the valves of a horn.

00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:20.346
Learning a new way of playing
was exhilarating and frustrating

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:22.906
for Lukas, and just as
he was getting the hang

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.936
of playing it, someone took his horn.

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:28.066
&gt;&gt;Newscaster: Call crime check
if you have any information.

00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:28.546
That number is--

00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:32.546
&gt;&gt;Kristy: It was stolen in the
morning and by five o'clock

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:37.046
that same day, I was getting
the first call in my cell phone

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:40.226
from an anonymous person
that said that they wanted

00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:42.806
to contribute monetarily to a fund

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:45.876
to either replace it,
or as a reward for it.

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:48.296
And from that point
on, it just snowballed

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:51.136
into this huge wonderful thing

00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:54.006
where the community raised
six thousand dollars.

00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:56.366
&gt;&gt;Andrew: You know, I wasn't
quite sure where the optimum spot

00:05:56.366 --> 00:05:58.656
for the solenoids was gonna
be, so I wanted to be able

00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:00.066
to have it slide up and down in--

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:03.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The loss of the
first horn became a blessing

00:06:03.086 --> 00:06:06.366
when mechanical engineer
Andrew Coleman joined Amend

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.116
to design a second,
more responsive joystick

00:06:09.116 --> 00:06:11.976
and horn, which Lukas uses today.

00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:14.011
[band plays]

00:06:14.046 --> 00:06:17.286
&gt;&gt;Kristy: What's so beautiful with
this whole music thing is, you know,

00:06:17.286 --> 00:06:20.906
he's a part of that whole
huge sound that they do.

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:24.206
They look at him and he's
as good or better or,

00:06:24.776 --> 00:06:25.976
you know, as anybody else there.

00:06:30.016 --> 00:06:30.176
[ band plays Sugar-plum Fairy ]

00:06:30.176 --> 00:06:35.806
&gt;&gt;Terry: It's very
unique what he does.

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:40.296
There are some musical
challenges, but it's his personality

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:44.306
that is making it happen, 'cause
he's taking all those pieces

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:48.256
and put them together in a positive
way and working really hard.

00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:53.706
&gt;&gt;Lee: When I heard and saw Lukas
perform recently at a concert,

00:06:55.006 --> 00:07:00.836
it reminded me just
how far we've come.

00:07:00.836 --> 00:07:03.796
And through the efforts of all
the people that have been involved

00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:05.946
in supporting him, we
caught on to his dream.

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:12.546
&gt;&gt;[band plays Sugar-plum Fairy]

00:07:13.046 --> 00:07:16.676
&gt;&gt;Lukas: I'm hoping to go to
college on a music scholarship

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:19.876
and study music and be a musician.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:22.616
I love to play.
