Hi. I am Chitrotpola Mukherjee from Art Space
India and I am talking on behalf of Expert

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.930
Village. Now I am going to show you a method
also used by ceramists to do designs on pottery

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:24.330
on sculpture or what ever work on newer pieces.
That can be done. This is by application of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.860
stickers. Let me show you a sheet of stickers.
As you can see you can there are pieces that

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.219
are round there are pieces that are thin circle.
And these you can use and cuts and use or

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.350
in what ever way your like. Simply cut a little
piece out of it and put it in what ever piece

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.370
of work that you're doing which you want to
embellish. Anything that is appropriate. So

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.499
just stick it and then you put it through
the same process of putting it in the furnace.

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:08.530
Keeping it at 700 or 8000 temperature. Keeping
it for 7-8 HRS and then it cools. And then

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.170
you take it out and it is ready. This particular
design which ever designed you have put has

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:25.420
been transferred onto your particular piece.
It really works wonders on this simple ordinary

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.149
looking things and you use a sticker and it
completely raises the level of that particular

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:41.640
piece. The same stickers can be used to enhance
the look of a sculpture. For instance if you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.399
look at this round piece. Now if you cut and
it into two. First the artist likes. You take

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.880
this and you put half of it on this wing and
you put it half of this on the other wing.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.880
And then well it has changed. It's a bird
it becomes a bird with a floral wing on both

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.259
sides. And you want to add some more color
may you can put a strip of red over here.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.190
Or a strip of red in the beak. You can do
lots of things other than using on glaze process.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.550
You can also, this is again a non glaze process.
Which you can use for embellishing your object.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.090
There is such a large scope. what a huge scope
there is to do things and have really have

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.200
fun. When you are working you don't have to
be very serious. You can play with this. You

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.280
play with stickers. You play with color. Play
with designed and you're thinking keeps changing

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.990
as you wish. So I think that's, that gives
a lot of scope and variety to the artist at

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.700
work. Thank you
