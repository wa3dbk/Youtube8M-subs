00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.890
SCOTT BROWDER: Now we're going to talk about
hitting an offensive shot from a really poor

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.349
position, say the ball has dropped below table
level, you want to be able to get an offensive

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.449
shot going to keep yourself on the offensive
motion where you're going to possibly get

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.210
a point out of it instead of just blocking
the ball back in the play and trying to save

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.779
a point. So what we're going to do is focus
on trying to come really from almost your

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.540
knee level with the paddle up above and rolling
it forward and hitting--swing in towards the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.440
net at the same time, so you're combining
the low to high, remember the jar thing again,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.320
the jar wrist action, and punching towards
the net but it's going to be critical to really

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.710
get some extra top spin on the ball because
you're actually hitting, making contact below

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.280
table level almost. So a lot of people think
that you can't hit an offensive shot from

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.430
that angle but if you get enough top spin
on the ball and enough pace to it, it makes

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:25.031
it very hard to return after that shot. And
you want to be able to move, be able to move

00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:32.780
your feet enough to keep your body fluid enough
so that you can readjust, readjust, readjust

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.740
even to the point where you can actually come
up of off the floor with a little bit of a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.310
hop so that I kind a gives you that burst
coming towards in that and getting some top

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.670
spin on it. But if you practice that shot
enough, you'll actually get to the point it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.190
can be a very consistent return that it will
put to you on an offensive mode to possibly

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.340
get point of off that point.
