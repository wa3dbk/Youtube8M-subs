00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:13.721
Hello and welcome to a new 1000PS video.

00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:24.589
We are here on Lanzarote in spain because Yamaha invited us to the presentation of their new "top seller".

00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:40.902
First of all i have to say, that the price of the MT-07 is really good - it will cost only 5699€

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.909
and it will be available at the dealers in march.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:57.735
The drop of bitterness is, that the ABS version of the bike will cost arround 1000€ more.

00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:07.350
The bike was presented to us yesterday, during a presentation and the power of the engine was stated with 75hp.

00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:24.216
This sounds not very much, but MT stands for "Master Torque" and the bike stands to his name.

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:30.177
The bike is really a master of torque. We already drove about 200km

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:35.984
and a wheelie out of the first or second gear is not a problem at all.

00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:44.808
All you have to do, is to open the throttle and the bike is on the back wheel.

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:50.645
I'm lazy about changing gears and i still like this bike,

00:02:51.112 --> 00:03:01.660
because even if you drive with the "wrong" gear it's not a big problem. The MT acts good in every situation.

00:03:02.377 --> 00:03:07.693
Because of the low price someone could think, that this bike is not processed very well.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:15.527
I have to say, that this was also my first thought, while i went to the presentation.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:24.843
But when saw and drove the bike i got convinced of the countrary.

00:03:25.993 --> 00:03:36.431
You just have to take a close look and you can see, that everything fits and that there are no cheap parts.

00:03:37.492 --> 00:03:42.247
It starts with the awesome view of the bike. In the back we have a wonderful swingarm.

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:47.769
It is one of the most beautiful swingarms in this class.

00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:56.106
Next we have the seat which looks like an arrow and clings perfectly to the motorcycle.

00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:08.338
Then we have the display. It shows, nex to standard stocks like speed, number of revolutions or tank capacity,

00:04:08.787 --> 00:04:17.229
other helpful things like the temperature of the engine, outside temperature,

00:04:17.522 --> 00:04:25.710
gear indicator and a fuel consumption indicator.

00:04:26.647 --> 00:04:29.693
But now lets take a look at the driving skills of the Yamaha MT-07.

00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:39.083
The bike is really agile. The ABS version has, fully fueled, only 182kg,

00:04:39.407 --> 00:04:43.777
and the version without ABS has 3kg less.

00:04:44.403 --> 00:05:01.905
The bike is very easy to handle in the curves.The reason for that is, the narrow seat.

00:05:11.764 --> 00:05:18.772
Some of the journalists said, that the chassis is a little bit too soft.

00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:29.252
I would say, that it is comfortable. Unfortunately you can't change many things at the chassis on your own,

00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:34.988
but for people like me, that don't know much about a chassis, this is not a problem.

00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:43.214
Otherwise there is nothing to complain - especially if you remember the price of this bike.

00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:51.998
I say it again - 5699€ in Austria inclusive all taxes and Nova.

00:05:54.679 --> 00:06:08.267
All in all i can say, that you get a great bike for little money and it makes much fun to drive with it.
