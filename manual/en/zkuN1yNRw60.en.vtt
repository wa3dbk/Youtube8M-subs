Welcome back to my Food For All series.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.140
My name is Pippa Kendrick, author of the Intolerant
Gourmet and in this episode I am going to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.110
show you how to make chorizo, new potato,
and watercress salad which just happens to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:20.010
be gluten free, dairy free, and egg free.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.080
[music]

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.990
So we have about 500 grams of new potatoes.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.630
Now normally, with new potatoes you steam
or boil, but for this salad I'm going to roast

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.630
them.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.110
Add some really nice flavor and also texture
to the salad.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.829
So all I've done is chopped them up into bite
size pieces.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.679
That is usually in halves or some just keep
whole.

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.730
And put them into a roasting tray.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.230
We are going to drizzle about two tablespoons
of good quality olive oil over them.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.699
Just like that.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:06.880
And we will give them a mix and then they
will go straight into the oven at 200 degrees

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.590
for twenty minutes.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.299
So, here we have the chorizo.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.560
Now you have to be slightly careful when you
are buying chorizo to make sure it is gluten

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560
and dairy free.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.850
There is a lot of good makes out there.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.119
The golden rule really is that the better
quality chorizo, the less ingredients it has

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.119
in it.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.950
So you just want it to have pork and spices
and salt.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.929
If it contains milk or any other form of dairy
then you do not want to use it.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:41.539
So we take our chorizo and we are just going
to slice it in half length ways and cut them

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.890
into about a centimeter thick half moons.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.350
For a full list of the ingredients and instructions
just check the description box.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.509
So we finished cutting the chorizo and then
once the new potatoes have started to roast

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.020
which is twenty minutes, we will then add
the chorizo in.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.159
We then put them back in the oven again, at
200 for another ten minutes.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.390
The roasted new potatoes and chorizo are out
of the oven.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.240
And then you just want to set them aside for
about ten minutes.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.500
You want them to be warm, but not to hot.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.860
Because if you put them onto the watercress
hot it will just wilt.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.030
So, we have our bed of watercress there.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.130
Pick out any really thick stems that you do
not want and then just simply scatter the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.530
chorizo and the new potatoes over the top
of the watercress.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.830

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.380
So there we have all the potatoes and the
chorizo.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.420
I have two spring onions which are just finely
sliced on the diagonal.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.890
They add a bit of bite, which is always good.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.740
Scatter those over.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.260
Rather than a dressing you just use the juice
of half a lemon.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.440
Because you have so much flavor from the chorizo
and the roasted new potatoes and the peppery

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.430
watercress that all you really want is something
to cut through.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.890
And that is where the lemon juice comes in.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.870
So just squeeze that over and that will give
you a really nice, clean, background note.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.440
So here we have it, my chorizo, new potato,
chorizo, and watercress salad.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.950
Perfect for a light lunch.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.290
Join me again for another episode of my Food
For All series.
