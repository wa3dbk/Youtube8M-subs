Hi there, Brian from AV-Express here to review
the Aeon line of TV wall mounts with shelf

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.440
and TV wall mount with shelves.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.490
A TV wall mount with shelves creates a modern
look for your TV and audio video equipment.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.640
The black piano finish adds a sleek look that
shouts look at me!

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.970
All while making the most of functionality.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.970
The TV wall mount with shelf, TV wall mount
with two shelves, and even the TV wall mount

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.949
with three shelves have many benefits.

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.649
Functional, efficient, modern look, and simplicity
to name a few.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.940
Let's look at these benefits a little closer.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.370
We have heard from our customers about the
valuable floor space they have regained by

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.850
placing their TV and equipment on this TV
mount with shelves.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.770
By mounting your TV on the wall and the audio/video
equipment as well, there is less need for

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.359
the entertainment center as we know it!

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.620
This TV mount with shelf adds a unique ability
to swivel up to 12 degrees in each direction

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.240
towards the viewing area simply by pivoting
the TV mount section.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.780
This Plexiglas reflects a 55" TV.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.200
The mount will handle most TV brands and sizes.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.369

a few.

Now who wants to look at a sleek, modern TV
wall mount and be able to see the wires?

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.130
With a cleverly designed channel in the column,
your wires are out of sight.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.130
Power cords, HDMI cables are well hidden from
view.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.679

going through the wall and making holes and

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.290
without hiring an electrician to do it.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.680
A small mounting plate is attached to the
wood studs or concrete wall with just 2 screws.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.489
Once the TV mount with shelves is assembled,
you simply hang it on the wall plate and 2

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.820

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.230

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.091

attached to drywall with anchors which are

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:37.150
