00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.170
Another piece of climbing equipment that you're
going to need for climbing in a gym is going

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.269
to be a couple of carabiners, and you have
lots of choices when you're picking a carabiner.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.780
It comes in all kinds of colors, shapes, and
sizes.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.530
They all serve pretty much the same purpose.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:26.300
So to give you a couple of examples, right
here we have a locking carabiner, and another

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.110
type of locking carabiner.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.900
Both serve a similar purpose, the color doesn't
really mean anything, you're going to see

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.039
lots of options when you go to pick some out.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.420
The most important feature is that they have
this screw gate here, which locks the gate

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.430
in the closed position, preventing it from
opening while you're climbing.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.020
These are the kinds of devices that you want
to have for attaching your belay device, to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.039
use for anchoring yourself, a little bit more
expensive than a non-locking caribiner, but

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.059
certainly a critical choice.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.039
You should definitely have one for your belay
device.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.629
These carabiners here are what are called
non-locking carabiners.

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.060
You'll notice there's no screw gate on them,
but they also still look a little bit different,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.190
meaning that one of these carabiners has a
wire gate, the other one has a straight gate.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.530
And these types of gates serve a similar purpose.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.600
You have some difference in functionality
as far as how the carabiners feel when you're

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.371
clipping your rope to them, but as far as
the strength and things like that, they're

00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:22.830
pretty comparable.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.970
So non-locking carabiners are great for when
you're sport climbing, and you're using those

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.461
as what's called a quickdraw to be making
your clips.

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:35.440
They are a little bit easier to work with,
so this would be a great example of a non-locking

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.410
carabiner.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.570
A final type of carabiner that you might see
is something known as a quickdraw.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.090
They look like this, and it's basically two
of those non-locking carabiners connecting

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.909
to what's known as a dog bone.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.350
That's the piece here in the middle.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.460
And these quickdraws are what you would use
for lead climbing here in the gym.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.700
Most of the time, these are already fixed
to the wall for you, but it's still a good

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.610
thing to be able to identify, and it is one
primary use for those non-locking carabiners.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.450
So again, these are quickdraws.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.039
You probably won't need to purchase any on
your own as most climbing gyms do provide

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.659
them for you, but just so you know what you're
looking at, these are both examples of quickdraws

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.390
used for lead climbing.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.909
And that's what you need to know before buying
any carabiners to come to the climbing gym.
