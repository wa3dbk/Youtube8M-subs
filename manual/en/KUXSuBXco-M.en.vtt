00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:09.149
Hi DIYers, Sterling here from Alarm Grid and
today we're going to show you how to mount

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:16.149
a 5800 PIR-RES Wireless Motion Detector. The
5800 PIR-RES is the motion detector that comes

00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:22.429
in the L5100PK kit, which is a very popular
wireless security system kit, and therefore

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.248
one of the most popular motions installed
for residential homes.

00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:30.318
We're going to install ours here in the living
room and we're going to choose a corner mount

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:35.759
position, so that it gets the best coverage
range of the entire room. The tools we're

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:42.759
going to need for today; power drill, tape
measure, Phillips head screwdriver, four screws

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:55.299
and wall anchors, and then, of course our
5800 PIR-RES.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:01.749
Your motion should be installed 7 Â½ to 8
feet high, and so we're going to use our tape

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:08.749
measure, and measure our corner here. Our
wall goes right up to 7 and 9 inches, so we're

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:23.149
going to go ahead, and mount it right up at
the top of the corner. The 5800 is made up

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.509
of two devices, the front, which has the batteries
and the sensor and then a back plate, which

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.789
we're going to use to mount to the wall.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.289
Very simple there's a tab at the top, press
in, remove and we're going to use this to

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:48.289
mount. We have a 3/16ths drill bit, and our
four holes for the corner mount positions,

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:58.149
in the plastic. You simply drill through those.
We're going to use that to then mark the wall

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.639
and drill our holes for our anchors and our
screws.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:10.639
The 5800 PIR-RES has a motion mask here and
also a look-down zone on the bottom, so it's

00:02:11.228 --> 00:02:15.748
very important that you orient it in the right
position. You'll notice also that the tab

00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:19.938
is on the bottom along with the look-down,
so make sure when you mount it you're using

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:22.178
it in that position.

00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:28.968
The back plate has the hole for the tab and
so we know we got at the bottom for that.

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:33.858
It actually also says top right on the plastic,
to make sure you don't make a mistake, and

00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:39.738
we're going to go ahead, and drill right through
the back plate into the wall, to also use

00:02:39.738 --> 00:02:46.738
as our holes for our anchors and screws. We
now have our four mounting holes and our holes

00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:41.028
in our plastic. Now that the holes are mounted,
we're going to make them a little bit bigger

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:48.028
for

00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:14.328
the anchors, and simply push our anchors into
the holes.

00:04:33.348 --> 00:04:40.348
We are now ready to mount our 5800 PIR-RES.
Phillips head screwdriver and these are actually

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:13.358
#6 3.5 millimeter screws. They're not included
with the wireless motion detector, but you

00:05:13.358 --> 00:05:20.358
could find them at any local hardware store.
Now that we have our first screw installed,

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:50.918
not fully tightened until we get them all
in, we're going to go ahead and do the opposite

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:57.918
corner. Make sure our holes are lined up.

00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:12.348
We did a pretty good job, they are lined up,
and then go ahead and do our last two screws,

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:19.378
and tighten them all down. Last screw, we're
going to go ahead and tighten this all the

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:08.679
way, and do the other three nice and tight,
not too tight. We don't want to break the

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:19.119
plastic. We are now good to go. Our tab is
at the bottom, very important, and we can

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:31.399
now mount our 5800 PIR-RES Wireless Motion
Sensor.

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:38.399
Now that our back plate is mounted, we have
our 5800 PIR-RES. Our battery is installed,

00:07:38.598 --> 00:07:43.209
make sure again the look-down zone is on the
bottom, matches the tab with the hole at the

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:49.579
bottom of the back plate, there are two plastic
tabs, at the top that fit onto the top of

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:56.579
the motion sensor, so you want to put that
on first, swing it down and snap it shut.

00:08:01.878 --> 00:08:07.429
Now we have our motion sensor installed. Again,
