Hi, this is Dr. Greg McDonald, and I am coming
to you from Expert Village.com. We are talking

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.160
about your cat and first aid in your cat.
One of the common things that we see in cats

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.590
is a thing we call an upper respiratory virus.
Upper respiratory virus can be very serious

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.800
but usually it is not. It is kind of like
a common cold for us, but there are certain

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.250
things that you can do before you get your
cat to a veterinarian. First of all it is

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.759
very important to try and prevent your cat
from getting an upper respiratory virus. There

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.390
are vaccines that are available for your cat.
Cats should start a vaccination and program

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.420
between six and eight weeks of age, and you
should consult your veterinarian at that time

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.740
to be sure adequate boosters are done in this
early phase of the cat’s life. These cats

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.710
at this age don’t have a very good immunity,
and why these vaccinations are very important.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.350
Some times these upper respiratory viruses
can look very much like an emergency situation

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.690
because your cat has so much discharge coming
from their eyes and nose that they are having

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.850
a hard time breathing. Their eyes look all
blood shot and they are really miserable.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.990
Once again it is not something that usually
requires an emergency care with your veterinarian,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.170
but there are a few things that you can do
at home to make your cat more comfortable.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.520
Often your veterinarian will want to put your
cat on some antibiotics during this time period.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.900
Be sure that your cat is eating and drinking
well. That is the real key when you are going

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.670
to have your veterinarian intervene. If your
cat becomes so miserable with an upper respiratory

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.730
virus, that they can’t smell their own food
and they stop eating and drinking. Obviously

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.829
they are going to get dehydrated and start
doing poorly and they can’t fight the virus

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.220
off themselves. So once again, upper respiratory
virus usually manifests itself by a lot of

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.270
discharge from their nose, some discharge
from their eyes, blood shot eyes, sneezing

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.189
and sometimes they even have ulcers inside
of their mouth. They get these really ugly

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.439
looking oral ulcers. We don’t see that in
cats that have been vaccinated very much,

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.970
but if there have been no vaccines, they can
have that. Some of the things that you can

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.280
do at home that these cats do respond well
to is a humidifier. You try to humidify the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.650
area for them and kind of put it nearby them
so that they can get some good humidity. It

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.500
helps to breathe a little easier. If your
cat stops eating and stops drinking, that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.540
is when you really have to see your veterinarian.
Occasionally the veterinarian will put them

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.190
on antibiotics. Even though this is a virus
and it is not going to kill the virus, it

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.450
helps to prevent them from getting a secondary
bacterial infection of their lungs, which

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.160
might be an ammonia case in your cat. So if
they are not eating or drinking, you need

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.750
to check with your veterinarian and get some
antibiotics, and also sometimes we give them

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.700
some fluids and even give them a vaccine while
they are sick to try and boost their immunity.
