00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.120
Whenever I was about 10 or 11 years old, I saw this movie called

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.030
"Man of the House," and this movie depicts Tommy Lee Jones on 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.190
the University of Texas campus who is assigned to protect the 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.070
University of Texas cheerleaders. And all throughout the movie, it 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.220
shows a lot of Texas tradition, it shows the football games, the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.280
Texas A&amp;M Hex Rally and just what "college life" is supposed to 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.010
be like.  So whenever I'm this young, I'm thinking, "Man, that looks 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.160
really exciting. That's way more fun than school right now. I think I 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.150
want to go to that school whenever I get older."  So a few years 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.000
down the road, it actually stuck in my head, and ever since then 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.050
I've been bleeding burnt orange.  So whenever I got to my senior 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.030
year, UT was pretty much the only school I applied to. My mom 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.200
didn't like that very much. But it ended up working out to my best 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.090
interest because UT actually has one of the better business 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.230
schools in the United States and one of the best cities in the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.160
United States as well.  So, it all worked out in the end.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.110
Whenever I first came to the University of Texas, I wasn't placed 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.150
into the business school initially.  I was actually placed into the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.160
School of Undergraduate Studies. And at first, I was a little sad by 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.270
this seeing as how I didn't get my first choice major, but it actually 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.260
turned out to be a really good thing for me.  

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.000
In the School of Undergraduate Studies, I was able to get involved 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.050
in the Undergraduate Studies Council, which is pretty much the 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.000
student government of Undergraduate Studies.  So whenever 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.270
students have complaints or they want to see something fixed or 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.000
made better, they come to the Undergraduate Studies Council, 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.030
and that's where we can change things on behalf of students.  

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.210
Currently, it holds about 1500 students, and of those 1500 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.090
students, I serve as the Undergraduate Studies Council president 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.080
even though I'm now in the School of Business.  

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.070
Since I transferred into the School of Business, the facilities are 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.120
actually really great, the professors are really caring.  They care 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.000
about your progress, and they are more than willing to give you 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.100
that one-on-one attention that you need.  So coming to the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.180
university and having that professor that's always there for you is 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.050
actually really beneficial because they really do genuinely care 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.280
about your success in the School of Business.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.070
For those who are considering UT Austin, I would just encourage 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.020
them to explore the campus, check out some of the classrooms. 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.240
Don't be deterred by us having such large classrooms because a 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.200
lot of our classrooms really are fairly small.  You can get the one-

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.030
on-one attention that you need.  

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.140
Also, I would encourage students to explore the city.  Not only if 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.160
you come to the university will you be spending time on the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.280
university campus, but you'll be spending a lot of time in the city. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.240
So, get a feel for the city.  If you like the city, chances are you'll like 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.020
the university.  Austin is a very unique city in the fact that it's not 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.010
very mainstream. So, no matter who you are or where you come 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.030
from, you can pretty much find the niche for you here in the city, 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.000
someplace where you can fit in and feel accepted and warm.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.050
