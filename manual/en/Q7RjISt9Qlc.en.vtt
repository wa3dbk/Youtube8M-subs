Hi I'm Gohar Vardanyan and
this is Strings by Mail Lessonettes

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.090
in this lesson I'll be talking about
left hand pressure when we first learn to

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.910
play the guitar

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.010
often because of lack of experience we
end up using more pressure on the left hand

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.180
than necessary and even when we gain the
experience when we're learning a new piece

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.130
and our left hand is unfamiliar with the notes
it actually works harder than it needs to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.189
the key is just to figure out

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.460
the perfect balance between the power
of the right hand strokes

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.519
so whether you're playing piano mezzo forte
forte etcetera

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.839
and how much pressure you exude in 
your left hand

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.139
a good way to start is to take something
very simple

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:42.409
like a C major scale and to play it through

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.149
with thudding the notes so playing so lightly

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.010
that you're getting a thud not a pitch
but a thud

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.079
now play the scale through

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.619
be careful that you're placing the notes
accurately in the right place

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.180
in the fret and the next step is to 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.490
press just a little harder and to buzz the notes

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.950
so there was a thud

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.579
and press a little more and start buzzing

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:20.770
and you can use play each pitch more than 
once so that you get more than one chance 
per finger to figure out

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.770
that pressure balance

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.820
etcetera so after playing that a few times with
buzzing then the next step is to press

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.850
just a little bit beyond to avoid the
buzz and get

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.560
a clean pitch and you'll notice
it doesn't take that much

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.560
so start with the thudding then buzzing

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.659
then just a little bit more and
it won't buzz any more the next note

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.620
and then try to just apply just pressure
enough to not buzz

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.629
and etcetera so practice that a few times and

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.230
make sure that you get used to pressing
little and not buzzing the notes

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.260
now of course this was perfect for the
amount of volume that I was using 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.450
in the right hand if I apply
the same pressure though very lightly

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.500
but I increase the volume in the right hand so

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.269
I'm going to start buzzing again

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.879
this might be fine if I do lightly

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.709
but if I play loud I'll actually have to
press louder

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.760
I mean more so this is perfecto piano

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.290
then as I get loud I have to increase
the pressure

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.170
to avoid buzzing and thats as I
mentioned before that's the whole point

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.360
is to figure out

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.720
the balance between how loud you're playing
in the right hand and how much you're pressing

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.860
in the left hand and never really working your
left hand harder than it needs to

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.280
after practicing on a simple scale then you
can apply it to whatever

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.819
repertoire that you have so if there's a
passage that you think

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.920
you're using too much pressure in use
the same technique so it's a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.840
start with the thudding

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.560
then press just a little more 
to avoid the buzzing

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560
and get a clean pitch

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.890
and then if you're gonna increase the volume
then increase the pressure this way your left hand

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.540
is working just as hard as necessary and not
a bit more than that

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.569
and you can conserve the energy and
the power so you can last for however

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.050
long your practice session is

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.650
or if you're playing an entire hour 
and a half concert
