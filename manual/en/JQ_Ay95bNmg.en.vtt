Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and we are just north of Olympia at

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.910
the Nisqually National Wildlife Reserve…

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.720
I just had to get that right, and we were
going to be meeting some members here, but

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.140
unfortunately they were unable to meet us,
so what we've done is taken a little walk,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.650
had some lunch, and I'm gonna show you into…
show you a couple things in the trailer for

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.160
storage ideas.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.350
This is a beautiful, beautiful park, they
have set it aside to protect wildlife, and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.101
it's just stunning, there's all sorts of wildlife
and beautiful swampy areas and stuff, it's

00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:51.300
just stunning.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:04.970
So let's go into the trailer and I'll show
you what we've got.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.350
Before we head home, we thought we would make
sure to show you some of the way we've got

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.480
everything setup here.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.180
First of all I wanted to show you, we hung
Willow's beautiful spoon, it goes so nicely

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.590
in the trailer; we wanted everybody to be
able to see it when they visited us.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.470
Also, Doug built this really great… well
he didn't build the cabinet itself but he

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.240
figured out a way to keep this cabinet nice
and stable.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.240
While we're travelling, I can't have my supplies
sliding all over the place, and they’re…so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.890
what we did is he hooked it up… so that
he put some bungee cords in here, and I'll

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.259
just unhook them now, we turned it around
so that the drawers were facing the opposite

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.010
way, that way the drawers couldn't open while
we were driving.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:04.770
And then if we roll it around, you can see
that I have a whole case just absolutely packed,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.980
probably next time I will pack a little less,
I didn't end up needing as much as stuff as

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.980
I brought.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.030
But I'll just kinda go through what I did
bring along this time, the first drawer has

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.650
a lot of scrapbooking supplies and things
in there.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.970
Each trip I wanna do a scrapbook… or I'll
start one big scrapbook and then I'll put

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.660
the different trips in there, and I was hoping
to do that while on the road but I ended up

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.280
not doing it yet, but that's one thing I'll
do before we head out next time.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.670
This drawer has a bunch of rubber stamps,
scissors, other sort of supplies and things

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.860
in here.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.040
This drawer has alcohol inks, it has some
other types of inks, StazOn inks, some cutters,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.840
even some Gilders paste, my favorite.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.690
I have all my jewelry tools in here, my cutters,
pliers, I also have some sand paper, my special

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.720
hammer.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.390
I have an Ott light that I brought along which
is just perfect for getting the right lighting

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.629
if you're doing color mixing and that kind
of thing, and it's portable.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:26.090
And I have some little jars of scrapbooking
supplies and beads and things.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.510
In here, I have some paper, my new Katie Hack
book from Katie Hacker, I'll have to show

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:41.659
that to you sometime, I've also got, my Kumihimo
stuff in there as well.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.540
In here I have my pasta machine and a whole
bunch of clay, it was amazing how much clay

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.739
I could get into a small container like this
inside here.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:02.519
And in the bottom one, I have my die cutter,
believe it or not and a bunch of dies, and

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.050
that I may or may not bring next time, depending,
it's kinda heavy, and I probably I won't be

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.450
doing a lot of die cutting, but I figured
I might be making some tags and things.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.310
So I really hope you enjoyed coming along
on this trip, it has really been an adventure.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.930
We've really had a great time, we've seen
some beautiful views, we've met some really

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.200
wonderful people and we're super excited about
doing this some more, I think we're all very

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.320
addicted.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.810
We learned a few things, I’ll have to write
some posts about that, ‘cause there's some

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.240
things we won't do exactly the same next time,
but we just really, really had a great time,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.820
and nothing went wrong so that was all good,
and what else?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.820
I'm just…

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.380
I’m really looking forward to the next trip
and getting to see you on the next PCT Road

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.410
Trip.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.430
So we'll see you next time and bye for now.
