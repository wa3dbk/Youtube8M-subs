00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.050
So what I was explaining to you as far as
a bow goes is if you look at this drywall

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.299
right now we are probably pretty much sitting
straight, right? You look down the line but

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.220
if I were to screw this in right now, now
we have got a bow going in right here. Because

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.540
this stud is farther back than these so what
we are going to do to remedy that is we are

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.510
going to get a piece of shim, redwood lathe
that is the same size as the gap and we're

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:52.440
going to nail that in. That looks straight
there, straight here. Now we are about to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.610
discuss shimming and furring out your wall
so your drywall lays flat. We've got two types

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.989
of different shims here but you can also make
your own. We have, this is a redwood lathe

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.320
shim and they sell them at Home Depot and
they also sell the paper shims. The redwood

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.619
shims are 1/4 inch thick around while these
are around 1/8 of an inch thick. You can also

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.799
make your own for seriously out of plumb walls
that are seriously tipped sideways you can

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:32.139
cut 2 X 4's from nothing to whatever size
you need to straighten up that wall but this

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:39.189
wall we are pretty much dealing with just
a bunch of junky old 2 X 4s and so we are

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.340
using strips and lathing to fur it out to
make it straight. The purpose of these shims

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.779
and the redwood lathing that we are using
is to actually fill in the space in between

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:57.700
studs or on the stud. Some studs are sticking
out farther than others and when you put a

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.779
piece of drywall on it the piece of drywall
will hit the studs that are sticking out the

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:06.499
farthest. Now the ones that are set back in
they pose a problem because when you screw

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.009
the drywall in it will push the drywall in
to that stud which will leave you a big bow

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.280
in it and for anybody that does taping and
mudding you know how hard it is to fill in

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.349
a hole like that so the best way to do it
is when you have studs that are in use the

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.930
paper shimming and the redwood lathe and you
fur the 2 X 4's that are set in out to meet

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.620
the edge of the drywall so the drywall will
stay flat and that's what these are for. See

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:53.799
how it is bent in a little bit, well you've
got to take that out. Put a shim behind it.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:20.140
See now it is straight. That's pretty much
shimming and lathing.
