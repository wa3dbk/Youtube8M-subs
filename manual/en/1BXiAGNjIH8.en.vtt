00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:13.932
With over 30 years beekeeping experience, 
prof. Ioan Ursu patented a hive that will 
revolutionize beekeeping and make it possible
to naturally fight varroa and obtaining organic bee products.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:25.588
The idea of this beehive came not by chance
 but is the result of many years of evolution.
"I was inspired by an old model that naturally fights varroa".

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:42.446
If you look down, you'll see many dead bees
 because of this mite that is very dangerous for bees.

00:00:47.044 --> 00:01:01.115
Let's take a bee who has this parasite
 and analize her.

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:16.115
Please note that she is very weak and her
 fins are damaged. Many bees are dying when
 they are out and is difficult to estimate the losses.

00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:24.614
The problem is very serious because entire apiaries
 are decimated by the nasty parasites called varroa.

00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:37.942
Besides that it naturally fights varroa, other benefits 
of the new hive include an increase of natural wax production,
organic honey and a small Queen farm attached to the hive.

00:01:41.053 --> 00:02:02.140
I exploited a well known fact, that this mite prefers
 the drone brood and the new hive creates all the necessary
 conditions for an increased control of the drone brood.
 This way varroa is kept under control.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:29.440
We can now have an increase of the natural wax
 and organic honey production.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:58.190
One of the secrets of this wonder hive is the attached pocket
 that allows repeated quick access to the drone brood frame.

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:23.780
The attached pocket can be split in 2 and next to the colony we
can insert a hollow frame(the varroa control frame) that
will stimulate wax production and drone brood.

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:42.590
The control frame is separated from the main colony by the 
following grid which is the main element of this invention.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:04:09.010
The frames in the hive are aranged like this, 
and it can accomodate about 14 frames. Notice that
two consecutive frames create a gap, that allows
bees and the Queen to pass from one frame to another.

00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:48.580
This gap is captured by the grid. For bees and the Queen this
grid is invisible but it allows their move from any frame inside
the colony to the varroa control frame.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:17.930
On the other side of the grid we have the control frame with
natural wax and drone brood. For the Queen this is an irresistible
offer because she doesn't need to cross the entire colony to get to it.

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:38.870
The Queen can now pass from any frame in the colony to the 
varroa control frame. The varroa will concentrate on this 
frame and we can act quickly to remove it from the hive.

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:58.800
This pocket allows the beekeeper a quick access to the control frame
without the need to remove the super and after a few cycles
the varroa will diminish considerably.

00:06:02.324 --> 00:06:18.720
Here's another opinion about this invention: This is a great
leap forward because is the first time when a separation
is made between the colony frames and the control frame.

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:44.580
These varroa distroying cycles do not interfere with the entire 
activity of the colony. The quantity of drugs needed to keep
varroa in chess will also diminish. An optim will be reached.

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:50.930
A patent for this new type of beehive was already obtained from 
The Office for Inventions and Trademarks.
