00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
Brazilian recorder being played again

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:10.000
Egypt and Greece brag about expanding their territories but the story is different for Brazil.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.340
Our foremost achievement is to govern our wide territory in peace and security.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.180
But if anyone is asked if they know Pedro ⅱ?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.940
They don’t know!
But if anyone is asked if they know King Alexandros, everyone knows!

00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:31.201
No / I don’t know him / No no, I don’t know /  I dunno / The King is Ghana king of liar.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.280
Panicked as everyone’s opposing.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.120
There is a Brazilian king who is more famous than King Alexandros.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.980
No way~

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.068
Pele!

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.760
The greatest soccer emperor Pele who won the World Cup 3 times

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.480
Agreed!

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.200
I understand that there is no such king in Greece.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.940
From looking at the present

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.720
King Pedro left Brazil. What did Alexandros leave?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.244
Greece!

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.780
King Alexandros did not manage to leave anything behind.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.095
Macedonia!

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.540
Territory of Egypt reduced.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.289
Yes, that’s right!

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.280
Counter-attacking!

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.060
Where is Greece now?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260
Here~ Macedonia!

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.600
Please explain.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.840
It was this small in the beginning and the rest was conquered.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.740
Then it all came back.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.300
(Murmurings)

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.760
Macedonia was this small at first and King Alexandros brought this much more to the country.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.040
But isn’t Macedonia Greece?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Macedonia is Greece~

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.460
Yes it is Greece.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.820
Macedonia is Greece.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.860
I thought he is Young Ja Lee.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.300
It is located next to it.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200
(Singing) Macedonia is Greece~

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.780
Calm down.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.680
Macedonia is originally a small region in Greece.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.720
But other countries try to reduce our history.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.500
Stretching face in all direction

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.320
Because I wanted to steal it.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.460
Groaning without saying anything.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.220
Jim Carrey of Greece

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.760
Jim Carrey of Greece

00:02:13.922 --> 00:02:16.402
Macedonia is a different country.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.420
Addictive melody

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.520
Back to the point

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.740
But people don’t consider Macedonia and Greece as the same country.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.920
(All at the same time) Different countries.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.580
I got you!

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.357
Finally giving up arguing.
