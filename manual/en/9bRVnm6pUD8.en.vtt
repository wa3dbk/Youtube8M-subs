00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.600
By the time when strange food unlikely to be eaten,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.620
Becomes a staple food

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.580
By the time monsters unlikely to be loved,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.500
obtain unmatched love...

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.640
Time machines will be illegal,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.980
And flying cars will be a hindrance

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.540
When we welcome that era,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.560
We can quickly get accustomed

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.860
will we get too accustomed?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.920
I don't want to!

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.280
If I could have fun living, that would be nice, though...

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.720
If I could laugh a little at the gloomy future, I'd be glad, so

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.300
Something so perverse, makes you pleased

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.980
If I could invent something that surprised everyone, it'd be nice, though...

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.500
When the time when tumors that show despair,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.260
suddenly start sing songs of hope

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.120
By the time when idiots who spit on everything,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.420
become grown, mature heroes...

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.380
The mysteries of genetics will be solved,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.060
The ends of the universe will be reached,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.180
The meaning of life will be understood,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.440
What to do next?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.860
What can we do?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.560
For now...

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.500
If tomorrow is sunny as forecast, that would be nice, though

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.820
If both truth and mystery could nearly become gags, I'd be glad, so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.320
Try to pinch the cheeks of a weird God

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.620
It'd be nice if wicked hearts could be fertilizer, though...

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.780
If I could have fun living, that would be nice, though...

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.680
Are there still stray cats somewhere on Earth, maybe?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.780
I want to make a call to the future and ask you,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.520
And whether there are or not,  "No worries.", though...

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.020
If I could invent something that surprised everyone, it'd be nice, though....
