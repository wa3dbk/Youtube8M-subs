00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.030
[music] It's been two years since Operation IceBridge has flown

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.100
over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet – one of the fastest-melting

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.160
large masses of ice on the planet.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.170
Back then, the mission was based out of Punta Arenas, Chile, a great location if you 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.190
want to hit the West Antarctic and other science targets near the Antarctic Peninsula. 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.230
But for the first time last fall, the mission moved its 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.250
field site to the even more remote McMurdo Station, where they 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.310
completed the most-comprehensive long-range surveys ever performed of 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.340
several areas. For many on the team, it was a new experience 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.360
to actually touch down in Antarctica, and see firsthand

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.370
things like Weddell seals basking in the sun, gigantic pressure ridges 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.410
of sea ice formed by the ice pushing against the coast

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.430
the volcanic Mount Erebus, and Scotts cabin 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.540
with 100-year old seal flippers mummified by the dry Antarctic air.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.580
But front and center on the teams’ mind

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.630
was the new complexity of this year’s challenge. There were new weather patterns 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
to decipher, new training exercises to prepare the pilots for landing

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.730
on a floating sea ice runway, and a host of new regulations for operating

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.750
out of McMurdo. Adding to the challenge: a runway 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.780
wasstarting to melt away as summer approached.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.800
Even with these challenges and a shortened schedule, the team was able to measure 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.810
the sea ice of the Ross Sea, along with land ice

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.850
the Siple Coast, the Dome C / Lake Vostok region, 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.910
along the Trans Antarctic Mountains, and over Victoria Land.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.920
IceBridge demonstrated it could operate out of this new region and plans to go back 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.000
in 2015. But the network of NASA, university,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.020
and international partners who use IceBridge data also

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.070
want to see how things have changed in the Antarctic Peninsula, on the Ronne Ice Shelf,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.130
and in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, so they're returning

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.150
to operation out of Punta Arenas, Chile once again this year.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.180
[music]

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.780
[beep beep, beep beep]
