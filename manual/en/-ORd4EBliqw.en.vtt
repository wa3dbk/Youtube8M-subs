00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.650
Okay so today we're going to make a classic traditional fish and chips

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.200
with one of my favorite fish; cod. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.260
The first thing you need to do is to get the chips on,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.930
you want to simmer them for about 5 minutes, drain them and let them

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.600
cool naturally in the air before we fry them. The best thing to do 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.080
is to do that a couple of hours before, because I think it's nicer to 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.300
have a dry chip before you put it in the fryer, and you get a crispy finish.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.140
So put the potatoes in to the cold water, the reason for that, 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.030
if you put them into hot boiling water, you end up with all the potatoes breaking

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.700
and still raw in the center. We want them cooked right through. 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.460
The next thing we're going to do is make the tartar sauce, the first thing to do is make a classic

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.790
mayonnaise. Now mayonnaise's are emulsions, so you're emulsifying 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.220
egg yolk with acid and oil.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.230
You have to make sure you do it slowly at first otherwise you will split

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.650
the ingredients.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.550
Firstly you split your eggs

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.501
We've got 3 egg yolks

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:10.941
and we need to take our english mustard

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.300
a couple of dashes of white wine vinegar

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.680
Now obviously whisking by hand

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.800
is quite an arduous job, so to help you, the best thing to do 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.409
is to get a wet tea towel and form a little circle

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.840
and that'll hold the bowl in place

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.840
so it gives you a free hand to put your oil in. 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.930
So slowly we add the oil a few drops at a time

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.430
if you were to split it, basically you take the split

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.690
ingredients, get a fresh egg yolk and put it into a new bowl

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.030
with a little dash of vinegar and start the whole process again 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.010
adding the split mixture and you'll have success with a freshly emulsified mayonnaise.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.900
So that's all the oil incorporated

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.040
and what you're looking for is the consistency of very thick custard.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.000
If you like it a little bit thicker you can add more oil

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.440
if you like it a little bit looser you just add less oil.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.820
So once you've got your mayonnaise made to the consistency you like

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.280
the next thing we need to do is chop the capers

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.020
and the gherkins and get the herbs in there. 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.520
Which is the tarragon, the chervil, the parsley and the chives

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.100
and you're going to add all of them into the mayonnaise.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.980
Sometimes when you add the ingredients to the mayonnaise

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.980
the vinegar will let the mayonnaise down so you may have to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.500
add a little bit more oil to it.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.040
Ok, so at this point we need to add the salt and pepper.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.160
So, the most important part is to taste the tartar sauce.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.360
If you're happy with it, get it in the fridge until we've finished cooking. 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.980
So whist you're making the tartar sauce keep an eye on your chips

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.980
When you insert your knife it's a little bit soft but still a little bit of firmness. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.120
When you get to that stage, it's about 6 minutes, you're going to take them off,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.780
drain them, and put them on to a tray to cool down.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.500
Next thing is the beer batter. So we've got some flour, sugar

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.530
and some fresh yeast and also some Doom bar beer 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.580
which is one of my favorites. You can use larger or any other beer

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.940
but Doom bar is for me. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.280
So, firstly you add the flour and the sugar

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.520
then we crumble in our fresh yeast

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.360
and then gently we add the beer. 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.900
What you're after is nice smooth batter. If you added all the beer at once

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.130
you wouldn't get a chance to make paste
first.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.350
You're after a paste first otherwise you end up with lumps

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.320
Finally we add a little bit of salt

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.800
and a touch of pepper.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.720
Then we cover that with a tea towel and leave it for 10 minutes

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.610
before we cook with it.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.740
The reason why I like cod for fish and chips is

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.960
because it has lovely, white, flaky, pearly,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.340
sort of flesh and it works very well with fish and chips.  

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.420
Ok so this is how you may get your fish from the fishmongers

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.260
at this stage you may still have the skin on it

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.120
and you'll still have a few pin bones in there that you really want to remove, 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.950
because they will get stuck in your throat so an easy way to do that without a struggle  

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.700
with pliers, but cut them out. With fish and chips that is perfectly acceptable. 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.460
And to skin it, I'll show you now the easiest way is to 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.360
come along the center where the bones are, like so. 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.120
As you can see you've still got the skin on there

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.400
what you've got is something workable. 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.630
So, knife in at the end to the skin, and there you have the skin at the bottom. 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.080
All you need to do is firmly hold on to the bit where you've cut.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.320
Don't move it, and use a sharp knife to come all the way along the fillet 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.060
Like so. 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.470
Then what you've got is a lovely loin of cod

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.370
which you now can portion for your fish and chips. 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.600
So the bottom side, 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.550
which is the belly of the fillet, just remove all of this, it's just like a sinew.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.220
It's the actual inside of the belly,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.440
which is not very nice to eat, we'll remove that. 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.600
And then the bones are still in there, so we just need to find where the bones are,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.240
using your sharp knife come along the center again

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.560
just cutting the bones out 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.880
and then the same as we did before just cutting at the bottom, bring

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.020
your knife along holding onto the skin.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.860
Let the knife do the work. 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.860
You can get 4 nice pieces out of one fillet,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.040
for your fish and chips, all those trimmings that you've got left over

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.810
don't throw them away, stick them in your freezer, when you've got enough make 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.270
yourself a lovely fish pie. 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.720
Ok so I've got my fish ready. So the first thing you do

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.610
is get your chips into the fryer, to get them coloured off first.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.730
Otherwise you're going to be struggling for room in your fryer

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.220
So the fryer is hot on 180 degrees

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.429
now, we'll seal them off for about 4 minutes

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:08.660
so they can start to colour up before we take them out

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.240
let them cool slightly while we put the fish in. 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.400
So whilst the chips are cooking for 4 minutes we'll get on with the cod. 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.970
We take our batter which has been resting for about 10 minutes, 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.220
and then we'll get some flour with a little 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.460
bit of salt in there and a touch of pepper. 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.500
And then just pass your cod fillet through the flour, knock off any excess

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.920
You don't want any layers of raw flour in there

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.160
and then into the batter.

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.699
Ok so the chips have been colouring off now about 4 minutes

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.279
so we'll take them off to drain. 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.080
And now you put the cod in

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.570
Leave the cod in there for about 2 minutes, and then we'll turn them over

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.790
and cook for another 3 or 4 minutes before we add the chips back in

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.570
and then hopefully we'll come out with something nice and golden brown. 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.980
The cod's about 3 or 4 minutes away now so I'm going to add the chips back in

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.620
just to finish them off 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.300
If you don't have a deep fat fryer you can simply breadcrumb the cod

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.620
by putting it though flour, egg and breadcrumbs and then shallow fry it

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.550
in a hot pan, and you'll get roughly the same result

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.190
but it is worth getting a deep fat fryer because fish and chips is all about the deep fat fryer

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.540
First thing you do is add a little bit of salt

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.400
Drain off our peas

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.220
Wedge of lemon, 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.020
our cod,

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.630
beautiful crispy chips,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.600
our peas,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.990
then lovely thick tartar sauce

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.900
and there you have it, that's my 

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.060
cod and chips with tartar sauce and fresh peas.
