00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.120
A year ago, Kanchana Jindatham lost
her leg in a motorcycle crash.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.720
She was just 15 and thought
her life was doomed.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.920
Her boyfriend rejected her,
and for a long time

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.720
she didn't leave her home in
Chiang Rai in northern Thailand.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.360
Her mother helps her walk
with a new artificial leg.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.160
It's made from recycled
soda cans and plastic,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.080
and although it's tricky at first,
it's given her hope. 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.800
The leg makes me feel
a lot more comfortable,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.640
because I can walk by myself.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.040
I don't feel like I am a
burden on anyone. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.280
I can do everything much more easily,
and I can do things by myself.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
Nearly 200 km away in Chiang Mai,
technicians at the Prostheses Foundation

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 are busy making artificial legs.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.080
The group has built limbs free of 
charge for over 20 thousand amputees

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.600
 over the past 20 years.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.800
 Each limb is a sophisticated work of 
technical and artistic craftsmanship.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.080
Legs are molded in sand casts and
specially fitted for each amputee.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.160
What's even more unique is the limbs
are made from 80% recycled materials.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.560
The foundation appealed for aluminum
that could be made into limb parts.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.360
People around the world started sending
in soda cans, bottle tops and rings,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.800
and the stockpile quickly overflowed. 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.560
Instead of smelting the aluminum, they
now trade it for top-grade aluminum

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.400
that is used to make artificial limb parts.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.960
Some joints are still made from
stainless steel, because it's stronger,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.840
 but most of the leg parts are
made from recycled aluminum.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.800
The group has already started giving
limbs to people across Southeast Asia,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.440
and hopes to spread the 
technology around the world.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.080
Using aluminum helps disabled people
receive good quality limbs. 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.720
They will have a better quality of life
and can be of greater benefit to society.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.600
Recycled plastics are also a big part of the mix.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.720
Most prosthetic makers in the West
refuse to use recycled materials. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.240
They say they aren't sturdy enough and
don't last as long as new materials.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.480
But here in Thailand,
the process is working.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.200
Nearly 60% of all Thais are farmers,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.440
so the group designed
a foot just for them.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.320
It's durable, grips the ground well
and can be worn in water, mud, animal pens

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.640
 and even climbing trees or mountains.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.200
Without donated limbs, many in
Thailand are forced to walk with crutches

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520
 or build their own limbs
with wood or bamboo.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.400
To make limbs for the masses, the
group's founder, Dr. Therdchai Jivacate,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.640
 had to cut costs.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.680
Turning to recycled goods helped him
stop importing expensive materials.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.200
Before the foundation came up with
this technique, artificial limbs

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.200
were simply too expensive for many.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.040
Most of the amputees that I took care
of could not have the artificial legs. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.920
The ones who are rich, they can go
to Bangkok and get the leg in Bangkok. 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.760
But the ones who are poor, you know,
they have to, they have no leg.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.760
 Most of the technicians
have also lost limbs.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.400
They wear their own custom-designed
legs and many are keen to give back.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.800
When they wear the prosthesis, it
shouldn't be too tight or too loose.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.920
 It should fit just right and shouldn't
hurt the person who wears it. 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.760
I am really pleased and 
willing to help them,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.840
because we are the same.
I'm also disabled.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680
I ask them, is it 
comfortable? Does it hurt?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.040
For those who get new limbs, it's
a chance to gain a second life.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.560
Twenty-eight-year-old Pornphrom
Rachchakiri got her first artificial leg

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.320
13 years ago, after she was in a car crash.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.040
Today she's come in for a tune-up.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.840
She says the technicians are unique,
because more than half are disabled

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.120
 and wear the prosthethetics.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.720
When we try the limbs and it hurts,
we can tell the disabled technicians.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.760
It's like having a heart-to-heart.
We don't have to say very much,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.040
 and they understand.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.880
The adjustment goes well. Pornphrom
can walk out of the clinic. 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.320
This act alone is something she
and many others like her

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.200
never imagined would be possible.
