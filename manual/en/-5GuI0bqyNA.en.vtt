00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.710
Today I want to show you the new Sucker's Channel website!

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.950
It can be found at: www.canaldootario.com.br or just canldootario.com [in Portuguese]

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.189
Woooow, that's coooooool!

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.590
The website was completely restructured...

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.810
and it's much easier to navigate and to find informations that you're looking for

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.320
Beyond this, it's totally responsive... i.e., it fits automatically

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.879
to different screen sizes or devices.
So, if you're using a tablet

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.960
you'll see like this... 
Or this, if you're using a cell phone!

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.040
Well... i'll take a brief tour with you!

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.269
In the main page or homepage, we can see a general summary of everything that you can find in the website...

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.040
Like last videos, censored videos,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.299
which now occupy a featured position here in this side!

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.180
So the people don't need to look for

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.350
or trying to remember which videos were censored. It's everything here...

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.350
there's also a followers or subscribers counter on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.189
The last five news of the blog, beyond random notices

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.479
that were posted on the blog in different times!

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.479
There's also a space for the last tweets or retweets that i've done in my Twitter

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.350

This here is a Instagram photo gallery, 
so you can see the pictures from

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.799

Instagram, but who wants, can follow me

on Instagram, it's free!

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.549
And in the footer of all pages you'll find
this structure

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.460
with censored videos.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.060

the channel financially through donations

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.100

people that probably you alrealdy know,
once in a while'll write some posts,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.380
putting their opinion about some subjects 
that i approach on Sucker's Channel, like misleading advertising,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.450
deceptions in general or censorship.
And this'll be a veru interesting opportunity

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.100
to increase our knowledge and hear 
different opinions.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.410
One thing that i haven't said yet is that, 
all pages have a sidebar

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.660
with some posts or highlighted subjects, 
some categories...

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.100
Finally, it's just to facilitate the people 
to find informations

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.330
From the main menu it's possible to 
access the Sucker's Channel Store,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.920
where you can find adhesives, toys, 
keychains and other products

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.920
In the 'Contact' menu, 
besides u sent me some document,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.690
complaint or denunciation in writing to 
may mailbox,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.700
you can send me a message, 
through this form

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.110
Oh, i almost forgot, 
there's this top menu up here,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.280
where it's possible to access the download area,
and download the Sucker's mask,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.130
or assemble the Sucker's paper toy, all for free!
Later i want to add here the android app

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.880
for the Sucker's Channel, 
up there you can also access the games area

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.880
of Sucker's Channel, that for the moment 
there are 3 games...

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.390
Like this one, remembering Pac-Man

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:51.390
I'm still thinking in create 
a forum of Sucker's Channel, that i'll leave here

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.620
in this top menu...
With this, it'll be possible you help me

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.430
with a slightly more active way with researches of even 
in the elaboration of the new videos scripts!

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.790
But i need to search more
how these forums work, or what would be the more

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.160
appropriate to install on the website

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.270
Oh, and there's also the researches area, here you 
can search any subject that

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.850
