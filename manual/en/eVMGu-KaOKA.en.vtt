My name is Ryan Parker, Parker Home Renovations
in New Braunfels, Texas and today I am going

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.840
to teach you how to hang a towel bar. The
first thing you are going to need when hanging

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.400
a towel bar is you will need a screwdriver
or a screw gun of some sort and you will need

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.770
the towel bar and the towel bar assembly.
It usually comes together in the same package.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.740
Now, if you are hanging a towel bar the first
thing you need to do is find a good location.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.670
Where you actually want the towel bar. Then
you are going to want to try to find a stud

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.539
in the wall if you can in that general area.
If not you can always use drywall anchors

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:43.339
like this and what you do with these drywall
anchors is you will drill a hole in the wall

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:49.100
the size of the bottom side of this drywall
anchor. You stick the anchor in the wall and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.719
then when you are fastening something to the
anchor you screw it in the anchor and basically

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.140
it spreads these little wings out to hold
the anchor in place. Okay, so what you are

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.679
going to need to do is you are going to need
to take your towel bar and you will want to

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:11.420
measure the distance of the towel bar from
the mounting brackets. Then, you are going

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.130
to want to go to the wall where you want it
mounted and you are going to want to measure

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.240
from one side to the other the same distance
to the middle of these mounting brackets and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.570
you want to make sure that they are level.
So stick a level on it to make sure your marks

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.590
are level. Put marks there. Then you take
the mounting bracket part of the towel bar.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.409
You will center it on your mark. You will
drill your holes. Push your drywall anchors

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.420
or if you caught a stud you can just screw
straight into the stud and mount your two

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.690
mounting brackets on the two places where
you marked. Then you want to assemble your

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.120
towel bar so you will slide whatever mounting
plates you have over the assembly and slide

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:10.819
the towel bar back onto the mounting brackets.
Now this towel bar has a little Allen setscrew

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.349
right here that once you get it back on the
mounting assembly you tighten that set screw

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.349
down and that keeps the towel bar from pulling
back out of the wall. Now, another trick you

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.060
can do these towel bars tend to turn. They
are designed that way so when you pull a towel

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.130
off it rotates. You can put a drip of silicone
on each end to keep it from turning if that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.670
bothers you.
