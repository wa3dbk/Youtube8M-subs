00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.630
We use plastics for so many
things, water bottles, milk

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.630
jugs, plastic bags to carry
our groceries, forks, knives,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.110
coffee-cup lids,
even shopping carts.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.410
We use plastics
for so many things.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.820
With so much plastic all around
us, have you ever thought,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.010
what is a plastic?

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.370
If we zoom in really
close on a plastic,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.800
we would find that it looks
like a chain of small units.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.960
One of these little units
is called a monomer.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.150
Each of these little
units, or monomers,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.680
are connected to other
monomers forming a long chain.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.050
This chain is called a polymer.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.690
Lots of these polymer
chains get grouped together,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.750
sort of like
spaghetti on a plate,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.060
and that makes up the plastic.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.070
Plastic polymers
are usually made

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.360
from oil, which is the
same stuff that makes

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.910
the gas we use in our cars.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.310
Well, how long does it
take all of this plastic

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.580
we use to break down?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.320
It takes 1,000 years
or more for plastic

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.950
to break down when
we throw it away.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.670
What if we could engineer
new materials that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.770
could break down easier?

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.310
Well, fruits and vegetables
break down or rot very

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.190
easily when they're
left out over time.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.470
In fact, they only take
three to four weeks

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.440
to break down when
they're thrown away.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.830
What if we could make plastic
out of fruits and vegetables?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.870
So today, we're going
to make potato plastic.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.710
We're going to make
it in the lab here,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.293
but these are all
ingredients that you

00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:33.790
can find in the grocery store
and do this yourself at home.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.870
If you decide to
do this at home,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.470
make sure you have
an adult supervisor.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.540
This is our starch.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.960
This will be the
backbone of our plastic.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.360
It is a molecule that's made
up of a chain of sugars,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.380
and you can get this from
potatoes when you boil them.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.770
It's that milky, white water.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.840
You can also find starch
in corn, rice, or tapioca.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.440
We're going to use water to
mix up all the ingredients

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.220
and help loosen up all of
those long starch chains

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.220
to help make our plastic.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.600
Vinegar helps break
the starch chains

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.540
into smaller sizes, which
make them more manageable

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.610
while creating plastic.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.260
Glycerin helps make the
chains of starch slip

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.590
along each other, which help
make the plastic material more

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.670
flexible.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.250
We'll also need vegetable
oil and food coloring just

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.470
for our baking needs.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.120
Measure out 10 grams, or about
1 tablespoon, of potato starch.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.065
Add the starch to the beaker.

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:35.320
To this we'll add 60
milliliters of tap water.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.020
Add 5 milliliters of vinegar.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.810
Add 5 milliliters of glycerin.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.160
It's very thick, so it might
take a while to pour out.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.820
Add three drops of your
favorite food coloring to make

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.810
a very exciting plastic.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.080
To get this solution
to turn into plastic,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.850
we're going to add heat.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.120
When you're doing this
at home on a stove,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.420
be careful not to
touch any hot surfaces

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.060
or handle hot liquids directly.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.670
Stir the solution
continuously on heat.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.850
As it starts to
thicken, raise the heat

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.140
from low to medium up to high.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.840
This might take some time,
so consider asking a friend

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.850
to help you stir.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.280
Once it finally thickens,
allow the solution

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.220
to boil on medium-high heat
for another five minutes.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.680
You can see how the
solution has darkened a lot

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.660
and has become very thick
and hard to move around.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.930
Allow the mixture to
cool for a couple minutes

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.430
so it's easy to handle.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.220
Grease the pans or
molds that you'll

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.490
use to scoop out your plastic
with a little bit of oil.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.890
This will make it easy to remove
the plastic once it's dry.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.600
Scoop the mixture into
your mold and go ahead

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.390
and spread it out as
thin or thick as you

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.270
want your final plastic to be.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.880
Stick the plates into
the oven at 65 degrees

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.790
Celsius, or 150
degrees Fahrenheit,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.340
for one to two hours.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.190
Now let's zoom in
and take a look

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.570
at what's happening
to our polymer.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.390
So earlier we talked about
an oil-based plastic.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.680
But here we've made our
plastic from potato starch.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.380
The dried starch powder
is a bundle of polymers.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.090
We add it to water to
loosen up those bundles.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.420
Some of the starch polymer
has branches on it,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.790
which makes it difficult
to form a good plastic.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.740
We add vinegar to cut
off those branches

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.110
and make a linear
polymer called amylose.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.580
If we just made plastic from
this linear polymer amylose,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.730
we would get a
very rigid plastic.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.920
We add glycerin to make
the plastic more flexible.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Now let's go see what it
looks like when we take

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.560
the plastic out of the oven.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.480
If you add less
glycerine, you'll

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.740
get a plastic that's
somewhat hard and rigid.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.640
If you add more glycerin,
you'll get a plastic that's

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.720
more flexible and bendable.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.850
So depending on how
much glycerin you add,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.530
you can create plastics
depending on your needs.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.550
Now, the key reason why we chose
to use starch as our polymer

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.680
is that it's biodegradable.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.240
That means natural
organisms like bacteria

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.640
are capable of breaking down
the material into smaller parts.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.550
In this case, we take
a polymer, our starch,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.910
and break it down into
its monomer parts,

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.060
in this case, simple sugars.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.470
Sugars are a vital energy
source for all living organisms.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.590
As a result, many organisms,
from bacteria to humans,

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.780
have enzymes that break
starch into simple sugars.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.510
Let's take a closer look
at how this is done.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.030
The starch polymer is made
up of chains of simple sugar

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.680
monomers called glucose.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.670
The bonds that connect them
are called glycosidic bonds.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.300
An enzyme called amylase
helps break the sugars apart

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.950
from each other by fitting
between two monomers.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.820
A water molecule is
absorbed in order

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.370
to break the glycosidic
bond between two monomers

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.760
in a process called hydrolysis.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.610
Let's test whether our
bioplastic is biodegradable.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.200
To do this in the lab, we'll
need an amylase enzyme,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.320
which will help break down
the starch into simple sugars.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.060
This is actually a
concentrated form

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.140
of the same stuff you'll
find in your own spit.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:29.960
Add the amylase enzyme to
water, give the mixture a stir,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.870
and finally add the potato
plastic to the mixture.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.910
We left this sample overnight,
along with a control sample

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.020
with just water.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.000
The control is there to see
if water alone breaks up

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.130
the sample.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.850
Notice how the plastic
in the amylase breaks up.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.600
Here, let's take a closer look.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.760
This is what our plastic
looked like before we

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.520
biodegraded them.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.910
And this is what they look
like after we biodegraded them.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.110
Again, notice how the sample
that was in the amylase enzyme

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.080
broke apart and degraded much
faster than the plastic that

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.840
was just in water.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.490
So we've just
demonstrated that we

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.860
can make a plastic that degrades
in a matter of days as opposed

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.500
to thousands of years.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.320
So with a little bit of
thought, it's possible for us

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.570
to engineer better
plastics for our planet.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.620
