Ernie Banks:
I look at my life
and look back,

00:00:01.892 --> 00:00:03.958
and what have I done?

00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:07.091
I think that we all do that
as we get older in life,

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:08.892
we look at, "What have I done?

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:09.991
What have I accomplished?

00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:11.224
What have I changed?

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:15.258
What has been the difference
that I made in people's lives?"

00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:18.224
And I think about baseball.

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:21.224
I mean, America's
greatest pastime.

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:24.858
And maybe that's it,
you know, hit the baseball,

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.991
going to catch it,
playing against another team,

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:32.625
playing against other players, 
and then it's over.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.124
And what have I really done?

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:39.124
I mean, they show the records,
you won MVP awards,

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:41.458
you did this, you did that.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.425
So it's very special as
I think about it in my life.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:47.958
What in the world have I done

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.725
to receive this wonderful honor

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:53.725
as one of the greatest
citizens in this country?

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:58.058
Do something with
your life, do something,

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.024
get out here and do something.

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:04.391
That's my next message
to young people.

00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:07.358
Education was one
of my precious things.

00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:10.825
I went back to school after
I retired, went to Northwestern,

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:14.491
University of Chicago, Arizona
State, Columbia College,

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:19.258
it was just a voracious 
appetite to learn,

00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:20.625
you know, get knowledge.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:25.358
Science, technology,
engineering, and math --

00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:27.991
STEM program they call it.

00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:34.158
And I want to train kids in math
and science since high school

00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:37.925
to be good enough to go to MIT
and become a nuclear physicist.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:40.124
That's my thinking.

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:44.758
Train young people that are
good in math and science,

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:51.458
and they should be, to go to MIT
to become a nuclear physicist

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:53.658
to save this world.
