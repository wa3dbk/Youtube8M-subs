Hi, this is Yolanda from vanveenbulbs.com.
And in this segment, we're going to learn

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.570
about how to build a raised bed. Now, there's
lots of different ways to build a raised bed,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.850
but probably the easiest way that I have found
to build that raised bed is just to lay some

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.510
wood out in a big square, and fill it with
some compost, and I always use some weed barrier

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.980
on the bottom, so the water can go through
it but the weeds don't grow up through it

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.160
and the gophers and the moles don't get through
it either. So it works really well. And I'll

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.610
show you right here what I've done. So these
aren't even connected, these pieces of wood.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.090
We could just got probably 8 feet long pieces.
I've got two 8s by two 4 feet pieces, and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.340
they just fit really well. And I just put
'em into a big rectangle, and I've got my

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.070
weed barrier cloth underneath, and then we've
just put lots of compost in here, and filled

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.960
it up to at least four or five inches. And
we've actually dug down a little bit deeper

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.299
than the level of the gravel, so the bed itself
is probably six inches deep. So we've actually

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.570
dug it out a little bit because then then
we have a little more room for the roots to

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:21.249
grow, and for the bed to have some nice, lush
dirt in it. And it's really simple to do and

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:26.810
you can build a raised bed pretty much anywhere.
You don't have to have wood, even, you could

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.710
surround it by rocks, and lots of different
garden centers will sell rocks, and landscape

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.909
companies, and even gravel pits if you live
anywhere near one. But there's lots of different

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.640
ways to do it. You can use brick, you can
just make put your weed barrier cloth down

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.369
and then just put rows of brick, and the next
thing you know, you have great, great flower

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.700
beds. So building a raised bed is easy to
do, and you can make it formal or informal.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.340
I know people that have used stainless steel
because it bends and made circular beds, and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.220
you can use pretty much any material, and
recycling's always a good thing. So go out

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.770
there and set aside an area for a raised bed,
and go to it, and before long you going to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.560
have a beautiful garden.
