00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.630
Alan Moore, you baggy-eyed Bolshevik, shut
your aging hippie yap.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.570
I find it supremely ironic that this contrarian
bullshit-artist feels its his own personal

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.720
purview to 'call out' comic fans for enjoying
concepts and stories he claims 'have not matured

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.730
since 1967', particularly due to this man's
politics, dress, worldview, and preoccupation

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
with snubbing his nose at perceived 'authority
figures' that haven't been in power since

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.110
the year 19-fucking-67! Treebeard!

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.130
The world no longer conspires to preclude
you, your life partner, or any other noxious

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.460
simp at the anarcho-syndicalist commune within
which you presumably dwell how to carry out

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.080
the declining years of a declining career
of a sloping forehead.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.350
And I'll add, Rip Van Hipster: The Watchmen?

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.670
It's shit.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.090
The graphic novel itself, the film it's based
on, the socialist pabulum expressed therein,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.940
and the borderline Moebius plagiaris-- I mean
artwork... of artist Dave Gibbons.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.220
It's a generic story expressing generic ideas,
written by a shriveled simu-golem who has

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.759
never once found himself in danger of the
expression of an original fucking thought.

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.220
You're a mediocre hack in a field awash with
mediocre hacks, and the only reason anyone

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.619
with common sense ever truly finds themselves
taking exception to your unique, briny blend

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.859
of pretentious horseshit... is because the
rest of the world - for whatever baffling

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.689
reason - regards your output as something
other than the supremely vapid tripe it truly

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:33.689
is.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.920
To your credit, even you have called your
work out as being one-dimensional and derivative.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770
Alan Moore doesn't like the Killing Joke.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.939
Which is great to hear!

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.020
Neither do I!

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.409
It's an origin story with no fucking origin
in it!

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.720
Glad to find we can see eye-to-eyebag on something!

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.030
Oh, and thanks again for performing cellular
mitosis and shitting out an even less talented

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.030
version of yourself.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.960
We're all loving the shit out of Grant Morrison's
incoherent, self-important über-tripe!

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.719
You know, truly meaningful socratic theses
with titles like 'Dinosaurs vs. Aliens'.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.359
Which frankly sounds more like a fight between
Alan Moore and his gardener than the title

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.829
of a fuckin' graphic novel!

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.490
That's one hell of a protegé, pal.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.540
A true pioneer of the Alan Moore Method.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.900
'What comprises the Alan Moore comic writing
method?' you sheepishly inquire.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.270
The Alan Moore Method, my friends, is when
you swallow a North Korean supertanker of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.460
blotter acid and then pretend the one-note
caricatures you inevitably pinch out in the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.000
inebriated aftermath is 'a neo-surrealistic
portrait of contemporary morasse.'

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.320
No, asshole.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.320
It isn't.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.230
It's fucking SEAGUY, and it goddamn eats.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.710
Write a fuckin' comic instead of frantically
scrambling to perpetually remain no less than

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.950
five feet ahead of the 'cool curve'.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.950
Fuck you very much.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.250
Oh, what's that, Alan?

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.030
You've founded your own neo-shamanistic Snake
Cult?

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.030
That's profoundly edgy.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.850
In the the mid-'60s, asshole.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.650
The world has moved the fuck on.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.650
Come along, Alan!

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.320
Join in our reindeer games!

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.260
I swear to whatever bundle of twigs Alan Moore
worships out of spite, this man would drink

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.940
his own piss if he thought it would piss off
Margaret Thatcher's corpse.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.270
"People who enjoy superheroes are emotionally
deranged and childish', you say?

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.751
Capital stuff, coming from the guy who participated
in a full-length documentary on the life and

00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:16.230
career of Steve Ditko, only to dedicate its
entire runtime to bashing the man and his

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.030
politics, knowing full well he would never
publicly rebuff your incredibly pedestrian

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.030
worldview.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.270
I hate to break it to you, Alan... but that's
not only childish... it's the intellectual

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.070
equivalent of 'Duck-Duck-Goose'.
...and now I need two gallons of Mind Bleach

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.370
to sear away the mental image of a fully bearded
Alan Moore playing 'Duck-Duck-Goose'.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.560
I'm RazörFist.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.360
God - fuckin' - speed!
