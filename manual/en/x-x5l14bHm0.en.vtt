00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.051
My name is Arzoo. I'm in the final year of my Pharmacy degree

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:09.871
What attracted me to Kingston was the open day that I attended before starting at the university.

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:14.553
I remember we had a tour by Professor Cairns and he really sold the course to us.

00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:21.695
We had a chance to go into the labs, have a go at dispensing some pills and talk to the students.

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:31.051
They really enjoy their time here. What they told us, was that we get the chance to have placements right from our first year of the degree.

00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:34.294
I really liked that point because not all pharmacy schools were offering that at the time.

00:00:34.294 --> 00:00:43.408
I really liked the area that Kingston was in. I've always wanted to study in London so it was a good chance to come and study here.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.829
What I really liked about the course was the clinical aspects which you study in the third and fourth year.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.485
I really want to work as a hospital pharmacist. So it's been fantastic we've so much clinical knowledge

00:00:56.485 --> 00:01:02.886
and the fact that we get to spend a week in a hospital setting or community, if thats's what you want to go into. 

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:08.603
Just to get more of a feel of what the career demands.

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:13.450
The teachers here are excellent. The tutors are really helpful.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.427
You do over time build a bond and they treat you like a professional.

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:24.757
We have good facilities here. We've got the LRC. When I started the John Galwsworthy building was a brand new facility.

00:01:24.757 --> 00:01:29.332
It's pretty cool. You can go in if the rooms are empty and you need a quiet place to study

00:01:29.332 --> 00:01:31.574
and the library is to crowded you can go in there.

00:01:31.574 --> 00:01:36.149
Student life here is pretty good. We're a five minute walk from the town centre

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.922
We've got a river running behind the uni. So there's quite a lot of stuff to do.

00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:46.640
We have a fantastic Pharmacy Society here. They organise a lot of social events every year.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.260
We have a fantastic Ball. Last year we had a masquerade theme. This year we got an Oscars and Hollywood theme with the billboards and everything.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:04.190
It's a nice opportunity to get to know other people on the course across the years,

00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:08.220
get to know your teachers. Because obviously, they are all invited to the ball.

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:11.960
It's nice to see everybody outside of uni. Dressed up and having a good time.

00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:18.670
Coursework wise, there is a lot to do. It's not easy, but you just need to pace yourself. 

00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:23.110
Which is good, because it prepares you for when you will be practising as a pharmacist.

00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:26.960
Time management is one of the essential skills you will need.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.470
You do a lot of group work. You have a lot of presentations to do right from the start.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:39.720
I think that was quite nerve racking. Because you're not really used to that, depending on what high school or college you went to.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.340
It builds your skills up for your final year when you need to present your project

00:02:44.342 --> 00:02:48.430
and your posters, to your whole year group and tutors

00:02:48.428 --> 00:02:54.510
It builds your confidence up so you are not so scared in presenting. Because your project will be a big thing anyway.

00:02:54.514 --> 00:03:01.410
I am doing my project in hospital because I wanted to go into hospital. We've got fantastic support from our tutors at the hospital

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:08.760
as well as the tutors in university. You can go and see them as much as you like and they help you as much as they can

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.020
They really push you to get the best grade you possibly can.

00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:17.470
So if you like having fun. If you like meeting people and you want to study for a professional degree,

00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:23.660
I think pharmacy is a fantastic choice and Kingston University is a really good place to do it.

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:27.890
They offer you opportunities other places don't. Such as placements right from the start.

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:31.470
You have two every year. A week long placement in your third year.

00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:38.220
When it comes to doing assignmements, the library has access to a lot of journals that other universities don't always have access to.

00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:40.670
So you don't have to pay to get the information that you need.

00:03:41.213 --> 00:03:45.980
So there is a lot of support available and it really does help you achieve your full potential.
