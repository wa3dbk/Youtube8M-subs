00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.870
Say hello to the new Audi RS7 and its arch-rival,
the BMW M6 Gran Coupe.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.050
Both are powered by turbocharged V8 engines
and have over 500bhp -but do they really justify

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.160
their nearly £100,000 price tags?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160
Let's find out.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.600
The BMW M6 costs just under £98,000 and features
a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 with 552bhp and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.879
680Nm of torque.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:43.160
It'll sprint from 0-60 in just 4.2 seconds
before hitting a limited top speed of 155mph.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.579
The Audi has a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 yet
despite being down on capacity compared to

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.520
the BMW it produces the same bhp and has even
more torque with a huge 700Nm.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.059
Once again top speed is limited to 155mph,
but it hits 60 in just 3.9 seconds.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:09.610
Time for a drag race - the Audi's got more
torque and it has four-wheel drive: the conditions

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.369
are really wet a greasy so it doesn't play
to the BMW's advantage.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.880
But let's see how we get on.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:28.380
The Audi's mighty off the line... already
70mph, 80... it's an easy win over the BMW.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.380
So, the Audi won - but straight line pace
is half the story.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.649
It's how the cars make you feel when you drive
them that's actually more important.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.119
What's the RS7 like to drive on a back road?

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.289
Well, the first thing is that it's so hard
to use the performance on the road - it's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:53.090
just warp speed fast so it does feel a little
faster than the M6 but it's so hard to utilise

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.090
it on the road.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.090
The one thing the Audi does have is obviously
with quattro all-wheel drive and that clever

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.280
sport differential - it doesn't have any of
the traction issues that you get in the M6.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.659
It doesn't work it's stability control as
hard.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.979
There's lots of grip but the problem is it's
just a bit inert - there's not a lot of feel

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.270
in the steering, a bit of a disconnect between
the steering and you don't get any sense of

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.040
the road.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.430
Also, the suspension is a bit odd.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.209
The ride isn't great - in fact it's pretty
awful - and all in all it's not a particularly

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.870
engaging car despite its speed and it's not
as comfortable as the BMW.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:37.590
It's quite hard to love this car despite the
fact that the engine is so great.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.140
Overall the Audi, while incredibly capable,
left me feeling a little cold.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.579
Hopefully the BMW will be more fun.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.349
Ok, so how does the BMW compare?

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.680
Well we know it lost in the drag race but
in reality that's because of the wet conditions

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.590
and the fact it's rear-wheel drive and the
Audi got that 4wd traction.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.459
In the real world both of these cars feel
stupendously quick.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.599
If anything the BMW engine has a little bit
more character than the Audi engine and there's

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.720
certainly more character to the driving experience.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.810
It's not perfect and it troubles the traction
control quite a lot on a wet road and with

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.659
it off you've got to have some pretty sharp
reactions to catch the slides.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.849
It's just a bit more lively and you can enjoy
it more, the steering is better - a bit softer

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.040
than the Audi but in the comfort modes it
rides better than the Audi too.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.510
It's just a little bit more engaging to drive.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.680
The biggest problem for this car in a way,
though isn't the Audi - it's the M6's sister

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.310
car, the M5.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.319
This car is substantially more expensive than
the M5 - about £25,000 more than an M5 - and

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.500
it doesn't offer a huge amount more in terms
of driving.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.900
It's hard to justify it - but I think it looks
great.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.609
So the BMW is the best to drive but it's also
the nicest to sit in, with its stylish interior

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.550
and sporty wrap-around cockpit.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.819
The Audi's still feels posh and is loaded
with gadgets but it lacks the BMW's wow factor.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.760
With its hatchback boot the Audi is the more
practical of the pair.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.129
So the Audi is faster and more practical,
but the BMW's better to drive and looks more

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.139
exclusive - so which one should you choose?

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:15.599
It might cost a lot more money than the BMW
M5 but we'd go for the M6 Gran Coupe - it

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.419
looks great, sounds fantastic and most importantly
it's more fun to drive than the Audi RS7.
