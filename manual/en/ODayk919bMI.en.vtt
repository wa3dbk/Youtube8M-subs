Review of the 3-in-1 Combination Plane

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.900
The design of the Indian- made SOBA shoulder
or rabbet plane is based on the pattern of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.609
a British shoulder plane made originally by
Preston, later by Record, and is currently

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.910
reproduced by Clifton. The most common use
of the plane is as a regular shoulder plane.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.329
However, if the long nose is removed - a bolt
keeps in it place - the plane becomes a chisel plane.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.540
And if installed with a short nose,
the plane is transformed into a bullnose plane.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.610
I bought mine at Garrett Wade in June 2012.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.680
Watch this review to learn more about the
plane and how to fine tune it. This will enable

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.590
you to turn your plane into a versatile shaving
tool.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.170
I began by placing a blade straight edge to
check the plane's sole for flatness.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.860
The sole was extremely flat so no additional flattening
was required. Then I checked the plane for

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.320
squareness between the sole and the side of
the plane. I used a machinist's square and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.280
here too the results showed that the plane's
sides are extremely square to the sole.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.510
The plane's shim and bullnose attachment
came with minor burrs from the machining process.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.510
I removed them by lapping the parts on fine
DMT diamond stones. I used a small square

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.460
to check the lever cap nose for squareness.
It was not perfectly square, off by a few degrees.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.460
To correct this I drew a square line
with a Sharpie pen and filed the extra metal

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.590
with a regular file, followed by a diamond
file.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.940
The blade's projection retrieving nut is
nested into a rectangular opening in the tail

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.590
of the blade. I had to file away the sharp
burrs on the rims of the opening to enable

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.439
for a smoother operation. I had to spend quite
a bit of time lapping the blade's back.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.049
It would be better if the blade makers would
make an extra effort to flatten it before

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.250
it leaves the factory.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.130
The critical features of these planes are
very good: flat sole , an accurate machining

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.160
of the blade's rim, very good fit of the
other components. Although you will have to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.630
spend an hour or two in order to bring the
plane to perfection, I think it's worth

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.599
your time. The Indian plane costs between
$70 to $80. In comparison, the British Clifton

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.530
costs around $260. I leave it up to you to
decide which one fits your needs and budget.
