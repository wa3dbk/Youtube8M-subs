00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.559
Hi. It's Mr. Andersen. And in this podcast
I'm going to talk about the domain Eukarya.

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.780
That's the domain that you belong to. Because
you, like a chimpanzee have a nucleus and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.780
have organelles. But so do a bumble bee. So
do these mushrooms. And this volvox. And these

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.330
flowers. And this yeast. We are all eukaryotic.
And so this is just the first in a number

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.960
of podcasts that are going to talk about the
diversity of eukaryotic life. And so what

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.900
is a eukaryotic life? It's basically things
that have a nucleus. So they've got their

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.010
DNA contained within a nucleus. They'll have
other things like endoplasmic reticulum. Or

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.310
golgi apparatus. Or mitochondria. But this
is the domain that you belong to. Remember

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.510
there are other two domains. We've got the
domain bacteria. And then we also have the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.370
domain archaebacteria. And I've already talked
about both of those. And so we are more related

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.130
to archaebacteria, if we look at this. So
basically we share a common ancestor more

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.930
recently then we do with bacteria. But again,
all life on our planet are going to have some

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.390
characteristics. We just happen to belong
to the domain eukarya. So what are some other

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.140
things that are found inside here? Animals
and fungi. But we're also going to have things

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.460
like slime molds, ciliates, flagellates. There's
a bunch of things that are found in the domain

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.770
eukarya. But we're more related to archaebacteria.
What are some of the characteristics of eukaryotic

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.200
cells? And here's just a typical animal like
cell. Well we're going to have nucleus. So

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.390
we're going to have this nucleus right here.
And the DNA is going to be found on the inside.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.430
And then we're going to subdivide work. So
we're going to have for example golgi apparatus

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.310
or endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria.
And so we're going to have organelles that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.330
do individual jobs. Also we're going to be
much larger then the cells of like a bacteria

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.630
for example. They just have their DNA in the
middle. And they do all the same jobs that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.850
we do, but we kind of divvy that up and give
it to different parts of the cells. What's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.520
another big characteristic that's different
in eukaryotic cells is going to be our chromosomes.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.150
Remember in bacteria and archaebacteria they're
chromosome is a simple loop. But in us it's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.469
going to be a linear stretch of DNA. There's
is a loop. Ours is chromosome after chromosome

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:23.430
after chromosome. And so it's linear stretches.
We also will have introns. Those are going

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.189
to be sections of our DNA that don't code
for genes. Whereas on their DNA every little

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.659
bit of it is going to code for something.
Another characteristic is going to be the

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.810
cytoskeleton. So the cytoskeleton, I'd point
to these right here, are going to give us

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.829
structure on the inside of the eukaryotic
cells. And now there is some structure in

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.859
bacteria and archaea, but it's not as definitive
as that found in the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.290
cells. How did they come to be? In other words
we think eukaryotic cells came much later.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.980
So how did we go from a simple cell to these
complex cells? Well there's two ways that

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.629
we got there. And the first way is what's
called the endosymbiotic theory of eukaryotic

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.379
evolution. That's a mouthful. It was first
proposed by Dr. Lynn Margulis in I think 1967.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.279
And basically what she said is that perhaps
cells became more complex by having certain

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:23.279
cells ingesting or forming symbiotic relationships
with prokaryotic cells. The two things that

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:31.109
she pointed to were the mitochondria and then
the chloroplasts. That in 1967 was craziness.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.709
But pretty much since then it's been accepted
as close to scientific fact as you can. And

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.419
so what we have are these mitochondria and
chloroplast which are almost, hijacked their

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.669
way into our cells. And they're living within
our cells. What's some evidence that would

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.959
be, that could support endosymbiotic theory?
Well, mitochondria and chloroplasts have their

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.409
own DNA. They have their own ribosomes. And
they resemble both genetically and morphologically

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:03.049
they resemble bacteria. And so basically cells
became more complex by grabbing two things.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.269
I would point to this and the chloroplasts
of the plant cell. And also to this, the mitochondria.

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.669
They became more complex that way. One of
my favorite quotes of Lynn Margulis is that

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.789
cells became more complex not through combat
or fighting each other, but through networking.

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.960
Through cooperation. Also they became more
complex by infolding. And so if think about,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.150
if we have a cell like this, what's one way
that it could be complex? Well we could simply

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.830
fold it in on the side. And once you fold
it in on the side, not only have you increased

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.810
the surface area, but you can give that organelle
different jobs. And so all of these things

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.150
from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus
to the lysosomes, all these things we think

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.060
were formed by infolding. And so those two
things gave us complexity in eukaryoitc cells.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.389
Both this endosymbiotic working together.
And then this infolding. What evidence would

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.669
we have that the endomembrane system was formed
through folding? Well the proteins on the

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.229
outside and the proteins on the inside are
going to be different. And so the proteins

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.400
on the outside, if we look on the inside of
a golgi apparatus, are actually going to be

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.490
found on the inside of that. If you imagine
it folding in. And those that were on the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.490
inside are actually on the outside of this.
And so that's pretty good evidence that endomembrane

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.289
systems formed through infolding. Now how
do they make energy? In other words, how do

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.759
they make a living? Well their metabolism
is going to be diverse in eukaryotic cells.

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:35.419
But two of the big things are going to be
this process where autotrophs, so things like

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.729
plants and algae, and bacteria fall into this
as well, are taking carbon dioxide, water

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.340
and using energy of the sun and converting
that to compounds. And then we have the reverse

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.520
in cellular respiration. And so pretty much
any niche on our planet is going to be filled

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.849
by eukaryotic cells. They're making a living
however they can. The way they reproduce is

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:02.229
going to be different though, between bacteria
and arachaeabacteria and bacteria. And so

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.939
basically they use the process of mitosis.
Mitosis remember is copying those chromosomes.

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.870
You can see our linear chromosomes, we're
copying it and then it's simply dividing in

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.650
half. And so we take one cell. In this case
this would be a diploid cell. And we're making

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.110
two diploid cells that are exactly the same.
And then we have meiosis. And so meiosis produces

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.599
gametes remember. In this case it could be
four sperm cells or it could produce just

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:31.680
one egg cell. But regardless, if you're something
like an anemone, so the would be an anemone

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.780
right here and you want to make a copy of
yourself. In some eukaryotic cells they'll

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.990
simply just do mitosis. It will just divide
in half. And you can see this one dividing

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.750
in half right here. Pretty soon what you get
are two sea anemones that are exactly the

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.249
same. But we also can do sexual reproduction.
So through the process of meiosis we can make

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:54.870
gametes. And then we can have fertilization.
And then through mitosis we can get growth.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.689
And so we can get genetic variability like
we would have in this little child right here.

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:06.210
And so that's eukaryotic cells. Again they've
got nucleus. They've got organelles. They've

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.900
got mitosis and meiosis. But the diversity
of them is massive. And we're going to talk

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.590
about that over the next few podcasts. And
I hope that's helpful.
