00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.180
This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.710
It’s not just a Sedan, it’s a Subaru.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.849
Scientists have discovered a way to cure certain
pesky bacterial infections - and the treatment

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.000
is a pill full of poop.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Literally.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.800
Kinda wish I was making that up.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:29.619
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - in amazing
disgusting science revelations - researchers

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.070
have discovered that capsules full of frozen
poop may actually save your life!

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.530
Clostridium difficile, also known as C diff,
is an extremely stubborn bacterial infection

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.550
that can cause severe debilitating diarrhea.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.829
It typically occurs after someone takes antibiotics
for an unrelated illness.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.360
Those antibiotics wipe out all of the normal
flora in their gut, allowing C diff to essentially

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360
overrun the intestines.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.910
It’s a growing problem in health care facilities,
killing nearly 14,000 people a year in the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.910
US alone.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.460
And it’s notoriously difficult to treat.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.110
Most antibiotics don’t work against it,
because it’s an infection specifically brought

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.040
on by taking antibiotics.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.240
But there is one thing that’s been shown
effective for patients suffering from extreme

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.680
C diff infections: fecal transplants.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.130
And yes, that is exactly what it sounds like.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.170
The idea here, is that you take someone else’s
poop - someone healthy, usually a relative

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.580
- and implant it into your body via colonoscopy,
after which it replenishes all of your good

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.580
gut bacteria.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.490
Obviously, that’s a tricky process.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.130
So researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital
tried coming up with better ways to do it.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.380
First, they tried delivering the transplant
through a tube that goes down your nose and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.860
into your stomach - which worked, but again
- not really ideal.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.290
Especially since if a patient gagged or vomited
during the procedure, they could potentially

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.180
inhale fecal matter - which sounds like literally
the worst thing ever.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.830
So they came up with another idea - that’s
so simple, it’s kind of amazing no one thought

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.830
of it before.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.960
They just put it in a pill!

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.150
They figured patients would be way less likely
to vomit from it, and by freezing the pills,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.979
they wouldn’t need anyone to make a “fresh
donation.”

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.300
They could just keep them in a freezer.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.830
What’s hilarious though, is that the capsules
themselves have to be acid-resistant in order

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.780
make it past the stomach and into the intestines
- and unfortunately, the only acid-resistant

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.420
capsules on the market - are translucent.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.950
Which is… not ideal.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.150
Of course if you have a C diff infection,
I’m guessing that’s a small price to pay

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.620
for relief.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.370
So they put the pills into production, and
tested them on a group of 20 people with recurrent

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.819
C. diff infections.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.640
Each of those patients was instructed to take
30 pills over the course of 2 days.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.340
And miraculously, 14 of them experienced immediate
relief from diarrhea - with no recurrences

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.510
whatsoever.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.680
The other 6 tried the treatment again, and
for 4 of them - it worked the second time

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680
around.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.940
The two people who failed to see any improvements
were found to be in poorer overall health.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.130
Since that initial test run, doctors have
treated 21 additional patients, with similar

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.130
success.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.569
But that doesn’t necessarily preclude anything
bad from happening.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.190
It’s possible that this method could actually
transmit other infectious agents - so for

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.379
now, doctors are relegating it to only the
most extreme cases.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.379
What do you guys think?

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.019
Would you rather eat 30 pills full of someone
else’s feces, or have diarrhea for 4 months

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.190
straight?

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.240
Let us know what you think in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.370
watching!
