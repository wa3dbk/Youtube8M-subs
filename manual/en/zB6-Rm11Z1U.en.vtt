00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.190
To understand how the Earth and our environment
work, we need to have access to the water

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.830
and the atmosphere and the solid earth, the
bottom of the ocean.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.519
Scripps vessels have played a very important
part in providing access to those areas for

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.349
our scientists.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.890
Competitions for the nation’s research vessels
come along very rarely, so it’s important

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.480
that when they do, that we compete well and
in this case we were lucky enough to win the

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.620
competition for a vessel called AGOR-28.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.970
AGOR-28 is being funded by the United States
Navy, it’s about an $88 million project

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.170
and we’ve been able to be integrally involved
in the design and now the early phases of

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.190
construction of AGOR-28.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.605
AGOR-28 is going to be a new class of ocean
vessel, called an ocean class.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.070
The ocean class research vessel is going to
be a little bit smaller than our biggest global

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.070
class research vessels.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.390
It’s going to have a suite of instruments
on it that’s similar to our biggest and

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.280
most capable vessels, yet it’s going to
have a smaller footprint.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.359
So, it’ll take a little bit fewer scientists
to sea, have a smaller crew and hopefully

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.899
be a little bit more efficient than our biggest
ships are right now.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.160
One of the biggest investors in the ocean
is of course, the U.S. Navy and many of the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.090
things we want to know for all of our projects
are things that they want to know for their

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.090
safe and efficient operations.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.610
One of them is national security.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.940
So, being able to listen quietly to the ocean
and understand who is out there and whether

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.170
they are our friends or our foes is a very
important part of our research.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.070
Over the decades, it’s something that Scripps
has excelled and something that we’re going

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.710
to continue to develop over the decades.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.430
There are many other aspects of our work,
especially in climate change that are increasingly

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.740
relevant to national security.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.360
So, when there are shortages of drinking water
or floods, these often lead to both direct

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.350
impacts and also geopolitical instabilities.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.620
All of those things are consequences of the
changing planet.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.570
We need to understand them and predict them
as best we can and feed them into our government

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.190
so we know what is waiting for us down the
road.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.110
And so over the decades, we have developed
a pipeline of ideas and inventions that are

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.750
first used by the U.S. Navy and when they’re
comfortable with it, they make the transition

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.340
into the environmental side of what we do.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.129
So, we’re always going to need access to
the ocean, we need slightly different equipment

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.060
to optimize the experiments we’re doing
this decade compared to previous decades and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.280
that’s why it’s important every now and
then to build a new research vessel.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.060
Right now, the vessel is about to enter its
initial construction phase, so we’ve been

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.879
involved with detailed design and following
that, we’re going to go through a year-and-a-half

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.439
of construction and we hope that the vessel
will be delivered in the early part of 2015.
