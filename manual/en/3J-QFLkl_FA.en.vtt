The wonderful thing about the United States
is that there are so many different ways to

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:12.580
be American. And they're all legitimate, they're
all valuable. Asian Americans are very much

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.530
a part of the fabric of this country. My name
is Maya Soetoro-Ng, and I'm the president's

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.530
younger sister. Because Hawaii is the only
AAPI majority state, my brother grew up with

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.630
a wide array of Asian American and Pacific
Islander communities and cultures around him.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.079
And they all made an impact on the way that
he walks and speaks and his vision of the

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.079
world. I am half Indonesian, and our mother
was committed to Asia, and worked there for

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.989
most of her career, not just Indonesia but
India and Pakistan and Thailand and elsewhere.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.449
So the AAPI community is something that is
something very near and dear. It's his kin,

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.449
his daily experience continues to be informed
very personal ways by the AAPI community.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.139
This administration has worked hard to weave
in Asian American cultures around the nation

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:25.740
into the national narrative. Things like the
DREAM Act I think are really critical to helping

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.529
us all recognize the importance of children
of immigrants and to recognize the contributions

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:38.909
of many, wherever they came from and however
their families started out. The fact is that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.740
the children of immigrants are a big part
of what makes this country so powerful and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.740
beautiful and successful. This administration
has a much larger AAPI representation than

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.919
other administrations. That makes me feel
very proud. My hope is that the AAPI community

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:06.919
will participate in unprecedented ways. Please
come forward if you haven't already participated

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.679
politically. A wonderful place to begin, of
course, is with a selection. Registering other

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.420
voters, speaking about why this presidency
matters, speaking to what might be possible

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.890
and what we can build together in the future.
Get involved by going to barackobama.com/aapi.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.440
We look forward to hearing from you.
