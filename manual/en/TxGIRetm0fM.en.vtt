00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.280
It has been my favorite form of photography
and is usually rock 'n' roll

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280
photography.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.530
I've been fortunate enough to shoot for a
couple of big

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.240
magazines and newspapers and have had access
to really awesome concerts.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.230
The reason I like it so much is because A)
it's extremely challenging.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.869
It's
generally crazy lighting patterns, crazy lighting

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.199
schemes, low lights
situations, fast action.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.579
So it create a lot of difficult problems,
but if

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.699
you work with it really hard you can get great
photographs.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.239
A couple tips to get some great rock 'n' roll
photographs is you're going

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.120
to shoot wide most of the time.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.360
Most concerts will have you up front for
maybe the first two or three songs and that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.579
will be all you will get to
shoot.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.920
So you've really got to nail it in that time.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.910
Shooting wide ensures
you a lot of frames to work with.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.620
That way if you're have to crop in, you
can crop in.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.360
I generally will set the exposure I think
is right in manual mode and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.820
adjust it accordingly as I'm shooting, depending
on how the lighting is.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.010
Nailing down a white balance in is also a
really great way to ensure

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.770
that your faces aren't going to look too blue
or too red or whatever.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.680
The
lighting that they're using, you want to compensate

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680
for that.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.450
Now if it's a small venue you might be able
to get away with using a flash.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.011
I don't really recommend it because A) it
generally aggravates the rest of

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.050
the people in the venue, especially if it's
a really intimate crowd.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.960
So if
you're going to use a flash, use it sparingly.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.840
Don't be that guy in front
popping off a million frames.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.510
They're just going to hate you.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.170
Generally speaking, at bigger concerts you're
not going to have that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.170
option.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130
You're basically going to be at the mercy
of the bouncers up front,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.000
and you're going to be able to do what they
tell you.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.140
So if you want to use
a flash, ask them first.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.170
In fact, ask them anything before you do it
because you don't want them to be your enemy.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.320
Another important thing to keep in mind when
shooting rock 'n' roll is

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.380
everybody going to hate you.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.230
The crowd is going to hate you because you're
either in their way or you're up front out

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.790
of the mosh pit, or you're
popping off a flash, or you're really close

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.790
to the bands.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.790
For all these
things they're not going to like you.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
The band is not going to like you because
they think you're just . . . not

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.340
all of the time, but a lot of big bands will
be like, oh, this guy is just

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.820
smooching off our fame.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.500
The bouncers aren't going to like you because
you're in their way.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.520
Pretty much your only fan is going to be the
band's PR

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.820
firm which is okay.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.970
So if you're cool with everybody hitting you
and you're

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.810
cool with the really tough challenges, hey
rock 'n' roll photography might

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.810
be for you.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.760
These are some of my favorite shots I've done
over the years.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.480
This is (?)
NRD shot during an outdoor concert.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.310
It was a pretty easy shoot with good,
natural light probably day.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.580
In fact, it's actually pouring rain during
this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.580
show.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.970
The band was covered, and all of the other
photographers had given up

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.630
and gone home, but I was sitting in about
a foot and a half of water next

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.402
to the stage and just happened to look up
and get this shot.

00:02:35.402 --> 00:02:38.480
This is the band, the Front Bottoms, performing
at a really teeny, tiny

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.480
venue.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.130
This is an example of using a flash with some
shutter jags, and this

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.141
photo is less about the band and kind of more
about the movement and the

00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.640
vive of the music.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.050
This is Paul McCartney at Yankee Stadium.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.490
It was a really different kind of
photo.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.690
This was shot from really, really far away
with a really strong

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.130
telephoto lens.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.181
This we literally had the first two songs,
and we were

00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:58.890
shuffled right out of the stadium into a parking
lot.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.210
This is Dave Navarro.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.600
This is an example of really funky lighting.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.060
The
reason, honestly that it is grayscale is his

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.400
face was so blown out from
fluid and it was corrected, so sometimes grayscale

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.140
is a good way to deal
with a problem like that, but it was such

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.200
an interesting look I felt it
deserved to be edited and published.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.410
This is another band shot with some shutter
jag, low ceiling with a flash.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.130
This is another example of using black and
white.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.750
This one was less because
I messed up and more of it began to convey

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.750
a mood.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.830
He's a good friend of
mine.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.600
This was another one shot from far away.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.940
This is Jane's Addiction
again.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.800
A lot of rock 'n' roll photographers will
kind of neglect the crowd.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.180
You've
got to realize that is half of the concerts,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.850
the performers, the energy
they're getting back from the crowd that makes

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.380
a concert so interesting.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.930
This is obviously the boss, Bruce Springsteen,
hometown Jersey boy

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.720
represents I think really intense.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.680
You can tell he's really getting into
it.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.160
It just kind of makes it.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.280
This is an example of using the lighting
schemes around there to kind of give it energy,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.489
to kind of give a mood to.

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.840
Another thing to realize with rock 'n' roll
photography is you've really

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.349
got to be prepared for anything.

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.250
You're, again, always going to be at the
mercy of the bouncers, the people in charge.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.920
So I have had plenty of shares
where I wasn't even allowed in front of the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.639
stage and had to shoot from a
balcony with a long lens.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.590
So for that reason I always bring two cameras.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.769
I
always bring a wide angle.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.769
I always bring a telephoto.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.389
I always bring a
flash, just in case I can use it.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:37.990
I always go into the concert with the
understanding that there's a chance I'm 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:52.819
not 
going to 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:05:13.359
get to shoot at all.
