Hi, I'm Bobby crispy this video is part my guitar lesson series

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.758
So today I'll show how to play oh pretty woman by Roy Orbison

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.849
So I'll play the parts first

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.190
Then I'll show how they're played note for note

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.830
Okay start with [the] intro

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.399
Okay, broke that down into two [riffs] riff one is this

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.009
It's top string open twice

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.269
fourth strip fret

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.809
fifth string second fret

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.229
fourth string open

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.140
You do that twice

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040
you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.280
then it's

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.549
four times

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.829
top string open place

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130
fourth fret

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.340
fifth string second fret

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280
fourth string open

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.009
fourth

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530
second oh

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.170
[you're] that four times?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.190
then the verse plate first

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.949
okay, the rhythm for this made me just up and down one and two and three and four and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.819
That okay, so it's a [four] four beats

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.730
[F-Sharp] Minor four beats

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.370
[again] four beats

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.810
F-Sharp minor for [4] Beats

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.580
then [d] for six beats

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.730
@E for [8] piece

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.349
then riff to

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.349
four times

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.390
and the verse

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.459
then riff to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.860
four times

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.250
Then the bridge which [is] this I'll play it first

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.170
I should repeats twice okay, so it's d minor four times four beats

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.690
G four beats

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.589
see four beats a

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.900
Minor four beats

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.040
D lighter four beats?

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.599
G7 four Beats

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.040
then see for a piece

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.250
And you play through it again

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.589
And you wouldn't go to cut the see you play it four times four beats instead of eight

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.230
Then it goes into this

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.840
Which is a four beats?

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.740
F-Sharp Minor four beats

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.570
D minor four beats?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.620
II for weeds

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.750
And you repeat the whole thing

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.480
And it's riff to before beats

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.379
three four times then the verse

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.020
Okay, [and] that when you play the e at the end of the verse. It's played before

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.200
sorry play it for 12 measures or

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.730
48 Beat so it's

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.730
one two

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.230
three

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.810
five

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.760
and on and on or not up to 12, so that II

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.410
Played for quite a few if you measure there are 12 [letters]

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.830
That is riff one

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.580
click that twice then riff two

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:20.260
That nine times the song ends with just a twice

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.239
And that's the song okay. [I] hope this lesson has been helpful and thanks for watching
