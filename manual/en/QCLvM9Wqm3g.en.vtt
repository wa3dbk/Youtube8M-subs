00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.220
I would like to ask you a question

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.120
Why do you ask such a stupid question?

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.350
I was wondering...

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.950
whether, in time of war between Muslims and non-Muslim... 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.880
you would hide a Muslim in your house? 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.380
I don't think I would

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.590
Why not?

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.390
Well... because we don't belong toghether.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.390
No, I think I wouldn't interfere.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.600
Yeah, when you are in trouble you can always count on me.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.000
Yes, I don't even need to think about it.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.800
Could I hide at your place when a war breaks out?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.590
No.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.800
No? Why not?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.600
Now you ask me on the spot what would you do...

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.100
And I say yes, yes...

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.990
But when it's crunch time...

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.030
...one needs to make disicions.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.700
Can I count on your help? 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.120
Of course you can.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.680
I never exclude war because people can do bad things.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.310
Eighty percent tortures with electro shocks when a docter tells them to.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.310
I guess I would help because I am a foreigner myself.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.280
I would always help foreigners.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.880
And not a Dutch person?

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.680
During the war we've had people hide in our house. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.600
Unfortunately they were killed...

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000
but we did had them for seven months.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.230
But yeah, that's easy to say. 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.200
After the war everyone was part of the resistance movement.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.140
And what if it is forbidden to be a Muslim?

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.720
No, that's not happening, in the Netherlands we have freedom of belief.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.650
For the time being.
- Yes, for the time being.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.650
I hope that it never happens, and if it happens...

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.720
I don't know what to do. I'll just die or something like that.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.520
That's sad
- Yes, it is

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.550
From our side it will not happen. 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.250
Like I said we feel free, most of us. 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.100
On behalf of all Muslims I can say that we feel save here.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.780
I don't feel save here.
- No... really?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.260
I rather have them leave tomorrow than the day after tomorrow. 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.090
Netherlands for the Dutch, Muslim for the Muslims.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.280
Do you already have a hiding place?
- What?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.270
Do you already have a hiding place?

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.600
Could you move this camera!

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.170
Do you really think there is gonna be a war here?

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.490
I wouldn't exclude it.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.100
You're right... just stay here. just stay with me.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.220
So I may write down your address?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.530
Are you scared?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.450
Great, thank you!
- There is nothing to thank me for.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.450
I am happy

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.050
We are hospitable to our guests, I swear!

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.950
If you are in need of help...

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.950
Whatever I can do, I will do. 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.760
What I can't do, well that's a pity.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.940
Do you have a dishwasher at home?

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.170
Do I have a dishwasher? No.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.280
I don't want to do the dishes when I'll be hiding at your place. 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.670
You're not going to do that? Well I think you will have to.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.300
I think I should just book an one way ticket to Morocco. 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.800
Yes, maybe that's the wisest. 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.990
When you feel that you're not welcome

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.710
I'm happy you will help me. 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.720
Yes who knows. I will prepare you a cup of coffee. 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.120
I will make some Maroccon tea.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.900
Ok, deal. And kebab and those kind of stuff.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.500
Ok, thanks!
