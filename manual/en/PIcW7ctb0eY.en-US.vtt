00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:09.734
In the previous video

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.340
I was shown how to check the fuel injection timing

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.220
determined I feel 18 degrees

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.960
As expected 22 C

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:34.880
and for this we need to take the gasket out under high pressure pump

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:53.680
If only C had to be reduced, then we would have to add a shim

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.900
how to do it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:13.000
this pump, Unscrew the three bolts

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:35.320
and remove the pump Assembly

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:52.293
put it aside

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:11.200
and on this pump now costs three strip

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:24.040
remove one and see the result

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:46.360
era rake, which regulates the supply of fuel

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.480
and this rail, you need to make when installing on a leash

00:02:56.955 --> 00:03:10.995
here the leash

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:28.480
if you don't get the engine bot to gain huge momentum

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.300
very gently inserted

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.580
like got, but I will check

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.980
replace the bolts

00:03:50.300 --> 00:04:03.480
and then look at the reaction of the fuel

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:13.000
now let's check the injection timing

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.700
have I checked the injection, he began 19-20 degrees

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:36.240
it was 18 degrees. one spacer adjusts one degree

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.400
another take away is 20-21 degrees

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:58.120
will be respectively a little later. If to choose between a little later and a little earlier, it is better to choose a little later

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.280
there will be less load on the crankshaft

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:14.380
how to check the ingress of Reiki in the leash...

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:23.480
we collect the system, pumped gas for a minimum of

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.580
twist the motor

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.320
fuel is not

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.860
added brush fuel max

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.800
twist the motor

00:05:50.055 --> 00:05:56.475
jet start spraying fuel

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:04.440
then rake and a leash connected

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:17.120
again, set the flow to a minimum, and twist

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:31.400
remove now the gas completely, the fuel to go stopped

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:46.280
if the fuel supply is regulated, then everything is fine
