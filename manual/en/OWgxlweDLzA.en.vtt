00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.189
Yindyamarra Winhangnha, is the wisdom

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.240
of respectfully knowing how to live well

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.560
in a world worth living in.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.480
At CSU, we believe wisdom is shared,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.960
that learning is about more than the degree,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.020
it's about the connections you make,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.840
and the leaps that you take,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.650
and the mark you leave behind.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.370
We understand

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.320
that knowledge is best built on a foundation of strong relationships

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.820
developed in your own time

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.910
and in your own way

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.540
while connected

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.829
to a community of support.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520
As a CSU student

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.460
you'll learn from experts,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.100
you'll build skills in the workplace

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.110
and your degree will be backed by one of the best graduate employment rates

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.650
in the country.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.909
But living well

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.770
means more than that.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.650
It means reaching out to those around you,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.110
it means finding fulfillment at each step of the journey

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.990
and arriving at a destination of your choosing.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.660
Because the people who make this world worth living in

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.380
are driven

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.710
by curiosity

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.370
and by passion

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.610
they are the people who turn

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.050
possibilities

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.439
into realities.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.400
We believe that barriers

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.480
can be overcome.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.860
That it's your commitment and your life
experience that count

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.829
and that the only person who will decide
how far you'll go,

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.439
how high you'll reach and how much you have to give

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.700
is you.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.679
So, welcome to CSU learn how to live well

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.540
and make this world worth living in
