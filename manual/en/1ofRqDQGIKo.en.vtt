00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.330
I'm John Scalzi.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.490
I'm a science fiction writer.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.890
I'm best known for the "Old
Man's War" series of books,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.970
and also for my blog,
"Whatever," which I've been

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.020
writing since 1998.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.830
I started blogging back when
they didn't actually have the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.650
word 'blogging.' It was online
diaries or online journals.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.750
And I did it because
I used to be a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.180
columnist for a newspaper.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.880
And I thought, one day I'll go
back to the newspapers and

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.090
write a column.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.530
Which is kind of funny, if
you think about it now.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.980
Well, the column in newspaper
never happened, but the blog

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.350
got 8.1 million visitors
last year.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.940
So I think I've made
up for it.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.070
Well, I think my fiction writing
style is actually very

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.880
influenced by the jobs that
I had as a journalist

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.165
beforehand.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:48.810
I was a film critic.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.680
So I spent a whole bunch of
time watching movies and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.420
watching how the storytellers
in the movies made their

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.480
choices about what to show
and what's to take.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.240
One of the things I'm really
excited about is my new book,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.800
"The Human Division," which is
the latest book in the "Old

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.530
Man's War" series.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.940
And another thing that I have
been working on is a video

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.120
game, which is called
"Morningstar," with the folks

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.480
at Industrial Toys.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.810
And it's a first-person shooter
that is natively

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.230
developed for tablets
and for mobile.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.670
So that's going to be very
exciting for people to play.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.450
I am much more of a video gamer
than anything else.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.320
I used to review video games.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.840
And I worked for "Official US
PlayStation Magazine" for a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.270
number of years.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.830
And after I'd had a stressful
day of writing or doing

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.450
whatever I'm doing, there's
nothing more relaxing than

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.910
blowing the heads
off of zombies.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.570
I played a lot of tabletop or
board games, but I don't

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.730
really play them that often,
because I discovered a really

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.290
terrible part of my personality,
which is that I'm

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.580
super, super, horribly,
horribly competitive.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.170
Which is, if we're going to meet
on the field of battle,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.980
you are going to die,
and I am going to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.090
feast on your entrails.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.790
And I don't really like that
part of my personality.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.230
I had met Wil lots
of times before.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.990
Wil and I have been friends
for a long time.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.530
He narrates my books when
we do audiobooks.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.480
So he and I have a very
good relationship.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.800
He and I also collaborated on an
anthology called "Clash of

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.290
the Geeks," in which we had this
picture painted of him in

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.610
his clown sweater and blue hot
pants, holding a spear astride

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.850
a unicorn-pegasus-kitten,
while I was

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.150
portrayed as a troll.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.640
And we're about to do battle.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.520
And there were a whole bunch
of stories that were built

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.210
around, what the hell is going
on in this picture?

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.850
Explain it.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.510
And so we had stories from Pat
Rothfuss and Cat Valente,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.990
Stephen Toulouse-- just a whole
bunch of friends, and we

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.770
contributed as well.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.990
And we ended up raising $25,000
for lupus research.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.740
Gaming's fun.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.270
I mean, it's a way to spend
time with friends.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.630
It's a way to relax.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.930
It's a way to just enjoy
the company of others.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.770
When I do play games, I
try to avoid being the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.810
hyper-competitive one.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.710
And what I really try to do is
actually focus on the fact

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.700
that I get to spend
time with friends.
