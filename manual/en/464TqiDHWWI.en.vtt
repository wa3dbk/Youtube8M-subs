00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.600
On behalf of Expert Village my name is Karen
LoCasale and I'm here to tell you about crafting

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.140
with gourds. So we're going to go ahead and
burn the design that I drew on this gourd

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:28.801
and let you see how that looks. So, you want
to go slow, you don't want to rush it. Some

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:38.969
gourds the burning process is quickly if they're
a softer gourd and some gourds still have

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.500
a bit of a harder shell and it can take a
little longer. You can see right there where,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.739
that little spot right there took a little
bit quicker. So, it's just a matter of practice,

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:04.170
getting use to your burner, getting use to
the different gourds. And, you can always

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.970
go back over your line if it's not as dark
or as deep as you want. So, it is better to

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:19.730
go light the first time and then go back over
it again as needed. And again with your different

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.540
tips, they have tips that allow you to do
shading if you wanted to do some shading.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:39.250
Some thicker tips for a wider line or more
narrow if you want the more fine lines. Again

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.460
some of the books out there for gourds also
have different techniques that different artists

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:57.210
have come up with for burning their designs.
Some actually look like a basket weave that

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.840
sort of thing so, this is kind of, you know,
the artistic portion of it to it look how

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.360
you want it to look. And now you have it permanently
etched onto your gourd.
