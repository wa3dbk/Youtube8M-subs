00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.040
You probably know the drill: You’re handed
an exam, and you’re told you need to fill

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.690
out the bubbles completely, and then reminded
that -- for reasons that no one ever explains

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.630
-- you can only use a number 2 pencil!

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.470
Now, unless you’re an artist, you’ve probably
never even seen a pencil that’s not number

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.320
2, also known as an HB pencil outside the
U.S.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.570
The thing is, if you used any other kind of
pencil when you took an automatically-scored

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.230
test, you’d probably be fine.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.710
However there are reasons that test instructions
still tell you to stick to number 2.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.140
And they have a lot to do with how machines
score your tests -- or at least, how they

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.140
used to.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.670
In 1931, a high school physics teacher named
Reynold Johnson was grading exams when he

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.212
wondered if there might be a way to score
them without actually having to go through

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:42.379
every single answer by hand.

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.649
He knew that graphite, the writing material
in pencils, was electrically conductive.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.539
It’s made of flat sheets of carbon, and
its outer electrons are relatively free to

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.030
move around within the material.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.420
So Johnson devised a machine with many small
electrical circuits that would pass over an

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.440
answer sheet.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.879
If there was a pencil mark on the sheet, it
would conduct electricity through one of the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.030
circuits, and the machine could record it
as an answer.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.860
Eventually, he sold the idea to IBM, which
produced the first mark-sensing machines.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.760
But the number 2 thing didn’t become an
issue until the next generation of machines

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.270
were introduced in the 1960s and 70s.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.160
Those machines had light-sensing devices called
phototubes, and if they did not detect light

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.800
in a certain spot, they recorded it as an
answer.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.140
That made graphite especially useful, because
it’s better at blocking light than many

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.320
inks.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.100
Graphite reflects most light -- that’s why
pencil marks are so shiny -- and absorbs the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.100
rest, which is why it’s black.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.330
But for a long time, these optical mark-sensing
machines were very picky.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.050
And that’s where the different grades of
pencil came in.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.200
The graphite in pencils is held together by
clay, so manufacturers can control how soft

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.140
or hard it is, and also how dark it is.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.860
The softer the graphite, the darker the pencil’s
mark.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.860
Pencils are labeled accordingly.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.930
In the United States, those labels are numbers.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.750
International manufacturers use a different
system, with HB corresponding to number 2.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.341
Number 2 pencils make marks that are just
dark enough to be sensed by the machine, but

00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:57.470
also light enough to be erased without leaving
a readable mark.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.100
These days, scoring machines use much more
advanced sensors that can detect almost any

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.790
sort of marks you make, as long as they’re
in the bubbles.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.880
So you could probably take your next exam
with any kind of pencil you wanted.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.700
But your SATs probably aren’t the time to
test that hypothesis.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.200
Maybe bring a couple of number 2’s just
to be safe.
