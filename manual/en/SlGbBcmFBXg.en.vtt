00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.200
Hello everyone

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.960
Every year at the end of the year

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.680
Often we all have some Christmas parties

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.120
Or is this New Year's party

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.240
Does everyone have such an opportunity?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.220
It's time to participate in these parties.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.830
This event needs you

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.360
How about preparing one or two small snacks?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.373
Then we think

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:24.060
a headache for yourself

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.680
In this busy industrial and commercial society,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.420
What kind of method do to use?

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.260
Can easily be homemade

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.180
These party snacks

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.180
I just want to share today

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.100
Muffin cup cake

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.360
Cup cake has been popular in Taiwan for a while

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.660
But the taste is different from the formula

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.320
Some are solid and some are soft

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.300
The first thing I want to share today is

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.840
More solid taste of Muffin cup cake

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.180
Other kinds of recipes for this cup cake

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.120
We will introduce you next time

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.780
This muffin cup cake tastes

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.420
Rich creamy, solid texture

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.720
I like it very much

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.420
The whole process

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.880
How to make this muffin cup cake

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.320
Let's take a look together

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.700
First to prepare

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.380
We have prepared these two whole eggs

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.860
The other is this low-gluten flour

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.180
We have to prepare this 220 grams

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.111
Then we will

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.160
We must sieve this low-gluten flour

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.240
Okay, younger brother, you want to see

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.440
Okay, then you have to be quiet

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.740
This is this baking powder

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.180
Two tsp of baking powder

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.900
We prepare this fresh milk, full-fat fresh milk 80C.C

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.880
This cotton candy, or you use fine sugar

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580
We prepare 100 grams

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.280
An equal proportion, 100 grams of this cream

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.900
To understand the sweetness of the cup cake

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900
We must add

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.480
One spoonful of salt

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.950
We just go straight to

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.840
The inside of this low-gluten flour

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.660
This baking powder, low-gluten flour, and salt

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.040
We all sifted

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.260
Then we probably

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.140
It's better to sifted twice

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.240
It's the first time that we have come through a sieve.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.170
Let's put this again at room temperature

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.600
Already slightly softened tallow

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.760
The sugar should be divided into

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.180
Send this cream

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.700
We will call it like this

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.160
The entire state of the cream

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.700
Then sugar melts in this

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.400
Inside this cream

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.900
Now this state

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.600
We have to put this egg in order

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.740
Can be divided in two or three times

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.280
We don't want to stir everything up

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.160
Unsuccessful

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.584
Every time we put it in

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:18.320
After all the fight

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.400
Blend together without separation

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.700
We add it again

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.120
The egg goes in three times

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.920
Then we continue

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.720
Second merged state

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.040
It's probably like this.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.224
Then we can continue

00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:38.100
Then put the last egg

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.560
Then we must prepare to mix in low-gluten flour

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.980
Follow this milk

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.300
At this time, we first come to preheat the oven

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.920
Is the temperature of 180 degrees

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.720
Let's warm it up first

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.880
First half the powder

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.620
Sifted twice

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.920
Half join first

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.380
At this time we use presses

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.240
Don't use excessive stirring

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.600
Because we are afraid that it will cause this

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.560
We use presses

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.260
Even with the cut can

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.540
That is, we donâ€™t want it to produce a lot of sex.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.300
At that time, put half of the milk again

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.840
Join again

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.980
It feels like a feeling of cut, the way of pressing

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.940
OK, then we'll pour the remaining powder again

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.320
Remember to use this cut method

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.580
That can also put the last milk into it again.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.480
Try not to use a mixer at this time

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.400
Because of the stirring opportunities

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.746
That cake will not have

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.760
This soft feeling

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.920
Will become this gluten

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.980
Cake paste has been mixed

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.780
In order to make it better

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.560
We are looking for a simple, clean plastic bag

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.160
We put this batter

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.260
All fall in this plastic bag

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.140
We filled up the batter

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.020
Made this way, this will be better

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.720
Let's cut this scissors again

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.020
Because this batter is a bit more

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.980
So we may have to be slightly

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.200
Let it flatten it

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.380
180 degree warm-up time is up

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.940
Then we put the cake all in

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.160
Then I use baking mold

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.680
OK, then we're going to prepare 25 minutes

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.060
Then we start

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.680
When it's time, let's see how we roast

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.580
Now probably the last 10 minutes have been left

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.740
We can observe this time

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.060
How is the color in the end?

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.380
Then let me pause it first

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.360
OK, let's take a look

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.820
Like my stove, it's in the rear

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.820
It seems a little darker

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.000
So I might want to adjust

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.080
Its location

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.200
Then I put this whole baking tray

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.320
All out of one direction

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.240
Let it become this outside

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.980
Then we continue this 10 minutes

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.160
We will continue to let it complete this journey.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.400
Like this just put the color inside

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.840
It's very deep

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.420
OK, let's tune it slightly

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.120
Leave the rest of the trip for 10 minutes

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.380
Time is up

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.120
We put all the cup cakes

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.000
All moved out of the oven

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.240
This is what we are demonstrating for everyone today.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.240
Basic Marfin Cake

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.480
Very simple muffin cake

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.440
It's worth your weekend to try it out
