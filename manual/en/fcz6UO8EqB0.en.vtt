00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.330
Wireless microphones are a great tool both
in and out of the studio BUT they can be expensive

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.480
and they also have their own issues.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.130
However there are alternatives that can not
only be a lot cheaper but also don't suffer

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.070
from the wireless problems.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.840
In this video I'll show how I came to find
a few alternatives to wireless mics that may

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:29.980
not have thought of.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.359
Now when I'm in the studio I use a lapel mic
connected to a Sennheiser wireless system.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.570
This consists of the transmitter where the
microphone plugs into there, this transmits

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.729
a signal which goes to my base station which
is over there and this picks the radio signal

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.979
and then outputs the audio in to the camera.

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.660
This arrangement works very well and allows
me to move around without having to worry

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.219
about getting tangled up in wires and pulling
something out maybe damaging either the mic

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.229
or camera.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.179
However, last summer I needed to do a piece
about using a monopod which meant i had to

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.180
film outside and away from the camera so I
couldn't use the cameras internal mic because

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.740
that's too noisy and I couldn't or a camera
mounted shotgun mic because I was going to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.360
be too far away from the camera.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.990
Now because my current wireless mic uses a
base station which is powered by the mains,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.240
I couldn't use that either because there was
no power where I was filming.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.659
So I had a choice to either buy a new wireless
system that used battery powered transmitter

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.060
and receiver, all of which are pretty expensive.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090
Or I could use something else.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.189
Back in the old days before we used camcorders
with built in audio, cameras just recorded

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.740
the visual element and the sound was recorded
on to tape separately.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.369
Today we have replaced the tape machines with
much smaller solid state devices but the principle

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.880
remains the same.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.780
The microphone is connected to a portable
audio recorder which you carry around with

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.200
you in the same way as you would with the
wireless transmitter, so you're recording

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.140
all the audio as you move around.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.619
All you have to do is make sure both the camera
and the audio recorder are set to record at

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.090
around the same time, then in the edit, the
audio and the visuals are synchronised together.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.610
Another advantage to this method is that you
are not limited by the range of the radio

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.450
signal and you don't have radio interference
problems either.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.100
Now the setup I ended up using for the monopod
shoot was my iPhone 5 and an Audio-Technica

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.170
ATR3350 powered lapel mic.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.140
The iPhone and other smart phones can work
really well as an audio recorder.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.730
There loads of apps available which will do
the job of recording your audio.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.670
The one I use on the iPhone is the iRig recorder
by IK multimeadia.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.060
It is free and allows you to adjust the record
level and has a visual meter to check the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.040
external mic is plugged in and working and
that's its not too loud or quiet.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.620
Once you have recorded your audio you can
export it by iTunes, FTP, WiFi or to a sound

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.980
cloud account.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.400
Now whilst the IPhone did a good job I did
notice there were some problems, the biggest

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.420
was that if you put the battery box of the
microphone near the iPhone, for example if

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.020
you put both in your pocket when your using
it.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.880
One the actual recording you could hear a
rapid clicking noise in the background.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.950
This turns out to be interference coming from
the iPhone which in being induced in to the

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.050
electronics of the little battery box of the
micro phone.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.300
In the end I had to separate the by putting
the iPhone in my sock and the mic battery

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.970
box in my back pocket, that worked OK but
it's not really the best solution.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.460
The other issue is that because of the iPhone's
touch screen, it's all too easy do something

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.680
you don't want to when you're handling it
like putting it in your pocket for example

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.490
or in my case putting it down my sock.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.250
So after I did this I started to look around
for something that was specifically made for

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.250
the job.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:07.070
This can range from voice dictation devices
up to multiple input field recorders.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.210
One that I did find that looked quite good
was a voice recorder made by Sony which is

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.970
the ICDUX522, it's quite cheap at about £55
or $85, it small and light weight and can

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.480
save you files to a micro SD card or you can
plug it in to your USB port to get access

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.220
to your recordings that way.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.700
A couple of things to watch for with these
dictation recorders, and one is that they

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.380
can take an external mic, because not all
of them do and another thing to do is try

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.990
and get one which has a manual gain control
or have the ability to turn off the automatic

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.660
gain control or AGC when recording.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.460
Now I didn't buy one of the Sony's because
in the end I bought one of these.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.860
This is a Zoom H4n audio recorder.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.500
Its bigger than both the iPhone and the Sony
but it can still be placed in to a pocket

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.960
out of the way, the only thing that is really
missing from this is a belt clip though I'm

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.380
sure you could use a small pouch or something
similar to attach is to you in some way.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.370
The great thing about these is that you have
a high quality low noise input section that

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.180
can not only take microphones with a 3.5mm
sockets like the lapel microphones but in

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.910
the case of the zoom H4n they have two XLR
inputs so you can use it with any professional

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.620
microphone like shotgun mics, boom mics and
condenser mics and other audio equipment that

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.940
uses XLR connections.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.080
They record directly to a standard SD card
so your recording time is only limited by

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.090
that of the card capacity.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.220
they also have a built in speaker so you can
review what you have just recorded and the

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.950
headphone socket can also be used to monitor
the audio input as it is recorded to make

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.630
sure your levels are actually OK.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.110
The only thing that bugs me with the Zoom
H4n is that the 3.5mm mic socket input is

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.790
on the back of the device and means that the
plug and lead stick out when I think it should

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.770
have been mounted on the top or bottom like
on the iPhone.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.440
Audio recorders like this also have full control
of the input levels.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.919
They have compressors, limiters and EQ which
can help maintain a high quality recording

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:25.240
and stop unwanted distortion from unexpected
loud speech or noises.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.720
These type of recorders are available from
about $100 upwards, though the Zoom H4n was

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.700
about £200 which is around $300.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.160
So whilst they are not super cheap, they can
give you a very good audio and can be used

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.440
as the centre of your audio recording for
other types of microphones and XLR equipment.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.860
And with ones like this Zoom H4n which have
built stereo mics they give you a very good

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.210
quality sound recorder too, with a much better
quality than the microphone that are built

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.250
in to most video cameras.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:07.180
So that's it, by using a small portable audio
recorder you don't have to use an expensive

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:14.160
wireless microphone system if you want to
be free of those pesky wires.
