00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.000
Each hard-cover book is spiral bound

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.800
and loaded with 30 pages

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.817

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.800
to deliver both style and elegance.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:48.802
Look at that beautiful vellum piece.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.799
Everytime you turn the page

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.796
you'll experience a new design and feel.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.792
One of my favorite things about these books

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:59.789
are the journaling options scattered throughout

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.784
that make it easy to express what I enjoy most about my loved ones.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:07.779
Let’s take a closer look at this lovely My Crush™ For Her book.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.775
The floral patterns and soft elegance

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.771
of this book make it a lovely way to celebrate

00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:15.769
a very special lady in your life.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:18.765
In this book, I added photos of my mother,

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:21.065
along with some of her grandkids,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.757
as well as some favorite memories I have, here in the journaling.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.754
I just love the personality of this book.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.750
The simplicity of it makes it so easy

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.746
to highlight what I love most about my mom.

00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:36.742
The pages can be used for story telling

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:38.740
or highlighting a certain special photo.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.736
Whether it’s a birthday, anniversary, or Mother’s Day,

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:45.731
this book is the perfect gift for celebrating the connections

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.727
you have with the women in your life.

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:51.724
Now let's look at the My Crush™ for him book.

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:54.720
this book has a unique masculine design,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.717
and enough space for you to gush about

00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:59.714
how great that special guy really is.

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:01.711
I love how this book compliments

00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:04.707
Jody’s role as a husband and father

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.007
in a genuine and simple way.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.700
My kids and I wanted to journal

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.700
a few special memories we have about Jody.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.699
I added family pictures

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.694
and single moment photos to really make this book come alive.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.680
I know Jody will love this book and these memories.

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.685
Wouldn’t this be a great Father’s Day gift?

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:23.645
What a tribute!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.679
You don’t need to be a seasoned artist or experienced scrapbooker

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:28.677
to put these books together.

00:02:28.677 --> 00:02:32.297
They’re so fast, simple, and attractive!

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.660
And for additional uses of this book,

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.667
I have some really stunning artwork to show you.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:39.664
So let's look at some alternate things

00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:41.661
to do with these beautiful books.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.659
Here I've got

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.656
these amazing layouts

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:47.654
you can see here, let's see.

00:02:47.654 --> 00:02:48.652
I'll put them upright for you.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.640
So these books really pack a punch.

00:02:52.647 --> 00:02:55.027
You can use my crush pages to emellish

00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:56.640
to make some of your layouts.

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:59.639
And it's not even just layouts,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.636
you can also make, cards.

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:03.634
And let me show you a little bit

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:06.220
of these beautiful ideas

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.600
within these books.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.580
So, this is using the For Her book

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.620
and you can see there's so many possibilities.

00:03:12.622 --> 00:03:15.619
Here we are using the cover of the For Her book

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.616
on the top of this card.

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:21.611
Just one beautiful design after another.

00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:23.609
So really versatile,

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.606
you can do so much with these beautiful books.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:26.605
I have one more layout to show you.

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:29.601
I particularly love this one.

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:31.599
This one's featuring my family from a few years back,

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.596
because my baby, Maya, is just so tiny.

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:36.592
But you can see here, we've got some of

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:39.589
the bases, underneath there are the pages

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.586
of the For Her book.

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:44.582
So imagine, you can do the same exact thing

00:03:44.582 --> 00:03:46.580
with the For Him book as well.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.576
I love all the possibilities and uses with

00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:51.574
