00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:06.500
Because this sort of thing, I mean you kind of do it a bit anywhere

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:15.500
Weíre shooting Sharon today, sheís a lead singer in a fifties cover band so weíre going for a real fifties look, quite a dramatic hair and makeup and I think itís going to be really exciting.

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:25.500
Itís always great when you have these lovely kick out skirts, so weíre going to have cinched in waist, lots of bold colours, so again some really nice pops of yellow 

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:31.500
Its quite creative with bandanas and all the accessories as well. Bright red lips, lots of nice red nails

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.500
Everything I love, makeup, hair, clothes. Awesome

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:41.500
So is it just me today? I canít wait , Iím so excited.

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:48.500
Two times in my life, I have been extremely overweight, which I can now recognise the reasons why.

00:00:48.501 --> 00:01:02.500
The first time, Iíd gone from losing family, my parents and I hadnít realised what an impact that had had on me because suddenly youíre alone. I had my son, but you are alone and

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:20.500
I was in quite a lot of turmoil and more recently, having been very successful in my job, I got a call to say that my role had been deleted and itís really quite difficult not to take that personally 

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:30.500
I just got really carried away with everything, food, drinking, sort of more wine, eating because I was actually nervous and worried.

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:35.500
All the order and the routine Iíd surrounded myself with had suddenly gone

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:50.500
Itís me, it is me, and, itís really strange, Iím a very smiley person so Iíll always smile even in the face of adversity but I know what I went through

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:59.500
And it does look like somebody who had given up and the very next day, I walked into LighterLife

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:07.500
The next three months are going to be all about me, not worrying about everybody else, actually worrying about me.

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:14.500
And thatís not being selfish, thatís actually just respecting yourself

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:34.500
LighterLife is grown up, itís not patronising, you have discussions, itís very eloquent, you were taken seriously, you had a programme that was very easy to follow, it was guaranteed to work and it really does

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:48.500
LighterLife packs are extraordinarily tasty and I still have the porridge for breakfast, which I adore.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:53.500
Always have a bar at lunch time or mid-morning because Iím often on the run

00:02:53.501 --> 00:03:04.500
I even carried on cooking whilst I was doing the programme, I cooked for friends and for family because it didnít matter, my life didnít revolve around food 

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:15.500
If someone was thinking of doing the LighterLife programme, Iíd say donít hang around, do it now because your life will change you can actually see the future

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:20.500
Itís lovely being pampered and everyone just looking after you

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:32.500
The pictures that have been taken today are just amazing- thatís me, thatís definitely me, outgoing, bubbly, confident and just love my life in the here and now
