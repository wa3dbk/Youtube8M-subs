Kristen: Alright, we have a few questions.
MR: Yes.
Kristen: The first one is from

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.419
Tricia Braid, "why is it gross to trim your
fingernails public?"

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.559
MR: Tricia wants to know why it's gross to
trim your fingernails public?  Well...

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.929
Tricia...I

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.650
I don't know that it's gross necessarily to trim your fingernails in public provided of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.480
course you dispose of them

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.980
uh... socially acceptable way.  From a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.890
socially anthropological sort of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.640
analysis I would put the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.380
trimming the fingernails in there proper
disposal

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.920
in the same  basic category of uh...

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.889
you know what you do with the gum that
you chew when you're done chewing?

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:41.490
Do you spit on the ground. do you throw it away,
do you

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.620
wrap it up and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.810
in foil?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.270
I don't know

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.020
uh... what do you do

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.400
god forbid if you pick your nose?

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.620
I mean obviously that's not something you
would do

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.480
public, but if you have to did you do it

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.590
it becomes really a proposition of uh...

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.100
of disposal

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.840
i would think.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.750
Uh... I guess you could say the same thing too

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.290
about uh...

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.530
smoking. Right?  I mean still smoke what what do you do with the cigarette butts?  The point is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.180
I wouldn't so much condemned the
behavior of trimming your nails assuming

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.970
you're not biting them and spitting them.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.229
I would confuse that behavior

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.180
vis-a-vis grossness with the choice
you make vis-a-vis disposal.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.280
So my guess is that the kind of person
that throws the cigarette butt on the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.590
ground or spits  the chewing gum and out
of your mouth, or wipes your booger on a

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.580
bench you're probably going to just

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.840
clip your nail letting them fall.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.000
So those people all live in
this category.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.230
The other people

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.900
you know...non animlas

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.640
uh... they live in another category.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.610
Now I'm not casting dispersions. Truth is
I do trim my nails when I'm home

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.170
and uh... typically

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.760
I make

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.190
a little pile

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.280
when I'm doing it on the coffee table

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.360
and then I throw them in the fireplace.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.970
I don't know that they actually burn but
I've never noticed my fingernails the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.710
fireplace later.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.040
But that is where I put them

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.679
and eventually they just

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.059
vanish. Did I answer that?
Kristen: Yes.
