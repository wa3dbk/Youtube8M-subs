Hi, this is an instructional video on how
to use the AFM FM transmitter from Iphonefm

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:22.050
transmitter, first youÕll have to remove
this cap right here that protects your usb

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:39.120
and plug this into any usb drive and when
this plug in there will be a little dim blue

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.039
light that comes on over here that tells you
that the transmitter is being charged and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:59.559
when the dim blue light goes away that means
that the FM transmitter is fully charged.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:08.410
When you plug this into a usb drive, if the
dim blue light does not come on the that particular

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:18.540
usb does not charge, so you want to plug in
this a usb that actually has a dim blue light

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.390
because some usb drive do not charge, just
make sure this is completely charged and then

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:41.170
you can remove this and plug this into your
device, in this case weÕll be using an ipad

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:52.960
mini, so weÕll just put this in and weÕll
turn on the radio, make sure your car radio

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.130
is tuned in at the radio station at 87.9,
so weÕll turn this up, youÕll hear that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.450
thereÕs a lot of noise, static noise right
now, thatÕs because our switch, our transmitter

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.000
is currently at the off position, so weÕre
going to switch this on, notice that the hissing

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:27.109
sound goes away, thatÕs because the current
of the transmitter is now working, so weÕll

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:37.569
just go and turn our ipad on, go into our
music and weÕll pick any song and make sure

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.470
for the best optimal sound quality, make sure
that you have your device or in this case

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.670
will be the ipad mini sit in about 80%.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.980
Now we can channel the car radio through the
car stereo from the FM transmitter.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.829
Watch this, as you can hear, the sound quality
is actually quite good, there is no static

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.049
noise or hissing.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.900
So thatÕs it, thatÕs how this AFM FM transmitter
from iphonefm transmitter works.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.629
You simply plug this into your device, turn,
set the preset to 87.9 which goes with the

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.139
87.9 here, and make sure they are matching.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.909
Thank you for watching, thank you, and bye.
