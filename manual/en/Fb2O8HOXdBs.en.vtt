"Good evening Mr. President. My name is Mackenzie
Allen. I'm a retired law enforcement officer

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.290
and member of LEAP (Law Enforcement Against
Prohibition). The so-called 'War on Drugs'

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.590
has been waged for 40 years at a cost of a
trillion dollars and thousands of lives with

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.889
nothing to show for it, but increased supplies,
cheaper drugs and a dramatic increase in violence

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.730
associated with the underworld drug market.
Sir, do you think there will or should come

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.141
a time for us to discuss the possibility of
legalization, regulation and control of all

00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:27.869
drugs--thereby doing away with the violent
criminal market, as well as a major source

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.539
of funding for international terrorism? Thank
you so much for your time, Mr. President."

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.829
President Barack Obama: "Well, I think this
is a entirely legitimate topic for debate.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.449
I am not in favor of legalization. I am a
strong believer that we have to think more

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:53.079
about drugs as a public health problem. When
you think about other damaging activities

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.460
in our society - smoking, drunk driving, making
sure you're wearing seatbelts - typically

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.659
we've made huge strides over the last 20,
30 years by changing people's attitudes. And

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.369
on drugs I think that a lot of times we have
been so focused on arrest, incarceration,

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.820
interdiction that we don't spend as much time
thinking about 'how do we shrink demand?'

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.229
And this is something that within the White
House we are looking at very carefully. As

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.229
I said--"

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.229
Moderator: "Any ideas?"

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.010
The President: "Well, some of this requires
shifting resources, being strategic--where

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.970
does it make sense for us to really focus
on interdiction? We have to go after drug

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.970
cartels that not only are selling drugs, but
are also creating havoc, for example, along

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:57.610
the US-Mexican border. But, are there ways
that we can also shrink demand? In some cities,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.920
for example, it may take six months for you
to get into a drug treatment program. If you're

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.330
trying to kick a habit and somebody says to
you, 'come back in six months,' that's pretty

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.750
discouraging. So we've gotta do more in figuring
out how can we get some resources on that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.190
end of it. And make sure that--and also look
at what we're doing when we have nonviolent,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.890
first-time drug offenders. Are there ways
that we can make sure that we're steering

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.810
them into the straight and narrow without
automatically resorting to incarceration--drug

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.260
courts, mechanisms like that. These are all
issues that are worth exploring and worth

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.950
a serious debate."
