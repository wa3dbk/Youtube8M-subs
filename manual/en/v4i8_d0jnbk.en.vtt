Angie, wake up!  We have to go to class! You have to wake up.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.560
So what class you've got today? 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.620
Euh, Intercultural Communication.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.900
Oh my god, that's in three minutes!

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.340
It's going to be hard to get there in time.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.840
I just love it, we're having free fruit over here.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.460
Oh my god, I'm so hungry. So, this is our cafetaria where everyone meets for lunch.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.240
It's a really good price for what you get and it's really tasty.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.550
So, if you are want to come with me and we will grab some lunch.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.940
Oh, I'm so fill right now, I need to relax somewhere.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.740
Maybe you want to go to the Creativity Gym?  

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.200
That's probably the best place to go, to think about thoughts and relax after lunch.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.720
You know, the first time I heard that we
had a Creativity Gym here

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.180
I thought it was a free gym for the students
or something. 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.560
But it turns out to be so much better than that.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.600
Look, there are sofas where you can relax and get
away from the hustle and bustle of normal student life.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.490
And you can think here properly. It's as a
temple to me.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.860
However, if you're looking for a real gym, Mechelen-Nekkerspoel is your place.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.480
So this is my bike and that's the most valuable thing you'll have as a student here in Mechelen.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.500
Because people are cycling everywhere in Belgium.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.360
Luckily for us, you can rent them for 5 Euro a month from our Student Information Point (STIP).

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.940
So that's really cheap as well.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.330
One of the most fantastic things about STIP are these vouchers you get. 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.570
You can use them one of them to go to the cinema for just 4 Euro a time.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.260
And there's another one for sports, so you get swimming and boxing completely free.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.460
Or you can also use them to go the the gym or dancing as well.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.240
And the last one, you can use for cultural things, for example museums and gallery's.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.920
So it's great to hang out with your friends.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.980
Erasmus has been such an incredible experience for me.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.100
But there's one thing that I'm never going to forget, it's the people and the friends I have made here.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.440
From all over the world, we all love each other so much.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.380
And I can tell you that in these short few months, they are already going to be friends for life.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.220
Angie, who are you talking to? Come on, everyone's waiting.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.480
I would better go.
