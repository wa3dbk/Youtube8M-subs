Build as broad a social network as you can
to help stave off the effects of Alzheimer's;

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.120
a study has indicated that people who actively
engage with a large group of friends are more

likely to retain cognitive function as they
age.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940

Step 6.

your creative limits and teach your brain
