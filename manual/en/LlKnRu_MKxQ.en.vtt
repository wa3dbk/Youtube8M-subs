00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.830
Hi, I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
In this next segment, we are going to be talking

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.680
about what we need to be doing to get ready
for bottling besides just cleaning our bottles.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.130
Now that our bottles are soaking in their
sanitation solution, we're going to focus

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.599
on taking a specific gravity from our beer.
So, this is going to be our final gravity

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:36.940
measurement. We're going to use our sterilized
thief and take a sample. With our final gravity

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.690
measurement, we are aiming for something that
is roughly twenty-five percent of what we

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.149
started with. So if we had a beer that started
with a 1.040, we are going to be aiming for

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.579
something that is 1.010, or twenty-five percent
less. If it's a little above this or a little

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.129
below this, don't worry, you are still going
to be fine. One tip on taking your measurement

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.270
is, right before you take it, give it a little
tap and that will knock some of the little

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.850
bubbles off and give you a more accurate measurement.
After you've taken your final specific gravity

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.570
measurement, you can subtract that from your
original gravity measurement and multiply

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.549
the result by one-hundred and thirty-one and
that will give you your final alcohol content

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.070
in "Alcohol by volume." Now we are going to
start worrying about getting our priming sugar

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.619
and our bottle caps ready to be used. So,
we are going to start heating enough water

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.850
to cover up about sixty bottle caps. And for
the priming sugar, we are going to add about

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.330
a pint of water into a nice small pot and
start heating that up. When we get ready,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.310
we are going to be adding three-quarters of
a cup of priming sugar. This will give us

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.240
our carbonation. When we've gotten our bottle
cap sterilizing water to a boil, we are going

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.880
to add our bottle caps and boil them for roughly
five to ten minutes to sterilize them. When

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.359
your primer sugar water is boiling, your going
to add your priming sugar and stir it in so

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.140
that it forms a solution. And you're going
to want this to boil for about five minutes

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.560
to sterilize. After that, you're going to
want to put a lid on it. With our priming

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.459
sugar ready and covered off to the side, we're
next going to start siphoning into our bottling

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.370
bucket the way that I showed you in the earlier
segment. As the beer begins to flow in, you

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:36.150
add your priming sugar water gently to the
bottom. As the water, or as the beer siphons

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.540
in, this will mix in the priming sugar creating
a nice homogeneous solution. You can cover

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.670
it up with your lid to provide a little extra
protection against any dust. Now that it has

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.900
all been racked into our bottling bucket,
we're going to attach the lid on for sure

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:05.340
and then lift it up and put it on our counter.
And now, we are about ready for bottling.
