00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.160
Neutron stars are one of the
most extreme things in the universe.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.000
They’re like giant atom cores.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.090
Kilometers in diameter,
unbelievably dense and violent.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.300
But how can something
like this even exist?

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.830
The life of a star is dominated
by two forces being in balance.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.090
Its own gravity and the radiation
pressure of its fusion reaction.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.640
In the core of stars, hydrogen
is fused into helium.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.180
Eventually, the hydrogen
in the core is exhausted.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.730
If the star is massive enough,
helium is now fused into carbon.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.040
The cores of these massive
stars become layered like onions,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.450
as heavier and heavier atomic
nuclei build up at the center.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.060
Carbon is fused into neon, which leads
to oxygen, which leads to silicon.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.590
Eventually, the fusion reaction hits iron,
which cannot fuse into another element.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.460
When the fusion stops, the
radiation pressure drops rapidly.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.249
The star is no longer in balance,

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:09.130
and if its core mass exceeds
about 1.4 solar masses,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.510
a catastrophic collapse takes place.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.940
The outer part of the core reaches
velocities of up to 70,000 km/s,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.780
as it collapses towards
the center of the star.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.640
Now, only the fundamental
forces inside an atom

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.230
are left to fight the
gravitational collapse.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.040
The quantum-mechanical repulsion
of electrons is overcome,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.420
and electrons and protons
fuse into neutrons

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.060
packed as densely as an atomic nucleus.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.860
The outer layers of the star
are catapulted into space

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.410
in a violent supernova explosion.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.390
So, now we have a neutron star!

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.220
Its mass is between 1 and 3 Suns,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.920
but compressed to an object
about 25 kilometers wide!

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.810
And 500,000 times the mass
of Earth, in this tiny ball

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.520
that’s roughly the diameter of Manhattan.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.100
It’s so dense that one cubic
centimeter of neutron star

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.310
contains the same mass as an
iron cube 700 meters across.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
That’s roughly 1 billion tons,
as massive as Mount Everest,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.880
in a space the size of a sugar cube.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.410
Neutron star gravity
is pretty impressive too!

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.090
If you were to drop an object from
1 meter over the surface,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.740
it would hit the star in one microsecond
and accelerate up to 7.2 million km/h.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.570
The surface is superflat, with
irregularities of 5 millimeters maximum,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.670
with a superthin atmosphere of hot plasma.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.690
The surface temperature
is about 1 million kelvin,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.330
compared to 5,800 kelvin for our Sun.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.860
Let’s look inside the neutron star!

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.200
The crust is extremely hard
and is most likely made of

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.200
an iron atom nuclei lattice with a sea
of electrons flowing through them.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.780
The closer we get to the core, the more
neutrons and the fewer protons we see

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.200
until there’s just an incredibly dense
soup of indistinguishable neutrons.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.150
The cores of neutron stars
are very, very weird.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.320
We are not sure what their properties are,
but our closest guess is

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.940
superfluid neutron degenerate matter

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.230
or some kind of ultradense quark
matter called quark-gluon plasma.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.630
That does not make any sense
in the traditional way

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.420
and can only exist in such an
ultraextreme environment.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.970
In many ways, a neutron star
is similar to a giant atom core.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720
The most important difference is that atom
cores are held together by

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.040
strong interaction
and neutron stars by gravity.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.520
As if all this wasn’t extreme enough,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.480
let’s take a look at
a few other properties.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.050
Neutron stars spin very, very fast,
young ones several times per second.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.440
And if there’s a poor star nearby
to feed the neutron star,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.150
it can rotate up to several
hundred times per second.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.320
Like the object PSRJ1748-2446ad.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.770
It spins at approximately
252 million km/h.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.220
This is so fast that the star has
a rather strange shape.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.790
We call these objects pulsars, because
they emit a strong radio signal.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.070
And the magnetic field of a neutron star

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.980
is roughly 8 trillion times stronger
than the magnetic field of Earth.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.050
So strong that atoms get bent
when they enter its influence.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.740
Okay, I think we got the point across.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.450
Neutron stars are some
of the most extreme,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.880
but also some of the
coolest objects in the universe.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.560
Hopefully, we will one day send spaceships
to learn more about them

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.050
and take some neat pictures!

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.590
But we shouldn’t get too close!

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
