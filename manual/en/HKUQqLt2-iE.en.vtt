IN 2012, THREE BROTHERS FROM KANSAS TOOK TO
YOUTUBE IN HOPES OF SPREADING THE WORD ABOUT

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.690
AGRICULTURE -- BUT THEY DIDN'T JUST WANT TO
TELL FOLKS ABOUT AG, THEY WANTED TO DO IT

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.379
IN A UNIQUE AND FUN WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE WOULD
REMEMBER AND POSSIBLY TAKE AN INTEREST.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.410
WELL, THEY SUCCEEDED ALL RIGHT.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.380
NOWADAYS, THE PETERSON BROTHERS ARE AN INTERNET
"SENSATION".

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.320
(Kenny Burgamy)
Known as the Peterson Farm Brothers, their

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.009
parody song videos went viral on You Tube
over the past twenty-four months.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.130
There have been over 15 million views, yeah;
I said 15 million… already on their parody

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490
song, “Farmer Style”.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.220
(Sung - “Working farmer style, farmer style.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.360
“)
Something 23-year old Greg Peterson said was

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.430
meant to be an avenue to spread a positive
message of agriculture.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.340
(Greg Peterson, Peterson Farm Bothers)
And uh, I was an agricultural communications

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.560
major at Kansas State University and uh; they
they were always challenging us to find new

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.220
ways to promote ag, um in you know, in what
we do, and I came up with this crazy idea

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.800
to make a music video with my two younger
brothers, Nathan and Kendal.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.340
(Sung – “Farmer’s style.”)

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.320
(Kenny)
Leigh Ann Wynn, Senior VP of Business Development

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.680
with AGAmerica Lending in Lakeland, Florida
told me their company was pleased to sponsor

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.190
the Peterson’s performance at the Sunbelt.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.330
(Leigh Ann Wynn, Sr. VP Ag America Lending)
The Peterson Farm Brothers are definitely

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.170
advocates for farming and most of us at AGAMERICA
Lending had agricultural backgrounds, so we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.000
definitely wanted to, we could feel the connection
with the Peterson Farm Brothers, and they’re

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.720
so good at going around and being able to
let people understand what they do and that

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.920
made a perfect connection with us.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.950
(Kenny)
And, as you might imagine, the three young

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.330
men have their devoted fans no matter where
they go.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.890
(Fans from Florida)
I think it is just cool,’ cause like a lot

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.940
of people don’t appreciate the ag business
and they don’t see what farmers actually

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.340
do, and then when they put it into a video
they get to see how much work and hard effort

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.210
they have to put into giving us food, that’s
like healthy, at least.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.170
(Kenny)
The Peterson Brothers told me there is one

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.590
down side to their recently found fame.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.409
Their father is now having to pick up their
chores back on their cattle ranch in Kansas.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.540
(Greg Peterson)
Our dad.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.900
Yeah, we have a hired man, too.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.090
He’s our dad’s second cousin who comes
over to the farm and kind of takes our part

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.410
when we’re gone.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.519
(Kenny)
