00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.160
27 year old male with pretty big under eye
bags.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.820
Am I a good candidate for surgery?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.980
For the past couple of years I have been continuously
been made aware of how tired I look and if

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.790
I have been resting/sleeping well.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.680
It really has taken a toll on me.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.100
I've tried from cool cucumbers and many eye
creams and products to sleeping with more

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.720
pillows but nothing works.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.800
This is something that has shaken my self-confidence
a bit and I've decided I want to deal with

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800
it.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.370
My major concerns are that I do not want to
look overdone or face lifted, and my highest

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.839
priority is a natural look.

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.500
Thank you for your question!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.720
At the age of 27, you have expressed how the
puffiness under your eyes has been present

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.090
and that you have tried things like cucumber
slices and it's affecting your sense of your

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.090
appearance.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.920
I very much appreciated the photos that you
sent where you looked up.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.330
Clearly you have become aware of the volume
that is under your eyes and that's causing

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.829
this bulging and how it is enhanced further
by your looking upward.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.420
So to help you understand what's going on,
essentially based on the photos, it appears

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.560
you have something called lower eyelid fat
prolapse.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.539
Lower eyelid fat prolapse means that the fat
that is normally around your eyes has pushed

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.520
forward and is creating a bulge.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.609
That bulge is creating this continuous look
of puffiness under your eyes.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:08.270
And certainly, after 20 years of an oculoplastic
cosmetic surgeon, I have heard of only the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.070
phrase: "Tire of looking tired" so many times
and it's completely understandable.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:22.200
It affects how people see themselves, it affects
when they look at the mirror and they feel

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.220
good and then they see the bags under their
eyes and they literally feel that they look

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.220
tired and feel tired.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.800
So it's affecting them emotionally similar
to yourself so you're really not alone in

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.330
your frustration.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.340
Understanding that this is lower eyelid fat
prolapse is why there is a physical volume

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.910
that's actually pushing forward.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.390
Naturally, the do-yourself remedy such as
the cucumber slices, people use tea bags,

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.120
topical creams and of course, none of these
things work.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.300
The definitive procedure is some kind of procedure
that is surgical called a lower eyelid blepharoplasty.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.330
For most of our younger people, we perform
a Transconjuctival blepharoplasty.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.870
This is a procedure where I address the fat
pockets under the eyes from the inside of

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.870
the eyelid.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.290
This way we avoid an external scar.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.510
We also maintain and preserve the anatomy.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.590
Now you expressed how important it is to maintain
a natural look and I think that's fantastic.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:42.570
That is exactly what you should be getting
in your quest for finding the right surgeon

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.940
to do this.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.110
A natural appearance basically should look
as if you never had the bags.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.840
When people look at you, they shouldn't know
that you had surgery.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.910
When they look at you they should say that
you look good or that there's something that's

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.320
changed but they couldn't figure out what
and that's the idea.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.250
And so, meeting with qualified and experienced
cosmetic surgeons is an appropriate next step

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.300
for you.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.540
In addition, when you asked the questions,
look at the doctor's before and after pictures

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.060
as well as ask about the type of anesthesia.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.960
It is my opinion that these procedures can
all be performed under local anesthesia with

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.760
LITE sedation which we do in our practice
and we actually trademarked a name called

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.930
LITE anesthesia.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:41.520
The quick recover and limiting and minimizing
the trauma and stress to your body is of highest

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.440
value in addition to the safety and natural
appearance.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.610
And so it is definitely something that can
be done in that way.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.930
Well, that's my opinion and my recommendation.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.550
When you meet 10 surgeons, you would surely
get 10 opinions but there should be some perspective

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.851
that you bring with the knowledge that you
are acquiring from asking the question this

00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:07.150
way.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.340
So again, it's lower eyelid fat prolapse.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.599
I usually do Transconjuctival blepharoplasty.

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:21.210
At times we combine it with other procedures
such as the use of platelet-rich plasma which

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.020
we have been very successful in helping people
with skin quality under the eyes when we perform

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.330
the lower eyelid blepharoplasty under local
anesthesia with LITE IV sedation.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.110
Again, meeting with qualified and experienced
cosmetic surgeons whom you feel comfortable

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.150
with and move forward your solution.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.700
So I hope that was helpful, I wish you the
best of luck and thank you for your question!
