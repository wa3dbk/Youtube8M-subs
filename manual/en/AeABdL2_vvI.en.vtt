Stephanie Manley: Hi everyone!

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.900
This is Stephanie Manley with Copykat.com.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.270
Today I'm going to show you a fabulous recipe.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.570
Do you love Jalapeno Poppers?

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.180
I know I do!

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.830
And so do many of you.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.380
We are going to make Jalapeno Popper Wontons.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.910
So let me tell you what we have in them.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.380
We have wonton skins and you can buy these
in most grocery stores.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.620
They're generally in the produce department,
so check there.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.360
We need just a couple of fresh jalapenos.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.510
We need some cream cheese.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.000
And I'm going to use some sharp Cheddar cheese
right here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.979
And I'm going to jazz up my filling with a
little bit of Worcester sauce.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.830
So please click in the link down below so
you can see the exact measurements and all

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.560
of the instructions for this recipe.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.940
So let me show you how we get started.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.571
Okay, so the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to begin by putting in our

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:13.200
softened cream cheese in our bowl here.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.630
Now, I let mine soften for about a half an
hour before I got started.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.329
We're going to add in our cheese.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:29.190
We're also going to put in a couple of shakes
of Worcester sauce in here because that always

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.630
makes it better.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.850
The next thing we're going do is go ahead
and we're going to chop up our jalapenos.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.710
Now at this point, you have a choice, you
can make it spicy or not spicy.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.810
And what do you to make them spicy?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.549
You leave in the seeds.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.509
If you want them a little bit milder, go ahead
and take these seeds out.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.810
I am going to leave my seeds in.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.350
We're going to live on the edge today.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.159
So we're going to dice these up very very
small and we're just going to put them into

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.969
the cream cheese.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:09.721
Okay, I'm only putting in one pepper today,
but if you're going to go ahead and take the

00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.690
seeds out, add in two.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.130
They'll be really good that way.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.670
These peppers also a little bit large, so
we're just putting in one.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.950
Now we're going to give everything a nice
stir and just kind of mash everything together.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.140
And then we're going to fill our wontons.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.340
Once this all gets mixed up together, we're
going to go ahead and begin to fill our wontons.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.340
We're going to take one of the shells, you're
going to wet your finger and wet down the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.260
edges, this will help make them stick.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.540
And we're going to stick about a teaspoon
or so of filling in here.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.690
And we're just going to seal these up.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:16.170
Go ahead and mash these edges together well
so they won't pop open.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:26.300
(Background music playing)

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.820
Okay, so now it's time to go ahead and cook
up our wontons.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.450
I just have a small pot here with some cooking
oil in there, just some vegetable oil.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.640
It's about 350 degrees, and I'm going to put
a few of these in at a time and cook them

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.060
until they're golden brown.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.830
And then we'll have our Jalapeno Popper Wontons.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.870
So we've just made our Jalapeno Poppers and
it was really easy to do.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.260
These have all the goodness of a jalapeno
popper, but it's inside of a wonton.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.930

thumbs up.
