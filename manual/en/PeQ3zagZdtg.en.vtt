HobbyMom: Welcome to HobbyKidsTv.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.820
Today we are going to open up the Disney Pixar
Cars, Radiator Springs Classic, Flo's V8 Cafe,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.820
Play Set.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.650
We got this at Toys R Us.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.650
You can also get it online.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
I have the link in the description below.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160
Let's take a look at the back.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.850
It actually has a three level hang out, which
is really cool.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.330
It does not come with the cars, so you have
to buy those separately, but we have some

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.690
cars we can play with today.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:52.460
I have HobbyKid with me and he's going to
help me open it.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.160
It does require three AAA batteries, so make
sure you have that because it does not come

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.100
with it.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.280
It does come with some things with stickers
on it already.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.889
Like this dome right here that already has
a sticker attached to it and the same with

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:12.500
on the little oil can right there.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.549
There's already a sticker attached.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.270
This just easily snaps in, like that.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.599
You have to make sure the little tool shed
is closed.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:34.560
This comes down.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.000
Make sure to push in this portion before you
put it in there and then it just snaps down

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.239
and you can press this button.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:50.450
We made the lighting a little darker so that
you can see the lights as they light up.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.029
You can fit a lot of cars, different kinds.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:58.549
We've got Lighting McQueen here from a different
game and we have this little car.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.479
It doesn't even really roll.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.619
We have a tractor we're going to use, and
we have Francesco that we're going to use

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:13.099
from another game, so as long as it fits inside
this main little showcase area it's fine.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.780
You can manually turn it like a little showroom
inside there.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.459
Spider-man, what are you doing here?

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.239
HobbyKid 1: I'm trying to find a car.

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.069
Yeah, just get out, beep, beep, beep.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.720
HobbyMom: Oh, you tractored him out.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.680
He got the boot.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.360
We have all different kinds of cars here that
actually don't belong to the Cars' movie,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.840
but as you can see it does fit a lot of different
kinds of cars, and here's how the lights look

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.840
at night.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.859
HobbyKid 1: Let's cruise them there.

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.879
HobbyKid 2: They're like bad.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.890
HobbyKid 1: What are you saying?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.909
HobbyKid 1: I want it.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:24.909
HobbyKid 1: First you put the car right there
and you pull this and push the button.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.639
That's what makes it kick out, see?

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.280
HobbyMom: You just have to line up the back
of the car.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.260
HobbyKid 1: Push the buttons and when you
push it, there.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.519
HobbyKid 1: Duh, you always mess everything
up.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.110
HobbyMom: Nice.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.870
HobbyKid 1: Here's how it goes.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.219
Yeah, that was a sick one.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.739
Now here's the real one.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.849
Yeah, that's good.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.900
HobbyMom: Looks like we have a guest appearance
by Mr. Angry Bird himself.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.709
I think I'm in the wrong toy.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.980
HobbyKid 1: You can live here if you want
to.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.139
HobbyMom: Oh, thank you.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.739
HobbyMom: Thanks so much for watching and
watch the fun continue.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.220
Click one of these videos.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.699
See you next time.
