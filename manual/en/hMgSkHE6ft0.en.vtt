Hi guys,
Welcome back to my channel!

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.559
Today, I decided to do a color correction
video for you guys!

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.220
A few videos back; someone asked me if I use
color correctors to get rid of any redness

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.109
around my skin — and I do, but I didn't
want to mention those products in a video

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.650
because they didn't really work for me as
well as this color correcting palette has

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.990
worked for me.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.899
And, I finally feel a little more comfortable
sharing with you guys how I get rid of redness,

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.160
dark spots on my face and… you know… how
to get a good all around color correction.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.710
Now, If you don't know what color correction
is, it's basically applying a concealer of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.780
a different color; rather it be green, yellow
or orange.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.199
They have some that are lavender — to get
rid of different things on your face.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.230
Alright, so the color correcting palette that
I've been using a lot is by city color cosmetics

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.559
and this is the palette in the color medium.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.240
They have a light, medium and a darker one.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.830
One of the issues that I had with color correcting
palettes; is that either it was way too light

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.100
and it didn't really do anything for my skin.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.259
You could seriously see through the correction
of the color,

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.290
Or, it just wasn't the right consistency.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.140
With this palette, it has the perfect consistency
and it color corrects perfectly for my skin

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.140
tone.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.450
If you have my type of skin tone maybe a tad
bit darker, I definitely recommend the medium

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.450
one, but if you have a darker complexion,
or if you are very light… or fair, that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.080
do have those palettes ready for your guys
on the website.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.850
I'm going to get started with showing you
how I color correct.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.290
Alright, so on this palette, you will notice
that they have two regular colors, so this

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.350
is going to be the concealers you can put
over the color correcting concealers which

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.180
are these three right here.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.220
You have a green, a yellow and a orange.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.920
And I do apologize if the lighting consistency
is like, different.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.411
I am filming with day light, like, regular
natural daylight and, it's just not, it's

00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:11.940
just not working out for me!

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.280
So, I do have some redness around here, around
my mouth — and around… you know, any place

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.850
that I have a pimple, which is probably like,
rift around here somewhere.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.320
I'm going to use the green one right now.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.780
And it's very creamy, its very pigmented and
i'm just going to apply this around the nose

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.970
area.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.480
Right around where I get red.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.800
And it's going to look crazy, don't worry!

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.890
It's going to come altogether all in the end.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.020
The next color that I'm going to go in with
is the orange color — this one is very creamy

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.670
and pigmented I'm just going to apply this
right under the eye area right there.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.350
For the yellow one that I'm going to take;
I'm going to apply this to my acne scars,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.900
because I did have an acne attack, and it
just went crazy!

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.360
So, there is the yellow.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.840
And I'm just going to apply it on top.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:31.790
Now, you 
can go onto of that with these tone here,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.200
I actually have a concealer that I've been
loving, so that's the concealer i'm going

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.900
to use, but feel free to use the one in the
palette if you have that palette.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.710
Now what I'm going to do is apply my bb cream
on top of it.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.630
So, let me get the bb cream and i'll be back.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.070
So, now i'm going to take my bb cream; so
I am using the Garnier… it's one of my favorites!

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.380
It has SPF 20 so its perfect for everyday
use.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.980
And I also used it in my every day makeup
tutorial, so if you guys want to see that,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.550
I will have it linked down below!

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:17.220
I'm going to use one of my new Sonia Kashuk
brushes and my cover girl bronzer.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.160
And i'm just going to add this on the parameter
of my face so that way, I don't look washed

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.250
out.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:36.390
I'm putting this underneath my eye and on
top of the orange that I still might have.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.690
It has a little more brightening and highlight
to my under eyes.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:49.450
And I 
usually add this after bb cream, and before

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.030
bronzer — but, I'm having one of those days
guys!

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.610
LOL!

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.250
