00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.500
It is a major first for iOpener today,
as we will for the first time

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.900
participate in a live racing event 
where gamers will be able

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.100
to race live against the real pros.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The Ford GT of Marc VDS is equipped with


00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a GPS receiver and the iOpener Enabled 
technology

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.920
We just checked the amount of gamers
who subscribed to race today

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.990
and we are really happy to see
all our testers rushed to do so.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.280
Some of them, 
on the other side of the planet,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.840
will even wake up at night
to be able to participate in the race.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.940
They are all really excited!

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.570
The Marc VDS Team pilots will certainly
be better drivers than I.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.160
If ever I am driving in front
they will want to overtake me.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.320
Of course in reality they don't see me

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.820
So we developed a special AI
which will make it possible for

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.710
the game to simulate them seeing me
and overtaking me.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.750
Once they will actually be in front 
of me in reality, the car in game will

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.270
go back to its actual GPS position 
on the real track.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.260
iOpener is not a race game developer

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.570
We develop the technology which will
enable any race game in the future

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.280
to let people compete and 
compare themselves

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280
with real professional drivers.
