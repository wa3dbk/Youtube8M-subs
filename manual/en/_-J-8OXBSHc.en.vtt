00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.848
-Hey! Hey, Tootsie Roll, hey!

00:00:01.848 --> 00:00:03.550
-What? What do you want now?

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.020
-If you were a train, would
you be called a "chew-chew"?

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.020
[laughs]

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.925
-Ugh,
is he seriously gonna say that?

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.112
-Cut! Take five, Toots.

00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:12.773
-I thought you'd never ask.
-(Orange) What a poser.

00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:14.781
She can't even "roll."
[laughs]

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.946
-What's-what's going on?
Who are you?

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:19.049
-I'm Director Michael Baygle.

00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:20.943
You've probably heard of me.

00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:24.099
-Yeah, I've heard a
"hole" lot about ya. [laughs]

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.475
-This video's all right, but
it could be bigger and better.

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:30.187
Come on, people.
Cue the toaster!

00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:31.397
[boom!]

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.572
-Whoa!
-Cut!

00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:34.370
-It's toast.
[laughs in awe]

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.780
-Cue the stove!

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.652
[boom! boom! boom! boom!]

00:00:37.652 --> 00:00:40.738
-WHOA!
-WHY IS EVERYTHING EXPLODING?

00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:41.826
-Cue the title card.

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:49.806
-You know what?

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:52.794
We were doing just fine before
you showed up, Michael Baygle.

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:53.946
-Sure you were.

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:57.546
But who wants to be fine
when you can be awesome?

00:00:57.546 --> 00:00:59.942
Now, meet your new lead actor,

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:03.210
Optimus Prime Rib!
[chuckles]

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.962
-[deep voice]:
Greetings.

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:07.608
[mechanical whirring]

00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:10.531
-Whoa!

00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.974
-There's more to this meat
than "meets" the eye. [laughs]

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:16.609
-All right, all right, all
right. I'll admit he looks cool,

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:17.857
but what does he do?

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:20.315
-He blows stuff up; that's what.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.330
Optimus, show 'em.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.112
-Whatever you say, Michael.

00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:25.853
[boom!]

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:27.371
-WHOA!!!

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.941
[rapid firing]
[boom!]

00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:29.995
-WHOA!!!

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:31.190
[spew! spew!]
[boom!]

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.542
-Oh, yeah!!

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:35.602
Now we gotta introduce some
bad guys into the equation.

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:37.185
-What the-- why?

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:39.267
-So they can all fight
and destroy like, you know,

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:41.049
the entire kitchen. Duh.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.217
-Yeah, Pear.
-A-doy.

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:45.822
-We LIVE in the kitchen. Argh!

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:47.443
[clank! clank! clank!]
-We meet again,

00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:49.278
Optimus Prime Rib.

00:01:49.278 --> 00:01:53.469
-Megacorn,
today I shall destroy you.

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.087
-Over my dead cob.

00:01:57.087 --> 00:01:59.870
-So be it.
-[chuckles]: Oh, yeah!

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.580
Time for a
slooow-mooo baaattleee.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.368
-[grunts in slow-motion]

00:02:06.368 --> 00:02:09.985
-[cries out in slow-motion]

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:14.557
[firing in slow-motion]

00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:16.860
-Wait-wait--
how the heck is this happening?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.283
[boom!]
-Wow!!!

00:02:19.283 --> 00:02:20.604
-Whoa!!!

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:24.116
-This is a blast! [laughs]
-Whoa!

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:26.970
-[singsong]:
All right. Cue the helicopter.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.268
[boom!]
-(Orange and Pear) Whoa!

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:30.700
-Who do I have
to hump around here

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.001
to get some more explosions?
-Uh...?

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:34.403
-Cue the airplaine!

00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:37.181
[boom!]
-Whaaah!!

00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:38.988
-Whoo-hoo! Yeah, baby!

00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:40.781
That was definitely
worth $5 million!

00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:42.279
-Dude, knock it off!

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.690
-And now, cue the castoroid!

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.792
-Castoroid? I'd expect something
a little "meatier." [laughs]

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:49.785
Right, Optimus?

00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:53.804
-Ugh, the castoroid-- it's
a gigantic bottle of castor oil

00:02:53.804 --> 00:02:56.528
hurdling through space
and headed for earth.

00:02:56.528 --> 00:03:00.774
If it hits, the entire
planet will be destroyed.

00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:02.704
-WHY WOULD YOU EVER
CUE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:05.053
-'Cause it's awesome! Duh!

00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:07.831
I'll be in my trailer.
Call me when it gets here.

00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:10.948
-(Pear)
Oh, no. It's getting closer!

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:12.652
Optimus, what's the plan?

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:15.107
-Plan?
Why are you looking at me?

00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:17.961
-Dude! You've done this,
like, three times before!

00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:20.234
-And you're welcome.
[scoffs]

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:24.026
Besides, I only fight
other giant robots.

00:03:24.026 --> 00:03:26.820
This is totally
outside my wheelhouse.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.364
-(Orange) Well, guys, it looks
like we're all gonna die,

00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:32.978
so I just want you
to know one single thing.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:37.029
I REGRET NOTHING!!!
-[screams]

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.296
-I predict impact in five...

00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:41.543
four... three...

00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:44.103
two... one.

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:47.314
-What the heck? What happened?

00:03:47.314 --> 00:03:50.974
-I believe the castoroid
fell into a giant plot hole.

00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:53.855
-A plot hole? Huh.
I guess it makes sense.

00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:55.364
It is a Michael Baygle film.

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:58.359
-You mean we're safe? Yeah!

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.526
-It's beautiful!

00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:03.024
All right, people,
that's a wrap! Yeah-ha!

00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:05.229
Another blockbuster
movie in the can,

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.751
directed by me,
Michael Baygle, yeah!

00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:10.619
I'm the best!
Please give me an Oscar.

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:12.188
-Aren't you supposed
to yell, "Cut"?

00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:13.586
-No, you don't--

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.863
no, I meant that
we're finished filming.

00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:18.858
-Oh. So, does cut mean... Knife?

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.010
-Huh?
[screams in agony]

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.863
-Whoa! Poor Baygle.

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:27.425
Well, at least he got the
final director's "cut." [laughs]
