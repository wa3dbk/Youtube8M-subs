00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.520
We just stopped on the track up here, we got little drone

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.799
helicopters now to get our aerial footage.
We stopped up here, dropped the cameraman

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.480
off, put the chopper in the air, driven through
shot, I’m going to turn round with the big

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.000
trailer here, pops off the track. Turned round
a couple of times already, I have just driven

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.350
into the pit of death. I’m stuck.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.280
Hey Jase, do you copy mate?

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.880
Yeah mate, what is happening down there. You
get up here or what?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.080
No, I have tried to turn round and come back
and I have turned into a bog.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.960
Where the hell are you? 20m off the road?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.520
No I was just doing the circle thing, you
know. Going bush, as you do to turn around.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.260
You look like you are way in from here.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.100
Been doing the whole filming thing, driving
where we should drive to turn around. Now

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.640
I’m bogged, oh well easy to get out. 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760
Think the ground is wetter than it looks. 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.540
We’re good! 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.120
You’ll rope anyone into helping you, won’t you? How are you mate?
