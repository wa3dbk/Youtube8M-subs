00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.960
The Christian Church has taught a doctrine
that has duped many Christians into believing

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.780
they will be raptured,
and that they will never have to see the Great

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.780
Tribulation. They don�t even see that the
Great Tribulation is starting to happen,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.679
and they don�t see that Christians are being
martyred and persecuted.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.419
Satan has pulled a blindfold over their eyes
and they see NOTHING because they are holding

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.269
onto their false doctrines rather than following
Jesus

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:43.269
and believing Him. These Christians formulate
their doctrine using Bible verses such as

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.710
this one here in Revelation chapter 3 verse
10;

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.530
�Because you have kept My command to persevere,
I also will keep you from the hour of trial

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.010
which will come upon the whole world to test
those who dwell on the Earth.�

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.570
The Christians use this verse as a PROOF Text,
to prove they are the faithful ones and that

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.570
Jesus will keep THEM from the Great Tribulation.
He DID promise to be with us IN Tribulation.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.420
This verse right here is certainly not a promise
that Christians will escape

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.420
and be raptured from The Great Tribulation.
The Lord Jesus told me this last night by

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.539
His Spirit regarding the Great Tribulation.
The Holy Spirit spoke THIS to me: �The Hour

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.710
of Testing: Each will be TESTED to see if
they will fall into temptation or CRY OUT

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.280
to the LORD.
The LORD will keep His own from being destroyed

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.280
in that hour of testing. Those who don�t
know the LORD will be destroyed, but the LORD

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.190
said;
I will keep YOU from the Hour of Trial. This

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.220
is demonic attack and possession that will
come,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.220
the devil will attack people and MOST cannot
resist because they are NOT of the LORD.�

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.530
The devil attacked me last night.
When I prayed, the Lord Jesus saved me. He

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.080
rescues those who cry out to HIM! We cannot
hold out the devil on our own,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.410
we cannot resist the devil on our own power.
We can choose to do good not evil, BUT the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.120
devil will continually attack,
and unless you know Jesus and unless you are

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.120
a Child of the Living God, you will NOT be
able to resist the devil when he attacks you.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.740
You will NOT be able to withstand the �Hour
of Tribulation�, but you will be given over

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.340
to tribulation and you will be given over
to your sins.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.060
See, most Christians are being given over
to their sins and they are NOT kept from the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.480
Hour of Trial because they are NOT abiding
in Jesus.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.910
That is what Jesus was talking about in Revelation
chapter 3 when He said;

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.590
"I WILL KEEP YOU FROM THE HOUR OF TRIAL WHICH
WILL COME UPON THE WHOLE WORLD TO TEST THOSE

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.870
WHO DWELL ON THE EARTH."
He was saying He will keep those who abiding

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.870
in Him from demonic possession. If you abide
in Jesus you will not be possessed by Satan,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.930
you will not be possessed by evil. If you
are walking in the Holy Spirit you will NOT

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.730
be given over to temptation like these people
are today.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.710
If you watch the news, people are being given
over to their evil desires and they are even

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.090
being killed, they are killing themselves,
they are killing others. They are NOT escaping

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.000
tribulation.
The ONLY way you will be able to escape the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.209
devil and what he is doing is if you cry out
to Jesus.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.209
If you truly are abiding in HIM. JESUS promises
to be with us through the Great Tribulation,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.599
He does NOT promise that we would be raptured
from our situation, He promises to be WITH

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:39.599
US in Trials and in Great Tribulation.
Jesus told us that we would be persecuted,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.770
I want to read to you what Jesus said in Luke
chapter 21:

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.680
�You will be betrayed even by parents and
brothers, relatives and friends, and they

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.740
will put some of you to death,
and you will be HATED by ALL for MY namesake.�

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.599
DOES THIS SOUND LIKE THESE BROTHERS IN THE
LORD ESCAPED THE GREAT TRIBULATION?

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:12.169
But Jesus DOES promise to be with us IN tribulation.
He says this also; �But not one hair of

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:19.169
your head shall be lost,
by your patience possesses your souls.�

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.560
If we hold onto Jesus and if we continually
abide in HIM and are patient to endure, Jesus

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.830
says that;
�Those who endure to the VERY END, THEY

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.830
are saved.� Will you be able to endure to
the very end? Holding onto Jesus? Fixing your

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.699
eyes on HIM?
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
