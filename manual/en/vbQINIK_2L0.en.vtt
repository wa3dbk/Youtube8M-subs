00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.640
 All right! We made it, Sonic!

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.380
Professor Pickle was kidnapped?!

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.050
It happened a little bit before the planet split apart.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.990
&lt;i&gt;Along with a bunch of mecha, a man with this and this showed up!&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.330
Professor Pickle was taken away, along with his lab reports.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.860
Oh no...

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.330
I bet Dr. Eggman's behind this!

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.200
We definitely can't let him get away with that!

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.300
We have to hurry and rescue this Professor person!

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.840
If he was kidnapped that long ago,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.070
he's gotta be real hungry by now!

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.280
&lt;i&gt;If I was that hungry...&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.080
&lt;i&gt;If I was that hungry...&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.210
I think I would just DIE!

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.260
Even if it IS Eggman, I'm sure he would feed him something at least...

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.060
OK!

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.030
Let's get going!

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.510
Professor Pickle!

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.250
We came to save you!

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.720
We lost contact, haven't we?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.990
Professor?

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.920
Hey! HEY!

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.560
They cannot possibly call this "food."

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.960
Look at this, this poor excuse for a sandwich!

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.400
If it were to be a sandwich, the bread would be no less thicker than three quarters of an inch.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.870
Upon it, a tablespoon of mayonnaise and a pinch of black pepper.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.540
And as for its contents, thinly sliced cucumber, if you please.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.850
Do you not agree, Tails?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.250
This is like a lecture, right?

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.450
Pr-Professor, you're the same as ever.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.810
May I ask what brings you here?

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.030
Surely not for these horrible sandwiches, I hope.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.220
Uh, no, we came to help you actually.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.130
Oh, I see! How rude of me.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.940
Well then, before we depart, I shall talk with the chef about making a proper sandwich.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.510
Professor, that's not important right now!

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.050
Let's get outta here before Eggman and his troops show up!

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.650
Ah, yes. Well then, let us collect the contents in that vault before we leave.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.870
Thank you.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.000
Those documents are the key to saving the world from this crisis.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.570
Now, gentlemen, let us be off.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.710
I'm half-starved from being fed nothing but those horrible sandwiches.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.080
Professor, like a bite from this?

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.980
Well, well! I shall help myself then.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.530
These documents are known as the Gaia Manuscripts.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.230
They tell of a legend of a disaster that befell our planet some tens of thousands of years ago.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.400
Disaster?

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.580
Yes. And according to the Gaia Manuscripts, our planet had broken apart before in the past.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.320
The cause of this disaster lies in the planet's core.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.520
Within it, there lives a hyper-energy organism known as...

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.920
Dark Gaia.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.630
Its presence within the planet is what caused this disaster

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.760
and all the phenomena we're witnessed.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.200
So how do we stop this Dark Gaia and put the world back together?

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.200
The revived Dark Gaia is still incomplete.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.780
It's most likely because Dr. Eggman awakened him prematurely.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.550
If we act now, we may be able to restore the planet by revitalizing the Chaos Emeralds.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.060
You must travel to the each of the temples listed in the Gaia Manuscripts.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.430
The planet's power will restore the Chaos Emeralds, and in turn the Chaos Emeralds restore the planet's scars.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.530
And the shattered planet will return to normal.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.420
Just who are you?!

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.220
Fear not, my good villagers!

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.860
If you all behave yourselves, I won't have to do anything nasty.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.300
Now, will someone tell me where I could find the Gaia Temple here?

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.930
Who would tell YOU anything?!

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.310
Alright then, in that case, why not I make you tell me by force?

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.780
What th-?!

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.350
Sonic!

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.520
Yo, Eggman!

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.390
Thanks for the high skydiving experience the other day!

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.860
I should've known you'd still be alive,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.000
you meddling hedgehog!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.500
What are you doing here anyway?

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.600
As if I'm going to tell you that.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.470
I'm far too busy!

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.970
Farewell!

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.170
Hey!

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.140
That's unfair! Come back!

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.580
Let 'em go for now.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.250
More importantly, is everyone alright?

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.150
[Oh yes! Thank you very much! You saved us!]
