00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.690
Video games are still a relatively new thing.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.830
Compared to television, and movies...video
games are still the punk kid, who thinks their

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.270
heroes are legends.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.040
Meanwhile, movies are like, "Oh, your little
plumber's a legend, huh?

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.050
And after just 30 years.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.480
Aww, that's adorable."

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.550
Turns out movies are kind of dicks.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.480
Nonetheless, gaming still has its pioneers.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.360
The only thing is, while some of those pioneers
are straight-up OGs, that are still bringing

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.510
it even today...some of them are just old.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.840
Some of them never really figured out how
to evolve with the industry they helped to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.840
create.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.110
Don't let the voice fool you.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.610
Frogger's one of them.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.040
So it was 2002.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.250
That's 21 years after the original Frogger.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.479
Frogger was old enough to drink, when this
came out.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.110
In gaming years, that's ancient.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.100
And obviously, the gaming landscape was completely
different.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.940
It was almost a law, you couldn't do 2D games
anymore.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.540
Not on consoles, at least.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.000
So when Konami set out to revive Frogger,
they were playing by a 2002 set of rules.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270
For a game that was at its best in 1981.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.509
I mean, I'm not a math guy, but...that was
probably their first mistake.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:48.710
Half of the problems with Frogger Beyond...are
conceptual.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.140
There was just no reason to squeeze Frogger
into that early 2000s platformer template.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.829
Cut scenes, and dialogue, and a plot...uh,
no.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:58.829
Doesn't work.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.960
This is the same kind of crap that a lot of
modern Pac-Man games struggle with.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.350
Arcade games should be arcade games.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.649
When they try to be something they're not,
it's just embarrassing.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.590
It's, like...casting Betty White as Catwoman.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.100
Actually, that would be kind of awesome.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.980
So you play as Frogger.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.620
Who, in the last 30 years, got really heavy
into Satanism, apparently.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.730
What the f*ck is goin' on here?

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.400
This is supposed to be Frogger!

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.420
This is, like, Frogger The 13th.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.420
Ugh.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.450
Anyway, Frogger has to...do something, I don't
know.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.870
It's not jump across stuff, so I'm not interested.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.599
And since it was 2002, he had to check off
all the level cliches.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.530
Jungle level, water level, mechanical level...

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.640
There may or may not be a lava level.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.760
That'll be 
a surprise.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.430
Look, I'm not saying you can't update Frogger.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.870
You absolutely can.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.260
This is not the way to go about it.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.290
Different environments?

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.290
Cool.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.769
Throwing in some 3D-ness here and there?

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.769
Fine, that's apparently a rule nowadays.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:12.769
So whatever.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.580
It's, just...there's no way I'm going to take
a game seriously when it's trying to tell

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.560
me a story about this talking frog who has
to travel through dimensions.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.860
It's just so tired, and stupid.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.330
And in this case, totally unnecessary.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.880
Fortunately, once you cut through the crap...the
gameplay is definitely better.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.670
It's takes the classic Frogger concept and
places it in larger, pseudo-3D levels.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.230
You have to get Frogger to the end of each
level, one jump at time.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.970
He can't run or anything, that's the point
of Frogger.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.280
Along the way, there are tons of obstacles
to make that journey more difficult.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.450
Like, a lot more f*cking difficult.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.150
This game is insanely difficult.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.620
And that's due in no small part to its awful
camera.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.640
There are times when you can't even see where
you're jumping, or where you're supposed to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.490
jump.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.190
So if the game retains anything Frogger, it's
the gameplay and the difficulty.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.450
Moving one space at a time in these huge levels
is, just...a tremendous pain in the ass.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.780
It takes a lot of patience to play this game,
even more than skill.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.190
And I have very little patience, so.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.190
That's my bad.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.800
But the game could definitely be a little
more forgiving.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.460
I mean, the checkpoints are nice, but...

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.460
Come on.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.670
Get the f*ck out here, with this.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.930
Fortunately, the game actually looks pretty
good.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.800
Music, on the other hand...is a nightmare.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.390
Remember the DK Rap from Donkey Kong 64?

00:04:36.390 --> 00:05:00.670
This is way worse.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.750
Why does Frogger need a rap theme?

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.750
You know what?

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.750
I don't even want to know.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.910
Besides, I don't think there's an answer other
than, "Well, because it's 2002."

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.250
That's the whole impetus behind this game.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.380
It wasn't, "Hey, I have an idea for a new
Frogger game."

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.660
It was just "Let's make Frogger more 2002."

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.290
There are some good ideas in here, but you
have to...hop over that sh*tty idea to get

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.290
to them.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.180
And jumping will frustrate you, anyway.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.280
It's Frogger Beyond, for the Nintendo GameCube.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.800
I need you to go away, Frogger.
