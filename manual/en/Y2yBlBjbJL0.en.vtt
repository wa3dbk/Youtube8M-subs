I'm sorry but you asked me what time it is

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
did you look at the clock? look, 2.22 pm!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.379
have you seen what time it is?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.160
thats what you asked me!

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 No Nina but what i told you was that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.380
other artbook review so...

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
...just like it was the last time..

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.680
so that you just stop with these things

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.644
ask me again and i will answer,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.220

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.140
yes,again, NINA DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.480
 yeeeeih yeah right adventure time..

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.680
now give me the bone since that's what is making me look at the camera

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.600
right....

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.280
ok

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.560
   Hey guys it's tresh from treshtoons

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.234
and today

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:55.600
i bring you another artbook

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.320
just like i promised before

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.960
and since most of you liked the previous artbook

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.420
today i bring you another book

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.740
this one was a gift for my 24th birthday

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.380
So i don't know how much it was

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.440
anyway i will show you anyway

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.100
The art of OoO

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.700
OoooOoooOOOooooooo

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.940
  So, the art of adventure time

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.820
This book is, massive! as you can see

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.400
the book is huge,it has so many pages,colours from start to finish

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.400
no words, the book is amazing, it has over 300 pages

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.975
it has everything that you may want to know

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.875
and want to learn about adventure time

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960
the book won't teach you step by step

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.020
on how to draw the characters,but

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.200
it speaks a bit about the story of each of them

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.260
the concept of each character

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.800
they talk about how they came up with some of the final art

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.180
Just like the text saying Adventure time

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.340
since that is drawn,not a font that exists

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.840
you already seen me draw or you will see a drawing that i made for wuant

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.140
that i had to made something like the lettering that says Adventure Time

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.760
you can see here some styles of some concept arts

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.100
just like i said in the last video about The Dreamworks Amation

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.620
you have the diferent steps untill you get to the character itself

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.100
overall it's a book that personally i was very happy for getting it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.720
it's a MUST HAVE if you like animation

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.420
and if you are as curious as i am when it comes to animation

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.900
getting to know how it went from Pendleton Ward's style and his ideas that he had untill

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.000
they get to Fin and Jake, and Fiona and Cake, to Princess BG

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.140
to Ice King or Marceline, The Lich King

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.200
So many things, So many characters untill they ended up of what they became today

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.460
,and i'm telling you, i don't know the price of the book, i have the idea that it is about

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.440
30€, this being bought through amazon, so about 25£

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.600
But i am telling you that for someone that is as a fan as i am

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.160
its almost the same as recieving a book about DBZ for someone who grew up in the 90's

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.860
it's a MUST HAVE for who really likes adventure time

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.100
for who likes animation, not only for who wants to learn

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.340
but actually even for who has the curiosity when it comes up to an art style

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.340
that it's way more comic like

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.780
no doubt it was a great gift that i got, i loved it, and it is something i would give to someone too

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.606
the book just like i already told you, is BIG

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:48.546
it has a LOT of information, it's not just "fillers"

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:53.646
 Unlike other artbooks that i already saw, it HAS something usefull for many diferent people

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:59.046
not only people that want to know how to draw, not only people that draw,not only animators

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:04.426
not only people who write the stories,but overall, it is a great book that i advise you to buy

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:10.626
i can't add much more than this, because i am showing you some pages but

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.620
i won't show you the whole book

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.860
if you know someone who likes adventure time and likes to draw

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.240
it is a great christmas gift since we are almost at that time

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.800
if you want to learn how to draw it's an excelent choice to ask as a gift

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.000
if you have any kids,cousins,nephews, anyone that loves adventure time

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.680
many people think that adventure time is a retarded cartoon, basicly that P.W. was on acids when he created them

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.760
but i can assure you that it has a lot of hidden messages, life lessons, the same way that

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.040
Disney movies had and we didn't understand as kids, and kids still don't get them today

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.400
only now as grown ups do we actually get them

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.780
Adventure time works in the same way, and maybe you should give it a second chance

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.600
since perhaps you only saw the first episodes of the first seasons

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.340
but arround the third season untill the current one(since we are in December 2014)

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.300
i can assure you that there are A LOT of messages, specially at the ice king story

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.980
i don't want to be spoiling anything but, there are a lot of stories that

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.280
in the middle of all that mess they are life lessons, and it is an amazing cartoon

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.300
i haven't seen a cartoon this good for so many years now

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.020
and i'm not talking about Gormiti and stuff like that

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.960
i am actually comparing it to being a monster the same way as Looney toons were, Hanna Barbera

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.700
with Flintstones and Jetsons, so from THIS generation

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.123
adventure time is excelent

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:43.963
not wanting to add much more and making this too big

00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:45.960
i hope you like the book, i hope you like the video

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.100
if you did leave your like, if you didn't leave your dislike

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.100
subscribe if you wan't more videos like this

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.520
as always i'm Tresh, from Tresh toons

00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:55.298
Stay tooned!
