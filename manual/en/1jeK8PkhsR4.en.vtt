00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.850
The next area I want to talk about is one
that I'm particular proud of myself, pretty

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.260
much designed this under my own thinking.
What we have here, is what I'm going to call

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:20.330
the small head target mirrors. I've got four
foot square mirrors adjusted a little bit

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.449
different heights on the wall here. And, what
I have my boxers do is pick one that is approximately

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.470
their face is dead center of that mirror.
What we do is, is I tell them if you take

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.670
a step back from the mirror. As you punch
yourself in the face, you can simulate that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:49.250
being another boxer punching you. So, as you
step forward and your fist comes almost directly

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.740
into your face you can expect that other boxer
to be punching you. So, what we're trying

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.350
to do is get your face out of the target out
of the head target mirror. Ok. So, as we're

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.439
stepping forward we're going to bend at the
knees and get our face out of the mirror.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.420
Ok. Our first, on the other hand is still
going directly into mirror directly into their

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.530
face. They don't train at Bill's gym so you
can bet that their face is going to still

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.439
be here, while your face is down a little
bit lower and out of the head target mirror.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.409
When you step back again, it's ok to have
your face in the mirror. They can't hit you,

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.170
you can't hit them. You're half a step away,
this is where you need to relax. So, as we

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.749
step forward we're bending down. We're getting
out of the mirror. Ok. And, not only is that

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:37.759
good for just a jab. But, it is also good
as you can see for the one two left right.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:47.179
Ok. We start throwing now one two, two rights.
Again, keep your face out of the mirror. So,

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.170
four different height mirrors for four different
boxers. Even this one here, for the younger

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.460
boxers. Actually, I had to draw a little circle
in the mirror. Because, they were so small

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:05.659
that they were covering the whole mirror.
So, again it's one of the few times where

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.090
being having your face directly in the mirror
is not a good thing. Thanks.
