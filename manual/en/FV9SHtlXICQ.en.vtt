Hi guys! My name is J again and I'm talking
to you guys on behalf of expertvillage.com,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.320
and we're going to go on with our enchiladas.
I'm going to show you how to prepare for making

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.330
chicken enchiladas. What you want to do is
you want to get your skillet like this and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:21.490
you want to preheat it at about half way,
5 on mine. You want to come over here. What

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.580
I'm going to do is use 1 1/2 boneless skinless
chicken breast as you can see. They're already

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.859
pretty thin so I'm not going to pound these
down. The way you want to prepare them is

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.290
you want o make sure they're at room temperature.
Like this has this little fat piece; take

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.239
that off. What you want to do is you want
to make sure they're at room temperature so

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.179
when you stick them on the skillet, they're
already at the temperature they need to be.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:53.569
I have some chicken seasoning here. What you
want to do is you want to coat these completely

00:00:53.569 --> 00:01:01.850
and evenly. I got fresh ground black pepper.
I'm going to coat these. Looks like a lot

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.760
of seasoning, but a lot of this seasoning
just cooks right off and falls off. I'm not

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.330
going to add salt because the seasoning I
have already has a bunch of salt in it. If

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.900
you can look at the back of you seasonings
and you see salt as the first ingredient,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.521
more than likely it has a bunch of salt already
in it so you don't need to add salt. More

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:32.820
pepper. The reason why my chicken fajita is
going to become tender is because my seasoning

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.730
already has tenderizer in it. If you look
in the ingredients and it says tenderizer,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.990
you don't need to add anymore tenderizer or
anything like that. If your seasoning doesn't

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.300
have tenderizer, you want to go ahead and
maybe pound down your chicken or butterfly

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.280
it or what you want to do is maybe buy a meat
tenderizer and stick it on there. Since mine

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.030
already has it in there I'm not going to do
that. Now, basically with my chicken that's

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.920
all I'm going to use for seasoning is chicken
seasoning and fresh ground black pepper. If

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.090
you want to add a little paprika or if you
want to add a little chili powder or something

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.230
to it you can do that. For me I'm just going
to leave it like this and I'm going to let

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.090
the enchilada sauce kind of flavor everything.
It's going to be delicious. That is basically

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.370
preparing your chicken breast for being cooked.
