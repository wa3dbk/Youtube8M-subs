00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.830
Okay today we are actually doing a preview
of a 2004 Jeep Unlimited Wrangler.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.940
We are looking at an intake produced by AFE,
Advanced Flow Engineering.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.349
The intake that we have here is a stage 2.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.709
We do a different series of intakes.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.450
We offer stage 1, stage 2.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.460
Difference between a stage 1 and a stage 2
is a factory box.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.831
It is just a box in stage 1, when we add a
torque tube it becomes a stage 2 in the AFE

00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:29.320
line up.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.820
We also offer sealed induction intakes which
are completely enclosed for the people who

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.230
like the sealed version.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.840
00:36
On this intake here from AFE we are featuring

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.970
it with a dry media filter which is our Pro
Dry S. We have other options at AFE we have

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.190
our 5-R, which is our performance filter,
and we also offer a Pro Guard 7, which is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.130
our 7 layer filter.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.440
This filter here is a dry media filter from
AFE.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.500
The cleaning installation of this is fairly
simple.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.110
If I want to restore a dry filter since it
is oil free, I can tap it and I am doing this

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.430
here so you can see I am tapping out particles.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.540
I will get an 86 percent restoration of the
filter.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:33.409
If I choose to restore it at 92 percent, I
can take a vacuum and I can vacuum out 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.450
the filter.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:02:50.379
And if I want 100 percent restoration, I will

00:02:50.379 --> 00:03:14.760
simply 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:46.269
use 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:04:38.550
soap and water, dip the filter 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:57.210
in 
there for cleaning.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:12.509
It is 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:33.439
a dry media filter.

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:49.399
