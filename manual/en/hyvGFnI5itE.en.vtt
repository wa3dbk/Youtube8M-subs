[Singing Taylor Swift song '22']
[giggle]

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.830
Sorry. I didn't see you there. I know a lot
of you LOVE "Dork Diaries" and are a big,

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:19.090
BIG, fan. I have been getting a lot of requests
on another "Dork Diaries" review. So here

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.560
it is, but I'm giving you a double review!
"Dork Diaries Tales of a Not-So-Talented Pop

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.539
Star" and my review of the most talented Pop
star! And Im not talking about Nikki. I'm

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.640
talking about Taylor Swift!
[music playing]

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.640
Now excuse me while listen to the rest of
my music.

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:50.019
In tales of a Not-So-Talented Pop Star Nikki
enters a talent show. Now I have never been

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.100
in a talent show but I have gone to a talent
show. It was the best talent show I've ever

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.989
been to. Guess what it was Called. Taylor
Swift Red Concert!

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.989
&gt;&gt; Mom: Why are you making Taylor Swift signs?
&gt;&gt; Girls: Because were going to a Taylor Swift

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.220
concert!
&gt;&gt; Mom: Woo!

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.460
&gt;&gt; Brooke: And Im riding in my first limousine.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.549
[girls screaming] Were going to Taylor Swift!

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.580
&gt;&gt; Brooke: Were Famous!

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.103
&gt;&gt; Girls: Taylor Swift!

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.620
[Music playing Taylor Swift 22]

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.960
The Taylor Swift concert was definitely one
of my favorite experiences. There was fire,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.290
there were fire works, she was floating in
the air, I was on the big screen!

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.400
a party with Taylor Swift.
You know, I could picture Taylor Swift and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.860
Nikki being friends. They are just so Dorkalicious.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.860
In this book, Nikki's dad is the schools exterminator.
And she's so embarrassed because he drives

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.340
a van with a roach on top and its just so
embarrassing. And its the only reason she's

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.130
actually there at the school. Mackenzie is
the only other person that knows about this

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.590
and she uses it against her. She puts a bunch
of bugs everywhere so that her dad will have

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.560
to come and clean them out.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.310
Nikki's so embarrassed by her Dad, that she
doesn't tell him that he's supposed to come

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.310
to the school to get rid of the bugs. And
she made a BIG mistake and the only way to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.160
fix it is to get her scholarship and get into
the talent show!

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.410
Now I don't want to give anything away in
this book but if you like Brandon, your going

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.370
to think she made a great choice.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.280
