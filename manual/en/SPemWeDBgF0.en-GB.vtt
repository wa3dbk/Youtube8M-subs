00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.450
Get Inside the Tanks

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.280
with Richard "The_Challenger" Cutland

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.010
The Panzer IV

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.240
Deutsches Panzer Museum, Munster

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.130
Welcome to the Deutsches Tank Museum...

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.570
...in Munster, for another...

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.570
...in the series - Inside the Tanks.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.690
Today we're going to take...

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.940
...a closer look at this...

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.040
...the Panzer IV...

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.580
..the backbone of Germany's...

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.580
...panzer forces, throughout WWII.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.800
Pzkw, IV Medium Tank

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.800
Longest Serving German Tank of WWII

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.000
It was in service in one form...

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.210
..or another, from the beginning....

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.720
...to the end, and is a tribute...

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.010
...to the soundness of its design...

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.310
...that it remains capable...

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.680
...of giving a good account of itself...

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.530
...on the battlefield....

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.470
...even though it was increasingly...

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.320
...up against bigger, better-armed...

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.830
...and better-armoured tanks.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.600
This example...

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.980
...is a relatively late model...

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.980
...the "AusfÃ¼hrung G" or "G Version"...

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.190
...nearly 1700 of this type...

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.510
...were produced from mid-1942...

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.130
...to mid-1943 before it was replaced...

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.380
...by later variants.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.600
Development

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.630
At the outbreak of war...

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.960
...Germany's panzer divisions...

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.950
...were widely equipped with...

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.280
...Panzer Is and IIs...

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.810
...but even then, these were only...

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.680
...light vehicles...

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.990
...better suited to training...

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.480
...and it had long been obvious...

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.840
...that replacements were needed...

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.340
...and replacements had been planned...

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.340
...from as early as 1935.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.550
The result was the Panzer III...

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.510
...and the Panzer IV...

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.820
...the III manufactured...

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.750
...by Daimler-Benz...

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.750
...and the IV by Krupp.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.270
At the start, different roles...

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.280
...had been planned for both...

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.460
...with the IV designed as an...

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.760
...infantry-support tank...

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.480
...and the lighter III, designed....

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.590
...to engage enemy armour...

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.590
...but that would soon change...

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.950
...once Germany came up against...

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.450
...much tougher tanks in the USSR.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.870
Krupp's prototype for the IV...

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.960
...was armed with a short 75mm gun...

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.120
...and quite thin armour...

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.740
...and went to production in 1937...

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.930
...but real life on the battlefield...

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.130
...soon highlighted the need...

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.980
...for more protection...

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.490
...so, from then on, the Panzer IV's...

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.520
...armour was constantly upgraded...
...so, from then on, the Panzer IV's...

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.240
...armour was constantly upgraded...

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.800
...either by simply bolting on...

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.600
...extra plates...

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
...or replacing them with thicker ones.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600
Construction

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.620
The construction of the Panzer IV...

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.820
...was typical for its day.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.720
It's basically flat plates...

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.620
...welded together.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.940
There's some attempt...

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.140
...like here on the turret...

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.220
...to angle plates...

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.900
...so as to offer better protection.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.620
The tank is effectively 3 boxes.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.120
The engine compartment...

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.200
...the fighting compartment...

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.160
...with a turret...

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.160
...and the front or driving compartment.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.020
By the time we get to the G variant...

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.640
...the front hull armour had increased...

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.660
...from the original 15mm to 50mm...

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.960
...and would later add...

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.560
...another 30mm plate...

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.200
...to bring it up to 80mm.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.480
The side armour and the turret armour...

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.400
...were both increased from 20 to 30mm.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.860
Size wise...

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.980
...the Panzer IV was similar...

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.640
...to the Sherman...

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.660
...although slightly lower.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.560
It was taller than the T-34-76...

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.300
...and about the same length overall.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.540
It weighed 25 metric tonnes...

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.900
...a little less than the T-34-76.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.900
Thanks to its 12 cylinder...

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.520
...V12 Maybach HL120 engine...

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.040
...which delivered around 300 hp...

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.920
...the whole thing had a useful...

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.400
...maximum road speed of 42 km/h...

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.500
...and a cross-country speed of 16 km/h.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.760
The suspension remained constant...

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.160
...throughout the production run...

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.060
...with leaf-springs on 4 bogies...

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.820
...on each side...

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.380
...each carrying 2 wheels...

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.000
...offering good weight distribution...

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.340
...and simple maintenance.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.650
Gun

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.660
Just like its armour...

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.660
...the Panzer IV's gun...

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.980
...was continually upgraded...

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.420
...throughout its operational life.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.960
This vehicle here...

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.280
...has the long 75mm Kw.K 40.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.640
Where tank guns are concerned...

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.760
...the longer the barrel...

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.800
...the greater the punch...

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.060
...and length was expressed...

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.740
...as a multiple of the gun's calibre.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.580
This gun started out...

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.220
...with a length of 43 calibres...

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.480
...and then quickly moved to 48 calibres.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.220
This could penetrate...

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.000
...up to 97mm of armour at 1000m...

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.110
...which gave it...

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.230
....more than a fair chance against...

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.680
...just about all allied tanks...

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.120
...until very late in the war.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.880
Its main ammunition...

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.840
...was the Panzergranate 39.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.900
Secondary armament consisted of...

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.360
...two MG 34s...

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.360
...one coaxial with the main gun...

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.900
...and another in the front hull...

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.420
...fired by the radio operator.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.940
Crew access was pretty good.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.220
The driver and co-driver...

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.780
...who was also the radio operator...

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.660
...and machine gunner...

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.440
...had hatches above their positions.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.540
The commander had his cupola...

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.400
...in the turret roof...

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.740
...and the gunner and loader...

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.680
...had hatches in the turret's sides.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.540
Inside

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.020
Inside, the layout...

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.180
...is quite conventional.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.060
I'm sitting in the commander's seat...

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.120
...inside the turret.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.320
Above me is the commander's hatch...

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.020
...and you can see the vision slits...

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.980
...in the cupola.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.720
It's pretty cramped in here...

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.340
...and you can see it...

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.160
...being more cramped...

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.760
...with all the ammunition storage.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.100
A Long Run

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.020
By the end of the war...

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.700
...more than 8000 Panzer IVs...

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.640
...had been built, making it by far...

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.120
...Germany's most important tank...

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.320
...in terms of sheer numbers.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.880
The 2 final variants after this one...

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.060
...the H and J...

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.140
...saw further moves...

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.360
...to strengthen the armour...

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.820
...and simplify the construction.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.620
But it was clear that the IV...

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.080
...was reaching the limit of its life.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.100
The most obvious extra armour...

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.960
...were the side-skirts...

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.900
...of marked steel...

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.080
...designed to detonate...

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.280
...hollow charge projectiles....

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.580
...before they hit the hull.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.820
These weren't much liked by the crews...

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.040
...because they were easily damaged...

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.860
...in rough country...

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.360
...and often had to be removed.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.980
Following German practice elsewhere...

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.480
...the IV's very good chassis...

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.860
...was used as the basis...

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.300
...for a range of other vehicles...

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.000
...like the SturmgeschÃ¼tz IV...

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.400
...which mated the chassis...

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.400
...with a StuG III superstructure...

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.120
...and the Jagdpanzer IV...

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.200
...which was a more thorough redesign...

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.300
...as a dedicated anti-tank weapon...

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.600
...using first the 75mm L48...

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.140
...and then the L70 gun of the Panther.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.220
So good was the Panzer IV...

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.800
...that even when the war finished...

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.220
...it still continued to be used...

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.820
...by Bulgaria and Romania...

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.560
...and a number, amazingly...

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.560
...even saw action in the 6 day war...

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.980
...of 1967 in the Syrian army.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.980
So that's the Panzer IV then.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.740
A thoroughly well-designed...

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.820
...and well-made tank...

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.820
...which was developed consistently...

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.280
...and which maintained its presence...

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.920
...on the battlefield long after others...

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.020
...had disappeared.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.200
Arguably...

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.180
...it should have been replaced...

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.000
...long before.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.660
But the pressures of war...

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.680
...and the teething troubles...

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.300
...which plagued later German tanks...

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.540
...ensured that it hung on...

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.400
...and became the only tank...

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.480
...of all the combatants...

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.100
...which was in action on the first...

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.560
...and last days of the war.
