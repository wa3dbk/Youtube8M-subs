I'm Joe Marshall with expertvillage.com and
today we are going to discuss shuffles and

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.050
cuts. This is a type of poker shuffle you
would see a actual dealer do at a blackjack

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.660
table or a poker game or on Texas hold them
tournaments on tv. What they would do they

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.070
would separate the deck like so they come
across with the hands on top. First finger

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.440
is on the top, fingers on the side, thumbs
on the back and what they would do they would

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.050
bring the two halves together and just you
their thumbs they start dropping cards from

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.800
each packet and it would fall just on the
corners. Then their fingers come together,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.610
pinkies are on the back. The pinkies do the
pushing and they push in, the fingers on top

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.430
and the thumb on the back keeps them from
sliding around and they push in and then they

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.430
come across and square up with all the fingers.
That is the actual legitimated way to do a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:03.090
poker shuffle is to come up fingers on top,
thumbs just let each card drop. Like so, then

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
the pinkies come around back and they push
in, the fingers stay on top, and the thumbs

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.630
on the back to keep them from sliding around
and they give it a square up and that is the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
actual legitimated poker shuffle. You want
to do it on the table I guess theoretical

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.560
you could do that without a table it would
just look funny doing one of these things

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.610
and coming in like that without a table. It
just looks more awkward then just doing your

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.200
riffle shuffle without a table. So when you
do your poker shuffles just make sure you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.420
split half of the deck and actually getting
into that position both hand start off on

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.139
top, both first fingers are mirroring each
other, both hand look identical, one of your

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:47.920
first fingers comes up and peels of half,
they separate, your first fingers come back

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.280
around to mirror each other. Both hands should
always look the same. The cards lay on the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.309
table. Thumbs let each card go one at a time,
it is just the back corners. Pinkies go on

00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:05.240
the back. Square up the cards and push in
and then you square up the pack. That is the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.189
actual legitimated way to do a poker shuffle.
