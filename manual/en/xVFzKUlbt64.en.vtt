00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.440
Hello,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.880
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.880
[pause]

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.570
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.219
Cosmeceuticals is a relatively new term.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.039
It’s an engaging name

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.320
that sounds both cosmetic and medical at the
same time…

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.940
and that’s exactly what these products are
supposed to be.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.250
Clearly, cosmeceuticals is the combination
of the words

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.340
“cosmetics” and “pharmaceuticals,”

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.190
and in the universe of pharmaceuticals, we’re
actually referring to “drugs,”

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.140
so let’s first understand what these terms
mean

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.129
to best understand cosmeceuticals.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.210
Cosmetics are defined as topicals used to
make

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.749
the appearance of your skin look better…

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:41.789
the key word being “appearance.”

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.559
So, they help the appearance

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.860
but don’t actually change the function or
structure of your skin…

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.999
That's what drugs do…

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:51.440
Drugs are defined as products

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.100
that affect the structure or function of the
human body

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.710
with the intention to cure, mitigate, treat
or prevent disease.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.799
The FDA is the government organization

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.910
that created these definitions and that is
also

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.250
in charge of oversight.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.390
By reviewing the ingredients

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.400
in the products and the claims made by the
manufacturer

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.890
as to what the product can do, the FDA determines
whether

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.820
a skincare product is a cosmetic or a drug.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.260
And if it’s a drug, it needs to go through
rigorous

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.280
and costly testing to both ensure it’s effectiveness
and safety.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.770
So enter Cosmeceuticals…

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.110
Cosmeceuticals are cosmetic products with
newer active ingredients

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.170
that really can help your skin and that claim
to have medical

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.240
or drug-like benefits, but the companies that
manufacture them

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.470
ensure that they don’t cross the line into
making a drug claim

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.350
or being a drug.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.070
This means they’re as close as you can get

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.170
to a drug without being one, and thereby,
can affect

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
desirable change without the strict oversight
of the FDA.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.100
Now, when I talk about “new Cosmeceutical
ingredients”

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.409
on DermTV, I’m referring to these newer
active ingredients

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.360
like vitamins A,C and E; Antioxidants like
poly phenols,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.170
green tea and Vitamin C derivatives; Minerals
like copper and gold;

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.370
Peptides, tensors, pigment bleaches, essential
oils,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.120
and so many more.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.480
And it’s these active ingredients

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720
which make these products cosmeceuticals.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.140
It makes them

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.480
much more effective than cosmetics but the
manufacturers

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.890
are also careful enough to promote them in
such a way

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.970
that the product doesn’t become considered
a drug.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.880
For that reason they don’t have the same
FDA oversight

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.310
as drugs do, especially when it comes to marketing
claims.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.260
So when it comes to cosmeceuticals,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.600
make sure you’re purchasing them from brands
you know

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.660
and trust, because when they work,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:03:00.950
they can really make a difference in your
skin.
