00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.819
Now a nice quick way to get some walking bass
lines going while you play is just take the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:15.290
root and just play 1,3,5,7, off it. So we
have key off of E flat major 1,3,5,7, so then

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:24.800
you have your F minor 1,3,5,7, B flat 7, 1,3,5,7,
etc., now a lot of these chords only take

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.660
up 2 beats so just do 1 and 3. So say we are
like 1,3,1,3, so now we are going to go through

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:56.309
and show you. So the first one is E flat,1,3,
and then B flat, 3,C,3,C,3,G,3,5,7,C,3,5,7,F,E

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:15.960
flat. So now look at my hand and I'm going
to say the roots E flat, C,F,G,C,F,B

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:36.200
flat, E flat,C,F,F,B flat,
D flat, G flat, E flat, G,C,G flat, E flat.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:02:04.730
It takes a lot of practice and once you get
it out of your fingers it is easy. That is

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:17.280
how you get your
left hand moving.
