Bonus Fact 1: You may not have heard of UNIT9, makers of Decromancer, but they've been around as an award-winning multi-media company since 1997. They more often work with branded ad campaigns for companies like Domino's or JetBlue.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:17.600
Bonus Fact #2: Since Decromancer was a pet project for Unit9's Head of Games Dave Rzepa, he did most of the early work for it - design, art, programming - by himself.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:36.700
Bonus Fact #3: Decromancer's stand-out artwork and distinctive style are a labor of love: all of the art was drawn by hand.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:04:31.000
Bonus Fact #4: Designing Decromancer for mobile platforms forced the designers to iterate on the game, making it small enough to fit on phone screens, but ultimately improved the simplicity and clarity of the design.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:06:28.000
Bonus Fact #5: Decromancer deliberately attempted a "good will" monetization policy, avoiding a lot of common free-to-play techniques in the hopes that loyal players would decide to pay of their own volition.
