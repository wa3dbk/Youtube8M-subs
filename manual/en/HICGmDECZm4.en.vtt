Hey people, welcome to my LP of Final Fantasy VIII. This LP would be commented in English but i 
 changed my mind and will be commented in Portuguese and i'll add subtitles to my english viewers.

00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:26.407
And... In this video we will take a look on Balamb 
 Garden, which is a military organization, people hire Garden...

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:36.246
to make some missions, like killing people and stuff 
 like that. Let's start going to the Cafeteria.

00:00:51.461 --> 00:01:18.461
Well, these 3 characters. Fujin, she always talks on caps and seems to be monosyllabic. Seifer, 
 the guy who tried to kill us and Raijin, which is a good guy, heh.

00:01:22.258 --> 00:01:23.628
Let's talk with Raijin...

00:01:51.784 --> 00:02:02.780
This running guy, well, i'll talk about him later but 
 you'll see him in the next videos for sure.

00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:40.190
A lot of people think that this FF is one of the worst, just because the system is pretty different and the history is 
 a little confusing. It took me a while to understand everything, i played the game like 2 times to understand the history.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:50.670
But particulary this is one of my favorite FFs.

00:02:57.924 --> 00:03:10.920
Here's the dormitory, there's nothing important to see there. 
 The parking lot, there's nothing important there too

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:21.870
Here's the Training Facility, it is closed by now, and here 
 it's the Library, let's have a look shall we.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:04:03.460
Here's a magazine, Occult Fan I. There are a lot of these magazines through the game and basically, 
 they're like curiosity magazines, they talk about some items and urban legends. It's nice to collect them.

00:04:07.073 --> 00:04:48.070
Here we have this guy and this strange thing, it's a Draw Point. Well, in FFVIII, we can equip the 
 GFs to our characters by junctioning them, and then you can boost your status junctioning magic to your status.

00:04:49.842 --> 00:05:17.840
Then you can equip the commands to your character, like Magic, GF, Draw and Item. I'll put 
 Draw, GF and Magic. I'll explain more about the Draw command later, in a battle.

00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:42.630
To draw magic from the draw points, these pink-purple things, you need to have a GF equipped to your character and the Draw command. 
 We have the Esuna magic here, 14 Esunas. After you've got the magic from the draw point the color will change to blue.

00:05:45.486 --> 00:06:19.490
Now that we have a magic, let's equip on our status. The magic are like items, they're consumable. 
 If you use a junctioned magic and the magic ends the status you loose the boost, obviously.

00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:34.230
Let's talk to this girl... she is part of a sidequest. The most 
 time that i'll be on the Garden i'll talk to this girl.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:49.150
Actually, it's not a important sidequest, as i remember you don't earn 
 any prize or item, just a cutscene, i think it's interesting.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:07:02.660
So that's it, we went back and looked at the main points of 
 the Garden. There's a save point. See you next time! :)
