00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.470
W. Somerset Maugham, who in his day was a
huge best selling novelist and he's still

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.849
read today, he said that there are four simple
rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately,

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:19.460
no one knows what they are. And that remains
true. Everyone writes a novel differently.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.160
I have known someone who wrote an award winning
novel over a long weekend. Other people spend

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.380
decades writing a single novel. Obviously
they're not using the same process. But each

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.690
writer has to find the process that works.
Some people work from outlines. They find

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.770
it very useful. At the very least it can be
useful to outline what you've already done

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
so you can keep track of it and you don't
contradict it too much in the rest of the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.809
stuff you write. Some people find an outline
too confining. Some people just start at the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.809
beginning, they have a character and they
have a situation and they write until they

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.480
find they've developed a problem and resolved
it. That works too, for different people.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.870
But you have to find your own process. Try
outlining, it may work for you. Don't outline,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.070
don't try, if you start outlining every word
of what's going to happen then you're writing

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.360
the book. You can do that too. Try outlining
by scenes, or writing by scenes. Don't think

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.230
in terms of chapters. Don't think of how many
pages you've gotten in. Did I write a scene

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.790
today? A scene is a unified set of action
in a single place. Try to have more than one

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.030
thing going on in each scene. And whatever
the two actions are they should be related.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.560
Keep going. If you wind up writing an awful
lot of crap, if you have write a thousand

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.560
pages of, and most of it is crap, well you've
still got maybe two or three hundred pages

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.310
of good story in there. Feel free to write
crap, give yourself permission, because that's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.620
the way we revise. The real work is not in
the writing, it's in the revising and finding

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.990
the gems that are buried in that awful first
draft.
