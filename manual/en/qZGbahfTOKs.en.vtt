00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.640
I'd like to tell you about the brushes that
we use in porcelain painting. For the smooth

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.019
brushes, we generally use a pure squirrel
hair. It's a much finer bristle, and it makes

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.610
for a soft stroke. And I'll show you what
that's like. Kind of condition my brush, which

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.910
always means you're working the medium through
your brush. When it stays together like that,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:47.380
it's ready to go. Show you with some red.
This is a smooth brush. Now I'm going to show

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.350
you, another thing we use are synthetic brushes.
And these are what you find at your craft

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:06.079
stores that people use for oil painting on
canvas and they are talon, camel, things like

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:12.579
that. They're usually a pretty smooth and
fine brush but they don't have the consistency,

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:23.570
which I'll show you here. You always squeeze
the excess oil out, as the squirrel does.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:34.649
You put it on and I'm going to tip it up.
This is a much more even coat, where as with

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:44.979
the synthetic, it's a much more scratchy coat.
And the reason is, we use the synthetic more

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:53.359
as a wipe out tool. So if you want to come
in and lighten something and you clean it,

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.810
you can wipe it out. But as you can see the
brush strokes, much easier here than you can

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:09.479
here. These are great little wipe out brushes
because you can get a pure, clear white wipe

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.319
out. So we use both brushes to achieve the
looks we want. And when you're finished, you

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:25.310
can clean them out either with your oil, your
medium, like this, or the Turpenoid. Again,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.250
if you have a lot of paint on your brush,
it's easier to use the Turpenoid because you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.629
can spare your oil. The medium oil sometimes
gets a little bit expensive.
