00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.190
Today we've been talking all about ironing.
I've given you some tricks and some tips,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.970
but don't run out of steam yet. I have one
other sweet treat to show you. It involves

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:20.689
a pillowcase. So go get yourself your favorite
pillow case. What I want you to do is get

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.179
a pillowcase. I don't know if you've ever
slept on freshly ironed pillowcases, oh, it's

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.790
really, really, really nice. What I want you
to do is get your pillowcase, put it over

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:52.620
the end of your ironing board like so. And,
really simple. Just to get a nice warm line

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:04.539
in there. Plus, when you wake up you won't
have a big crease on your face. This is a

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:16.090
special treat that I like to do. Look at that.
It just takes a second. Really does. It makes

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:25.929
all the difference. Okay. So next part of
the sweet treat is I like to add a little

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:37.409
perfume, just a bit, to my pillowcase so it
smells like me. There you go. You can iron

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:47.200
that scent in. Right in. That will make him
miss you, "Oh I miss my wife it smells so

00:01:47.200 --> 00:02:00.679
good." It's a little trick between us girls.
Again a little goes a long way. Don't have

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:16.840
to bathe in the stuff, just a little reminder.
Keep it moving. There we go. Another inch,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:29.370
steam. Now what's really nice is if you do
this right before bed, if you're home and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.260
you're doing it, right before bed and then
you lay down, it's just so nice to have that

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.909
warmth next to your face. A sweet treat ready
to sleep on.
