00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.270
If you really want to know what's going on
with your soil, you're going to have to take

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.680
a soil test.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.030
Now where do you get a soil test performed?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.730
Every state has a local county extension,
and on that extension website, you're going

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.630
to find a form that you can download and print
out and that form is going to need to go with

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.210
the soil when you send it in so that they
know what crops you're trying to grow and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.660
how to label the soil.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.940
So download the form, print it out, fill it
out to the best of your knowledge, front and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180
back, and then you're going to have to go
out in your yard and you're going to have

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.710
to get some soil to send to the county extension.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.440
Now here we've started already.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.980
The first thing you're going to want to do
when you take a soil test is to remove the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.760
top or the organic layer.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.920
If that's mulch or if it's turf, whatever
it is, get that off of there because that's

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.890
going to make the soil test seem different
that the soil you have.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.930
What you're interested in doing is getting
a sample of the soil that's underneath what's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.940
on the top.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.009
So we removed the turf, and then you need
a spoon or here, an ice cream scoop is pretty

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.009
good.

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.799
You might want to avoid anything that's galvanized
because the zinc can show up on the soil test

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.229
and might make the results look a little different
than they are.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.650
So you want a little Ziploc baggie like this,
then take your scoop.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.409
Now you're down below and all the organic
matter you've gotten out of there, so you're

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.950
getting just the soil.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.380
And then take a scoop, scoop a few scoops,
scrape along the edge of the hole, put it

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.110
into the baggie, and you're going to want
to get maybe a third of the cup of soil from

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.439
this hole here.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.829
And then when you've got about a third of
the cup, that's about a third of what you're

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.829
going to need.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.079
If there are any grass blades or organic material
in there you might just go in and take that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.600
out, because that might skew your organic
content reading.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.280
So you've got about a third there.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.829
Then what you're going to want to do to get
the other two thirds is make two other holes

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.100
in your yard far away from this one, at equal
spacing around your yard.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.800
So the combination of those three soil samples
you're going to have in this bag, you're going

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.790
to mix it all together so that really gives
a pretty good sample of your entire yard,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.040
not one single space.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.580
And once you've got it all in there, I'm going
to seal the top.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.840
Get the air out a little bit.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.879
Roll it up.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.040
If you have a rubber band, that's a good thing
to put around it.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.430
Actually you'll want to make sure if you have
more than one sample of that, you label that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.200
with masking tape or something like that,
or put a little piece of paper in there, and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.540
make sure that each sample stays with it's
appropriate sheet.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.599
If you have multiple samples, say you're taking
different lawns, "I want to know what my front

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.599
lawn is.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.000
I want to know what my back lawn is.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.959
I want to know what my neighbor's lawn is,
then you'll need a separate sheet for each

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.090
one, to go with that sample.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.640
One simple way would be just roll it up a
little bit neatly, put a rubber band around

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640
it.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.959
Then you have your envelope addressed to the
local county extensions, soil testing thing,

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.260
you put it in there, seal it up, send it off,
and then probably about two to three weeks

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.599
later they're going to send you a report back.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.890
Now that report is going to list several things
about your soil.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.230
Firstly and most importantly probably, it's
going to list the pH.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.290
That's how acidic or how basic your soil is.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.040
And that's going to be very important because
if you're growing turf grass you need a fairly

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.620
neutral environment.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.099
The report is also going to tell you how much
amendments to add to the soil to get to that

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.340
proper pH.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.140
Lime, if it's too acidic, or possibly sulfur,
if it's too basic.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.569
But that's rarer and harder to do.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.710
The other thing it's going to tell you that's
really important is how much organic matter

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.760
you have in your soil.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.560
Ideally, you want to have about five percent.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.069
And if it's low, if you have less than five
percent, they might recommend that you augment

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.299
your soil with a little compost or something
to bring some organic matter in.

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.659
We've talked earlier about mulching your leaves
in.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.709
That's an excellent way to raise organic matter
in your soil.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.280
So send it off to the county extension.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.560
Get their recommendations back and then follow
those to improve your soil to improve your

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.739
lawn.
