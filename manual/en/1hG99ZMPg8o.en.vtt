00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.099
hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.900
welcome back to another session

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.109
with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.510
we're going to make another delicious

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.660
okra dish which is called kadai bhendi

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.869
why do we call it kadai bhendi see typically

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.539
this is cooked in a kadai where the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.660
items are tossed and cooked but when you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.969
go and order dishes in a restaurant

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.730
called kadai you know like kadai paneer or

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.100
kadai vegetables or kadai there's

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.079
always two three ingredients you will

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.629
definitely see that is nicely chopped

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.289
onions and tomatoes tossed and nicely

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.270
cooked too nicely saucy kind of texture

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.789
and they always often use kind of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.620
capsicum that is bell pepper that is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.289
green pepper used in this dishes, to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.360
prepare this dish we need okra so what I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.379
did I slightly deep fried this cut okra see the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.510
reason why I cooked is in the kadai

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.100
preparation you don't take too long when

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.780
you after you add and you don't want

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.790
that sticky kind of texture that okra

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.880
can provide so just deep-fry your okra

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.740
but remember one thing look at my okra

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.530
see how green they are don't fry your

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.990
okra till they're crispy brown or

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.210
anything just cook them to a consistency

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.340
where they are nicely green in color and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.740
that is when when you bite into okra in

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.450
your kadai bhendi you get nice okra

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.909
texture and taste, some chopped tomatoes

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.850
I'm using some green and yellow, curry

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.829
leaf curry leaf is an optional because

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.479
if you go towards north India in some

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.770
of the kadai dishes you don't see

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.079
curry leaves but you know I have seen

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.060
lot of people using curry leaves in kadai

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.490
vegetables, ginger garlic paste, sliced

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.040
green chilli, chopped onion, chopped

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.450
coriander leaves, coriander seeds just

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.670
put some coriander seed and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.340
crush them, cumin powder, coriander powder,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.180
cumin seeds, red chilli powder, turmeric

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.190
salt, oil, in this preparation I am not

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.260
using whole garam masala so I'm going to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.510
use some garam masala powder but if you

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.489
want to use whole garam masala you could

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.150
use them add some oil into a hot pan add

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.269
some cumin seeds just like a half a

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.760
teaspoon and your crushed coriander

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.970
seeds and immediately just after frying

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.230
them for few seconds add chopped onion

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.220
I know I got  couple of complaints that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.780
I am not showing the right quantity of

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.720
the ingredients I went and bought spoons

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.850
here measuring spoons so we're going to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.100
try to use the spoon today  just add a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.810
pinch of salt, the salt helps in bringing

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.190
out the moisture from the onions and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.799
cook them good for this preparation you

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.450
don't have to really brown the onions

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.250
so what we are going to do we're going

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.010
to add turmeric just one-fourth of

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.220
turmeric don't add too much 1/4th teaspoon

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.019
of turmeric nicely mix,  one table spoon

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.560
of ginger-garlic paste and this is tough

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.459
make sure you cook it for a minute or so

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.830
so that the raw flavor of ginger garlic

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.290
paste is gone and then add some curry

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.989
leaves, your sliced green chili and again

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.700
mix it now the green chilies everything

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.090
is sauteed at this time what we do is we

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.360
add our diced tomatoes I have taken

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.690
two medium sized tomatoes and then added

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.569
to this we will let this tomatoes cook

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.799
meanwhile you can add  2 teaspoons of

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.829
coriander powder and the same two

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.450
teaspoons of cumin powder and 1

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.209
teaspoon of chilli powder,

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.140
ok now I'm done with all these

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.810
spices just mix it little bit,  see one thing

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.210
very good about all these kadai vegetables

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.699
is the nice colors that you can see

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.669
in the cooked vegetable so once

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.669
your let your tomatoes kind of get

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.310
mashed up not totally mashed up kind of you know

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.599
little bit cooked well see now this

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.400
tomatoes are slightly mashed up in

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.020
everything you don't have to cook this

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.360
tomatoes too much and then add your

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.260
capsicum bell pepper now just toss them

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.370
little bit after you add your green

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.440
and yellow pepper you don't want it to

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.630
cook it too much because all you want is

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.330
the nice peppery flavor get dissolved in

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.910
this sauce little bit ok you can see the

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.590
nice green and yellow colors of these

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.810
vegetables you can sprinkle half of your

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.180
coriander let this also get cooked

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.330

okra is all cooked just add your okra

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.190

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.529

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:36.929
and just cover it up and leave it like

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:40.019

cooking you don't see so much of flavor

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.059
but when all these ingredients mix up

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:00.359

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:03.419
