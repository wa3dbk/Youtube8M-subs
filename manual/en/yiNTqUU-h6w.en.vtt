In "Part 4:  Preventing Cross Contamination" you will learn what causes cross contamination so you how to avoid this potentially dangerous problem.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.960
Avoiding cross contamination is one of the most important keys in a kitchen

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.160
Itâ€™s critical to avoid cross contamination, always keep raw meats like chickedn, away from ready to eat foods like vegetables.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.980
Cross contamination is the spread of bacteria from raw meat to other foods.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.920
This happens when blood or juice from raw chicken or other meat gets onto a counter, cutting board, utensils, or hands.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.920
The bacteria present can spread to other food.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.620
It is very important to keep raw meat away from other food!

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.840
Always wash your hands after handling raw meat.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.680
Food-contact surfaces that touch raw meat must be washed and sanitized.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.260
Never prepare raw meat in areas near other foods.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.680
Use one cutting board for fresh produce and a separate one for raw meat, poultry, and seafood.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.400
Never place cooked food on a surface that has previously held raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.680
Cooked food can become infected by the bacterias these other foods harbor.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
Storage is another place where cross contamination can occur.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.480
Store raw foods on shelves below ready-to-eat foods to minimize contamination from accidental drips or other contact.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.220
Store meat with a higher cooking temperature (like chicken) below meat with a lower cooking temperature (like fish).

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.840
In my kitchen every employee follows safety steps to avoid cross contamination.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.780
Here's what we learned about Cross Contamination.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.320
It is caused by bacteria in raw meat spreading to other foods.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.540
Always keep Vegetables and Meats Separate

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.080
Always wash your hands after handling raw meat

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.580
Use separate Cutting Boards for meats and vegetables.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.900
Store Raw Foods on Shelves below ready to eat foods.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.240
Keep foods with a higher cooking temperature like chicken, below foods with a lower cooking temperature, like beef.
