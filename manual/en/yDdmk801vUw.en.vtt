This engine created in 2008 by devmas.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
While this video is only 30 FPS, the engine runs at 60 FPS.
This video is taken from my 1 GHz Pentium III.

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:18.001
A large amount of case was put in to making this engine as accurate to Megaman 6 as possible (because it was the final NES Megaman).

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:23.002
Jump heights, speeds and whatnot were analyzed, frame by frame, in an NES emulator's RAM.

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:27.003
The ice block, created for testing purposes, is positioned wherever you click the mouse. It then slides until it hits a wall.

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:32.004
The ice block is solid, and can crush the player and enemies. This causes for some fun testing :)

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:38.005
Moving this block around will show you that Megaman reacts to constantly changing environments. Perhaps some crazy levels can be created.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:43.006
Moving the block too fast will destroy him as well. It is not an error, but instead the engine thinks he is crushed.

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:47.000
These test Goombas I made invincible, so they do not die... but they react to the block as well. Imagine Megaman controlling a block, destroying enemies...

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:54.001
Because controlling the block is so fun, I am considering maybe adding a 2 player element, where one player controls a mouse,

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:58.502
doing things in the environment, helping (or destroying...) the main player. It would be like playing "Mario and Wario" for the SNES... but more fun :-P

00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:03.000
I also plan to add regular co-op as well... but I believe that games need new, refreshing ideas as well, or else we would be playing the same old all the time.

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:08.001
Now... a level for the game that I'm creating along with the engine.

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:13.002
This is based on Tecmo's Solomon's Key. I plan to have Dana, the character you play as in that game, the boss of this level.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:18.003
but this will be ice wielder Dana from Fire 'n Ice (or Solomon's Key 2 in some places). You can see where I plan to have ice blocks fall at during play.

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:23.004
This level is not complete. I plan on playing my friend's Solomon's Key more before I do so... maybe to get some level and enemy ideas.

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:28.005
I will try and make this game pretty challenging, like Megaman games should be in my opinion. I feel that games today are too easy.

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:33.006
I love Megaman (original series) for its learning curve and tight controls. I hope that I can translate these elements into my engine.

00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:38.007
I will definitely put out the source to this one day, with comments that will hopefully have others learningthe ins and outs of Game Maker.

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:43.008
When released, you can do anything you want with it, I guess :) Someone looking into making games may be able to easily create a Megaman game.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.009
Notes: The previous text was written before Megaman 9 was even announced. My favorite Megaman game... heck, my game of the year :)

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.009
I am glad that Capcom sees the fun in classic Megaman enough to take a risk and even create it in NES style!

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.009
I feel that the NES games have the tightest controls, and because the sprites are smaller, there is a lot of room for creative levels and challenges...

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.010
Thanks for watching!
