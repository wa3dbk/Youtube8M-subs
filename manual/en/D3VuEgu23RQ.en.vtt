What up FoodTubers, Jamie Oliver here we are cooking

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.080
in Australia look at the Sydney Opera
House nothing better than that we're doing a lovely

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.680
simple barbecue of crispy prawns, lovely little croutons

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.280
smoky bacon and we're gonna do it with none other than Tobie Puttock

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.940
Tell us about the dish that we're going to be cooking. I thought we'd get you cooking some prawns

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.800
on the barbecue today at the opera house it's a shame not to isn't it. Australia.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.760
yeah it's a shame not to basically we take these beautiful 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.600
big rosemary skewers. Yeah. And we're going to use them as skewers

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.580
Cooking on this stork will give you incredible flavour

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.600
We love it don't we? Remember we used  to do this dish with kind of scallops and prawns on rosemary

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.760
One day I couldn't get scallops so I started using ciabatta like this

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.280
And then I'd push it straight down like that. We're using a prawn here

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.440
But cooking next to your shellfish it could
be anything like scallops

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.500
salmon, whitefish. Once we stop barbecuing this all that beautiful fat

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.900
renders through the bread so it melts down, you get so much flavour into there.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.860
Kind of like super turbocharged croutons
like you get in a salad yeah.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.320
So I've got some cold pressed olive oil in here

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.659
or extra virgin olive oil with a crushed
garlic clove, salt, pepper

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.819
and I've got some rosemary which I've just busted in half here and we use that as a brush

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.259
and just before we started filming I
just warm that up for about

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.710
you know 2-3 minutes just to get the chill
out of the Olive oil

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.180
and that will also help infuse the garlic,
and the seasoning and the rosemary

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.990
through the oil

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.710
which'll then transfer through this as we start cooking. Yeah.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.580
I'm even going to put it in between the prawn now as well

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.060
So if I can - can I just nick some of your oil. Yeah go mate, go.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.380
Now we probably don't need to season it much do we Tobs?

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.960
Well we've already got seasoning in the oil. Okay. As well we can seasoning it a little more after. Straight on?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.640
correct

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.000
At the same time I've got some lemons
which are on here grilling

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.600
Everyone knows the flavour of a lemon but what a lot of people don't think about is

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.329
the sugar content within the lemon

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.589
which starts to actually caramelise when we're grilling that up so it changes the flavour profile

00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:03.060
So it's more jammy. More jammy but it also gets sweeter as well

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.500
Yep. And you're charring it as well. And you're charring it. Fantastic.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.330
Let it tick over. So we're probably ready for a turn I reckon. Let's flip.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.760
So I normally pick it up from the side sort of with the prawn facing away

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.240
and look at that. Gorgeous. Looks lovely doesn't it.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.560
So often when I kind of just got to this
stage, we're about to serve. I take some of this lemon

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.190
You've got to be careful when you doing this cause it's sort of that juice does get really

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.260
really hot in there

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.160
and we just squeeze that straight over the top just before serving it

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.450
It is like a little jam isn't it. It's cool isn't it? This is gonna be good

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.550
It's gonna be awesome. I think they're pretty perfect now and the colours

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.520
are gorgeous what a lovely thing Tobie. And you can see this rosemary as well

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.080
we can actually eat that now. So just sprinkle that over the top. It's beautiful yeah you really can

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.340
just put it over the top. We've got our lovely lemon again

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.980
and if you want to, you can take a little bit
of this olive oil and just over the top as well

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.970
beautiful, cool huh? So there you go guys so simple

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.200
and you put that on a BBQ and it's going to transform the norm

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.850

Let's go. I'll take the top, I'll take the bigger one

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:19.859
Aw man,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.519
Rosemary and seafood is so underrated. What a joy. They're lovers

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.739
That is super, super tasty
