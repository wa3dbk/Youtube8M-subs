00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:13.386
&gt;&gt; Welcome back to
Southwest Yard and Garden.

00:00:13.386 --> 00:00:15.116
We're here with Judy
Nickel again,

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.036
one of the Albuquerque master
gardeners and she's going

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:20.716
to show us some weedy plants
which are plants you might plant

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:22.956
but you find that they
tend to be very invasive

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:25.776
and some true weeds which you
really shouldn't be planting.

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:28.056
&gt;&gt; Right. Well you don't need
to plant weeds, they come up.

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:28.986
&gt;&gt; They will find their way.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.666
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.216
Some weedy plants.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:34.196
This cute little vine.

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:36.136
&gt;&gt; From a seed.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:36.956
&gt;&gt; From a seed.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:38.186
&gt;&gt; Planted by the birds.

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:41.236
&gt;&gt; Birds bring these things
in; this is Virginia Creeper

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.686
and this will creep all
over your whole place.

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:47.506
Vinca Major is another one
that a lot of people plant

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.516
and it's a cute little
thing but boy that really--

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.436
you'll spend 30 years
getting rid of it.

00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:54.066
&gt;&gt; Nice evergreen leaves,
blue flowers, but it is--

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:54.876
&gt;&gt; If you can get it to bloom.

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:55.716
&gt;&gt; It is a spreader.

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.416
&gt;&gt; And another spreader is
hypericum St. John's Wart;

00:00:59.486 --> 00:01:02.596
it has yellow flowers,
doesn't even bloom to well,

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.186
and it spreads by
roots underground

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:07.756
and you get a whole new
plant all over the place.

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.596
And then we have
some weed trees.

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:10.316
&gt;&gt; Oh yes.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:11.956
&gt;&gt; Ailanthus tree.

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:14.256
&gt;&gt; A lot of people
do plant this.

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:15.066
&gt;&gt; Yeah you don't need to.

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.676
&gt;&gt; And your neighbor
regrets it when you do.

00:01:16.936 --> 00:01:18.046
&gt;&gt; You neighbor will sue you.

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:20.376
This is one leaf.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:23.316
All of these little
leaflets make up one leaf.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:25.786
And huge things.

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:26.366
Now the Elms.

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.656
&gt;&gt; Grow from seed.

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:30.166
&gt;&gt; They come up-- they come up
from seed; they very seldom come

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.926
up from root but they will
come up from seed and you need

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.046
to pull those when
they're little

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.276
because their roots will go
to China for a while there.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.746
One of the worst weeds
we have and it's one

00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:41.676
of the worst weeds
worldwide I think is Nutsedge.

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:44.356
It looks like a grass
but it's truly a sedge.

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:47.186
It's related to what
the Egyptians made paper

00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:48.296
out of papyrus.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:48.796
Yes.

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:52.946
And here you see one that's got
a little, see the little nut.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.266
You don't often see the little--

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:57.326
the little nut at the
base of these things

00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:58.436
and that makes new babies.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:01:59.956
Bindweed.

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:01.726
&gt;&gt; Oh one of our favorites.

00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:02.916
&gt;&gt; Oh yes.

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:05.146
And in Arizona it's
outlawed isn't it?

00:02:05.146 --> 00:02:06.736
They make little white flowers.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.606
&gt;&gt; Good news for those who have
this who don't want to have it;

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:11.656
they have now received
authorization

00:02:11.656 --> 00:02:14.106
to release a beetle
which feeds on this.

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:16.166
It won't kill it outright
but it's going to weaken it

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.706
so it's not going to
be such a pest anymore.

00:02:18.026 --> 00:02:18.616
&gt;&gt; Here's one.

00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:21.076
These tend to come up
mostly in the lawn.

00:02:21.116 --> 00:02:21.886
&gt;&gt; You know when people call

00:02:21.886 --> 00:02:24.296
and ask us questions unless
they know what it is they call

00:02:24.296 --> 00:02:24.906
it milkweed.

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:26.946
&gt;&gt; It's called milk--
they call it that,

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:27.726
it's not a true milkweed.

00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:28.366
&gt;&gt; It's not a milkweed.

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:31.326
&gt;&gt; But it makes that little
milky sap when you break it off.

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:33.896
And that can be irritating
to the skin too.

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:36.386
&gt;&gt; Yes. And this one will
irritate your skin too.

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:37.636
&gt;&gt; That'll irritate anything.

00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:41.626
This is when it's little and
that's when they get bigger

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:43.726
and they can get well
this high and bigger.

00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:46.076
&gt;&gt; Yes. And beautiful
blue flowers,

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:47.066
a lot of people like it.

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.466
&gt;&gt; They look like
a tomato flower.

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:50.856
&gt;&gt; Right, it's related
to tomatoes.

00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:52.966
&gt;&gt; That's right and there's
what looks like a tomato.

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:54.876
&gt;&gt; This is the silverleaf
nightshade.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.216
&gt;&gt; Right and it's poisonous.

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:58.376
&gt;&gt; It's poisonous, it's
got prickles along the stem

00:02:58.376 --> 00:03:00.226
so when you go out to pull it
be sure you're wearing gloves.

00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:02.716
&gt;&gt; If you're into
xeriscaping and stuff

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:04.096
like that it'll be
all over the place.

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:05.396
&gt;&gt; So you need to
really stay after it.

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:05.926
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:06.426
&gt;&gt; Well thank you Judy.

00:03:06.426 --> 00:03:07.976
&gt;&gt; Thank you for asking.
