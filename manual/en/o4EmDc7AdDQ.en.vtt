00:00:03.132 --> 00:00:09.160
Hi again. Welcome to www.engvid.com. I'm Adam.
Nice to see you again. Today, I want to talk

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.586
about a topic that is a little bit unusual.
Everybody thinks that English is all about

00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:18.578
vocabulary, or grammar, or
punctuation, things like that.

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:22.939
There's little things, too, that you need to
worry about, and people often ask me about

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:31.400
these things in particular: ", and so on",
"etc.", "...", three dots, sometimes four,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.873
I'll explain, "blah, blah, blah", and "blah".
Okay? Not everyday stuff. I mean, every day,

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.575
you're going to see it all the time, but this
is not something that ESL teachers will teach

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:46.193
you, it's not something that you will really
learn in books, so here it is; I'm going to

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.250
explain it to you. Okay?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.473
First, "and so on". First of all, notice I put
a comma before it. Why? Because this will

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:03.153
always come at the end of a sentence or after
a list of some sort. Okay? When we put ", and

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:10.020
so on", we mean: and we continue with the
same examples. Right? So you ask me: what

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.320
kind of foods do I like? Well, I like pizza,
I like hamburgers, I like fish and chips,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.710
you know, and so on. What does that ", and
so on" mean? Does that mean that I like egg

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.709
white only omelettes with like asparagus and
broccoli? No. Why? Because I listed hamburger,

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:35.324
junk food; pizza, junk food; fish and chips,
junk food. So when I say: ", and so on" means

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.710
and more examples like the ones I just said.
Right? So it's very important to remember.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.160
Many of my students, they just throw ", and so
on" all the time. Talking, talking, talking,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.380
"and so on". And so on, what? I don't understand.
Right? So you have to be careful. This has

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.540
a very specific use. You're continuing
the same list or the same idea.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.954
Next: "etc." Usually, you will see it like
this: "etc." Now, how to pronounce. This is

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:12.733
the actual word when you open it up: "etcetera".
Now, some native speakers will say: "et-cet-era",

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:23.394
"etcetera". Most will say: "ek-se-chra". That's
what it sounds like when most native speakers

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.081
say it. "Etcetera". Correct, "etcetera", but
both are acceptable. Now, what does etcetera

00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:36.870
mean? It means: "and so on". It means the exact
same thing as "and so on". Again, you're

00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:42.390
continuing the list that was started before.
Right? Now, people often ask: how do I use

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.189
it in writing? Usually, you can... If it comes
at the end of a sentence, you put the period,

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:54.281
that's it. But if it comes in the middle of
the sentence... So: "I like pizza, I like

00:02:54.307 --> 00:03:02.061
hamburgers, fish and chips, etc., but I also
like..." etc. There you go. So I'm writing

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:12.183
whatever I write, whatever I write, etc., but
I also like other things. Right? So, it's

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.709
a little bit confusing, you got period and a
comma. The period goes for the shortened;

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.999
the comma goes for the sentence. Okay? Not
that important, but if you want to write it

00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:26.499
correctly, that's how you do it.

00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:33.120
Next, we have three dots. These are called
ellipses. You don't necessarily need to know

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.849
this word "ellipses", but just understand
that it's referring to this. What does three

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:48.247
dots means? "And so on". Same idea. Right? But
this is... Usually, you see this in writing.

00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:54.819
Instead of writing three words, you just put three
dots, because it's easier, people understand

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:04.617
it. But also remember sometimes it's used
just as a pause. Okay? So, person "A" says:

00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:17.003
"Well..., I think..." You ask: "What do you
think about climate change?" for example.

00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:23.172
"Well..." I'm thinking, thinking, thinking;
dot, dot, dot. "I think that..." Etcetera.

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.779
Now, "And so on" means... "And so on" means the
idea is going to continue. Okay? I'm about

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:37.043
to give you my opinion. Right? This is in
writing. Some people will actually say: "Dot,

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.576
dot, dot", but they're trying to be dramatic
or cool. If you saw the movie Trainspotting,

00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:47.949
you heard it there, "dot, dot, dot". Very
dramatic scene. I liked it. Okay? But basically

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.680
so far, all more or
less the same idea.

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:58.688
Now, you get into: "blah, blah, blah". First
of all, don't ever write this. Very, very,

00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:07.245
very casual. This is usually for spoken English.
What does it mean? It also means "and so on",

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:19.013
but because the conversation is not interesting.
Okay? My friend, Harry, he came over to my

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.639
house and he started telling me about his
kids, blah, blah, blah. And then we went out

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.990
to watch the hockey game at the bar. Why did I
put "blah, blah, blah" after his kids? Because

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.949
I don't care. I don't have kids. It's not
interesting for me. So, here's the story,

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.279
I'm making it very short because it's not really
interesting. Right? So he started talking

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:48.434
about his kids, blah, blah, blah. Time passed
by. And so on, his kids, his life, his toys,

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.270
his kids' toys. I don't know. I don't have
kids, again, remember. Blah, blah, blah, and

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.219
then the important part: we went to watch
the hockey game. So, I'm skipping all the

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:03.584
not interesting conversation by
putting in: "blah, blah, blah".

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:12.670
But sometimes we use the word "blah" only
one; not three. Here, three means and so on.

00:06:12.696 --> 00:06:18.779
One has a very different meaning. "Blah".
You see how I'm saying it? "Blah". -"How do

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:25.029
you feel today?" -"Blah. Not so good." -"How's
the steak?" -"Blah." Means not much flavour,

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:30.462
a little bit bland. -"How's the weather?"
-"Blah." It's like raining and cold, and not

00:06:30.488 --> 00:06:35.957
so nice. So, basically, any time you want
to say something negative about something,

00:06:35.983 --> 00:06:40.909
just say: "Blah." But you have to say it like
this: "Blah." It's like coming out of your

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.719
mouth and you don't want it to, but it has
to come out. Right? That's why it doesn't

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:47.453
feel good. It's almost
like a sickness.

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:54.339
So, there we have it. ", and so on", "etc.",
"...", especially for writing, "blah, blah,

00:06:54.339 --> 00:07:01.059
blah", to skip the not interesting part, and:
"blah". Now, I hope that this lesson wasn't

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:06.139
blah, but that's up to you to decide. If you
want to practice a little bit more on these

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.520
things, go to www.engvid.com. There's a quiz

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.369
to my channel, B) go to www.engvid.com and
practice these things. And lastly, if you

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:22.629
have any questions, write them in the comments
section and I will get back to you. Okay?

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.023
Thank you very much.
