Justin Dugan: Hey, guys, Justin here checking
back in with the progress of the Bama Terminator.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.690
Now this is our '03 Cobra that we are building
with the Bama Performance Team for the sole

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.549
purposes of just being an all-out track monster.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.110
If you guys caught the first video, then you
know our plans a little bit.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.339
We're riding out the stock blower as long
as we can with bolt-ons, and after that thing's

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.480
maxed out, we're going to rip it out, put
on a completely different power adder capable

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.710
of some serious numbers.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.820
You guys are going to have to stay tuned,
because later on we are going to throw this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.230
thing on the dyno for the first time and then
we're going to take it down to the track and

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.120
see what kind of numbers it is capable of.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.880
In the meantime, if you want to see these
videos, first and foremost you have to subscribe

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.890
to our YouTube channel.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.880

Facebook, head over to our YouTube channel,
AmericanMuscle Videos and subscribe while

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.629
you're there.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.109
In the first video, we checked off some of
the blower basics.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.649
We added an upper and lower pulley from Meco
Motorsports to increase the boost, while the

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.540
C&amp;L cold air intake and the power inlet and
throttle body combo made sure our factory

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.710
Eaton blower is going to be well-fed with
plenty of air.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.920
Fueling wise, we kept things simple for now
with a boost a pump from MSD, which should

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.440
be able to handle our added fueling needs.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.710
Now along with the Bama Performance Team,
we're going to round out some of those performance

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.520
basics in addition to show you guys some of
the parts we used to strengthen up that factory

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.250
independent rear suspension before hitting
the track for the very first time with our

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.250
new project car.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.410
What do you say we check out some of those
parts?

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.270
Pulleys and intake all sorted out with this
car, it was really time for us to start thinking

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.270
about the exhaust.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.220
Now, of course, we want something that's going
to help us out right away, but we also want

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.100
something that's going to work out for us
a later on down the road when we do get a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.100
little bit more radical.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.960
So together with the Bama Performance Team,
we decided on the Kooks one and three-quarter

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.840
inch Long Tube Headers, in conjunction with
the Kooks 3 inch Off-Road X-Pipe.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.410
Now Kooks is definitely one of the top names
in the game, and this setup should really

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.160
help give us a lot of power pretty much everywhere
throughout the curve, which would really help

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.740
us out without top-end gains, which, of course,
is what we're after here with our strip car.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.240
When it came time to pick the actual exhaust
for the car, it really just boiled down to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.310
our personal preference.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.320
Again, with the Bama Performance Team, we
put our heads together.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.910
We wanted something that would give the car
a nice little growl, so we decided upon the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.850
Flowmaster American Thunder Series Cat-back.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.950
You really can't beat this exhaust.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.840
I mean, full stainless steel construction
throughout, the polished 3 inch tips look

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.600
awesome coming out the back, and, honestly,
guys, you can never go wrong with a Flowmaster-Mustang

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600
combo.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.080
While we still have the car in the air, why
don't I show you guys some of the things we've

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.450
done to make the rear end a little bit more
stout, just as of now.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.200
I'm sure a lot of you guys might knock us
for not going to a solid rear axle right away,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.150
especially considering this thing mainly going
to be seeing strip duty.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.730
Truth be told, I was probably one of those
people.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.010
But we wanted to ride the stock IRS out for
as long as possible, just to see what it can

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.010
do.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.060
Honestly, there's guys going 9s on the IRS,
just given a little help, so we know it's

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.060
been done.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.530
For starters, we grabbed a carbon fiber one
piece driveshaft from our friends over at

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.900
the Driveshaft shop.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.160
Now, honestly, I can't say enough good stuff
about this product.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.870
We've used it on several of our project car
builds in the past, and the thing is just

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.640
pretty much damn near bullet proof.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.730
After that, we totally rebuilt and overhauled
our rear end using the Ford Racing bearing

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.630
seal and pinion kit and while we were in there,
we actually punched up those stock 3.55 gears

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.290
to a set of 3.73s.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.540
Now, the 3.73 gears, along with a 28-inch
tall tire seems to be the magic setup here

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.980
with these Cobras and should put us through
the traps at the top of [inaudible 00:03:20],

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.010
which is exactly what we're looking for.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.069
As for our diff, we went with a tried and
true Detroit locker from Eaton.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.000
A little tricky to drive on the street, but
when it comes to putting the power down at

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.959
the track, you can accept no substitutes.

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.520
The thing just rocks.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.200
Again, guys, just like our motor setup, this
is just the tip of the iceberg, we're definitely

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.790
going to dive a little deeper into the IRS,
make it a little bit more bulletproof.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.930
For now, with the power levels we're seeing,
this thing should be just find getting us

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.160
down the track.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.240
That wraps us up for now, guys.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.890
I'm going to get out from underneath the car,
and I'm going to show you a couple more things

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.030
underneath the hood, and then we'll get this
thing over to the dyno.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.550
All right, guys, as we know by now, when we
really start putting these roots blowers to

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.010
work, like we are now, increasing the boost,
heat quickly becomes the enemy.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.890
So, taking a page from some of our past bolt-on
build-ups with the GT500s, we went with the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.099
AFCO Double Pass heat exchanger down there,
which should really help keep things cool

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.890
at our current boost levels and power levels,
and especially later on down the road.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.470
Under the hood, as you can see, we have a
couple beautiful parts from Canton.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.249
We have their aluminum heat exchanger tank,
which is nice, replaces the cheap factory

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:23.629
piece that oftentimes cracks.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:26.930
We also have their battery box supercharger
coolant tank.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.930
Now, I like this one.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.610
This is actually their newer, street version.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.180
It does have a vent on it, and, of course,
it has a nice big top, so when we get down

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.669
to the track we can ice that thing down, hopefully,
keep that blower nice and cool for a few passes.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.520
All right, Paul, looks like you're working
hard out here, brother.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.789
You just about got the tune dialed in?

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.060
Paul Meister: Just about dialed in.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.539
Just cleaning up some of the fuel pump voltage
tables, some fueling, some timing, we're ready

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.539
to make our final pull.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.960
Justin Dugan: Well, it sounds like you're
about ready to do a pull, so allow me to get

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.289
out of the way then.

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:02.219
All right, Paul, we definitely heard that
Eaton working overtime, brother; 458, 469

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.219
at the rear wheels.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.419
You've got to be pretty happy with that.

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.620
Paul Meister: Yeah, completely stoked with
the power the car made, right in the neighborhood

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.620
of what we wanted.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.748
I can't wait to see what this thing's going
to do.

00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:13.120
Justin Dugan: Should be quite a handful with
about 450 pound feet of torque right off idle?

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120
Paul Meister: Oh, yeah.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120
Justin Dugan: Nice, man.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.120
Well, I guess there's only one way to find
out guys.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.139
We're going to get this thing packed up, head
down to the track, and see how she does.

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:25.039
Justin Dugan: All right, guys, so we're down
here at the track with the Bama Terminator.

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.322
My buddy, Paul, from Bama Performances here
with me hanging out and we're going to shake

00:05:28.322 --> 00:05:29.322
this thing down.

00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:30.322
Paul, what do you think it's going to do,
man?

00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:34.180
Paul Meister: Based on the dyno numbers, that
it laid down, probably a mid to high 11.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.180
Justin Dugan: Very cool.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.800
And I know traction should be an issue here
with this thing.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.720
We're just sticking with the radials for now
and, hopefully, those half-shafts stay together,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.720
too.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.720
Right?

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.720
Paul Meister: Yeah, hopefully, nothing breaks,
but you never know at the track.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.479
Justin Dugan: You never know at the track,
but on the plus side, guys, we have beautiful

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.830
weather today, low temps, low humidity, so
we have that working for us.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:58.120
I guess it's just time to get this thing on
the line and see how it does.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:07.550
All right, Paul, so first shakedown pass,
12.0, not too bad, followed immediately by

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.550
and 11.8.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.729
This thing is definitely where we want it.

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:10.729
Paul Meister: Exactly.

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.820
It's right where we want it, we know what
power it made on the dyno, we saw it perform

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.259
at the track, put some ice in the inner cooler
reservoir to take advantage of that Canton

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:30.449
tank, that AFCO heat exchanger, we're ready
to roll.

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.629
It's on.

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:41.580
That's what I'm talking about.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:49.529
Justin Dugan: All right, Paul.

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:53.210
Well, that settles that.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.229
I mean, the night was great, successful night
all around.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.279
The car just went 11.4 on its last pass.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.869
We're calling it a night there.

00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:59.869
We couldn't ask for much more.

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:00.869
Paul Meister: No, not at all.

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:04.020
We got perfect weather, allowed the car to
cool down, make a couple tune adjustments,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.020
and then let it rip down the track.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.860
Justin Dugan: Yeah, so 11.4, I believe at
121 was the best pass of the night, with a

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.919
1660 boot time.

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.319
That's not too bad, considering that was on
a radial.

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.319
Right?

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.319
Paul Meister: No, not bad at all.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:17.460
Justin Dugan: Yeah, we actually ran the slicks
for a couple passes, but we ran into an issue.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.990
We actually were grinding on some of the brake
components here at the IRS, so we actually

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.560
took those back off and the car went a little
faster.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560
Go figure.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560
Paul Meister: Yeah, that's awesome.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560
Justin Dugan: Hey, man.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.870
Well, now we're going to get crazy, we're
going to ditch that Eaton altogether, and

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.050
you've got something crazy up your sleeve.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.050
Right?

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.589
Paul Meister: Yeah, something totally crazy,
totally different.

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:32.830
Justin Dugan: Should make big power?

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.830
Paul Meister: Oh, yeah.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.830
Justin Dugan: That's the goal.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.830
Right?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.830
So, guys, you're going to have to stay tuned
to see this one.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.830
