00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.140
It appears we have landed

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.109
on Androzori. Why is that giving me a Self-ee?

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.290
I haven't even the slightest.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.260
Well. Lets see if this works.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.560
[Tardis take-off]

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.090
[Tardis take-off]

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.270
[Tardis take-off]

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.370
[Tardis landing] Huh, okay it appears now we have

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.880
landed. Do I dare try it?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.880
I dare.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.000
Okay, Tardis is locked.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.260
Where have landed? Is that the Tardis?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.080
What?! The Tardis?!

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.640
But how?! It has turned within itself

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.780
inside out. Actually no.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.220
It replaced the exterior with the interior.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.220
How does it do that?!  Perhaps we'll never know.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:24.840
Huh. Can't open the doors.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.240
But I do find it funny that the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.000
Mines of Androzori are quite mine-less.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.180
[Door opening sound] Ahh that's better.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.430
