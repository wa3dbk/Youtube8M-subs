00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:32.750
Chuck, what I’m saying to you is that there
is no simpler solution, no ready, credible

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.250
solution, other than Congress either give
me the authority to raise the debt ceiling,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.470
or exercise the responsibility that they have
kept for themselves and raise the debt ceiling.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.920
Because this is about paying your bills.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.640
Everybody here understands this.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.250
I mean, this is not a complicated concept.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:05.890
You don’t go out to dinner and then eat
all you want, and then leave without paying

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.940
the check.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.330
And if you do, you’re breaking the law.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.850
And Congress should think about it the same
way that the American people do.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.530
You don’t — now, if Congress wants to
have a debate about maybe we shouldn’t go

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.860
out to dinner next time, maybe we should go
to a more modest restaurant, that’s fine.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.070
That’s a debate that we should have.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:38.740
But you don’t say, in order for me to control
my appetites, I’m going to not pay the people

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.960
who already provided me services, people who
already lent me the money.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.369
That’s not showing any discipline.

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.130
All that’s doing is not meeting your obligations.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.760
You can’t do that.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.119
And that’s not a credible way to run this
government.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.390
We’ve got to stop lurching from crisis to
crisis to crisis, when there’s this clear

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.160
path ahead of us that simply requires some
discipline, some responsibility and some compromise.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.440
That’s where we need to go.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.480
That’s how this needs to work.
