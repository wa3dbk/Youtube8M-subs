00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.630
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper way to remove and replace a rear wheel

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.570
anti-lock brake sensor on a late model Ford
Explorer. In this step, we're going to talk

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.180
about jacking the vehicle back up and removal
of our jack stands and letting the vehicle

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.329
down. I'm going to take my heavy duty floor
jack, slide it underneath the rear differential.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:36.969
Tighten it up and give it a pump and line
it up with the center mass. We're just going

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.300
to pump it up until it comes off our jack
stands. Once we have it off the stands, you

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.620
can go ahead and release the safety mechanism.
This is the lever here, you'll watch, I'll

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.510
flip it up and the jack stand support arm
will come down. Going to do the other one.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:06.720
Going to slide them out of the way. From there,
I'm going to take and release the pressure

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.750
on my floor jack and let the vehicle ease
down to the ground. You're not going to want

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.090
to release all of the pressure at once. The
vehicle will slam down real quick, it's possible

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.320
to damage your jack, the vehicle or yourself.
Take and turn the jack counter clockwise very

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:39.150
slowly. You can see the vehicle is starting
to creep down.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.220
Alright, once you have the vehicle on the
ground, you can take and remove your floor

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.810
jack. Get the rest of your stuff out of the
way. The very last thing you want to do is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.160
perform a test drive. You take it around the
block; apply the brakes several times, just

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.150
to insure that your anti-lock brakes are working
correctly. That is the proper way to re-jack

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.990
the vehicle, remove your jack stands and verify
your repair on the system.
