Hi this is Matt on behalf of Expert Village
and today we are going to learn how to make

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.040
my chicken shrimp penne pasta with homemade
Alfredo sauce. Okay our chicken and sun dry

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.720
tomatoes are coming along very nicely, it
looks delicious. Now we are going to add some

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.050
spice and our vegetables. So we are going
to serve some Italian seasoning in here now

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.030
just do this for taste. Everybody is different.
I like to seasoning a lot of Italian seasoning

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.440
in like oregano, sage, and rosemary among
some other things. Just throw that in there

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.100
and I'm going to throw some garlic pepper
salt. Actually it is kind of a mixture of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.470
garlic, pepper and you know you guess it,
salt. I'm just going to throw some of this

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.879
in and as it cooks I will taste it a little
later you know and if it needs more I will

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.680
add more. If it doesn't I just don't put a
lot at the top I just put a little bit in

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.430
taste it as it cooks. If I need more, then
I will add it. So now let's add our vegetables

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:23.340
let's put our orange pepper and zucchini squash
and yellow squash in.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:42.920
Let's mix that in and that looks really good.
Look at that I'm ready to eat right now. Okay

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:52.049
now we are going to throw in our red pepper,
onion and green onion. Just kind of throw

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.530
that in there. Our mushrooms we can not forget
about our mushrooms. Okay that is starting

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:12.810
to cook nicely so get that all in there. Let
it cook for another 5 minutes. When the peppers

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.140
and the vegetables are soft that is when we
are going to add our shrimp.
