00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.238
"Phytates for the Prevention of Cancer"

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:11.039
Cancer prevention strongly acknowledges 
the importance of diet, 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.262
as dietary factors are 
the most important 

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:15.418
environmental risk 
factors for cancer.

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:18.140
Within recent years, a large 
number of naturally occurring 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.674
health-enhancing substances 
of plant origin 

00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:23.422
have been recognized to have 
beneficial effects on cancers, 

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:25.085
known as phytochemicals. 

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:28.330
Yes, beans, chickpeas, 
split peas and lentils

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.699
are packed with all sorts 
of nutrients we need, 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.164
but the reason they may protect 
against several degenerative  diseases

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:37.663
may be due to non-nutritive 
compounds in plants, 

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:42.660
or even so-called antinutrient 
compounds like phytates. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.500
The reputation of phytate has 
had a roller coaster ride 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.099
ever since its discovery.

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:50.814
It has undergone alternate 
eminence and infamy. 

00:00:50.814 --> 00:00:53.063
What everyone can agree on 
though, is that Phytates,

00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:55.042
also known as 
phytic acid,

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.522
is one of the most fascinating 
bioactive food compounds 

00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:00.699
and is widely distributed 
in plant foods.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.235
In the U.S. colon cancer is the second 
leading cause of cancer death,

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:07.659
but in some parts 
of the world,

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.341
they’ve had just a tiny 
fraction of our rates, 

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.618
with the highest rates 
reported in Connecticut, 

00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:18.371
and the lowest in 
Kampala, Uganda.

00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:21.817
The famous surgeon Dr. Burkitt 
spent 24 years in Uganda 

00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:24.660
and most of the hospitals 
in Uganda he contacted 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.419
had never even seen a 
case of colon cancer. 

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:32.500
Noting they live off diets 
centered around whole plant foods, 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.740
he figured that maybe it was the 
fiber that was so protective.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.890
Studies like this, though, called 
that interpretation into question. 

00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:44.380
Danes appear to have more 
colon cancer than Finns,

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:47.860
yet Danes consume almost 
twice the dietary fiber. 

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:50.460
What else, then, could explain 
the low cancer rates 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.820
among plant-based 
populations? 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
Well, fiber isn’t the only thing 
only found in whole plant foods, 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.500
missing from processed 
and animal foods. 

00:01:59.507 --> 00:02:02.500
Maybe it’s 
the phytate.

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:06.460
Dietary phytate, rather 
than fiber per se, 

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:08.700
might be the most 
important variable 

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:11.060
governing the frequency 
of colon cancer, 

00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.700
As we know phytate is 
a powerful inhibitor

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.540
of the iron-mediated production 
of hydroxyl radicals,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.020
a particularly dangerous 
type of free radical.

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.300
So the standard American diet 
may be a double whammy, 

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:26.620
the heme iron in muscle meat 
plus the lack of phytate 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.930
in refined plant foods to 
extinguish those iron radicals.

00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:34.810
This may account for what was 
found in the Adventist study. 

00:02:34.817 --> 00:02:36.790
They found excess 
risk of cancer 

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:39.310
for higher intakes of both 
red meat and white meat, 

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:43.190
suggesting all meats contribute 
to colon cancer formation,

00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:46.830
about twice the risk for 
the red meat eaters,

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.820
and three times the risk for 
those eating chicken and fish. 

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:53.430
But those eating meat could 
reduce their risk in two ways, 

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:58.390
by cutting down on meat 
or by eating more beans, 

00:02:58.392 --> 00:03:00.300
an excellent source 
of phytates. 

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:02.510
So it’s not just how
 much meat we eat, 

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:06.870
but our meat to 
vegetable ratio. 

00:03:06.873 --> 00:03:09.150
Between the 
two extremes-

00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:11.400
high-vegetable and 
low-meat diets versus 

00:03:11.487 --> 00:03:13.280
high-meat and 
low-vegetable diets-

00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:15.740
a risk ratio of about 
8 appears to exist, 

00:03:15.748 --> 00:03:18.000
sufficient to explain 
a substantial part 

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:22.110
of that international variation in 
the incidence of colorectal cancer. 

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:24.320
Those with the worst 
of both worlds,

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:25.750
high meat and 
low vegetable, 

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:31.050
were at 8 times 
the risk.
