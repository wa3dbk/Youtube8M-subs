00:00:01.732 --> 00:00:03.376
- [Curtis Smith] What better place is there to learn

00:00:03.376 --> 00:00:06.718
to grow your own vineyard than
in Napa Valley, California?

00:00:06.718 --> 00:00:09.172
With us today is wine maker, John Burtner.

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:11.405
John, what is the most
important thing people need

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:13.244
to know about growing their own grapes?

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:14.834
- [John Burtner] To figure out what type
of grape you want to grow,`

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:16.200
whether you're gonna try to make raisins,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.542
or grape juice,

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:18.739
or wines for-

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:19.910
I mean grapes for wines,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.714
those are the three things
you'd have to think about.

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:22.675
- [Curtis] So there
are different varieties

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:23.864
that do better for each one of those?

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:24.697
- Exactly.

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:26.104
- How can people learn which grape

00:00:26.104 --> 00:00:27.738
is best for which purpose?

00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:29.176
- I would say, talk to
your extension agent

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:30.347
because there are different grapes

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:31.725
for both jellies,

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:32.600
and raisins

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.753
and juices,

00:00:33.753 --> 00:00:35.067
as well as for wine,

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.762
and they're all different.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.939
- And I notice there are a lot
of grapes on the ground here.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.523
What's that for?

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:41.356
- This is the time where people

00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:44.273
are dropping crop, let me show you.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.613
Here's what I wanted to show you.

00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:50.704
You can see we've got quite
a bit of fruit on the ground,

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:52.860
as well as quite a bit of
leaves and little branches.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.124
We've been--
- [Curtis] Pulling the fruit

00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:55.107
up here though.

00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:56.565
- Yes, very definitely, that's right.

00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:58.198
You want it exposed.

00:00:58.198 --> 00:00:59.987
You can see we're going
to veraison right now,

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:01.636
so there's still some green left

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:03.394
but most of the grapes are turning blue.

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:04.711
- Veraison, now what is that?

00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:06.309
- Veraison is when,

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:07.751
actually it's when the
grapes stop growing,

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:08.785
they start turning color,

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:10.162
the grapes start getting softer.

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:10.995
Prior to this,

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:13.455
last week these were all
hard little green units.

00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:14.794
Now they're starting to get softer,

00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:16.513
they're still quite unripe,

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:17.831
maybe half ripe,

00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.025
but you're starting see

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:20.425
that we're going through veraison,

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:22.111
which lets us know we've probably got

00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.139
another thirty to sixty days max

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:25.501
before we'll pick this fruit.

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:26.334
- And that's when you're starting

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:27.290
to come of then, thin 'em out?

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.472
- Right, well we're just dropping crop,

00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:31.213
and making sure that we
have a balance in the vines,

00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:32.273
so that they can-

00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:33.392
all the nutrients can come up

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.010
and we feed the grapes.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.481
We don't wanna have too many grapes

00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:38.023
just like we don't wanna
have too many leaves

00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:39.419
because otherwise all the nutrients

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:40.838
are going to the canopy,

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:42.075
and the grapes aren't gonna ripen.

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:43.268
- [Curtis] That's why
I see some of the vines

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:44.101
on the ground too, then?

00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:45.434
- Exactly.

00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:47.863
We're dropping crop and
we're also thinning it out.

00:01:47.863 --> 00:01:49.049
We're doing leaf pulling,

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.876
get more exposure where we have

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:53.445
the right balance of
leaf to vine essentially.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:55.390
Leaf to vine to grape so that,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.223
like I said,

00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:58.511
the nutrients go here
as opposed to up here.

00:01:58.511 --> 00:01:59.594
- Some of these look awful ripe.

00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:01.221
How can you tell when they are ripe?

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.215
- Well, you can get a
refractometer, that's one way.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:04.720
You can do it by taste.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.132
These are handy little units

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:08.662
that we all walk around
with 'em in our back pocket.

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:10.829
You just take some grapes,

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.505
squeeze out some fruit,

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:16.578
and this is not a-

00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:18.328
it's a random sample.

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:26.604
And these are around

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:27.437
15, 15 3.

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:31.758
These will be picked probably
when they're around 25 Brix.

00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:32.591
- They've got a ways to go.

00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:33.424
- They've got a ways to go.

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:34.257
- That's the measure of the sugar?

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:35.965
- That's the measure of
the sugar, the Brix level.

00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:37.667
- How this refracts the
sunlight coming through.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:38.500
- Exactly.

00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:41.298
People use these for-

00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:42.540
diabetics use them for whatever,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.387
checking their sugar solutions.

00:02:45.387 --> 00:02:46.551
It's something that we use.

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:47.948
If not, if you don't have one of these,

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:49.836
then you're gonna start going by taste,

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.669
- Yeah, a lot of people

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.502
don't have that.
- and by feel.

00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:53.710
Are these expensive?

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.965
- $75 on up, depending on
which model you wanna get.

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:58.843
You can pay frightening amounts for them.

00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:00.614
- But if you don't have it
then you can just taste it?

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:01.545
- You can taste it.

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:03.085
Right now these are very high acid,

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:04.414
there's very little sugar.

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:06.688
Another way is- let me
get this out of the way-

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:07.605
is to check

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:09.621
the color of the seed

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:11.658
'cause right now, they're quite green.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.066
Once the seeds are getting riper

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.437
they're gonna get brown.

00:03:14.437 --> 00:03:16.634
As they brown, they'll get
green towards the tips,

00:03:16.634 --> 00:03:18.407
and after that they'll
be brown all the way.

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:19.240
So one of the ways,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.024
if you don't have the technology with you,

00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:23.025
is just to check the grapes daily

00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:24.317
and start looking for that.

00:03:24.317 --> 00:03:25.150
Like I said,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.235
we're weeks away at this point

00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:27.685
so they're very very green.

00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:28.518
- Now as you chew that,

00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:32.097
is it gonna be just kinda
gummy in your mouth?

00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:32.930
- Well,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:33.763
it's chewy.

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:34.596
Gummy is a good word.

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:35.429
It's chewy.

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:37.144
As the grape ripens,

00:03:37.144 --> 00:03:38.814
those seeds will become like grape nuts,

00:03:38.814 --> 00:03:40.299
and I don't know if that's
where they got the name,

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.146
but they literally, that's
what they will be like.

00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:43.461
They'll just crunch up

00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:44.632
and break up

00:03:44.632 --> 00:03:47.466
and you won't get that bitterness

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:48.882
that I'm getting right now.

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:50.727
- I see something else a
lot of you don't realize.

00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:52.617
The grapes are all right here where

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:54.840
the vines have come from last year's bud.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.232
They're not up throughout
the vines, are they?

00:03:56.232 --> 00:03:57.548
- No.

00:03:57.548 --> 00:03:59.749
You set 'em that way so
that they get good exposure,

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:00.938
they're easier to pick,

00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:02.394
and that way you have your canopy above

00:04:02.394 --> 00:04:04.817
'cause it's performing the photosynthesis

00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:06.515
that's allowing the grapes to grow.

00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:07.381
- [Curtis] So they need some leaves

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:09.177
to feed the sugar into the grape,

00:04:09.177 --> 00:04:10.953
but you don't need the
vines to be too long.

00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:12.004
- [John] Exactly.

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:13.354
Too much vigor means all the nutrients

00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:14.672
are going the wrong direction.

00:04:14.672 --> 00:04:15.593
- And if it's humid it also

00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:17.025
then blocks airflow and you get diseases.

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:17.858
- Exactly.

00:04:19.262 --> 00:04:21.527
You do some leaf pulling,

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:23.893
you make it where the
bunches are more visible,

00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:25.651
you don't need too many around there.

00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:26.784
As you do leaf pulling,

00:04:26.784 --> 00:04:28.499
you're reducing the potassium,

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.482
you're reducing the malic acid,

00:04:31.482 --> 00:04:33.756
you're allowing the grapes to breathe.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:35.289
There's less likely, like you said,

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.729
if it's too moist like that,

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.209
you're not worried about powdery mildew,

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:39.466
things of that nature.

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.324
- And you really have to know
how to do it for your area

00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:43.215
because in some places,
where you've got humidity,

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:44.115
you wanna open it up.

00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:45.675
And others, where you've
got a lot of sunlight,

00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:46.824
you want little bit more shade.

00:04:46.824 --> 00:04:47.657
- Exactly.

00:04:47.657 --> 00:04:48.490
You need more shade.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.289
But still, that old adage, less is more,

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.031
still comes down, same thing.

00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:53.724
You don't want too many leaves.

00:04:53.724 --> 00:04:55.666
They say anywhere from 10 to 20 leaves

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.625
per cane per bunch is
just about what you need.

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:00.543
But again, every vineyard is different,

00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:02.221
and you have to treat it as such.

00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:03.598
- John, that's a lot of good information.

00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:04.611
It'll help people get started.

00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:05.601
They can still get more information

00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:06.747
from their extension agent.

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:07.580
- Without a doubt.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.413
- Thank you.

00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:10.424
- Oh, you're most welcome.
