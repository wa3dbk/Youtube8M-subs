00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.020
Don't let the pink hair fool you.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.320
Jill's one tough customer.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.500
She's got thick skin.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.670
Both because she's driving a tank,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.450
and because...as soon as she arrived, she
was already overlooked.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.370
We were living in a Nintendo DS world in 2006.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.370
That

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.690
meant Jill and her fantastic little platformer...were
living in the shadows.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.330
Plural because...two screens.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.680
Fantastic because...Drill Dozer is one of
the best Nintendo games most people have never

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:03.360
heard of.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.990
So just like Kirby's Adventure and Super Mario
RPG and Majora's Mask...this was a very late

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.260
release in its platform's

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.260
lifespan.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.220
But there's a huge difference between those
games and this game.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.080
Those games featured video game royalty.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.830
This one had a little girl with a tank.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.190
I mean...introducing a new character on a
fading platform?

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.190
That's definitely

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.190
good for the platform.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.070
Probably not as good for the character.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.430
Poor Jill ended up with a great game...but
not a great series.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.430
She became an assist trophy, instead of a
new

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.430
challenger.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.230
That's the only thing about Drill Dozer that
sucks.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:45.340
So if you don't know Jill...let me introduce
you.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.340
Guys, Jill.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.340
Jill, guys.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.170
Guys, Jill's kind of a badass.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.170
She's the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.110
leader of these thieves known as the Red Dozers,
and the dozers are fond of drilling.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.030
Through dirt, walls, windows,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.130
boxes, security doors, whatever.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.730
So when this rival group steals a diamond
from the dozers, Jill decides to steal from

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.730
them.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.780
How's she gonna do it?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.739
Like I said, the dozers like to drill.

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.400
Drill Dozer is the rarest kind of video game,
a game that actually has an idea.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.390
Not only that, it actually has ideas

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.030
for ways to implement that idea.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.561
And it never runs out of them.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.269
This is a platformer designed entirely around
the

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.709
concept of drilling.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.740
You drill to attack, you drill to break through
walls...but it's more than that.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.740
You drill to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.480
hitch rides, on platforms.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.049
You drill to solve puzzles.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.340
You can drill to fly across rooms.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.840
With every level, the game gets more and more
creative about the mechanic, embracing it

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.379
on a level that very few games

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.030
ever have the confidence to do.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.340
And you know, it's even clever about the controls.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.450
You can drill simply by pushing the shoulder
buttons...but each one

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.379
drills in a different direction.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.459
So for example, drilling with the right button
may tighten a screw, while the left

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.969
button would loosen it.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.639
That alone is used for countless puzzles,
but there's more to it.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.920
You can actually shift gears

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.159
while drilling, which increases your power.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.590
And man, it feels good to do it.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.359
You actually have to re-press the shoulder
button at just the right moment, like you're

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.810
really shifting gears.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.810
It just

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.200
feels so rightâ€”it's a brilliant match of
control and concept.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.420
Of course, the best game mechanics in the
world don't mean a thing unless you have level

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.659
design to back it up.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.659
And

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.029
Drill Dozer holds it own there, too.

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.519
The levels are always fun to play through,
but they're also really good at

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.519
foreshadowing.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.810
So you might see a wall you can't drill through
or a gate you can't open.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.439
At least, not yet.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.439
Actually,

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.700
Jill's backtracking kinda reminds you of another
Nintendo heroine.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.120
And it works really well within the context
of...you know, drilling stuff.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.810
You always feel like there's a secret to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.230
find, if you could just find the right part,
or drill the right place.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.779
Now, this drill can get a little dull from
time to time.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.799
I mean, the drawback of a design this focused
on a single

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.919
gameplay element...is that it's focused on
a single gameplay element.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.120
So things can get a bit repetitive.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120
And although

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.830
Drill Dozer looks good, the music's another
story.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.570
It's not terrible, it's just...kind of forgettable.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.050
That sticks out, given how brilliant the rest
of the game is.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.910
I'll be the first to tell you, though...those
issues aren't really a big deal.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.620
In fact, the game...kind of drills

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.620
through them.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.650
It's a shame this thing didn't reach more
people, but...hey, like I said.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.860
Jill can handle it.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.860
She's

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.860
always had a thick skin.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.560
And although
some don't know it...she also has one GBA's

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.560
very best games.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.570
Give her a chance, and she'll drill her way
right into your heart.
