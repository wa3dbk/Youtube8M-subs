00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:23.553
I am doing more tests with the Open Broadcaster Software

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:44.622
I picked up Sleeping Dogs again for the test because I love this game. 
 This is the last statue from the game and not the Zodiac Tournament

00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:53.908
I was not paying attention to what I needed 
 to do in this part of the game

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.734
OK! Now I know what I need to do

00:00:56.142 --> 00:01:08.142
I am doing a live local recording test with Open Broadcaster 
 to see how it can replace FRAPS, Xsplit and DXTory

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:19.583
For the moment it runs ok and I like it. I have to do 
 a lot more test in order to get a tutorial series going.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:31.099
As a bonus, I decided to get the chroma effect working on 
 the OBS while doing the test and it looks very good.

00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:39.974
These settigns are the same that Xsplit gives me some problems with choppy playback

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:44.160
Still not sure about that thou

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:47.890
OBS is running excellent to be a free software

00:01:58.137 --> 00:02:28.140
Once again please let me know your opinions about the video quality. I am 
 using DXtory with OBS in order to avoid capturing the entire desktop.

00:02:25.953 --> 00:02:32.950
And that's it for now. Rate this video thumbs up if
