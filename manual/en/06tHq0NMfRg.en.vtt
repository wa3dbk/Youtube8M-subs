00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.160
Commander's position.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.970
To his direct front he has a vane which will
allow him to generally guide the gunner onto

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.090
the target.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.430
To his left he's got a spotlight, and of course,
he's got his own 360 degree rotating cupola

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.950
which can be locked into a number of different
positions, and it actually rotates quite easily.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.120
Now, if he is forced to come into the turret,
the first thing to note is that it is incredibly

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.120
confined here.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.270
As I'm sitting here, my knees are overhanging
the front edge of the gunner's seat.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.030
Now, granted, I'm a little bit taller than
the average tanker of the era, but it still

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.989
gives you an idea as to how confined it is
in here for the two crewmen.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.030
Controls for the commander himself are actually
pretty limited.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.851
Other than being able to rotate his cupola
around a little bit, he's got a light, he

00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:19.600
has his intercom set for the Number 19 wireless
set which is located on the turret rear, and,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.430
most importantly, this container here contains
drinking water, down to a little tap that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.350
you can turn on and off and dispense the water
for you.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.810
A feature you don't find on many tanks these
days.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.530
Forward of the commander you'll find the gunner.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.640
It's definitely a tight fit, and it was a
little bit tighter until about three seconds

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.560
ago, I just figured out how to raise and lower
the gunner's seat.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.500
Turns out he's got a little pedal by his left
foot and the whole thing is hydraulic.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.480
Why we can't have that in today's tanks, I
don't know.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.939
Anyway, located to his right is his pride
and joy: Ordnance, Quick-Firing, 77mm.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.930
Now, a little background on the gun.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.049
It's commonly referred to as a cut-down 17-pounder
and this isn't really the whole story.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.080
You start off by taking the breech mechanism
which was pretty much created for the job,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.560
the cartridge case which came from the 20cwt
(twenty-hundredweight) anti-aircraft gun,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.730
the projectile came from the 17-pounder, and
also so did the barrel, which is cut down

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.730
a little bit.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.329
It was really a purpose-designed gun specifically
for vehicles which had a smaller turret ring

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.210
and just couldn't take the 17-pounder.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.500
Another advantage to it, it was a little bit
more accurate, especially when shooting the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.459
APDS rounds, also know as SVDS: Super Velocity
Discarding Sabot.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.989
It could also fire APCBC or High Explosive
rounds.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.860
The speed of the turret rotation is determined
as much by the engine power, how many revs

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.209
it's pulling, as much as it is how far you
are traversing your handle.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.130
To the right of that is located the elevation
handwheel, one turn of the wheel will elevate

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.090
or depress the gun one degree, the full range
of motion being sixteen degrees.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.120
He does have a manual traverse to his left
as well: Push in to release the brake and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.880
engage the gear, and simply crank left or
right.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.019
Further down, you're going to have a three-position
selector for the trigger.

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:29.420
The trigger itself is a foot pedal, and the
three positions are coaxial, main gun, or

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.660
safe.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.780
The loader is located on the right hand side
of the turret, surrounded cozily by the tools

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.960
of his trade.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.980
I'm currently sitting on a liftable pedestal
which can be used either as a seat if the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.760
vehicle is moving or as a foot pedestal if
the loader wants to stand outside of his hatch.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.430
To his direct front he's going to have his
coaxial Besa 7.92mm machinegun, the ammunition

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.609
would hang in belts off to the right, he has
a periscope to the front.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:04.549
To the rear of the turret he going to have
three two-round bins, each of which will hold

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.950
two 77mm rounds.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.930
Directly under the gun in here there is going
to be nine additional rounds, and under the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.400
platform under his feet he's going to find
another nineteen rounds.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.970
If that's not enough, forward of the turret,
and you have to rotate the turret to actually

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.990
access them, between the driver and the machinegunner
you're going to find another twenty-one rounds

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.449
of ammunition.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.949
The loader has one additional duty, he commands
the smoke bomb thrower.

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:44.900
Now, what this is, as I move around to the
right, here, is basically a very large pistol

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.759
. Smoothbore, launches smoke cartridges, fired
through the roof, and unfortunately I have

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.800
to dismantle it to get it into the port.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.610
Spare ammunition is found on the right hand
side, here.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.819
It is aimed by the gunner, because, of course,
it is a fixed traverse, and the gunner will

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.240
traverse to the left or to the right, but
the loader himself is the person who will

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.539
actually pull the trigger launch smoke bombs,
and that way you have a smokescreen if you

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:19.180
find you have to egress or otherwise stop
people from shooting at you.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.050
Loading the gun, from the loader's perspective,
is a little bit... awkward, I think is probably

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.259
the easiest way of putting it.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.750
My mobility is limited by the fact that the
ammunition bins, which at least are somewhat

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.469
armoured, stop me from moving my legs around.

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:40.740
So you'd lift up the round, comes all the
way up, you then have to turn it around, find

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.960
a way of placing it into the breech, of course
this tray is in the way, push it forward,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.650
it is a vertically sliding breech, stand well
clear, flip the loader's safety switch which

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.469
has been removed from this vehicle.

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:01.669
Hold on, round will fire, take another round
out, do it again, close the bin, go on to

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.759
the next round.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:09.610
Obviously during lulls in the fighting you
want to take advantage of the time to reload

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.270
these ready racks, ideally from under the
floor plate or the driver's compartment, but

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.810
if necessary from under the gun itself, because
there are the only rounds, the only four to

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.169
six rounds, that he can really access quickly,
especially if the hatch is down and he cannot

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.100
stand up.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.659
While we're in the loader's position, as the
gun is facing forward, down the right rear

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.419
of the turret, that's where the batteries
are located.

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.749
The primary radio is located on the rear of
the turret, this one's a Number 19.

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:44.080
As you can see, it is a former one that had
been sent to the Soviet Union for lend-lease.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.560
Ordinarily, only the commander could transmit
on the radio, but the entire crew was equipped

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.610
with a two-way intercom system.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.050
Now, Comet may have been a great tank, but
it still only had a very limited service life

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.050
with the British Army.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.360
The reason for that was that Centurion was
close on its heels and that was an absolutely

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.910
fantastic tank in every respect, almost.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.020
So, with that tank available, there was no
need to keep Comet.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.050
That said, you could still find Comet in use
with friendly foreign nations such as Ireland

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.610
for many years after that.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.570
The story of Centurion, however, we'll come
back to another day.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.450
So that brings us to a close of our tour of
Comet, I hope you found it informative, and

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.539
we'll see you on the next one.
