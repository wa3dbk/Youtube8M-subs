00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:28.816
(Jon)
Alright Jory, we're on the log flume! 

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:31.695
We're on the log flume... it has no logs, 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.525
Its actually a circular disc. Its a stump, its a stump flume.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:44.257
Now, legend has it, all the logs they ship down river, there was all of these stumps left over,

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:46.467
They were all like, "What do we do with all of these stumps?"

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.832
(Jon)
Let's make a ride out of it at Six Flags, New England!

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.567
(Jon)
Alright, we're on the log flume here at Six Flags New England.

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:55.240
(Jory)
Wait, does your bar go around? Oh, no.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.000
(Jon)
Oh no! These bars do nothing!

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:00.325
(Jory)
Aw, Jeez.

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:01.951
(Jon)
Please remain seated.

00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:03.530
Its the stump bump, is what it is.

00:01:06.943 --> 00:01:12.655
Alright, Jory! Whoa! I'm not doing that on purpose!

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:18.460
(Jory)
You feelin' it? You feelin' it?

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.853
(Jon)
I'm feelin' it brother!

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:21.867
(Jory)
Are you ready?

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:23.500
Whoa!

00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:33.600
I'm going to try to video this entire ride! This camera may or may not get wet, we'll find out!

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:35.924
Whoo!

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:41.729
That was you!

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.611
(Jon)
That was all me!

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.391
Oh, you're going for the waterfall - pass it over here. God damn It!

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:53.478
[Beep]!

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:04.299
So we uh, just got told by the log flume people to turn my camera off.

00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:10.754
And then the security came and verbal warning. A strict and strong verbal warning!

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.517
That is against park policy to film on any of the rides.

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.721
Which is really too bad, because were having a lot of fun.

00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:21.365
So unfortunately, this is I think the last Roller Coaster Commotion episode of all time.

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:25.220
And it was a log flume. Not a coaster.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.108
New England's so much more strict than California.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.066
[Beep]ing yuppies.

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:39.999
(Jory)
[Beep]ing yankees!

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.899
Yankee assholes!
