00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.640
Well, we've got two crazy dogs, Harley and
Petunia. They both love to explore, love

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.609
to get out and around. It's been our
first time traveling as a whole family

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.730
with the dogs and that's really a
special experience too because they've

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.030
really enjoyed themselves and we don't
have to worry about somebody taking care

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.260
of them or putting them in a kennel and
I think that they've really gotten the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.989
exercise and the enjoyment that they
deserve.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.230
Harley was in the water immediately
chasing sticks, chasing fish, chasing

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.210
leaves, floating down the river. He loves
the water and it was an awesome, awesome

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.040
chance for him to just swim.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.280
The dogs had a chance to run around and
explore as much as they wanted to without

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.990
really getting into any kind of trouble.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.710
Petunia's favorite time was probably the
opportunity for her to run around in

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:40.130
Lone Pine. When we are around the rocks
Harley, he had a lot of stuff to sniff. The

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.300
dogs had a great time running around
wherever they wanted to. I think the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.910
dogs came home over more exhausted than
we were. They slept for a week.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.960
It was pretty funny because Harley he was like, "Ruff ruff ruff." He
hasn't howled in such a long time so he

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.670
can't really do it. Harley would love it
if it got to howl all the time and bark.
