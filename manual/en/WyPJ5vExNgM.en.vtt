00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.570
Beauty Express:
1.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.500
Make Your Own Tinted Moisturizer
Make your own tinted moisturizer by mixing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.070
a little foundation with a bit of moisturizer.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.390
I usually go with a 50-50 ratio but you can
use more or less of either depending on how

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.390
much coverage you want.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.390
2.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.340
Use Your Wrist to Match Your Foundation Color
If you're not sure what your foundation color

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.890
is, put some foundation on the inner side
of your wrist to see if it blends with your

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.890
skin tone.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.890
3.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.480
Increase Your Concealer Coverage
So if you want to get a bit more coverage

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.210
out of your concealer, just let it sit for
a few seconds before blending it in.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.640
I usually fill my eyebrows in before coming
back to blend it out.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640
4.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.111
Use Sticky Tape for Winged Eyeliner (Express)
If you really struggle with getting a winged

00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.880
eyeliner super straight just get some sticky
tape and stick it at the back of your hand

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.680
to get rid of some of the glue.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.280
Then line it up with the outer corner of your
eye and in the end of your eyebrow.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.330
Draw your line and once you pull the tape
off, just join the lines and fill them in

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.320
for the perfect winged eyeliner.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.360
5.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.909
Long Lasting Lashes
To make your lashes last longer, warm up your

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.520
eyelash curler using a blow dryer for a few
seconds.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.520
6.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.329
Avoud Mascara Smudges with a Spoon
Now if you always get mascara smudge marks

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.700
just place a spoon over your eyes when applying
mascara for smudge free lids.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.310
7.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.220
Tight Line Your Beauty Eyes
Line under your upper lid to help define your

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.070
eyes and make your lashes look fuller.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:56.630
