00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Who would have thought that NASA's 1960s technology
would still be saving hundreds of lives all these
years later?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here are the facts about this amazing technology.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What would happen when this type of Apollo capsule would
be hurtling towards Earth?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It would actually be, when it crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean with all the parachutes, when the parachutes fly off,
they need another thing to hold them up.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So the capsule had a life raft on the bottom, and that's
what they were worried about the high winds of the helicopters.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And there also was divers waiting by the capsule so they
would be able to get the astronauts out.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And they had the ballast system, on the bottom, and it
would fill up with water so it would only tilt and not flip over.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
They were attaching the raft to the bottom of the capsule,
which is right here, and they would attach it to it so

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the raft wouldn't flip over, like I was talking earlier about,
they had the bottom of the raft covered up in a thick layer of plastic

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and had it go deeper underwater, and they had holes in it to
fill water up in it so it wouldn't flip over.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Jim Givens had an idea of using the Apollo life rafts that
NASA had the idea of and making an actual life raft with them.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
They used them to save hundreds of lives.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It is called the hydrodynamic stabilization ballast system.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It was used so the raft wouldn't collapse and flip over and fill
up with water and have the people inside of it drown.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It's used by the Navy and the Coast Guards. They use them when
they have hurricanes and peoples' boats are being sunk.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
When their boats are being sunk, they know that there's a warning
somewhere, so they grab some life rafts

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But they don't inflate them yet, and when they get out to the
area where the boat sunk and the people are,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:55.000
they'd press a button and the life rafts would turn to their regular size.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And they would be better so they would be able to save lives.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
People's life rafts were tipping over because the ballast system on
the bottom of it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It would fill up with all the water, the 2,000 pounds, and it wouldn't
flip over. It would only start tilting a little bit

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with the high winds of the hurricane.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And the way it works is the bottom of it, of the life rafts

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:39.000
since they're filled up with water, they really will only be
tipping over, and if they come to the side they'll come back up,
like those punching bags that have water on the bottom of them.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
This actually is a picture of the Givens life raft, and you
can see the ballast system on the bottom

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and the holes right there where the water would fill up in it.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And this is the main part of it, where the astronauts, where the people
inside of the life rafts would stay and survive.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It wouldn't tip over at all because of its ballast system.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It only takes 30 seconds for it to fill up--30 seconds or less
to fill up the ballast system with water,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and it fills up in 30 seconds or less it fills up 2,000 pounds
of water.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So it won't start tilting over and over. And flip.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It only takes a

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
There are over 450 people alive today because of this NASA technology
and Jim Givens.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Their lives are my proof that this is the best NASA technology
being used today.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And many more lives will be saved in the future because of this technology.
