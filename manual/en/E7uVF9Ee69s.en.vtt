 Hi, I'm Mauro Uliassi. I'm here in the restaurant That I own with my sister Katia in Senigallia, 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.160
 to a classic, super-classic Italian recipe pasta Carbonara. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 A very tasty recipe, easy to follow. 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.320
 The ingredients are: sheep's milk pecorino cheese, Parmesan, best-quality bacon / pork cheek, 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.440
 some more bacon / pork cheek, later I'll tell you why, garlic, an egg, egg yolks, some salt, pasta, oil and pepper. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.460
 Cook the pasta in lots of water. For this recipe the pasta is fully cooked in the water Because later 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.740
 on it's mixed with the sauce off the heat. Unlike other pasta dishes Which finish 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.940
 cooking in the hot saucepan, this one must be properly al dente at the start. 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:18.640
 Let's brown the bacon / pork cheek while the pasta cooks. When the bacon / pork cheek is browned, drain to remove any excess fat. 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.840
 In the past, this fat was used as part of the sauce, but since the fat 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.140
 Exceeds the idea smoke point it can make the dish too heavy and less flavorful. 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.620
 Let the pork cheek oil drain well and here we have browned the pork cheek. 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.020
 To make up for removing the fat, let's put some oil into the pot, then add whole garlic 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:53.060
 and heat it, to flavor the oil with garlic, then Add more bacon / pork cheeks, in this way. 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.100
 These ingredients are used just as flavoring elements. Here we have garlic and bacon / pork cheek-flavored oil. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.020
 Once the oil is flavored with bacon / pork cheek and garlic, let's strain it in a bowl, this way. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.700
 To this we add the egg, cheese, and a bit of pepper. 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.799
 Let's whisk all the ingredients and here we have the typical mixture Carbonara. 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.019
 I strain the spaghetti. 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.800
 At this point, let's add our noodles to the bowl with the seasonings. 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.460
 Stir 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:54.780
 add a little of the cooking water to meld the mixture a bit. 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.739
 Then stir it into another pan to make thickening easier. Thicken it well. 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:22.700
 Add the bacon / pork cheek, pepper, some more Parmesan or pecorino cheese. 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.720
 Our classic spaghetti carbonara are ready! 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.660
 This dish is extremely tasty, appealing to everyone.
