00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.240
- [Simon] Despite the trend in recent
years of people spending loads of money

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.040
getting a bike fit, if all you want to do
is get your saddle in the right place,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.310
that's not actually necessary. Here are a
few simple steps that will mean that you

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.030
can get your saddle position
in the right place.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.251
Now, at the end of the video, I'll also
compare it to my current saddle height

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.690
and position, and then we'll see whether
or not these methods have actually got me

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.740
close to where I need to be.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.370
We start by adjusting the saddle height.
Now, a great way of doing this is to put

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.199
your bike on an indoor trainer, but you
can actually do it out on the road

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.930
as well. Just be careful. So jump on your
bike. You want to put the heel of your

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.860
foot on the pedal, and at this point your
leg should be locked out.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.200
But we're also now going to actually try
and pedal to make sure that your pelvis

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.290
isn't rocking from side to side.
It's remarkably difficult.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.120
So you can see that my leg isn't quite
locked out at the bottom of the stroke,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.210
so I perhaps need to put my seat
up a little bit.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.060
I think that's ballpark.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.710
Right, with the saddle height roughly
ballpark, we're now going to look at how

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.600
fore or aft your seat is. Now, to do that,
the adjustment is normally made by just

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.160
loosening one or two bolts on the seat
post here, depending on the design of it.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.427
And before we actually start, I've got
to stress that the bike must

00:01:12.427 --> 00:01:16.170
be completely level, so we've already
been at it with a spirit level to make

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.831
sure that this is going to work.
Then it's a case of using a

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:25.620
plumb line. Hmm. With your feet
in normal riding position now,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.425
you want to have your
cranks horizontal, and then you need

00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:36.480
to drop your plumb line from the bony
bit at the back of your kneecap.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.430
That should bisect your pedal axle.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.820
So this is called the Kops method,
and it does have its critics.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.736
We'd be the first to admit, in fact, that
it's got its limitations, so you will need

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:52.300
to fine-tune, kind of depending on what
sort of rider you are.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.038
If you ride in quite a
stretched-out position, then you'll

00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:57.147
probably find you need to move the
saddle forward slightly.

00:01:57.147 --> 00:02:00.560
Whereas, if you ride in a very relaxed
position with upright handlebars

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.170
and a shorter stem, then you may need
to go backwards.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.100
Next, it's really important to make sure
your saddle is level.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.790
If it's tilted up slightly, it can put a
little bit too much pressure on some

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.980
rather sensitive areas. And if it's
pointed too far down, then it puts a lot

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.660
more weight through your hands, and you'll
find yourself constantly sliding forward

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.170
on the saddle. So we think that horizontal
is best. If you're racing,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.800
the UCI tell you you have to have it
horizontally anyway, and to check,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.070
all it is is a case of getting your trusty
spirit level out again,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.980
making sure your bike is on level ground,
and then adjusting it accordingly.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.370
So we need to pull that slightly
nose-down.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.130
Once you've performed those three
measurements, you then need to jump back

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.360
on your bike and go through it all again,
because obviously, if you've adjusted your

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.650
saddle height after you've done the
forward and backward, then that will have

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.180
a bearing on where the seat is placed. If
you can, get someone to film you whilst

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.925
you're riding on the turbo trainer,
and then you can get a real idea of how

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.982
you look when you ride. You particularly
want to pay close attention

00:02:57.982 --> 00:03:01.201
to your pelvis. You don't want that
rocking at all, because that can

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:03.060
get really quite uncomfortable.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.890
Now, we do also have to say that to get
your really personal bike fit,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.520
then you do have to take into account a
number of other different factors,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.920
like your flexibility, for example,
or, perhaps more importantly,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.780
whether you pedal with your toe
down or your heel down. That has quite a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.130
significant bearing on your saddle height,
for example.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.468
So, once you've got it ballpark, then you
can fine-tune it to make sure that you

00:03:24.468 --> 00:03:28.920
are comfortable and powerful. Powerful!

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.900
As we said at the very beginning, there is
some debate as to how you find the exact

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.630
saddle height for you. But here are a
couple of other methods that you might

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.920
want to try to see whether you can get it
a bit more fine-tuned.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.400
Now, first of all, do you have a
goniometer? No, no, I didn't think so.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.740
Neither do we, in fact. But you can pick
them up for not too much money.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.900
And if you get one, then what it does
is it allows you to do the Holmes method.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.205
Now, essentially, it allows you to measure
the angle of your shin bone in relation

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:02.430
to your thigh bone. Holmes worked out,
through quite a lot of research,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.140
that the optimum angle for this bit here
was 25 to 30 degrees when you're at the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.080
bottom of your pedal stroke.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.622
Another method is to measure your
inside leg. And I'm going to apologize

00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:16.599
at this point. We've tried to think
of a way of doing this without it

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.471
looking so weird, but we can't. So the
best way is get a long spirit level,

00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:27.990
to put it between your legs, nestle it
snugly to mimic the sensation of a

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.270
saddle, and then measure the distance
from the end of your spirit level...

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.232
I'm not joking...to the floor.
Now, I will take my shoes off first,

00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:38.791
because I don't want them to alter
the value of my inseam,

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:42.719
but I'll need to find a willing
accomplice to measure this.

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.855
Anyone? Anyone want
to measure it?

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:45.720
- [Man] No.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.370
- I'm going to have to find a wall
or something?

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.287
Take a note of that. Right. According
to this, my inseam is...

00:04:57.425 --> 00:05:06.721
well, 875 millimeters. Then, the
next thing you do is you take away 10

00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.601
centimeters from that, and that gives you
your saddle height value when measured

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.505
from the center of the bottom bracket
axle to the top of the saddle,

00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:18.710
inline with your seat post.
Complicated.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.110
So there we have three methods
for calculating your saddle height,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.840
and one of calculating how forward
or backward it needs to be.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.252
But we said at the beginning of the video
that I'd test it to see how it relates

00:05:29.252 --> 00:05:32.404
to my own personal position that I've
honed over the years.

00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:35.581
So first things first. This is currently
set up for the heel method,

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:38.824
and I'll measure from the center
of the bottom bracket

00:05:38.824 --> 00:05:44.418
up to the top of the saddle,
and it comes out at 760 millimeters.

00:05:44.418 --> 00:05:49.560
Now that is a quite significant 15
millimeters below where I think

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.060
I should be, which is 775
millimeters. But interestingly,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.595
the final method of measuring my
inseam actually gave me exactly

00:05:56.595 --> 00:06:00.973
that figure, 775 millimeters. Now, that
doesn't really mean anything

00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:04.601
for the general population, but perhaps,
in this instance for me,

00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:08.857
the inseam method was better.
However, I do have to say,

00:06:08.857 --> 00:06:11.963
neither of them take into account the
length of my cranks.

00:06:11.963 --> 00:06:17.229
So in this instance I'm riding 172.5s,
but I normally ride 175s.

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.850
But then what happens if I was on 167.5s?
It's a fairly big variation there.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.135
And also, it doesn't take into account
the stack height, both of my shoe

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:29.240
and of the pedal, which can be a quite
significant value there.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.030
So the lesson from all of this is that all
these methods will get you ballpark,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.395
but you have to fine-tune it for yourself
to find which is most comfortable

00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:39.950
and most powerful.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.407
Make any adjustments to your position,
then do so gradually, because actually,

00:06:44.407 --> 00:06:48.373
you can end up injuring yourself more
by changing to the correct position

00:06:48.373 --> 00:06:52.043
than you would do if you kept with your
old position. And it's always a good idea

00:06:52.043 --> 00:06:56.211
to make a note of where you started
so that you can always go back to the

00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:59.215
original position. So take a measurement
from the center of the bottom bracket

00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:02.743
to the top of the saddle, and from the
nose of the saddle to the handlebars.

00:07:02.743 --> 00:07:06.337
And that pretty much tells you your rough
parameters.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.770
To look at another aspect of your bike
fit, which is how high and how far away

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.830
your handlebars need to be, why not click
up there and watch a video specifically

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.039
about that? Then, to adjust your cleats
on your shoes, we've got a video

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.945
about that. Just click down there,
and you can go straight

00:07:21.945 --> 00:07:26.098
through and watch it.  Finally, to never
miss another GCN video, which I'm sure

00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:30.000
you don't want to do, why don't you
