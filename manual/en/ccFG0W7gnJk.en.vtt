Your wedding reception is probably one of
the biggest expenses and the most stressful

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.980
things you'll go through. This is Kathie Millen
and Vivian Miller with Austin Wedding Planners

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.160
and Elate Events and we're going to talk to
you about your wedding reception. Your wedding

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.950
reception is details, details, details. This
is where you and your style and your budget

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.090
and everything all comes together and creates
your reception. Your guest are going to walk

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.660
in and they should be able to say, "Oh, this
is Tom and Kathy or, you know, it's really

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.730
going to fit you two. It's all; it's about
you that day. So, you need to really work

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.170
and look at what; what you want that day to
look like and how you want that event to look,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.490
and it should be about you. If you like candles,
do all candles. Don't worry about flowers.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.510
If you want to do all flowers and no candles
or you can do both. You know that's something

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.110
that a lot of people like to intertwine is
the flowers and the candles; mixed with the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.770
colors of the fabrics and the linens and draping;
draping, the lighting, food. It is lots of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.670
details, favors, but do it in a process and
don't feel overwhelmed with everything at

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.740
once, because you even have dish ware, glassware,
flatware. Don't let it overwhelm you. Look

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.390
at everything and know that it's a process
to plan that reception. And if you are a very

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.680
organized person, then this might be something
that's not intimidating to you, but if not,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.720
this is where I definitely encourage that
your wedding planner would come in handy and

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.890
worth every dime that you pay her. She's there
to orchestrate all your vendors; make sure

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.400
they show up on time; if they brought the
products that they; they promised in their

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.540
contracts; that they're doing exactly what
you've paid for; to be your eyes and ears,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.941
that day. They are going to make sure that
it all comes together, and it comes together

00:01:54.941 --> 00:02:01.570
seamlessly and stressful. Usually, what happens
is the wedding coordinators are the ones that;

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.140
that decorate during the day. If you decide
to do this, on your own, keep in mind that

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.840
part of your wedding day, instead of getting
your massage and your pedicure and getting

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.989
your hair done; majority of your day is going
to be decorating, and if it's not you, it's

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.730
going to be your family members and I see
it that time and time again that the people

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.249
that don't have a coordinator, come about
9:00 o'clock at night, most of their guest

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:30.650
are watching the clock because for the simple
fact is, they know that within an hour or

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.159
so, they're going to have to clean up the
mess. So, I encourage everybody to get a wedding

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:42.319
coordinator. Help with those details. They're
definitely worth every penny. So, this is

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.079
Kathy Millen and Vivian Miller with Austin
Wedding Planners and Elate Events. Thanks

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:47.199
a lot.
