Hi everybody, and welcome to this tutorial of 
 how to do a simple scene makeup.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:26.353
Oh my God! did you just say scene?!

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:33.108
Yes, I did say scene.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:39.543
Oh my God, that is so 2008 God!

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.867
(heavy sigh)

00:00:43.873 --> 00:00:50.987
Ok, first of all I got no idea about what 
 you are trying to do but yeah HELL YEAH!

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:56.986
So I have to tell you  that this tutorial was requested

00:00:56.986 --> 00:01:04.435
And second, please s%&amp;amp;ghb&amp;amp;%$ and let me start.

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:07.393
Sorry about that. Let's get started.

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:15.086
Oh my GOd hi again, well this is me and I 
 am makeup less as you can pretty much see

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:19.743
And yeah I look so freaking beautiful!!!

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:24.890
Ok not reall I am just kidding, well let's get started with this.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:30.662
Well first of all if you got bangs pleae make 
 sure that they are not over your face.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.033
By the way I don't use concealer or anything like that beacause 
 I don't like to have much stuff on my face.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.340
And yeah, mainly I am so cool like that!! YAY for me

00:01:44.332 --> 00:01:46.890
Ok then we are going to take a liquid eyeliner.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:52.020
The tip of this eyeliner is sort of 
 thick, but I like it very much.

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:58.100
And then just put the eyeliner over your eyelid just like I am doing.

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:08.350

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:15.270
After doing this you just have to do a 
 thin line over here, just like I do.

00:02:15.274 --> 00:02:20.060
Then you just have to connect it. I do it 
 pretty thick and then I just fill it in.

00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:21.710
It's pretty easy.

00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:27.660
Don't be afraid to mess up, it's pretty easy to mess.

00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:29.600
Then we do the same with the other eye.

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:49.780
Oh my GOd. I hink that I've just messed up very badly.

00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:52.030
I did one eye thicker than the other one.

00:02:52.842 --> 00:02:54.890
I am just going to take it off and start again.

00:02:55.771 --> 00:03:01.640
Ok hi I am back. I'm just going to do the 
 same thing I did before on my other eye.

00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:03.710
I hope this time it works.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:29.380

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.380
Oh ya, that looks pretty much better.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.940
If you do one eye thicker than the other one, just don't really worry.

00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:43.980
You can always have more eyeliner if you want to, to 
 make the other eye as thicker as the other one.

00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:52.290
Make sure that you have to make it look thicker 
 because if you have to make it look thinner

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:54.810
you are just going to have to remove it.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.710
After that, we are just going to take a black eyeliner

00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:03.300
and then we are going to line the inner corners and our waterline.

00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:21.960

00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:25.440
And then just to finish we are just going to apply some mascara.

00:04:26.822 --> 00:04:32.650
YAY, I am not going to put on too much but 
 you can put as much mascara as you want to.

00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:44.150

00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:47.240
And after this we are clearly done.

00:04:51.817 --> 00:04:54.500
WEll, so this was pretty much it.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.180
