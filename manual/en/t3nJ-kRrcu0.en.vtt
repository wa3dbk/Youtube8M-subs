00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.200
Hello, guys! Sinful Sorcerer here with some news.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.160
Now, whether you want to call it good or bad news is entirely up to you.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.620
But the fact of the matter is that Deathfire Grasp will be removed.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.340
And it will be removed next patch during 5.2.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.280
Now, this doesn't surprise me that much
to be honest.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.780
I've seen it coming for a while.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.680
I just wasn't sure when it would happen

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.140
but I was pretty sure it would happen eventually.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.180
Ever since the item's release,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.820
 Riot seems to have had trouble balancing it in a way that they felt was proper.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.180
And some members of the team, Morello in particular,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.980
have been very vocal about their dislike for the item.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.040
Even going as far as calling it the
definition of toxicity

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.820
Now, I'm not making this video to go on a rant about Morello,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.620
even though I might disagree with a lot of his decisions.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.680
And I'm not exactly making it to defend
Deathfire Grasp either although it might seem that way.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.740
I actually wrote this text a couple days
ago essentially defending Deathfire Grasp

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.460
as I felt that Season Five was inevitably
closing in

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.500
and I thought that Riot might either target Deathfire Grasp for

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.920
some really hard nerfs or just entirely remove it.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.800
And shortly after my worst suspicions were confirmed.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.880
As you probably realised by now I really
like Deathfire Grasp.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.840
It's actually my favorite item in the entire
game and I don't want it to be removed,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.240
but like I said that's not what this video is about.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.880
I made this video because I want to discuss
this topic with you guys.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660
Personally I disagree with Riot on this.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.040
To me, DFG actually adds variety to the game rather than hinder it or remove it.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.000
It's a very unique item that can be seen as an alternative

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120
to Rabadon's Death Cap and Zhonya's Hourglass,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.220
which people otherwise seem to build every single game on mages.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.200
It also adds various different build paths to different champions

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.180
depending on what you actually want to accomplish in the game at hand.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.260
In addition to this, it's also core on a few champions like Veigar, Annie and Leblanc.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.840
And I really hope that Riot will do these champions justice after these changes.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.060
But that's just what I think.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.460
I'm interested to know what you guys think.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.880
I'm going to miss DFG but what about you guys?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.560
Are you going to miss it as well or are you glad that it's gone?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.660
Leave your thoughts in the comments in the comment section below

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.320
or just send like a video reply, if those still exist,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.840
I'm not really sure.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.880
And also,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.600
Is there any other item that you really miss?

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.500
Personally, I miss Heart of Gold.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.280
I think it was a really cool item that added, like different strategies and stuff depending on

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.720
if you wanted to get tanky, I mean, you could get it and stack up some extra gold and stuff.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.780
It was really cool. I really miss it.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.760
So other than that, thank you guys for watching!

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.040
And I will see you in... some other video, or something.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800
 This is my Veigar hat.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.380
There we go.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.900
Okay, this is starting to get a bit awkward

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900
so I'll just end the video here.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900
Thank you guys for watching and see you guys!

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.700
Next time.
