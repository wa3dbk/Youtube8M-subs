00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:09.513
My Xbox One game won't install.

00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:11.053
What should I do?

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:15.173
You could try waiting for the game to finish
installing before you start playing.

00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:17.403
That is so hard.

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:19.343
Is the console grinding?

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:22.073
If so, the problem is the optical drive.

00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:25.353
I’ve heard it called the grinding of death.

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:30.773
If the optical drive is malfunctioning, it
won’t read the disc – and then it won’t

00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:31.773
install.

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:33.293
What if it is the disc?

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:37.692
One option is switching the discs, to see
if the problem is the first disc or the disc

00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:38.883
drive.

00:00:38.883 --> 00:00:43.582
I do not have the problem on all the discs,
but sometimes see it.

00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:48.352
So use one of those disc cleaners to clean
the gunk and dirt on the inside of the machine.

00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:53.262
That may clean the optical head and guts of
the console so it is more likely to read the

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:55.032
disc so you can play.

00:00:55.032 --> 00:00:57.972
I’ve heard it could be a network connection.

00:00:57.972 --> 00:01:02.683
You could check to make sure the WiFi is working,
and that it is not slowed down by someone

00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:04.962
else downloading a movie.

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:08.853
Or make sure the WiFi signal is good enough
to load the game.

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:12.733
I can try, but I need something else to try,
too.

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:17.023
First, check to make sure the system is connected
to the network.

00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:22.833
It cannot load the game and communicate with
the Microsoft Xbox servers if it is not connected.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.063
That’s not the issue.

00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:27.543
So the issue may be your updates.

00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:32.533
If the connection is slow to load a game,
it will be slow to run the updates.

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:37.543
Stop trying to load the game and load the
updates to the Xbox instead.

00:01:37.543 --> 00:01:40.093
So I could have a digital traffic jam.

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:44.843
That, or there’s an update that’ll fix
the bugs with the game that you need to install.

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:48.353
Run the updates, then try to load the game.

00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:50.973
Don’t I need to reboot?

00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:54.743
That seems to be a pre-requisite to all other
Microsoft problems.

00:01:54.743 --> 00:02:00.583
Sure, do a power-cycle and restart it before
you try to load the game again.

00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:04.242
I could try restarting it, before I run updates.

00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:10.333
Sure, since it is a ten second wait before
you wait half an hour for Microsoft updates.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.163
Then reboot again.

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:17.013
If in doubt, reboot, is something Microsoft
needs to boot to the curb.

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:21.093
If it still won’t load the games, either
the disc or the console needs to be returned

00:02:21.093 --> 00:02:23.802
to the store, or Microsoft for a replacement.
