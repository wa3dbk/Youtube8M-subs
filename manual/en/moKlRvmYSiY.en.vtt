00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.090
Welcome to Revelation Unraveled. On this program
I want to answer a message I received from

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:15.090
a You Tuber last week concerning the rapture,
and this is what he wrote. 'Hello, we are

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.740
going to disagree on the Rapture'. Well maybe
I can change your mind on that. 'I think it's

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.740
a deception and a theory on how people interpret
the Bible. It makes no sense to me at all,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.890
nor ever will. What happens to the plane filled
with families, if the pilots both get raptured?'

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.690
Okay I think this is a very good question,
and if you watch the 'Left Behind Series',

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.500
you know a major feature is that, there are
accidents, plane crashes and so on, because

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.340
the pilots or the drivers of the buses are
suddenly raptured. I think if we take a look

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.089
at scripture, we will see that, that is not
necessarily the case. I believe everyone who

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:09.089
was raptured will be given a notice beforehand
by our Lord, so that each person can get his

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.230
affairs in order. Let's look at how Jesus
describes the Rapture in His parable of the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.230
ten virgins. In Matthew 25 verse 6, 'Behold
the bridegroom comes go you forth to meet

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.850
him'. And in verse 7, 'then all those virgins
arose and trimmed their lamps'. So we see

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.360
right here, there is a certain amount of time
allowed for the virgins to trim their lamps',

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.240
following the cry. And in verse number 8,
'And the foolish said to the wise, give us

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.240
of your oil, for our lamps have run out'.
So now we have some additional time, not only

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.060
do the virgins have time to trim their wicks,
but they also have time to engage in conversation.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.070
And in verse number 9. 'But the wise answered,
not so, lest there be not enough for you and

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.750
us, but go you rather to them that sell and
buy some for yourselves.' So now this conversation

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.870
continues, 'and while they went to buy, the
bridegroom came, and they that were ready

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.189
went in with Him to the marriage and the door
was shut'. I believe our Lord is telling us

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:38.170
in this parable, that we will be notified
ahead of time if we are going to be raptured.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.959
Not only will we have time to put our affairs
in order, but also to tell our family members

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.499
and friends that we will be raptured. So I
believe that all these images of plane crashes

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:57.269
and bus wrecks, because the drivers or the
pilots have been raptured is a bit of a fiction.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.530
And of course we need to remember, the 'Left
Behind Series' is a work of fiction. And,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.650
as I have been saying all along in these programs,
we need to understand that very few will be

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.650
saved. In Revelation Saint John says only
144,000 will be raptured. That means that

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.790
99.99% of all Christians must face the great
trial. Don't listen to the False Prophets

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.629
who claim that the entire church will be raptured.
Whenever Jesus talks about the Rapture, He

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:38.629
always warns people. He never gives comfort.
The passages in Saint Paul, where He says

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.719
'comfort one another with these words'; do
not have to do with the rapture. They refer

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:51.700
to Jesus' fourth coming at judgment. And so
my answer to my YouTube friend, I hope this

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.349
has been a help, and if you would like more
information, simply write to the address you

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.599
see on your screen.
