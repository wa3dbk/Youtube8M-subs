00:00:00.899 --> 00:00:05.200
Citizens have rights. They have rights to go into the laundromat and wash their laundry in peace.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.599
Wait 'til they get out in a situation where they're fighting and then they'll think about this and try to make it real

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.349
Isn't fantasizing about killing people

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.979
as a way to get your kicks

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:20.869
really the filthiest form of pornography?

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.869
we need to change that message

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.400
The thing I'm most passionate about right now is changing

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.660
how we talk about games, and how we talk about gamers

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.639
we have a number of generations

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:53.809
who have grown up being told that they
have wasted their time or wasted their

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.620
lives playing games

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.710
people like me who adore games and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.000
feel like the best versions of
ourselves when we play and were told that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.230
it's a waste of time, that we should have
been doing something else

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.770
well we didn't do something else and
kids today aren't doing something else kids

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.780
are playing more hours per week

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.720
then any generation before

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.130
and instead of just ringing our hands

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.760
and telling people that what they love

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.100
is bad for them

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.030
i think we need to change that message

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.350
we need to look at what

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.790
games are doing

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.840
FOR gamers; the skills that we're developing, the
relationships that were forming, the heroic

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.490
qualities that we get to practice
every time we play, like resilience

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.130
like perseverance and grit and
determination by having epic ambitions

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.500
and the ability to work with 
other players, sometimes thousands of other

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.630
players at the same time

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.309
there are a couple of concerns that come
up often when we talk about video games

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:57.739
the first is addiction and that's
definitely a real problem. gamer addiction is

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:04.180
not about necessarily the quality of games being somehow fundamentally 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.640
grab us and we can't escape. it's really about
what they offer us that the real world

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.340
sometimes

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.229
does a terrible job of offering us. and it is

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.569
hopefully our goal to

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.299
take those things that we get from games and
find ways to have them

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.419
in our real lives too.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.170
the other big concern that people

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.880
have about games

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.789
is violence

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:24.989
of course

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.499
and there's no evidence that gaming makes you more violent

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:31.999
in fact a study came out showing that
gamers who play violent games

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.059
that require

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:37.849
strategy with your teammates or cooperation with other players to

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.239
beat the bad guys

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.509
are actually

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.189
much more cooperative

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.449
in the game and in real life. that they're actually honing 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:49.569
skills of cooperation, not skills of violence. and it makes

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.829
perfect sense because when you're
playing a game with other players

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.359
youre not actually being violent right? you
have to actually

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.559
work with the other player you have
to trust them to finish the game you have to

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.889
work with your teammate, you have to communicate

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.879
there's no actual violence
involved right? the actual effort involved

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:06.730
is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.130
highly collabrotive, highly trustworthy highly
social. you know what Ive discovered is that

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.639
games do a better job 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.509
in many ways of providing the things
that we crave most

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.019
you know whether it's a sense of
satisfying hands-on work that we can

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.689
really see the outcomes of our actions
or a chance to succeed and get better

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.609
at something.  to start out being really bad and then

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.999
having a sense of mastery as you get
better and better. so the message needs to be

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.230
this is training for real-life. yes
gains are escapist

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.349
in that we do get to escape reality
when we play them

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.519
but they're not just escapist,

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.489
they are returnist. we return to our real
lives with real ways of thinking about

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.259
what we're capable of. real ways of solving
problems more creatively and and this is

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.290
the great news

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.439
for the gamer generation

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.419
that we have spent our lives planting this
seed

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.759
planning this capability and now we can take

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.809
those skills and abilities

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.979
to real challenges

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:11.819
and bring your gamer abilities

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.949
and help save the real world.

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.669
so if you have a gamer in your life or if you are a gamer

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.009
the good news is

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:26.009
you are ready, they're ready to do extraordinary things in their real lives

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:38.349
The adult goes out, he socializes, he relaxes with his friends, when they come here after school it relieves tension

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:45.699
and theyre able to have fun.The child needs a place to vent

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.660
frustration and it's better to vent the frustration playing one of these games, then to vent those frustrations on a peer

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.190
and end up in trouble with the authorities. and that, we don't want.
