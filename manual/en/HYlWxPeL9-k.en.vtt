00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.488
High Performance Computing

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:05.228
When you need to speed up your number crunching application

00:00:05.228 --> 00:00:07.278
by a factor of 100 or more,

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.389
high performance computing is unbeatable.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.071
If your application –

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:15.093
even when it deals with heavy numeric computation –

00:00:15.094 --> 00:00:19.003
takes too long for results, it's ballast in your  workflow.

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.554
You will avoid using the product at all,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.887
or worse, won't use it properly.

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:25.448
That costs.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.569
Catalysts implements high performance computing

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.582
based on a CPU-GPU system.

00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:34.737
GPUs – Graphic Processing Units –

00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:38.634
are many-core systems providing a highly parallel design.

00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:41.600
Perfect for many scientific simulations

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:46.979
for example in the field of physics, chemistry, astrophysics,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.846
medicine, financial application or earth observation.

00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:57.087
GPU-based systems even start to conquer ordinary business applications.

00:00:57.088 --> 00:00:59.162
In heavy numeric computations,

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:04.037
a GPU processing unit – also called streaming processor –

00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:08.424
is about 3 to 10 times slower compared to a CPU kernel.

00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:09.936
But there are so many of them

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.818
that you can achieve incredible speed-ups.

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:17.965
Nowadays, GPUs have several hundreds of these streaming processors.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.038
We at Catalysts have the algorithmic know-how

00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:23.814
to use this enormous, highly parallel potential

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:26.178
for your heavy numeric calculations.

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.166
Beside the enormous speed-up,

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:31.329
many-core systems are leading in energy efficiency

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.413
as well as cost efficiency.

00:01:33.414 --> 00:01:38.736
Your initial investment is about 20% lower for a CPU-GPU system

00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:41.950
than for a comparable CPU based system.

00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:45.812
Even energy costs for operation decrease by a factor of 10.

00:01:45.813 --> 00:01:49.902
Due to Moore's Law, hybrid CPU-GPU-based systems

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:53.056
can give a performance increase of about 1.000 times

00:01:53.057 --> 00:01:57.467
within one decade due to energy and cost efficient scalability.

00:01:57.468 --> 00:02:00.915
A future-oriented technology if you keep in mind

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:04.204
that CPU based systems have a performance increase

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.930
of about 100 folds within one decade.

00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:10.556
This table shows that the growth of GPU performance

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:14.156
is likely to do so until 2017.

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:18.742
Today, a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580

00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:22.757
reaches a theoretical peak performance of 1 TeraFLOP in a second

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:25.312
for a price of 400 Euros.

00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:27.868
Extrapolated from today’s values,

00:02:27.903 --> 00:02:32.917
you will get  11 TeraFlop for 400 Euros in 2014.

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:36.364
But what if you need 10 TeraFlop or more today?

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:37.967
The answer is quite simple.

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:42.370
We use multiple GPUs in one server or in the cloud.

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.146
That is a scalable, anticipatory solution

00:02:45.146 --> 00:02:48.194
we adjust to your needs and requirements.

00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:49.655
To sum it up,

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:54.646
your pros building on a GPU-CPU based system are incredible:

00:02:54.647 --> 00:02:58.636
You can tackle much bigger problems than you are currently thinking.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:01.747
You can choose better algorithms to solve your problems,

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.802
that are faster, more accurate

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:05.779
or that are giving you more detail.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.173
Your initial investment is lower compared to a CPU based system.

00:03:10.174 --> 00:03:12.940
With a GPU-CPU based system,

00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.361
you are building on a scalable, forward-looking technology

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.915
that saves you energy costs as well.

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:21.734
We at Catalysts have experience in setting up

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.681
a multiple GPU system,

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:27.033
using its advantage in our software products.

00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:29.774
You get a full range of IT solutions!

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:34.006
With our knowledge, we are able to speed up your calculations.

00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:37.392
Imagine, instead of waiting hours for your results,

00:03:37.393 --> 00:03:40.840
it could only take you a few minutes or even seconds!

00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.183
We were already able to increase the performance

00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:47.564
of our consumer's risk management tool by a factor of 400.

00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:51.723
Instead of waiting hours to receive the latest risk analysis result,

00:03:51.724 --> 00:03:54.474
they now get their results in a couple of minutes.

00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:58.384
We also have projects in the field of real-time image processing

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:01.891
in our portfolio, built on a GPU.

00:04:01.892 --> 00:04:04.471
We unleash the power of GPU computing

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:06.720
in the field of non-destructive analysis

00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:09.611
and imaging of the inner structure of materials,

00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:14.392
which is used for quality control or in the development of new materials.

00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:20.213
28 pictures with a dimension ranging from 2.048 x 1.000

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:26.104
up to 8.192 x 1.000 are processed per second,

00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:28.473
including sophisticated algorithms

00:04:28.473 --> 00:04:33.740
like a fast Fourier transformation which is implemented in software.

00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:37.032
We are Catalysts. Software is our passion.
