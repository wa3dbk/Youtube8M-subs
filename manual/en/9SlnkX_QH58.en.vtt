00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.359
Kansas waterfowl hunters face a challenge
as duck hunting progresses through zone openings

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.359
this fall.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:14.200
In a year of record-high duck populations,
hunting is limited in many places by dry conditions.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.700
Currently, the best open areas are Cheyenne
Bottoms and Jamestown Wildlife Areas, and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.849
Kirwin National Wildlife Refuge in western
Kansas.

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:33.120
Popular eastern marshes in the Late and Southeast
Zones open October 29 and Nov 5, respectively.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.610
Managers at eastern marshes have been working
against nature all year to produce food and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.820
water habitat for migrating ducks.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.550
Monty Manbeck at Neosho Wildlife Area near
St. Paul predicts tough hunting unless rain

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.740
comes soon.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.921
“We’ve got a few ducks, but the water
conditions are just so bad, and the river

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:59.650
levels are not very good for this time of
year – very untypical of what we usually

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.620
have.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.650
River levels have been lower this year than
any I’ve seen in the five years I’ve been

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.770
here, and for waterfowlers, that may not necessarily
mean good things.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.040
At this point, we’re struggling a little
bit getting water into the marshes due to

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.540
the low river conditions, but hopefully we’ll
see some rain in the near future and be able

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.070
to get water in the marshes before season
starts.”

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.260
Karl Karrow has battled similar problems at
Marais des Cygnes Wildlife Area near Pleasanton,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.640
but he’s cautiously optimistic about hunting
there.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.010
“We’ve got several marshes that are in
really good shape.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.430
We’ve got a few marshes that are a little
bit weak, but that’s kind of typical too.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.810
The river is a little low, we’re not able
to take all the water that our pumps can take,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.220
but I still believe we’re going to be in
pretty good shape by the time we have our

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.390
opening season here in the Late Zone.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.700
We’re pretty optimistic that we’ll be
in good condition and ready to go.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.010
“There’s going to be a lot of choices.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.560
Hunters are going to have to scout and find
those marshes that birds are using at a given

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.330
time and that have the kind of habitat that
the hunter prefers to hunt in.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.450
Get out there and get after them.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.110
That’s the best way to find the birds.”

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:33.010
Finally, Kirk Thompson at Benedictine Bottoms
near Atchison has fought the opposite problems

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.810
due to Missouri River flooding.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.190
“In the Benedictine Bottoms Area here, we
were under water for three months.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.410
In late June, water started seeping under
the levee and filled the area up.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.599
About 70-80 percent of the area was under
water, and it was under water until about

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.530
late September.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.160
And we were not able to get in even to check
anything in the wildlife area here until late

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160
September.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.200
On the protected side of the levee, we’re
in pretty good shape.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.770
We didn’t lose much vegetation, and where
we lost vegetation was in the low areas, and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.280
we have some barnyard grass and some good
native plants that are coming in in those

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.280
areas.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.550
But we’re in pretty good shape on most of
the area, and the waterfowl hunting should

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.170
be real good this year.”

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.360
Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism managers
have done their best to provide good hunting

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.620
this fall, but the weather was an overwhelming
factor.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.120
Check the weekly status of your favorite Kansas
marsh on the waterfowl reports by region on

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.810
the KDWPT website.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.090
Good hunting.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.030
