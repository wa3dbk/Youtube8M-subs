Hi this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:07.570
On today's episode let's take a look at how
you take a screenshot on your iPhone or iPad

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.599
and then email that to someone.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.710
So as an app developer I sometimes get questions
from my users.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.550
Like for instance in my most recent game Word
Tiles I might get a question about how the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.370
scoring works.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.770
They try to give an example but it is not
complete.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.100
So I say, Just send me a screen-shot and I'll
explain it to you.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.739
This happens a lot to app developers who just
want to see a screenshot of what the user

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.969
is seeing when they are asking a question.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.679
I'm surprised at how many people don't know
how to take a screenshot.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.589
It is pretty easy in iOS on the iPhone or
iPad to take a screenshot.

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.749
Basically you do it in two steps.

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:47.090
The first step is to take a screenshot.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.809
The second step is to do something with it
like email it to somebody.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.359
So let me show you how to do both.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.479
What you want to first do is take the shot
which involves using the two physical buttons

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:59.699
on the device.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.049
That is the Sleep/Wake button which is usually
at the top of the iPad or iPhone and the Home

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.340
button which is on the front at the bottom.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.150
Press these at the same time then it will
take a screenshot and place it in your Photo

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.150
Library.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.100
Now if you have an iPhone 6+ they have moved
the Sleep/Wake button to the side and I expect

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.479
them to be doing that on some of the future
devices as well.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.310
But either way find the Sleep/Wake button
and the Home button and press them at the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.070
same time and you will hear a sound and sometimes
see the screen flash as it just did.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.920
That puts it in the Photo Library.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.399
So let's go take a look at the Photo Library
now.

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.469
There is my Photos app and in there I want
to go and click or tap on Albums at the bottom.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.090
You can see I have Camera Roll.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.250
That is for photos that I have taken with
my device or screenshots.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.590
Also things that apps create.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.130
So an app that creates an image will put it
in the Camera Roll.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.500
Tap on it there and you can see I have that
one image there.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.760
Now I can email it to somebody many different
ways.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.380
For instance I can tap on it to go to the
screenshot and this is on the Photos app looking

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.550
at the screenshot.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.270
Not at the actual app again.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.510
I can use the Share button at the bottom left
and I can share via text message or mail or

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.140
however I want to do it.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.870
I can also just start a new message in Mail,
hit the Compose button, and I can just tap

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.790
twice in the body of the message and I'll
get Insert Photo or Video as one of the choices

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.790
there.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.760
Then I can choose from the Camera Roll to
choose that image, hit the Use button, and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.569
now it is inserted into my email message.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.599
I can still write text before or after it.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.370
That is how you take a screenshot on an iPad
or iPhone and email it to somebody.
