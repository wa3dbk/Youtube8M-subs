David, I don't want
to beat around the bush.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.748
I came to tell you that
you're gonna stop seeing Nicole.

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:17.184
Now, either you're as smart as you think
you are and you'll just go away,

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:20.050
or else you're gonna make things harder
on yourself than they have to be.

00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:23.951
You know, Steve,
you're really not a faggot.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.158
- What?
- I'm serious.

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:30.958
Seem like a pretty solid guy.
You should lighten up on yourself.

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:34.330
- We're not talkin' about me.
We're talkin' about...
- Yes, we are.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.563
That's what this whole thing's
about, Steve. Your inadequacies.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.468
- Your fears.
- You just wait a minute.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:44.476
Listen to me. See, I'm hip
to your problems. All of 'em.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:50.072
I know you abandoned Nicole
when she needed you most...
'cause I licked her sweet tears.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.643
I know about things comin' apart
at work. Maybe you fuckin'
lost it in that department.

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:58.287
I also know you ain't
keepin' up, so to speak,

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.824
your end of the bargain
with the missus.

00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:03.951
'Cause if you were,
she wouldn't be all over my stick.

00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:07.963
Relax, Steve.
We're friends.

00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:10.159
[Chuckles]
We're practically family.

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:15.800
I want you to understand
something, pal.

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:18.932
If you don't disappear from my family's
life, I'm gonna rip your balls off...

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.634
and shove 'em so far up your ass
they'll come out your fuckin' mouth!

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.304
You got that, my friend?

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.115
