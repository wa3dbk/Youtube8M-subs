00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.740
Now Mac and Cheese welcome to Steve's kitchen
by the way I asked a few days ago

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.599
what would be the best mac and cheese for
you. Now if you don't follow me on

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:09.940
Facebook or Google+

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.920
get across there and like the pages 
so you'd get that sort of information

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.640
and get involved in the community the
feedback I'm getting and I totally agree

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.100
with

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.910
is mac and cheese should be not too dry
it should have that love the elastic cheese in

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.310
there

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.970
and it should be not too stodgy and floury

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.720
absolutely agree 100 percent now in
order to make that stringyness

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.780
you want a good mozzarella this is an
Australian made mozzarella cheese

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.219
and something a little sharper to add
some flavor I've got a good quality cheddar

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.270
here as well

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.920
now for the topping I'm going to be putting
a nice bread crumb but we going to be using

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.760
also a smoked pancetta

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.770
to get all that flavor in the topping
come on

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.379
let's get and make the best Mac N Cheese
you ever had

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.259
let's go 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.430
The first thing we want to do is get a
pot of water on the stove and bring it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.990
up to a boil but you need to season that
water

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.619
now with pasta it's important to put
plenty of salt

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.790
into the water if you don't and don't
forget this is not going to absorb

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.759
into the pasta but it will flavor the
pasta so make sure your water is

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:20.680
well-seasoned

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.250
when the water comes up to the boil like that
we are going to add two and a half cups

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.970
that's about 250 grams or 8 ounces

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.710
of macaroni we'll just bring that up to a
simmer and we're going to cook that for

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.189
about six minutes a little bit
undercooked I want it because it's going to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.210
bake in the oven

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.540
and when that's cook we're going to drain
the water off I'm going to pop it into a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.810
baking dish like this

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.540
but now let's get on and make our
macaroni cheese sauce

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.220
now one of the things people say to me is
the sauce gets too floury

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.680
we do need some flour in our bechamel sauce or our white sauce

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.540
we're going to put about 30 grams that's about
one ounce of salted butter

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.579
and I'm also going to put about 30 grams one ounce
of all-purpose flour

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.479
now we don't want the floury flavor in our
sauce so we need to take this over to the stove

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.909
want to cook this through so the flour
changes its flavor

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.670
so by heating that butter and flour on the
stove we can cook off that unwanted

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.959
flour taste

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.959
now as the butter and flour melt down in
the pot like this

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.730
I'm actually looking for a little change
in color slight golden brown to the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.290
flour

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.510
now quickly while that flour and butter
is cooking there

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.530
this pancetta  is smoked it's absolutely
delicious and I'm going to be using a

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.319
little bit of this

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.459
to flavor my white sauce so I'm just
cutting a piece off

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.209
I'm probably going to use about an ounce again cut
into small cubes

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.810
now my butter and flour have been cooking for a
couple of minutes there

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm going to add my pancetta  in there and start
to cook that through and let the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.500
oils release from the pancetta you
don't have to use pancetta but

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.930
if you haven't maybe use a bacon of some
sort now the pancetta has started to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.069
release its flavors

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.330
I'm just going to season this with a little
bit of salt and a little bit of black

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.860
pepper

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.080
and next we're going to take a splash of cold milk now I've got a whisk here as well

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.680
I want to add the milk a little bit at a time and
just

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.540
whisk and you'll notice that it gets
very thick

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.440
and we just keep adding a little bit of
milk bring it back up to temperature

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.940
and whisk in until we get a lovely
thick sauce now I've added about 3 cups

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.920
that's about 750 mls

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.959
of milk into this and I've bought it up to the
boil each time so I've got a lovely rich

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.030
thick sauce now we have to add our cheese

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.299
Now if you you taste that sauce now its going to
taste great just as it is but we've got

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.440
to add cheese into it this after all

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.030
is a mac and cheese I'm going to use about
a pound 450 grams of mozzarella

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.830
as I want that lovely stringingness and
then I'm going to use about half of that

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.040
of a sharp cheddar this cheddar is a
delicious Australian cheddar

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.239
it's really sharp and we don't need to
grate it you can just take the cheeses

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.760
and cut them up into small blocks they'll
melt pretty quickly

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.230
in that hot sauce so back over at the
stove I've got my mozzarella

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.989
I know this is a lot of cheese but like I
told you this is going to be the best

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.129
Mac N Cheese

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.629
you've ever tasted pop the mozzarella in
there and on top of the mozzarella that

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.140
lovely sharp cheddar

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.230
and on a low simmer we're just going to
continue to stir this through

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.549
until the cheese is absorbed into the
sauce now that's why I don't bother

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.660
grating it in look thats

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.070
only been a minute or so it's started to
melt in its not quite fully melted yet

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.229
but look at the lovely stringyness to this
sauce

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.970
that is going to be so perfect for our mac and
cheese

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.090
and when that's completely melted down
we'll get this over to the macaroni

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.130
get it ready to go in the oven now
before we put our sauce in it's really

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.290
important that you don't over fill your
dish with the macaroni it's so thirsty

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.100
it will soak up all that sauce and will
become very dry

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.710
now we're going to take that wonderful rich
look at that sauce I'm going to pour the whole

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.710
sauce in there now it might look like a lot of
sauce

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.229
for this mac and cheese but it's why
this is going to be so delicious

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.389
then I'm just going to take my whisk and I
want to spike the macaroni cheese

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.410
so that some of that sauce gets down
into the macaroni holes

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.509
so you see all the little bubbles coming up
that's the macaroni filling up with the cheese

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.669
we're going to pop this in the oven for about
30 minutes or so on 180

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.020
degree Celsius 350 fahrenheit and I like
to see a little browning on top and then

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.699
I'm going to put a breadcrumb

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.180
and a little bit of bacon over the top to
get a crispy top

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.300
I'm just going to put a couple of tablespoons
of olive oil into a

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.050
frying pan or skillet and there's a
reason why I put my bread crumb on later

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.820
I'll explain that to you in a moment

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.110
just popped some pancetta in there start to
fry that through

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.310
and a knob of butter as well and just let that
melt in

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.669
as that comes up to heat I'm going to put
about a cup maybe a little over

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.030
of breadcrumbs this just fresh
breadcrumbs from home

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.770
just going to let them get coated with the
fats from the fried bacon

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.139
I'm also  going to put a little bit of dry parsley 
in there you can use fresh parsley of course

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.389
Now I don't want to cook this too long just a few
moments to get all the flavors mixed

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.000
together

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.419
this wonderful crumb is going to go on top
of our mac and cheese

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.250
any is going to make it fantastic now
look at that that is why I don't put the

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.160
crumbly top

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.500
on first because I want that caramelized
top

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.740
over my mac and cheese that is where all
the flavor is now I can put the crumble

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.630
on top of that

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.199
so we're going to have a double whammy we can have this
wonderful crunchy top which I'm just

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.789
going to pop back in the oven

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.139
for about 10 minutes until its golden
brown now

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.690
look at that there can you see that bubbling
away

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.009
there is my mac and cheese now I would
let that sit for about 15 minutes or so

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:33.979
on the side before I serve it

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.169
because it's going to be roasting hot at the moment
and I wish you could smell

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.330
what's coming off there  now it's so
delicious the smoked bacon is coming

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.130
through the cheese the mozzarella

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.150
now I can't wait anymore I'm going to give
this a try

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.690
 let's get up a piece from this corner
here got myself a dish

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.300
will you look just how beautiful and
stretchy that is

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.800
it's not dry it all maybe a little bit of
parsley  just on the top there

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.590
and I'm going to give this a go here goes
my perfect Mac

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.620
and cheese look at that

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.849

never been a major fan of mac and cheese

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.729
