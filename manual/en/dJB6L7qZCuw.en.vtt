00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.137
Hi I'm Victoria Rajkumar,  and I'll be 
 
showing you around my dorm tonight. 

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:05.870
Let's start with the bathroom.

00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:11.134
All right. This is my bathroom. 
It's super clean. It's nice. 

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:17.224
I put a bunch of flowers in there, 
a 
 poster, and a towel. It looks really nice.

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:20.455
My superhero poster. I love superheroes.

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:22.342
This is my room. 

00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:29.160
This is a painting I made a while back, 
and 
 it's the signature part of the whole room. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.632
This is my photo wall with 
all my friends and family on it. 

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:37.901
I miss them so much, but they make
 my 
 wall look absolutely beautiful. 
Thank you guys.

00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:39.809
This is my schedule. 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.143
I try to keep it colorful so I 
 can remember 
and keep track of everything.

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:48.275
This is a little shrine I have from gifts 
 
I've been given throughout the years. 

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:50.156
It's really sweet. 

00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:52.454
Everybody gave me little things 
to keep me safe.

00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:55.792
I have a book from Sister Helen Prejean 

00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:59.524
and a little booklet from the Dr. Kevorkian interview. 

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.398
I got both of their autographs,

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:05.702
and I think it's so cool that we 
got to meet these people 

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:09.341
and NSU decided to bring 
them here. Thank you NSU.

00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:14.476
This is my big chair where I do my 
studying. My books are there.

00:01:14.476 --> 00:01:20.176
Here's the wall tapestry. It's really colorful, 
and the video does it no justice.

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:23.256
It has om symbols decorated all around it. 

00:01:23.256 --> 00:01:24.950
So it's really cool.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.103
This is my study area where I do all 
my work, my homework, 

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:31.431
meet those deadlines, all that good stuff. 

00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:35.692
My wall decorations, another clock. 

00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:38.552
None of the clocks in my 
room work unfortunately.

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:43.730
Let's see. 
Here are all my textbooks that I keep. 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.110
More books, some tarot cards, 
and lots of water. 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.970
I have a lot of textbooks and water.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.220
All right. 
Let me show you into the closet area. 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.220
This is my closet. 
I have a ton of makeup, a ton of belts.

00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:04.630
Here is another thing that I love. 

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:07.700
It's a little necklace that says, 
"Take risks, take risks." 

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:09.870
It's the perfect thing to 
wake up to in the morning.

00:02:09.874 --> 00:02:12.470
Here's my bed area.

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:15.470
It's really cool because it's so magical. 
Everything is just dreamlike. 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.130
Let's see if I can get it in the shot. 
Another tapestry.

00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:28.230
Here's my fridge area. 
I have a lot of vitamins. 
A lot of vitamins.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.630
I have a little surprise to 
show you about the room, 

00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:33.600
really. Let's get a clear shot of it first. 

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:42.440
Very nice. My bed lights up. 
I think it's so pretty.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.210
It's the perfect thing to fall asleep to. 
The lights are completely safe. 

00:02:45.214 --> 00:02:47.940
They're little flowers with 
light bulbs built into them, 

00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:51.490
and it just makes it for a very 
whimsical place to live.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.700
This is the best part of my dorm. 
 
My dorm is a happy place. 

00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:58.960
It's colorful, it's beautiful, 
and it really matches the person. 

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:00.960
I think everyone should have 
their dorm matching to them.

00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:03.540
So thank you.

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:07.280
 I hope you enjoyed my room 
as 
 much as I enjoyed making it. 

00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:08.960
All right, thanks.
