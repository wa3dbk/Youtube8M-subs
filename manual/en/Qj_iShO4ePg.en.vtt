[Music]

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.960
[laughing]

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.240
BLAINE: Remember you were really drunk and you said that thing,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.860
and I was like Burnie, that's a funny thing you said?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.740
BURNIE: Yeah, no, I don't remember that.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.860
MICHAEL: Hey, did you guys go out last night?
BURNIE: Yeah?

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.300
MICHAEL: How come you never invite me?

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.986
BLAINE: I mean we would've group- messaged you, but... you know...

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:21.940
MICHAEL: No, I don't know.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.940
BLAINE: Michael, you're a green person.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.170
MICHAEL: What the fuck does that mean?

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.709
BLAINE: Do you want me to tell him? 
BURNIE: No, I got this one.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.320
BURNIE: Alright, Michael. See I have an iPhone, Burt has an iPhone.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.600
BLAINE: Blaine. 
BURNIE: Almost everybody who works in this company,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.909
has an iPhone and that means when we message each other, look, comes up in blue.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.930
That means we can send a group message and everybody else can see everybody else's replies

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.820
MICHAEL: Okay...

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.140
BURNIE: Alright, but when I had you, watch what happens here. Uh-oh! You come up, you're green...

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.380
MICHAEL: Right, I don't have an iPhone.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.860
BURNIE: Exactly, you don't have an iPhone, which means it can't send you a group message,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.809
it has to send you an individual text. That means you can't see anybody else's replies and even worse

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.049
When I add you to a group message, it makes *everybody* green.

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.840
BLAINE: So gross.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.280
MICHAEL: So what?
BURNIE: So, if nobody can see anybody else's replies,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.020
that means if we're gonna go out together...

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.400
everyone's got to talk to everybody else individually.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.560
[texting noises, laughing]

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320
BLAINE: No one's doing that.
 BURNIE: No

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.960
MICHAEL: Is this a real thing?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.240
BURNIE: Oh, it's a real thing, and it's why nobody ever invites you anywhere.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.260
MICHAEL: But I'm not the one with the stupid fucking messaging system.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.500
BLAINE: That's exactly what I'd expect a green person to say.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.140
MICHAEL: Stop fucking calling me green.
BURNIE: Dude, you're in denial.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.640
MICHAEL: This can't be a real thing.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.620
BURNIE: It is. Hey Barb who in the office is green?
BARBARA: On text?     BURNIE: Yes.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.900
BARBARA: Uh, Shane, Jordan, and...

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.040
...Michael! How've you been? Haven't seen you in months.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.000
BLAINE: Told you.
MICHAEL: This can't be a thing.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.820
BLAINE: Oh, it's a thing.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.750
[phone alerts go off]

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.920
BURNIE: Oh yeah dude, I can go to lunch. 
BARBARA: Me too.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.520
BURNIE: (offscreen) Where we going?
BLAINE: (offscreen) Oh, uh, I'll message you.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.760
MICHAEL: Can I come?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.800
BURNIE: Uhhh...

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.760
BURNIE:Yeah, we'll text ya.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.400
[texting noises]

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.940
MICHAEL: (dejected) Ya didn't send it...
