00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:24.490
How to select page protectors or insert for
your screwpost portfolio book

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.589
There are a variety of inserts that you can
use with your screwpost portfolio book

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.730
1. Archival Polypropylene Sheet Protectors
With Black Liner. This is our most versatile

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.840
and popular type of sheet protector. This
type of sheet protector is made from a very

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.210
clear acid free material that is inert, heat
resistant and chemically stable, all of which

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.440
means it is perfectly safe for your artwork.
It is sealed on three sides and loads from

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.900
the top. It has a sheet of acid free and lignin
free black paper that serves as an attractive

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.790
background and a separator when your artwork
is smaller than the full size of the sheet

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.549
protector. It has holes punched along the
binding edge and is scored along the edge

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:14.149
to form a hinge so that the pages can be turned.
The hole pattern is compatible with screwpost

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.759
portfolios as well as most brands of multi-ring
binders and presentation cases on the market.

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:28.730
2. Economy Archival Polypropylene Sheet Protectors.
This is our most economical sheet protector

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.450
for use with our screwpost portfolios. This
sheet protector is made from the same quality

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.539
acid free archival polypropylene as our more
expensive sheet protectors and has the same

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.690
top-loading design, but it does not come with
a black paper liner. If the artwork you are

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.109
using matches the sheet size of the protector,
you will probably not need the black paper

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.869
liner anyway, so this may be your best choice.
These sheet protectors are punched with a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.009
hole pattern that fits our screwpost portfolio
books, but will not fit in a multiring portfolio

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.729
or presentation case. So, if you will be using
the sheet protectors only in your screwpost

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.239
portfolio and if your documents are the full
size of the protector these sheet protectors

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.909
will save you money by eliminating the black
paper lining that you really don’t need.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:29.790
3. Archival Flex-Hinge Polyester Sheet Protectors.
Polyester is by far the clearest material

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.680
you can use for a sheet protector. However,
until now, polyester sheet protectors could

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.069
not be used in screwpost portfolio books because
the material cannot be scored to form a hinge.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.739
These Archival Flex-Hinge Polyester Sheet
Protectors solve this problem by bonding a

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.760
flexible hinge material to the edge of the
sheet, which allows the sheets to lie flat

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.110
when the pages are turned. Since they are
made from a single folded sheet of material,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.650
they are open at both the top and bottom.
This should be no cause for concern in most

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.510
cases, because friction holds the documents
in the sheet protector very securely. If you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.189
want the ultimate in clarity and pages that
lie flat, these polyester sheet protectors

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:14.189
are the choice for you.

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.170
4. Adhesive Hinge Strips. Sometimes you don’t
want anything to get between your artwork

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.019
and the person viewing it. For those occasions,
our adhesive hinge strips are just what you

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.730
need. Simply pull back the release liner to
expose the archival adhesive and adhere your

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.189
artwork to the adhesive edge. Now your artwork
is ready to be placed in your screwpost portfolio

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.859
book, since the strips are pre-punched with
the proper hole pattern and provide a hinge

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.939
action to allow your artwork to lie flat when
the book is opened. Adhesive hinge strips

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.069
work with both screwpost portfolio books and
3-ring binders.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:59.420
5. Prepunched Inkjet Paper for Screwpost Portfolios.
Perhaps the most direct way to get your artwork

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.599
into a screwpost portfolio book is to print
directly on our prepunched matte inkjet paper.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:13.180
The sheets are made of double-sided, smooth,
bright white, heavyweight matte paper and

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.940
are prepunched and scored so they can be bound
in a screwpost portfolio. The paper is water

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.139
resistant and archival and is available in
five sizes to fit our screwpost portfolios.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.909
