Hello! This is Jose Zuniga and I representin
expertvillage.com. Well we've got to the point

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.579
that we nned to check our PH level on our
soil. Remember if you planted your gardenias

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:17.910
near sidewalks, driveways and home foundations,
the PH levels are going to be way up there

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.750
and we want to reduce the PH level. Too much
of it is definitely going to kill our Gardenias.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.150
Remember one rule, stay away from the sidewalk,
the driveway and of course, the home foundation

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.100
because the PH level is going to be out there.
It is going to destroy the plant and not only

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.249
that, it is going to delay the growth. Delaying
the growth equals dead plant. One way of us

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:49.510
checking the PH level is basically real simple.
Get a small shovel, get a clean bag, ziploc

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:59.109
bag or just a clear bag that hasn't been contaminated,
dig for a little bit of soil; there we go,

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:09.300
one more. Aso before you take it to the store,
be sure to remove any weeds. Take it as clean

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.210
as possible to the store. Any rocks, perfect!
Take it to the store. It is going to take

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.890
about 10 minutes to check for PH levels. At
that point, they are going to tell you the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.190
PH levels for Gardenias need to be between
5.0 and 6.5. In the event that it is too high

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.670
in PH level, you are going to have to buy
a product most likely sulfur or whatever product

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.390
they guide you to. Be sure that you have two
different locations where you are going to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.950
be planting your Gardenias. You are going
to need to leave the bags of soil samples.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.750
Now if the PH level is too low, simple. Get
some coffee grinds. Add it to the soil. It

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.100
is going to hike up the PH level. Another
secret use those rustic nails on the soil

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.330
and it will take care of the matter. This
is how we test for PH levels for planting

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.830
of gardenias. Come on, let's tackle the project.
