00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.130
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ketchum: Then we have the colon. The
colon is a hollow tube that goes from the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.340
small intestine to the rectum. Its function
is to concentrate the waste into feces. It

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.900
absorbs water and stores feces until defecation.
Few electrolytes can also be absorbed.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.369
So here are some special features of the colon.
The large intestine includes the cecum, terms

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.249
that you may have heard before, the colon,
and the rectum. We have an ileocecal sphincter

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.400
that is actually between the ileum and the
colon. So remember that the ileum is the last

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.520
part of the small intestine. There’s where
the ileocecal sphincter is located. So it’s

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.400
going to control passage of material from
the ileum into the colon. Then you have these

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.280
teniae coli, which are bands of longitudinal
smooth muscle that surround the colon. And

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.430
you have four sections to the colon. The very
first part is called the ascending colon.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.420
Then your contents will move to the transverse
colon, then to the descending colon. And then

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.340
the last part of the colon is this little
“s” shaped portion. It kind of looks like

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.140
an “s,” right, and that’s called the
sigmoid colon. So as the contents are moving

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.249
from the ascending colon, the transverse colon,
the descending colon, water is being absorbed

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:25.240
and some ions are being absorbed from the
chyme. The sigmoid colon is more of a storage

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.670
depot for whatever’s left over. So whatever
didn’t get absorbed and is going to be stored

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.189
for a little bit will be stored in the sigmoid colon.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.299
Now just a note: We also have a structure
called the appendix, and it’s called the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.600
vermiform appendix because it’s wormlike.
And recently they’ve discovered 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.170
that it might be important
in replenishing that beneficial gut bacteria.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.300
So in other words, it’s a microbe storehouse.
It stores microbes that are beneficial.
