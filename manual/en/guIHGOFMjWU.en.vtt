00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.559
&gt;&gt; Are you an Avatar fan?

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.189
We'd like to talk to you about a meet up...

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:14.429
...in Seattle.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.390
You'd be making a difference.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.029
&gt;&gt; I became an Avatar fan for the fellowship.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.380
I told myself I could watch Avatar
as many times as any other fan.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.380
All I wanted; was a single place to meet up.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.680
&gt;&gt; Aysmukan, sÃ¬ aysmuke!
(Brothers and sisters!)

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.490
You are not in Kansas anymore...

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.550
...you's gonna be in Seattle.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.960
&gt;&gt; You should see your faces!

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.180
&gt;&gt; We have a genuine population of Avatar fans...

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.030
... they are very hard to quell.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.390
&gt;&gt; This is why we're here:

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.200
Because of this amazing film,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.140
which made over 2 billion.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.150
The forums happen to be housing the richest
deposit of Avatar fans, and they need to meet up.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.880
We're on the brink of needing more,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.000
and some of us are trying to find the perfect solution.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.790
&gt;&gt; The concept is: you get yourselves to Seattle in July 2012

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.850
Where Avatar fans from around the world
can say "I See you" to the natives.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.660
&gt;&gt; An Avatar fan in the Avatar exhibit: That's a potent mix.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.760
You come to Seattle and we'll see that you meet your Avatar family.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.500
Your real Avatar family.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.750
&gt;&gt; Hell yeah, sir.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.210
&gt;&gt; Looks like it's for you.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.970
This is your meetup.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.480
&gt;&gt; Just relax and imagine being there...

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.480
it shouldn't be hard for you.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.040
&gt;&gt; Look, it's real simple:

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.490
We want you to come to Seattle,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490
to be there is a must.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.000
&gt;&gt; You should be here.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.500
Come back!

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.490
All this is Jim's fault.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.169
&gt;&gt; We need your help.

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.169
To be here would be outstanding.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.789
&gt;&gt; Haven't got lost on the forums have you?

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.569
D'you forget what team you're playing for?

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.500
&gt;&gt; We long to stay there for a week, that would be the thing.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.889
You've got to come.

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.769
&gt;&gt; You knew this would happen.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.139
&gt;&gt; It was only a matter of time.

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.949
&gt;&gt; It's gonna be crazy here;

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.500
Avatar fans will be rolling through Seattle,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.939
and there'll be no stopping them.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.629
&gt;&gt; We're going up again people who do not See.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.500
&gt;&gt; Then I guess we'd better help them.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.069
&gt;&gt; Avatar has sent us a message:

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.289
That we can change if we really want.

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.279
Now we are sending the fans a message:

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:10.759
That this...

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:12.469
THIS IS OUR MEETUP!
