00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.930
Jason, what happened last time on 
The Intergalactic Nemesis?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.059
Well, Buzz, Molly and Timmy were rescued for a third time by that mysterious stranger

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.599
who's turned out to be a librarian from
Flagstaff named Ben Wilcott

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.100
Now they race to Tunis to
find the central hive

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.640
(Main theme song)

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
(Train whistle)

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.439
Timmy: Well it took a while, but I found some
genuine all-American Atlantic City taffy

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.720
Did I miss anything?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.199
Molly: Not hardly, kid

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.359
Rescue-boy, here, was just explaining how
he's going to knock out that central hive

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.960
Timmy: Oh, well maybe this'll help

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.100
(Rustling paper)

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.820
Ben: What's this?

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.360
Timmy: Our contact in Transilvania gave it to us right before he was assassinated by

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.930
the assassin that you

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.070
then assassinated right after. Boy that's
a little confusing

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.990
But it's written in some kind of code 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.180
Ben: Let me see
(Wrist computer beeps)

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.180
Timmy: Wow! What's with that wristwatch gizmo?!

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.800
Ben: Uh...

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.960
Molly: Yeah, what is that thing, Dick Tracy?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.580
Ben: It's an alpha-3 wrist-top

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.220
Molly and Timmy: (In unison) Alpha-3...?

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.960
Timmy: Molly...

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.360
Molly: (Whisper) I know, kid. I know

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300
(More beeps)

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.480
Ben: Just as I thought! This isn't just a map; it's a ground plan of the central hive!

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.800
Molly: You sure know a lot about this central hive, Mr. Wilcott

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.640
That must be some library you have in Flagstaff

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.340
Ben: Miss loan

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.540
Mr. Mendez

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.020
I think it's time you knew the truth

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.460
Molly: Oh, bully! I love a good secret

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.840
Ben: You saw something at Kradmoor, Miss Sloan

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.840
A man 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.840
mysteriously transformed into something so terrible it made you lose consciousness

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.980
Molly: But how did you see that..?

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.220
Ben: What seemed a horrible nightmare 
was in fact very real

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.360
The man you saw was not Lord Michael
Crawford

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.320
He was no man all!

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.120
That abhortant vision you saw was his
true form:

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.900
a hyper-intelligent... monster 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.020
with unstoppable mental powers 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.080
That creature

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.440
is a Zygonian!
(Suspenseful piano)

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.860
A race of creatures I've sworn to stop at all costs!
(More piano)

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.020
A race of creatures...

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.020
from outer space!
(Piano climbs)

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.320
Molly: Fascinating!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.780
I knew there was more to this story! Are
you getting this down, Timmy?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.640
Timmy: But, Molly...

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.820
Molly: Start scribbling, kiddo. They'll probably give
me some sort of a double pulitzer for this one

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.900
Timmy: Roger, Molly. You can count on me

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.600
Molly: Space aliens, you say? Of course

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.030
There could be no other explanation 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.340
And you say they're from Zygonia?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.980
Ben: Zygon, actually. Look I know 
it must sound incredible

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.880
Molly: No, Wilcott. This is the first thing 
you've said that actually makes sense

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.240
And this central hive? Is that some sort of spaceship?

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.120
Ben: No

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.360
It's a kind of nerve center

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.820
The Zygonians will use it as a base
of operations when their main fleet arrives

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.420
in 2095

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.820
Molly: Daddy would like these guys. They
really plan ahead

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.220
Timmy: So you found out about the invasion, and
now you're going to Tunis to save the World?

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.870
Wow! We've got a real life hero in our midst, Molly! 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.900
Molly: I'll say. It's kind of a tall order for a
librarian,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.900
isn't it, Wilcott?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.900
(Sad piano music)

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.540
Ben: Each of us has a destiny, Miss Sloan,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.880
for good or for evil

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.380
Perhaps your destiny is to change the
world through your reporting

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.800
My own destiny stands clearly before me

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.830
If it takes every ounce of life I have in me

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.960
I will put and end to their terror,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.980
once

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.300
and for all

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.300
(Music lingers then fades)

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.980
Ben: Now if you'll excuse me, I think...

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.320
I'll see if I can find a newspaper. Excuse me

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.740
(Footsteps traill off and a door closes)

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.680
(Timmy and Molly laugh loudly)

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.810
Molly: Good grief!

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.860
The poor sap is Banana's!

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.660
It's too bad too, he was starting to look kind of cute

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.300
Timmy: Well, Molly, look at this

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.300
(Paper rustling)

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.300
(Main theme played slowly)

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.549
Timmy: Do you think he's dangerous?

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.259
Molly: I don't know, Timmy. But one thing I do know:

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.959
If Mysterion is going to be in Tunis, then that's
where the story is

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.549
And I have a hunch this Wilcott's 
going to lead us right to it

00:05:11.549 --> 00:05:15.729
(Train whistle)

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.179
Ben: Here you go. Keep the change

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:22.369
Cop 1: Haff you seen ein female American reporter?

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:23.240
Cop 2: You!

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.880
Ben: Excuse me! 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.700
Cop 1: Vait! Stop that man!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.420
Ben: Miss Sloan! Mr. Mendez! We've got trouble!

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.560
All: Whoa! Aaaaah!

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.880
(Train breaks and falling luggage)

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.500
Molly: There's only one way out! Mr. Wilcott, Gentlemen first.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.780
Ben: No, but--Aaaaahhh! (fades out)

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.980
Molly: Timmy, you're next

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.380
Thug: You're not go-ink novhere

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.380
(Suspenseful piano)

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.879
Watch out for the next episode of 
The Intergalactic Nemesis

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.560
The adventure continues 
online and in person
