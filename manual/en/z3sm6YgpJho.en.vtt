00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.879
Today we're going to go over a dumbbell kick,
otherwise known as a dumbbell kickback.

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:10.879
It's for your triceps.

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.020
It's a very basic exercise for your triceps,
a well-known exercise that you can do completely

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.300
right or completely wrong.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.970
There are many different things that go into
such a simple exercise.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.900
First, you can do these standing, or you can
do these kneeling.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.461
The most popular way to do them is on a bench.

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.461
I still prefer that way, too.

00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:33.930
You want your knee well-supported, and you
want your body well-supported.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.650
This arm is for your upper-body support.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.550
The back leg is firmly on the ground.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.510
You want good balance.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.590
You're going to choose a weight that you can
control through the motion without cheating.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.750
I like to stay light with these.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.350
You're not really going to go heavy; it's
a concentrated exercise.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.230
With this starting position, you never want
to lock out.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.260
You're going to keep a slight bend in your
elbow.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.579
Now, your elbow is going to start here.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.110
You want to keep your upper arm at 90 degrees
to the floor, parallel to the floor, the whole

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.830
time.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.670
As you do this exercise, you simply extend
the elbow out and bring it back.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.130
It's a very controlled exercise.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.369
To get the most out of it, you're going to
come up and pause.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.240
That really works the muscle, right there.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.159
That pause is what you're going to feel the
most.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.259
Now release back down.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.570
It's not a swing thing.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.389
That's totally wrong; it's cheating, and you're
not doing a thing for your muscle.

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:37.469
It's all controlled.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.539
Squeeze that muscle and return.

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.179
Squeeze that muscle, and return.

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.640
Really pump a lot of blood into that.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.549
This isn't a heavy exercise.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.850
It's something you want to keep light.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.789
You can really fill that muscle up with blood
and get the nutrients that you need.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.499
Again, you see a lot of guys have bad form
with this, where they torque their bodies

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.659
to cheat the exercise and basically make it
an ego exercise.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.770
This is not an ego exercise at all.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.610
The better control you have doing it, the
better results you're going to get.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.099
You're square with the ground, you're firm
with your feet, your hands, and support.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.069
Elbows are parallel to the floor.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.980
Come up, squeeze that muscle.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.599
Make it burn, and return.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.250
Come up, squeeze that muscle.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.111
Make it burn, and return.

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.200
And that's your tricep kickback.
