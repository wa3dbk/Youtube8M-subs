00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.090
the three main characteristics of the
wetlands are hydrology vegetation and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.369
soils and hydrology is water and by far
the most important but without you know

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:43.199
all of them it wouldn't be a wetland this is where it might be good to have a walking stick

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.199
you guys getting the touch of the muck

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.970
muck is a highly organic soil is
partially broken down organic material

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.880
you can see roots and branches in here
and it's a the wetlands known as the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.640
kidneys of nature because if this stuff
works very well in filtering out

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.640
contaminants and pollutants

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.570
so when you get a really organic rich
mucky soil not only you get to throwing

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.800
mud balls but it actually holds onto
water really really well and act like a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.990
sponge so it's really good for flood
control so whenever the waters do come

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.710
in it can actually hold onto and it's
actually really good whenever there are

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.290
periods of no rain because it can actually
expel the water too

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.509
we're at the beaver dam about it's
about eight feet high and that the

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.569
largest section and it kind of just
backs up one of the area's or little

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.579
creek that flows into North Creek are
wetlands are home to a lot of different

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:10.129
species of birds such as eagles hawks
there's salmon breeding here as well as

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.470
coyotes mice rabbits

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.380
frogs salamanders we have 58 acres of
wetlands it's really something that I

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.400
hope more people will know about that's
why would like to do these one land

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.370
tours because it's such an amazing
educational tool right here you know for

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.480
everybody the utilize
