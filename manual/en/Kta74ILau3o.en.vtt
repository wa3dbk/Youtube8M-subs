00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:05.080
What's up, family?

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.610
It's Jason Andrew Wrobel here from JasonWrobel.com.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.549
That's Jason W-R-O-B as in baby, you want
some breakfast, E-L.com.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.549
That's
right.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.000
Today, I'm going to be doing a gluten-free
vegan dark chocolate

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.500
pancakes recipe, or as my friend Sean Connery
would say, pancakes.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.259
In fact,
I think I'm going to kick J-Wro out and just

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.730
do the whole recipe myself
here today.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.300
You know, for a Bond, there's only one proper
breakfast before

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.130
you go out on a mission, and that's pancakes.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.820
So let me show you how it's
done on the gluten-free tip, shall we?

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.360
Come on, let's begin.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.970
So the first thing you want to do when you're
making a perfect pancake is

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.660
to mix your dry ingredients, say that with
me, dry ingredients, in your wet

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.840
ingredients separately.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.329
You don't want them to play too quickly in
the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.220
sandbox together, so let's start with our
dry.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.319
What you want to do is get a
little bit of gluten-free pancake mix here.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.520
I've got here some buckwheat
and flax, which is nice.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.540
You get your omega-3 fatty acids in here.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.069
To your
mixing bowl, you want to add one-third of

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.060
a cup of your gluten-free pancake
mix.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.369
Now, the next thing is we're going to put
the chocolate into our dark

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.299
chocolate pancakes.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.319
I'm talking about some raw cacao powder.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.090
Now, say it
with me now, cacao.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.090
Cacao.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.040
Say it on the side of your mouth, cacao.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.340
It's
delicious, it's full of magnesium, antioxidants,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.619
and helps release more
phenylethylamine in your brain.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.990
What you want to do is add a big heaping
teaspoon, rather a tablespoon.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.079
Let's do a tablespoon and a half.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.759
That's
maybe right around four teaspoons, give or

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.759
take.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.049
If it's a little too much
chocolate in here, I'm not going to be the

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.999
first one to complain, you know.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.990
Then to make sure these are going to fluff
up real nice, you've got to have

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.259
some baking powder.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.910
Now, not all baking powder is created equal.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.730
In this
case, you want to get your non-genetically

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.980
modified organisms, or non-GMO,
certified, corn-based baking powder.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.690
Let's do a half a teaspoon.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.159
The last, but not least, in our dry mix, you
want to bring all the flavors

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.599
together, and how do you do that?

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.849
You do it with a little salt.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.959
In this
case, mineral rich Himalayan crystal salt,

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.019
about a pinch, which is maybe
equal to about an eighth of a teaspoon.

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.490
Now, the dry is looking real fly, so we've
got to go onto our wet mixture

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.490
here.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.840
I did some nice protein-rich hemp seed milk.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.430
Three-quarter cup goes
into your wet mixing bowl.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.380
Now, for some sweetness, I think we're going
to

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.380
go a little heavy handed.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.660
Maybe since our hemp milk is unsweetened,
let's

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.420
do a full tablespoon here of our maple syrup.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.180
Now, the complement to the chocolate has got
to be its partner in crime,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.329
the Robin to its Batman, the Indiana Jones,
Sr. to the Indiana Jones, Jr.,

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.329
vanilla.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.209
Now, you could use ground vanilla bean.

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.420
In this case, to keep it
liquidy and nice and the consistency proper,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.530
I'm going to use some organic
vanilla extract.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.180
You could do a quarter of a teaspoon.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.709
Now lastly, to give it some body, I have a
little bit of fresh sunflower

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.050
seed butter that I'm going to add in.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.700
We'll do a tablespoon of this.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.079
Now,
what you want to do is mix each of these separately,

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.629
and then we're going
to mix them together.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.739
So take dry ingredients, yes, and then you're
going

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.120
to take them, and you're going to put them
with your wet ingredients, and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.170
then we're going to make a pancake mix.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.819
Now, once everybody is in the pool playing
nice and they've got their

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.969
floaties on, you want to ideally set this
in the fridge for about ten

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.930
minutes to let it firm up just a little bit.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.200
A nice cool, firm mix will
give you a really great pancake consistency.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.749
So now the very first thing that you want
to do is take a skillet, add a

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.930
little, tiny bit of coconut oil, and what
you want to do is take that

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.310
coconut oil and just heat it over a low to
medium flame.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.030
Now, don't go too
high here.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.100
If you put your flame too high, things are
going get scorching.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.560
You want to make sure your oil is nice and
all around the pan, so swoop it

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.140
around a little bit like this.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.440
So what you're going to see start to happen
is you're going to see a few

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440
things.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.390
You're going to see air bubbles, little oxygen
bubbles, popping up

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.390
through the butter, and then around the edges,
it might be hard to see

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.730
because it's dark chocolate in fact, but you're
going to see the edges

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.830
start to get brown.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.042
So you want to see the oxygen bubbles popping
out of

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:55.010
the middle, like you're just up from a scuba
mission, like a top secret

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.020
scuba mission, and then the edges are getting
a little brown.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.920
That's what
you want to look for before you flip this

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.460
bad boy.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.930
Now, don't worry about a
little brown there, because after all, it's

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.930
chocolate.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.820
It's not looking
burnt, but it's right on the borderline.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.330
Now, as you can see, we've got some heaping
beauties right here.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.750
Now, we're
not done yet.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.970
We have to top these beauties properly, so
we've got a

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.190
delicious crunchy cacao nibs here.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.840
Then we're going to throw some extra
fine, oh, that's how I like it, shredded coconut,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.770
shredded coconut, then a
little bit of fresh blueberries on top.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.330
Now, at this point, I'm going to
grab my big ass jug of [grade B] maple syrup.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.460
If you don't want to use
maple syrup, you can always do agave, you

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.490
can do coconut palm nectar, a few
drops of Stevia, which might be a little weird,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.280
but, hey, if you're doing
the zero sugar thing, go ahead.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.340
In this case, I've got to go classic with
Vermont's finest.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.370
Now, it's time to dive in the deep end.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.370
Here we go.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.370
Time to take it to the
face.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.340
Where do you think J-Wro got that one from?

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.340
Me.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.340
Take it to the beard.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.790
Oh, yeah, got to get the blueberries in there.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.990
Got to get the pancake
action, the Connery cakes.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.900
Here we go.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.210
Mm.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.170
Oh, sweet plains of Dublin.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.580
You
know what that's like?

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.010
It's like the first time I had brunch in Vienna.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.350
There was this little cafe.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.350
I was there.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.700
I was a young man.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.780
I was in a
[college trip].

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.150
I never knew I'd be an action hero one day
of legendary

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.610
proportions, but I had pancakes in Vienna,
and this reminds me of that day,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.340
the first time I ever clipped my toenails.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.300
I actually still have those in a
bag somewhere.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.310
I've been meaning to use those in a recipe.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:51.330
If you guys dug my recipe, give this video
a fat, plump Bond thumbs up and

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.110
let me know what are your favorite all-time
breakfast recipes to really

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.770
impress that special someone?

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.670
Oh, yeah, you know, the ones you maybe bust
out twice a year, three times a year, once

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.800
a year, I don't know.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.270
Let me
know in the comments below.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.940
Well, everyone, my time is up.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.000
It's time for Connery to the fly the coop.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.280
Yes, that's right, my [Aston Martin] coop,
if you have to know exactly what

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280
I mean.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280
But here's what we're going to do.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.930
I want you guys to follow Jason
Wrobel.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.670
That's Jason W-R-O-B as in breakfast surprise,
E-L.com.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.230
He's on all
the social media networks, Facebook, Instagram,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.430
Pinterest, blah, blah,
blah, nowhere near as cool as mine.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.210
Well, guys, I'm stepping out, and time
to put these pancakes where the sun don't

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.970
shine, here.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.610
I'll catch you guys
soon, if you're lucky.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.270
Connery out.
