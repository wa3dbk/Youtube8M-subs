Now I add a bit more light to the knife. Against the shadow next to it. So both of them have a better contrast.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:50.000
A tiny highlight on the knife. This makes it stick out even more.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
See, you enter the painting here. At the end of the knife.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You go in there, follow the apple and you make a walk, if you like, through the painting.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.000
Not too bad..

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.000
I am quite happy with this.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Nice composition.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.500
Now I just want to add a shadow here, at the coffeepot, and then I am going to sign.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now, here we are.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.000
We have finished our painting.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.000
I have given you some information to make a simple still life, but this technique can be applied to many different subjects.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And now, it is up to you.
