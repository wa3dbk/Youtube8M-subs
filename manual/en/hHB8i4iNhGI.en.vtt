00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.630
[TYPEWRITER  NOISES]

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.340
RETO MEIER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.370
My name is Reto Meier, and
welcome to This Week in Adroid

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.330
Development for October
15th, 2012.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.260
This week's challenge for
regular viewers, figure out

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.130
which of these shots are live
and which are green screened.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.810
Last week in Android
Development, we celebrated

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.445
tablet week, by releasing new
promotional sections in Google

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:21.390
Play to highlight great
tablet apps.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.450
Developers can check out the
Android Developer blog to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.470
learn more about building
quality tablet apps.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.590
If you want to skip the
unwrapping and jump straight

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.620
to the juicy marrow, check out
the tablet app quality

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.950
checklist to feed on the
knowledge of what it takes to

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.790
build an app that's designed
for the growing number of

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.530
Android tablet users.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.500
We're all about quality here
at Android Developer

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.850
Relations, so we've also
released these Core App

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.260
Quality Guidelines, a checklist
for your release

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.610
process that will ensure your
apps delight rather than

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.890
disappoint.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.230
Continuing our tablet theme
this week, Nick, Roman and

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.730
Adam talked responsive design
in Android Design in Action.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.150
If designing for tablets sounds
like a lot of hard work

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.560
for an undetermined gain, check
out these developer

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.390
stories detailing how
mint.com, TinyCo and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.130
Instapaper took advantage of
the tablet opportunity.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.599
We spoke to the development
teams behind all three apps on

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.870
last Thursday's Developers
Strike Back.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.410
Check out the YouTube video to
learn how these developers

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.310
overcame the challenges to build
successful tablet apps.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.870
On last Friday's App Clinic, we
once again tried to review

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.650
video play apps CineXPlayer,
MX Player and DicePlayer.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.620
Sadly, the sheer overwhelming
anticipation of this long

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.080
awaited broadcast resulted in
an unprecedented demand from

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.870
viewers tuning in live, which
may or may not have caused

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.190
YouTube service to spontaneously
combust.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.450
It was only after we'd completed
our greatest ever

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.760
live performance that we
realized that not only had we

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.770
not be broadcasting, we hadn't
been recording, either.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.040
Determined never to be defeated,
we'll be trying this

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.460
one more time, broadcasting at
the special one-off bonus time

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.980
of 11:30 AM Pacific
time this Tuesday.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.260
Meanwhile, undeterred by our
repeated failures, Nick,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.070
Roman, and Adam will be
broadcasting their UX

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.640
make-over on two of the video
players we seem entirely

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.360
unable to review live on the
App Clinic on this week's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.120
Android Design in Action.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.900
Then on Friday, Ian and I will
once again tempt fate and the

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.780
gods themselves, as we attempt
to broadcast the App Clinic on

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.200
Friday morning, this week
looking at shopping apps.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.510
After the YouTube servers were
brought back to life last

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.090
Friday, Ian joined the
indomitable Dan Galpin for the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.210
Friday Games Review.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.100
Dan will be back again this
Friday, with an as yet

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.610
undetermined sidekick, for
another episode of the Friday

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.960
Games Review.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.710
As always, you can catch our
weekly Office Hours in London,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.470
Mountain View, and Sydney.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.500
And as always, you can find all
of last week's shows and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.940
the schedule for this week at
Google Developers Live.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.100
That's Developers.Googl
e.com/live/Android.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.290
In breaking news this week,
the long-awaited and much

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.710
anticipated new Google Play
Developer Console was released

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.520
today for everyone's
app analysis

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.990
and publishing pleasure.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.240
You can log in and check it out
right, or check out the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.920
post on the Android Developer
blog to find out more details

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.670
before taking the plunge.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.580
In other developer news, last
week saw the launch of free

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.230
trial periods for In-app
subscriptions.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.860
That's all in Android
Development news this week.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.840
As always, we look forward to
you joining us for our many

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.660
live shows.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.790
And remember, before you
came into my life, I

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.260
missed you so bad.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.530
My name is Reto Meier.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.780
Thanks for watching.
