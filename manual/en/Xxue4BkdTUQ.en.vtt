Hi there, I’m Shoo Rayner and welcome to
the Wednesday Drawing Show.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.410
Today we are going to look at circles and
ellipses.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.440
These are two very basic shapes that are really
good to understand and be able to draw without

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.519
thinking.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.920
Drawing a Circle is easy.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.460
Just draw round something circular, use a
compass or learn to draw them freehand.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.909
There’ll be a link at the end of the video
to show you how to improve your freehand circle

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.399
drawing skills.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:31.280
If we tilt a circle, you will see how it changes
its shape into an ellipse.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.860
A circle fits neatly into a square, touching
the centre points of all four lines.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.440
This fact gives us a great reference point
when drawing ellipses.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.730
See what happens when we tilt the circle inside
the square.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.000
We still get an ellipse, but the square changes
shape either into a rectangle, trapeze, add

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.350
perspective and it becomes an irregular quadrangle.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.630
This helps us when trying to draw cylindrical
shapes from different angles.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.290
Using a rectangle we can construct a simple
cylinder shape.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.020
To make the drawing more interesting, rotate
the rectangle into a diamond-like shape.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.600
The shape still represents the square, so
find the visual centres of each line and use

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.530
those points to construct the ellipse in a
new, more three dimensional sort of drawing

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.270
that uses perspective as well.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.440
Well I hope you enjoyed that, and if you did,
make sure you are subscribed for more Wednesday

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.079
Drawing hints and tips.

Either way, keep drawing drawing drawing,
practice practice practice and I’ll see

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.140
you next time.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.130
You take care now, Bye Bye!
