Hey guys, Sean Nalewanyj here of SeanNal.com
and BodyTransformationTruth.com and in this

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.640
video I want to cover a somewhat strange topic,
and discuss why you really need to handle

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.489
your nuts with care, and why if you get too
reckless with them it could very easily throw

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.779
your entire muscle building or fat burning
program off course.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.880
Now nuts and natural nut butters have always
been considered a staple source of healthy

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.260
fat in bodybuilding and fitness diets and
I certainly think that they are a worthwhile

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.010
to include in your overall plan.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.660
However, this is one food source where portion
control is of the utmost importance.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.290
As I've said many times before, if your primary
goal is to alter your body composition, then

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.040
it really makes no difference at all how "healthy"
you're eating if your total daily calorie

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.720
intake does not fall within the proper range
based on your goal.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.890
If you're aiming to lean down but you aren't
maintaining a net calorie deficit over time

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.229
(15 to 20 percent below your maintenance would
be my recommendation) then you're not going

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.719
to lose any body fat at all.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.490
And if you're aiming to bulk up and your net
calorie surplus shoots too high (again, 15

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.240
to 20 percent above maintenance would be my
recommendation there) you're still going to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.140
gain muscle, but you'll also be putting on
excess body fat at an excessive rate.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.619
It's really as simple as that, and the plain
fact is that nuts and nut butters, although

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.969
they are a healthy source of fat, are also
very calorie dense.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.509
You can only eat a very controlled amount
of this stuff before the total calories begin

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.159
shooting too high without you even noticing
it.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.840
Sit down with a bag of mixed nuts and just
start snacking away or start aimlessly piling

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.670
peanut butter onto your toast or into a protein
shake, and in combination with a few other

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.829
small dietary choices that you're making throughout
the day, you could very well be completely

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.409
sabotaging your results altogether.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.750
For example, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter
alone contains around 100 calories.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.640
Most people end up scooping out far more than
this at once though and end up with 200 or

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.400
even 300 calories just from one serving of
peanut butter alone, and that's a lot of calories

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.739
for such a small amount of food.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.040
Peanuts, almonds, cashews and other nuts are
really no different.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.459
For example, just one quarter cup of almonds
equals out to 207 calories.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.170
Go out and measure a quarter cup of almonds
and you'll quickly see what a small amount

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.540
that actually is.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.260
It might sound crazy but a half cup of almonds
per day alone could literally make the difference

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.189
between consistently losing a significant
amount of body fat every single week, and

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.879
making zero progress whatsoever.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.689
So the moral of the story here is simple and
that is, treat your nuts with respect.

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.590
If you're going to include nuts and natural
nut butters in your diet, that's totally fine

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.970
and even recommended, but just make sure that
you measure out your portions carefully and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.780
that it does fit into your total daily calorie
intake as a whole.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.579
In fact, for items like this, a food scale
is probably going to be the ideal choice.

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.040
It might sound obsessive, but it really doesn't
take any more time to weigh them out than

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.040
it does to put them in a measuring cup, and
it will ensure that you're not going overboard

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.140
and that what you consider to be a tablespoon
of peanut butter really is a tablespoon of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.170
peanut butter.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.540
Hard training is important, making the proper
food choices is important, but if your total

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.749
net calorie deficit or total net calorie surplus
is not properly in place, your results will

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.930
definitely be compromised, or even worse they'll
be non-existent.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.360
