00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.340
Let me tell you something, monkey.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.280
In its natural habit, your species is well-known
for being one of the best on the planet at

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.590
extreme motor sports.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.230
It’s a fact...look it up.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.430
And I’ll be damned if I’m gonna sit here
and watch you pretend you can’t drive just

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.100
for the sake of your own survival as a species.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.710
Now drive, monkey!

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.579
Drive!

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.949
Well...at least you went out with dignity.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.129
It’s Nitro Chimp for the iPhone.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.250
Just released to the App Store, Nitro Chimp
is a racing game with an endless course and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950
a plethora of obstacles.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.920
Crates, ramps, spikes, concrete walls, chickens,
they all stand between eternal glory...and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920
your monkey.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.049
Don’t be a chimp pansy.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.200
Go for the extra flip!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.140
So the idea is...you control this bike-riding
monkey and try to get him as far down the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.140
road as possible.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.659
Of course, it’s also about racking up points,
which you can accumulate with an array of

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.960
death-defying shenanigans.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.250
You can do wheelies, backflips, front flips,
handstands, and it’s all done with touch.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.500
You can also play with tilt, if you like...I
don’t know, dumb control schemes.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.360
Obviously, there are also coins all over the
place, and those can be spent on new bikes

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.609
and upgrades.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.100
You can even buy new outfits for your monkey.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.490
I like the fez hat, because it has a degree
of sophistication you normally don’t see

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.840
from this evolutionarily inferior species.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.930
They eat bananas, I have banana pudding.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.700
You tell me who has sh*t figured out.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, the game can get repetitive, and it is
more difficult than maybe it needs to be.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.560
It’s almost impossible to avoid things sometimes.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.540
But hey, death is part of the deal in these
games, and at least this one is fun enough

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.930
to keep you coming back.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.200
Nitro Chimp isn’t at the top of its genre’s
evolutionary ladder, but it’s no Neanderthal,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.730
either.
