00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.780
There are two types of ice that you find in the solar system.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.680
There's the crystalline ice that you will find in your freezer,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.170
but there is also a type of ice called amorphous

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.680
which lacks a regular geometrical pattern for its molecules.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.400
Amorphous ice is not something you naturally find on Earth

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.530
because the temperatures and pressures are much higher on Earth.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.580
The way that we make our ice is we use a small evacuated chamber,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.960
we pump all the air out,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.930
we have a small metal disk about the size of a quarter

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.950
that we cool down to just a few degrees above absolute zero,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.210
we flow a gas on top of it, the gas freezes on the metal,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.190
and we can study the way light reflects off that metal to tell us what the ice is like.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.280
One of the things that makes our lab unique

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.630
is that we can study cosmic ices when they're exposed to high energy protons

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.130
from a Van de Graff accelerator,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.940
so we can bombard our ices with protons that have a million volts of energy.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.480
The data that we measure can be used in order to interpret observations

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.070
that astronomers make of cosmic ices in space.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.110
Most people would put compounds in liquid water at room temperature

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.150
and study the chemistry like that, but

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.980
we're studying the chemistry in ice at extremely low temperatures.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.580
Historically people may not have thought that there could be any chemistry at those temperatures.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.670
We're able to study things in space without leaving the laboratory.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.520
At NASA we have people who build spacecraft and fly to distant places in the solar system.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.570
We collaborate with them, and by combining the laboratory work we do with

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.080
the spacecraft work that NASA does so well, 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.430
we're able to actually study the chemical composition

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.910
of things throughout the solar system and in some cases throughout the galaxy.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.010
