00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.970
Today on this 2010 Dodge Nitro we are going
to install part number 75517 from Draw-Tite.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.250
This will also apply to part number 87426
from Hidden Hitch.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.510
This is what the hitch looks like when it
is on the vehicle.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.840
Now we will go ahead and give you a couple
of measurements that will help you out in

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.390
ing accessories for it, such as a ball mount,
a bicycle rack or a cargo carrier.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.240
From the top of the receiver opening down
to the ground is going to be 17-1/2 inches

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.240
on this particular vehicle.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.100
And from the center of the hitch pin hole
to the outside edge of the bumper is going

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.770
to be 2 inches.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.770
Next we will show you how it gets installed.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.610
0:34
We are going to show you where the hitch mounts

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.960
up onto the vehicle.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.340
We are looking at the driver side part of
the vehicle.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.360
And you can see there are two threaded holes.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.550
Also, we are going to be using the threaded
hole that is behind this bolt as well.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.800
We are going to remove this bolt and that
will be replaced with the hitch hardware.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.530
And it is almost going to be identical on
the passenger side, except this bracket will

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.530
not be there.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.899
Now the next thing you want to do is go ahead
and clean out the threads on the existing

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.899
bolt holes.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.040
We are just going to use a lubricant and a
wire brush to do the job.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.630
Now, even though this is a brand new vehicle,
it still can get dust and grime inside and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.689
over the years you still want to clean these
out.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.130
Alright, and once you can thread in the bolts
you should be good to go.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:52.479
Alright, let us go ahead 
and remove this bolt now.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:05.549
