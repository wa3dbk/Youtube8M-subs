00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.670
-This morning we're going
to do one of the old hairdos

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.070
that we have pictures of
currently on the blog,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.650
but we haven't done a video for.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.680
And it's called the top
knot with a banded pony.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.260
So we joke around in our house.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.250
We say with banded pony.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.330
So that's what
we're doing today.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.230
So to begin with on her hair,
I have just parted the section

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.480
in the center of her
head, just a little one.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.630
And I have just put in a rubber
band off to the right side.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.040
You can see that it's
just slightly off center.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.706
I'm going to take this hair,
and I'm going to wet it down.

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:40.580
Lots of you asked what's
in the spray bottle.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.840
It's just water.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.580
Just gets her hair
wet and helps kind

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.990
of keep the flyaways in a
little bit better for me.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.876
I'm going to twist it.

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:53.820
I'll do that again, so
I'm going to make a knot.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.280
Just like you're going to
knot a piece of string,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.250
only I'm going to
do it with her hair.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.010
Did you see that?

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.260
So then you kind of
push the knot down over,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.929
so it covers that rubber band.

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.220
And then you let the hair fall.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.730
And then I'm going to gather
up the rest of her hair.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.620
Again, this is just water.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.550
It's just helping me
keep the flyaways in.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:22.730
I'm just going to
comb her hair back

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.210
into a little side ponytail.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.360
A side pony.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.040
This one's a great hairdo.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.760
Love it.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.100
Stays in so well all day long.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.565
It's cute, but it's quick.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.555
Put in a rubber band.

00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:55.390
And then I'm going to take
little bit smaller rubber

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.120
bands, and just kind of gather
the hair all the way down.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.810
So depending on the
length of your hair,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.490
you might need more than this.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.740
You might need less than this.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.020
And then just flip the pony over
the shoulder, and there you go.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.680
Add a little tiny spritz of
hairspray for the flyaways.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.980
And you're done.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.030
You have a cute little
topknot on the top

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.930
and a ponytail on the side.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.970
Oh, and then on her, I'm
going to add a flower.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.975
I forgot.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:32.480
If you can't add a
flower, something fancy,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.140
a little bit girly.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.800
This flower matches their school
uniforms, so she's good to go.
