Hi I'm Nancy Siler for today's ask Nancy

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.610
we've got a decorating expert from Wilton who's going to show you some

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.980
great fun project ideas. Hi my name's

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.980
Angie Thayer and I want to share with you some tips
that I use for my annual cookie exchange

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.880
that I have with my family and friends

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.430
you know it's a great time for us to get
together share some cookies have some good

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.550
conversation

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.550
just before the hustle and bustle begins, so to get my guests excited

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.580
what I usually start out with is the
invitation now I revolve the invitation

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.430
around my theme

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.790
it could be white Christmas it could be
you know home for the holidays which is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.000
what I'm doing this year

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.079
so each guest is going to need to bring a cookie
recipe based on a family recipe

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.329
on the invitation you're going to want to indicate

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.329
the date the time and a place of the event as well as

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.219
you know a brief description about what's
going to happen now

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.320
I also like to include how many cookies

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.880
the guests should bring typically for the rule
of thumb is to make

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.319
a dozen cookies per guest plus an extra
dozen for tasting at the event

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:13.830
you'll also want to indicate if you're
going to host a contest it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.399
could be for best dressed most festive
whatever you'd like

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.530
also have your guests bring a recipe
that way they can share it with everyone

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.590
else in the group

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.630
and they can have a book when they go
home now the day of the event

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.819
you're going to have your table all set
up I like to put a little festive

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.000
tablecloth on

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.990
and then just some kind of centerpiece to jazz
it up a little bit

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.679
my family and I did a gingerbread house
perfect for my theme this year which is

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:41.770
home for the holidays

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.789
so my kids and I worked on it together a
couple weeks ago

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.340
so I wouldn't recommend eating it right
now and then

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.069
as your guests come to the party they'll
start filling up your table and it's

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.590
going to be

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.970
a beautiful smorgasbord of cookies
you'll have your

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.110
platter of your dozen cookies for
tasting as well as some tags for the names

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.830
of the cookies

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.220
and then your guests can also bring either
containers to fill your cookies before they

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.840
go home

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.060
or have your guests have premade cookies

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.989
in your boxes you can do pre-printed
boxes that are already festive

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.920
you could decorate your own boxes like I have here are these popcorn boxes

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.209
or you could put it even in just a
basket with some

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.829
decorated parchment paper any of these
are great ideas to use

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.079
and it's just simple so when the event is over they can take their cookies home now

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.230
if you decide to have a contest

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.129
it's great to have some ribbons or
trophies

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.670
or even ornaments to give out like I had
noted before for Best Dressed cookie

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.980
most creative

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.049
most festive those are just some ideas
but be creative with your own ideas

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.870
some additional idea that you're going to want to
have at your party

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.109
it's always great to have holiday music in the
background so

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.310
have a disc already ready you could
have a fireplace going

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.109
have good conversation I like to have a
decorating table

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.859
on the decorating table you can include
some sprinkles sugars

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.329
food writers or even some sparkle gel
this is great opportunity for your guests

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:10.819
to

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.790
decorate some cookies that you have baked that are plain they can swap ideas again

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.840
a great conversation piece and then of
course at the end of the event

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.079
you're going to want to thank them for coming
they put a lot of work into this as well

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:23.709
as you did

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.780
so take some cookie cutters holiday ones
would probably work best

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.099
and then put a thank you tag next to it
that way they may be able to use cookie

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.299
cutters throughout the year

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.139
or maybe for your next cookie exchange
as you can see

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.719
a cookie exchange can be so much fun a
great gathering

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.510
plus it kicks off your season while you get
to go home with enough cookies to last

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.239
throughout the holiday
