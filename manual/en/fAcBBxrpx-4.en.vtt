00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.290
The Shorty George, one of the stable moves
that you should have in your Lindy Hop, East

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.000
Coast Swing, and West Coast Swing repertoire.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.940
Looks like this.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.540
We're going to talk about how to do that.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.020
I'm going to turn my back to you for just
a second, and you're going to try it with

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.020
your right foot.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.590
First, you're going to do a kick-ball-change.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.160
You're going to go kick, then the ball of
that foot, then change to your other foot.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.010
So that's kick, ball change.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.110
Let's try again.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.220
Kick, ball change.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.949
Now you should be good at doing this with
both sides so let's go ahead and try the left

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:35.949
as well.

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:36.949
Kick, ball change.

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.930
One more time, kick, ball change.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.090
Now literally from that point is just walking,
but the difference is is you're going to walk

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.809
kind of like you put your knees together and
let them go side to side.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.860
Rock to the outside edge of one foot to the
inside edge of the other, rock back and forth,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.860
so back and forth.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.250
No swiveling in the feet.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.699
Feet stay forward, just rocking back and forth.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.930
If I were to walk like that, I would take
forward step and have one knee fold behind

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.680
the other so that both knees drop to one side,
and then walk to the other side, both knees

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.790
dropping to one side.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.150
My feet aren't swiveling.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.800
They're staying parallel, knees dropping to
one side.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.390
So it's going to be a kick-ball-change and
then a series of walks.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.440
You're going to go kick, ball, this change
both knees drop to my left, and then I walk

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.960
to my right, and then I walk to my left.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.070
If I were to start that with my left foot,
that would go kick, ball, drop to my right

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.230
change, and then do the swivels, excuse me,
the shorties.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.980
You're going to go kick, ball walk, walk,
walk.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.960
Now if you look from the side I want to be
kind of over my feet a little bit, so when

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.440
I go kick, ball change I'm over my feet as
my knees fold both to the same direction.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.700
Again, practice your kick-ball-change.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.780
Practice your walk.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.210
Put your knees together so they go side to
side.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.479
And you combine the three things - kick-ball-change,
walking, keeping your knees together.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.190
Looks like this - kick, ball change, walk,
walk.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.790
From the side - kick, ball change, walk, walk.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.540
You can go ahead and gesture your hands.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.340
Kick, ball change, you can gesture your hands
down as that happens, and we have a Shorty

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.340
George.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:43.310
We're going to go ahead and try that to music.
