Hi, Today I am making homemade pumpkin spice latte. 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.110
In a mini sauce pan, add in 1/2 cup of whole milk, 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.910
1 tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk, 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.410
1/8 teaspoon of pumpkin spice, 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.820
1 tablespoon of pumpkin puree, 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.630
and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.430
Over medium heat, heat the milk stirring a little just before it starts to boil.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.720
Out of heat, pour in 1/2 cup of strongly brewed hot coffee.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.630
Now you can taste and add more sweetened condensed milk or brown sugar for your liking.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.220
Pumpkin spice latte is even better with whipped cream 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.500
and ground nutmeg or cinnamon on top.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.430
Bon appetit!

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.530
Wake me up anytime with a cup of hearty pumpkin spice latte in fall.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.996
Thank you for watching. Bye for now!
