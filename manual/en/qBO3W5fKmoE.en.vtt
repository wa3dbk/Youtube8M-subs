Anthony: Hey, this Anthony, with RevZilla
TV, where you can watch, decide and ride.

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.650
Welcome to our Avon Tire Guide and Brand Overview
at RevZilla.com.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.539
So, in this video, I'm going to walk through
the five main styles of Avon tire.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.240
We're going to talk about the application,
hopefully give you a starting point, if you're

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.130
starting your tire search, of what you could
immediately home in on, to begin to further

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.300
educate yourself, and find the right tire,
within the Avon family.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.750
Depending on the riding style, your budget,
the application, hopefully you can jump right

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.370
in then and start to walk through different
individual product review videos, for the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.599
different styles of tires.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.690
So you can learn a little bit more about them.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.620
So really, five key styles.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.860
The first I'm going to start with, on my right,
these are my sport tires.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.400
There's a few different families here.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.329
The first is a Storm 2 Ultra.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.130
The Storm 2 Ultra is an all-season, high performance
tire for sport and sport touring applications,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.030
in your common sport bike rim sizes.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.600
So, it's a mixture of mileage, performance,
and wet grip, built here, into the Storm 2.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.850
This is a more recent addition to the line,
and it's one of the more popular tires, for

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.780
those of you that don't want to go to the
track.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.080
Moving into the 3D Ultra Series, here's where
we have our family of really three tires,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.269
that are 3D Ultra.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.150
And 3D Ultra really speaks to this new 3D
siping technology, that you see on the tire.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.180
It's technology that adds grip, heat distribution
and stability to the carcass, and you have

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.370
three tires within that line.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.140
You have the 3D Ultra Sport, which is your
90/10 street to track tire.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.610
The 50/50, which is the 3D Ultra Super Sport,
and the 3D Ultra Extreme, which is a full

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.900
on, track day tire, with the least amount
of tread, using multiple compounds and single

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.060
compound tires.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.240
Full video breakdown on all three of those,
check it out.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.880
But that's going to be your aggressive, high
performance, track day tire from Avon, is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.870
that 3D Ultra family of tire.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.790
Moving into some of our other types of tires.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.490
The first up, for the cruiser family, we have
the Venom Tire, as well as the Cobra Tire.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.170
And the Venom comes into, even that Venom-R,
which you've seen on some of those bikes,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.530
we joke it's a kickstand eliminator, 333 in
the width.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.229
Some of those monster cruiser, rear tires
you see, are the Venom.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.490
It's an upgraded cruiser for heavy bikes.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.000
Think Valkyrie, VTX, Goldwing.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.509
Some of the bigger, cruiser, V-Twin, or metric
cruiser bikes.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.430
And again, you're getting upgraded performance
in handling, in grip and longevity, out of

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.370
the Avon Venom and Cobra series of tires.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.560
Moving down from there, and remember, we have
videos on all of these.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.869
You see your Roadrider.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.670
Your Roadrider is a vintage classic tire,
that comes in 33 different sizes.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.500
One of the key components, besides the fact
that, I believe, it's available on radial

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.290
and bias, is that you also have the ability
to have good performance with using newer

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.010
technologies, but keep your vintage and classic
look.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.560
There's also the AM26 TT version, this tire,
which is the race inspired version, with speed

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.790
ratings up to V.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.030
So again, classic vintage tire, with high
speed ratings.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.599
It will work really well, in a myriad of different
sizes.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.510
And then last up in the Avon family, besides
the dirt tires that they do, you have the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.510
Distanzia.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.580
And really this is part of the dual sport
family.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.500
This is the more popular dual sport tire.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.780
This is for big bikes, think 1000cc, 17 and
18 inch rim sizes.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.650
This is a 90/10 tire.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.850
The nice chevron pattern gives you better
wear, better grip in the corners, but it will

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.150
also allow you to move a good amount of soil,
without squaring it off in the longer term.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.610
Think big bike, 1000cc, your GS's, your KTM
990 Adventures, your 1000cc V-Stroms.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.210
Now, if you're moving down to that 600 Class,
if you're a KLR or you're a V-Strom guy, look

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.850
at the Gripster from Avon, which is going
to be your smaller bike dual sport tire.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.849
Now remember, as I said a couple times in
this video, we have videos specifically on

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.150
all these different families, and specific
tires.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.560
You're going to want to look at those.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.560
We talk about prices.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.569
We talk about rim sizes.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.510
We talk further about the nuances in the technology
and the wear patterns of these tires.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.569
But really in this video, we wanted to give
you enough to immediately, if you're a cruiser

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.620
guy, you're going to narrow the other four,
and you're going to immediately jump into

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.739
the Cobra and Venom family of tires, as an
example, and you can start right there.

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.620

family of tires or any of the tires at RevZilla.com,
