When I was a child
I was fascinated
by the spontaneity

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.600
and the freedom of the clown.

For me, the clown,
it was a whole human being

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.200
in the sense of humility,
of freedom, of dignity,
and the playfulness, yes.

When I was a boy
I loved to play the drum.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.580
And when I was 18
I did this drum show,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.780
and then there was this moment
between me and the audience.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.310
People started to laugh at me,
and it was not my music.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.460
It was something in me
what they kind of found funny.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.820
And this was really
the moment when I felt,
"Oh, this is nice

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.820
to make people laugh."

It was a certain time
in my life—
it was very difficult for me.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.900
And the clown was something
really which contained

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.820
this freedom to overcome
the seriousness
of my surroundings.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.570
I started to be fascinated
with the poetic side
of the clown.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.540
This figure of the Pierrot,
who is in love with the moon,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.140
and he's always
melancholic a bit.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.840
It related much
to a certain side of me

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.650
which was sad—
which was
kind of full of longing.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.730
It's a very important side
for the clown
because it's something

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.390
like my own poetic space
that is not dependent on others.

The biggest challenge for me
is to hold the confidence,
not to be

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.590
disturbed by what a clown
ought to be.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.270
You need a certain costume,
but it's not enough.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.500
You have to have
a certain state of being,
a certain state of innocence.

The clown is
the master of failure.

He loves the fiasco;
he's going into
one fiasco to the other.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.350
And when you want
to do something funny,
it's most of the time
it's not funny.
