00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.139
Moderator: The speedometry curriculum has
been designed using the 5E Model of instruction.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.339
The 5 Es stand for Engage, Explore, Explain,
Elaborate –

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:21.649
and Evaluate. So let's dig into these 5 Es.
Kids cannot learn if they're not engaged.

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:28.110
The speedometry curriculum uses excellent
videos with kids actually seeing real cars

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.930
scaled up going down ramps –

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.640
to get their attention and noticing phenomena
that they are going to ask questions about.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
The Engage is so important in the 5E model
to assess prior knowledge of students and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.550
also to use the experience from the Engage
to come up with scientifically-oriented –

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.350
questions that they will then investigate
as we move to the next phase. The next phase

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.220
is the Explore phase. Here is an opportunity
for the kids to work together to have a shared

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.579
experience around the scientific phenomena
that they're investigating.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.570
The data that students collect here and the
observations and conclusions that they draw

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.570
from the Explore is what you bring into the
explain phase. An important part of doing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.850
science is that the explain comes after the
initial Explore.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.600
So now that your kids have explored a scientific
phenomena, you can now as the teacher facilitate

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.049
learning during this Explain phase. This is
the time to introduce the scientific vocabulary,

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.810
any particular skills and mathematics –

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.490
any formats that you would want to follow
in terms of literacy skills and lab reports.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.650
The Explain phase is very important in helping
kids make connections between the Explore

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.830
and the scientific vocabulary. The fourth
E is called –

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.030
Elaboration. This is a very important phase
in teaching and learning. This give kids an

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.750
opportunity to apply what they’ve learned
to a new context, and that gives kids an opportunity

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.270
to dig deeper into the content and then to
apply their learning –

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.290
to some new context. The fifth and final E
is the Evaluation stage. The speedometry curriculum

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.420
allows kids to assess their own learning as
they've created models and revised their models

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.480
to explain the scientific phenomena, and you
as a teacher to understand –

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.700
through the use of looking at the students'
projects and their presentations what they've

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.060
learned in terms of the math skills, the literacy
skills, and the science skills and concepts

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.670
that this curriculum has been designed around.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.930
Do you have any questions about the 5E Model?

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.379
Teacher: Yes. I have a large classroom, and I'm just
concerned about during the explore stage,

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.950
how do you deal with so many children during
that phase of the 5Es?

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.040
Moderator: I think the speedometry curriculum –

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.030
is engaging curriculum. And when kids are
engaged, they'll stay on task. We've also

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.150
suggested group structures and group roles
so that every student knows what they're responsible

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.849
for doing throughout the lesson. But again,
the most important thing in learning is engagement.

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.510
Teacher: As you know as a teacher, we always have a
lot of things going on. What if I run out

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.959
of time? Can I skip steps of the 5E Model?
And how will that impact the units?

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.650
Moderator: Skipping one of the 5 Es is not recommended.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.010
All phases of the 5E Model are important for
student learning. We have to first start with

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.840
an Engage so the kids can connect the material
to their lives. Kids need to learn to do science

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.250
and ask questions, and this curriculum allows
kids to do that.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.430
In the era of next-gen standards and common
core, there are going to fewer topics to study.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.340
So I think this curriculum is going to allow
the depth of the understanding that kids truly

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.830
need to understand science and engineering
practices, as well as integrating –

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.709
in literacy opportunities and mathematical
skills.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.390
Teacher: Will this work for all the different types
of kids in my classroom?

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.519
Moderator: Inquiry-based approaches to learning allow
the teacher to put students in groups where

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.159
there's many more opportunities to differentiate
learning.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.519
Kids can help each other. Teacher acts as
facilitator. And truly, you're the one that

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.769
knows your students. So we recommend that
you take this curriculum and really understand

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.860
this 5E model and make it work for your students.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.870
