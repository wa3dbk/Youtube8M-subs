NATHAN MCCULLOUGH: Hi, my name is Nate McCullough
on behalf of Expert Village. In these clips,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.929
we're going to talk about the proper way to
remove and replace your vehicle's thermostat.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.970
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper way to remove your vehicle's radiator

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.300
cap and release the vehicle's drain cock to
drain the coolant out of our cooling system.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.800
The radiator cap is normally located on top,
it'll either be on the left or the right side

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.880
of the radiator. This one happens to be on
the right. Even with the engine marginally

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.160
cool down, you're going to want to use a shop
towel and to place over the cap. The cap is

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.720
spring-loaded in upward position, that's how
the lock works. You're going to want to press

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.530
down on it and release the cap. The reason
why I used the rag, just in case, the engine

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.420
is hot enough to still have pressure under
the cap, this rag will help deflect any possible

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:07.100
hot coolant that may want to spray on you.
It's very important to do this. The drain

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.590
cock for your cooling system is going to be
located in either the bottom left or the bottom

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.740
right corner of your radiator. This one happens
to be located on the left-hand side and is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.549
accessible from underneath the vehicle just
below the bumper. You can reach up and grab

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.109
a hold of it. That's where I'm going to reach.
If you can see both bottom corners, you can

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.409
identify it pretty easily. If not, you may
have to actually get under the vehicle and

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.329
look for it. What I'll do is remove this one,
take it completely out and give you a close

00:01:40.329 --> 00:02:03.919
up so you know what you're looking for. And
that is the proper way to unscrew your vehicle's

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:09.899
drain cock. And as you can see, we have our
bucket underneath there catching our coolant.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.379
Your vehicle is going to have to drain for
approximately 10 to 15 minutes. This is your

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.110
vehicle's radiator drain cock right here.
It pretty much inserts into the radiator.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.380
You can see it's threaded and it screws down
and with its mickey mouse here and tells it's

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.810
tight and seals the bottom of the cooling
system.
