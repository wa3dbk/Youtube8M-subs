00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.270
My name is Christine Marquette and I'm a registered
dietitian with the Austin Regional Clinic

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.530
and I'm going to talk to you about how long
before the effects of apple cider vinegar

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.370
are shown. This is kind of a broad question
and it really depends on what type of effect

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.529
you are talking about. For example apple cider
vinegar does tend to be very tart so that

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.839
effect of feeling that tartness that sourness
you might get that little look on your face

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.680
that's going to be immediate as soon as you
taste it. Somebody who is trying to use apple

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.609
cider vinegar for weight loss, they are going
to be waiting a long time because it doesn't

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:38.780
necessarily help with weight loss. One of
the studies that showed a modest effect took

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.199
four weeks and there was only a two pound
weight loss at the end of those four weeks.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.370
So again that's one study, it's about the
only study that's shown very, very much effect

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.660
for weight loss in particular and again it
was a very modest effect. As far as diabetes

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.199
goes, there's actually more research being
done in that area and that's something that

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.220
did show more of an immediate effect in some
people. And some of the studies typically

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.960
the dose that was used was two tablespoons
immediately before a meal. And in these people

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.000
they did see a reduction in their blood glucose
values after their meal as compared to the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.300
days that they ate similar meal without the
vinegar. So that was a fairly immediate reaction

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.410
just how ever long it took them to actually
eat their particular meal. They waited two

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.000
hours after and then they tested their blood
glucose and it was a few points lower. I believe

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.340
the drop was between four and six percent
in the groups that had been studied. So for

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.940
diabetes glucose in some of the preliminary
research it had shown an effect within a couple

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.880
of hours. So again it kind of depends on what
effect you are looking at and the other thing

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.530
to keep in mind for somebody if you do have
diabetes you don't want to go out and try

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.450
to treat yourself just using apple cider vinegar.
Remember these are very preliminary studies,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.390
there's only been a few done. There isn't
enough actual hard evidence to go out and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.700
recommend using two tablespoons of apple cider
vinegar to actually treat your diabetes.
