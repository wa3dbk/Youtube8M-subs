And we're back. If you're just joining

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.859
Loss and Redemption.'

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.820
Hello? Caller number #2 you're on the air. "Heyyy Whatsuppp" 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.540
"Thanks for taking my call." Thanks for
joining us. You're calling in from where?

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.119
"Jerusalem, my name's Harry. I guess it's more woolly than hairy"

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.369
okay Harry from Jerusalem, let's hear your
story

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.010
"You got it man. You know that saying 'the
grass is always greener on the other

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.710
side'?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.900
I do. "Well it's the truth man. See the other
day I got the urge to roam

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.669
and let me tell you life was good."  The grass really was greener?

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.770
"For real man. I mean it wasn't just the
grass was greener--

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.149
it was the whole scene! fun times away from the
flock

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.680
it was awesome, man." But something tells me this doesn't end well?

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.789
"It didn't end well for my freedom if that's what you mean.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.090
See I'm out there enjoying the world's best
pasture when shepherd came striding over the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.899
nearest hill."

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.210
Looking for you? "Looking for me man. I
mean, what?!

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.160
the guy has I don't know, at least 90 something other sheep to look after and he still finds

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.359
the time for a search and rescue mission."

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.839
Rescue? So there was trouble? "Not that I
could see."

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.740
"duddeeee" I bleated, "I'm fine what's the rush?"
it was nice in my little green pasture

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.270
there was clover and aw shoot i'm no
foodie but it was green and it was good

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.400
plus the views were rad." We're all waiting
for the shoe to drop!

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.950
"I'll tell you what happened next. Dude
tossed me up on his shoulders like I was

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.740
some kind of animal

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.110
then he carried me off whistling all
the rugged way

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.070
and I mean rugged. All you listeners out
there here's the real story

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.140
the grass wasn't greener. Up there on shepherd's shoulders I saw something else

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.740
the pasture was whack!" You'd been in danger and you hadn't even known it?

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.420
"I was practically wolf-bait man!" So he left all the others

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.340
just to save you? "I guess I don't give
shepherd enough credit most of the time

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.740
normally it's like, come on man!

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.729
Why do I always have to play by your rules but
Shepherd

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.909
he keeps on watching out for me. Actually, it's more than that. He shepherd's me really.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.799
I'm not just being cute. Even when I don't
know I've lost my way,

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.369
he's there." Hmm that's love. "I'll say
this:

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.450
with a shepherd like him obedience is a
gift, not a burden. Which means that instead of

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.259
bringing me down,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.959
Shepherd is really there to help me be, well, the best version of me."

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.010
So you're not just one in a hundred? "No way man, I'm his sheep

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.370
and i'm home."
