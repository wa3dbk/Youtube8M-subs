&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Amitbah Bachchan and I'm from
India. I live in Mumbai. I'm an actor and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.990
I've been an actor for the last 40 years.
I've done about approximately 150 films and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.580
I'm very honored to her in Davos. I've been
invited here because there was Economic Forum

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.740
is very kindly decided to honor me with their
Crystal Award for my achievement and contribution

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:44.140
in arts [inaudible]. I really don't know how
credible that is as far as I'm concerned because

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.760
I just look upon myself as just another actor.
If I have been able to contribute in some

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.999
manner to the community of entertainment in
my country then I feel very honored to be

00:00:53.999 --> 00:01:00.999
here in Davos and very humbly accept this
award that they are giving me. I've just been

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.840
here a few hous and therefore it's very difficult
for me to make out what Davos is all about.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.760
One reads about it, one's heard about it and
has had the opportunity to very briefly to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.710
move around and I find a great amount of energy
and interest among people from different walks

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.600
of life, from businesses, from entertainment
and politics, talking, meeting, discussing

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.600
issues and I think that this is a wonderful
wonderful occassion. For the entire world

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.320
to almost converge in one city, one center,
to be able to air and give their opinions

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.320
on views that effect all of us. Whether we
live in India or the United States of America

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.560
or Switzerland and we all have our point of
views and this is an extremely important form

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.150
for all of us to express ourselves. I know
that we have opportunities individually to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.150
do something like this, but I think once all
of us get together and have a forum, a common

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.100
forum, where we can virtually talk to each
other across the table this lends a lot more

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.250
credibility. It also becomes a lot more important
because what is talked of, what is discussed

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.250
here goes out to the rest of the universe.
I hope that this conference, this forum does

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.069
exactly that. I hope valuable topics are discussed
and I hope that those that listen in are able

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.340
to gather something, imbibe something from
this and make it a success. If there's something

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.020
that needs to be talked about in entertainment,
I'm here and if you have any questions, please

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.160
put them forward. Thank you.
