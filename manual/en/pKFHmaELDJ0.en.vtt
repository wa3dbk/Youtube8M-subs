00:00:00.151 --> 00:00:01.753
- (speaks in raspy voice) Okay,
how do you focus this thing?

00:00:01.753 --> 00:00:04.288
Hello, as you can
probably tell, I'm Batman.

00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:06.259
And while I'm not technically supposed to

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.694
be using this camera, I,
I, I'm using this camera.

00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:10.361
Why?

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:11.863
Because the most romantic holiday

00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:13.164
of the year is upon us.

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:14.799
The August bank holiday.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.336
In celebration of this
beautiful, wonderful,

00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:20.672
holiday of love, I thought
I would teach you guys

00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:24.043
how to make a love letter
with your words and your hands

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:27.980
and a pen and some paper, yeah.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.649
(romantic music)

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:32.618
So when you're starting your love letter,

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:35.087
you're going to want to
open with a salutation.

00:00:35.087 --> 00:00:38.589
My personal favorite salutation
for all of my letters is:

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.860
Guuuuuuuurl.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.996
I like to go between six to
eight u's in the word gurl.

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:46.098
After your salutation,

00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:49.234
you're gonna want to open with
a simple declaration, like,

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:51.136
"I love you very much."

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:53.238
Simple, to the point, real.

00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:55.673
Next I like to do a personal compliment.

00:00:55.673 --> 00:00:57.944
For example, in my letter, I write,

00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:00.879
"Your face is very much like not a crime."

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.115
"A good thing that I want to cherish."

00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:04.349
If you don't think that's beautiful,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.185
you can get the hell out of my face.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:08.053
The next thing that is
very important to remember,

00:01:08.053 --> 00:01:10.455
make statements about
what a great team you are.

00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:11.623
Like the Justice League,

00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:13.858
except for better movies about you guys.

00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:14.825
So what I wrote is,

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.962
"When we are together,
we are an ideal team."

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:22.066
"You, a Sagittarius, me
a dark enigma from which

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.935
no criminal can escape."

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:27.004
You can also include a
romantic quote in your letter.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.207
Now the key to picking a good quote is

00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:31.175
finishing it with a wink,

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:34.514
and writing the word
"wink" after the quote.

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:37.584
Do not use a winky face,
because that is cheesy.

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:39.918
For example, if you were to quote

00:01:39.918 --> 00:01:41.453
the Jonas brothers you would say,

00:01:41.453 --> 00:01:42.920
"To quote the Jonas brothers,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.389
when you look me in the eyes

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.091
and tell me that you love me,

00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:49.394
everything's alright, wink."

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:50.528
Another example,

00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:51.998
our love is so big,

00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:55.100
it's like the boat from
Jaws can't hold it.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.202
To quote Jaws,

00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:58.402
"We're gonna need a bigger boat, wink."

00:01:58.402 --> 00:02:00.438
Or, to quote Albert Camus,

00:02:00.438 --> 00:02:01.973
"It is necessary to fall in love

00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:04.743
if only to provide an
alibi for all the random

00:02:04.743 --> 00:02:07.612
despair you're going
to feel anyway, wink."

00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:09.715
It's very easy to be romantic

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:11.350
with somebody else's words.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.318
Which is why I recommend including

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:15.520
your aspirations for the future

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.355
with your loved one in your letter.

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:18.890
For example, you might write,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.092
"I love you so much,

00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:24.129
one day I hope to avenge
the death of my parents."

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.887
See, that's perfect.

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:29.333
I like to close my letters
with an inside joke.

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.035
It's important to have a sense of humor

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:33.271
and end the letter on a smile.

00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:34.773
For example, you might say,

00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:35.841
"You're the bomb,

00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:38.643
I'll never leave you at
a bus station in Deluth,

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:40.845
alone, so that I can go fight crime

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:43.115
without worrying about your well being,

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:46.185
because nothing happens in Deluth. Amen."

00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:48.120
Wait, don't close with Amen.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.522
That just came out weird,

00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:50.589
I don't know why I said that.

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:54.092
(romantic music)

00:02:54.092 --> 00:02:54.959

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.194
you can click "Subscribe"

00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:58.630
and see more of Megan's videos every week.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.834
You can also find her on social media,

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:02.366
and you can find another video

00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:05.103
in the bottom left hand
corner of your screen.

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:06.404
Megan will be back next week,

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:08.373
probably swooning over me

00:03:08.373 --> 00:03:10.675
and my great letter
that we wrote together.

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:11.843
Goodbye.
