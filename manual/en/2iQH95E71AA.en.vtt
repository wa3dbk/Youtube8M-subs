WELL, YOU KNOW, "GOOD TIMES"
STARTED IN THE '70s --

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:22.055 line:0%
'75, WE STARTED ON THE AIR.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.923 line:0%
AND SO, AT THAT TIME,

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:27.760 line:0%
BEING THAT WE WERE THE FIRST
BLACK AFRICAN FAMILY SHOW

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:29.529 line:0%
EVER ON TELEVISION,

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.665 line:0%
I WAS THE FIRST BLACK FEMALE
TEENAGER EVER ON TELEVISION,

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.867 line:0%
IT WAS LIKE
WE HAD GREAT WRITERS,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.670 line:0%
BUT THEY WERE MOSTLY WHITE,

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:41.974 line:0%
AND WE HAD TO HELP THEM
TO WRITE FOR US.

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.644 line:0%
THEY WERE GREAT WRITERS,
WONDERFUL WRITERS.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.446 line:0%
THEY COULD WRITE A SHOW
IN A MINUTE.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.781
BUT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR US
TO HELP THEM WITH THE LINGO

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.750
AND WHAT WE WOULD DO
AND WHAT WE WOULDN'T DO,

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:54.020
SO WE HAD TO DO THAT TO MAKE
THE SHOW WHAT IT WAS, YOU KNOW?

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:57.957
WELL, BECAUSE THE SHOW ALWAYS
DEALT WITH DIFFERENT ISSUES,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.027
AS DID ALL
OF NORMAN LEAR'S SHOWS,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.996
BUT ESPECIALLY BEING
THAT THIS IS THE BLACK SHOW,

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.898
THE AMERICAN BLACK SHOW,

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:09.202
WE CAME ACROSS
A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.738
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO DIDN'T LIKE THE SHOW

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.874
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO MUCH LIKE --

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.609
I WOULD SAY THEY THOUGHT

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.679
J.J. WAS ACTING TOO BUFFOONISH
OR WHATEVER.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.013 line:0%
BUT WE HAD ESTHER ROLLE,

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:24.350 line:0%
AND SHE -- I LOVED HER,
I MEAN, VERY, VERY MUCH.

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.219 line:0%
IT WAS LIKE MY SECOND MOM.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:31.657 line:0%
BUT SHE MADE SURE
THAT WE KEPT THE SHOW IN LINE.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.694
IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN ANYONE
WAS GOING OVER THE BARREL

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.163
OR OVER THE TOP,
SHE WOULD BRING US BACK.

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:39.932
SO, IF J.J. WAS GOING
A LITTLE BIT TOO WILD,

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:42.168
SHE WOULD SAY,
"I DON'T WANT THAT.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:44.036
YOU KNOW, LET'S KEEP IT
STRAIGHT," YOU KNOW?

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.508
HE COULD BE FUNNY, BUT NOT A
FOOL, AND SHE MADE SURE OF THAT.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.610
SO I GIVE HER A LOT OF CREDIT

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:54.547
FOR THE WAY THE SHOW WAS
AND THAT IT'S STILL A SUCCESS.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.817 line:0%
WELL, YOU KNOW, AT THE TIME,
IT WAS A GROUNDBREAKING SHOW.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.419 line:0%
THE WORLD WAS REALLY READY
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.221 line:0%
ESPECIALLY
THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.657 line:0%
WE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT BEFORE --

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.527
OUR PEOPLE ON TELEVISION --
A DAD, A MOM, KIDS --

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.263
YOU KNOW, WHOLE THING --
NEIGHBOR -- THE WHOLE NINE.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.298
SO, IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.933
AND WE TAUGHT A LOT.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.702
OUR SHOW TAUGHT
A LOT OF LESSONS.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:20.506
AND EVEN TO THIS DAY,
I HEAR PEOPLE COME UP TO ME

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.342
AND SAY, "OH, MY GOODNESS,
IT TAUGHT A LOT OF LESSONS.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.379
I WATCHED IT. MY MOM WATCHED IT.
MY KIDS ARE WATCHING IT."

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.115
SO IT'S LIKE A LEGACY
THAT'S GOING DOWN,

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:30.883
AND I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:34.554
THE FACT THAT WE WERE IN GHETTO,
AND WE MADE IT,

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:38.491
AND WE STAYED TOGETHER,
AND WE HAD MORALS AND ETHICS

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:40.693
AGAINST THE ODDS, YOU KNOW --

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:44.797
IT MADE THE SHOW LOVED
BY SO MANY PEOPLE,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.001
NOT JUST AFRICAN-AMERICANS,
BUT ALL PEOPLE

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.337
WHO WERE STRUGGLING
AND STILL ARE STRUGGLING.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.774
"GOOD TIMES" DID PAVE THE WAY
BECAUSE IT WAS A SHOW

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:58.244
THAT LET PEOPLE KNOW
THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT, YOU KNOW?

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:01.047
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT,
YOU CAN MAKE IT.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.150
AND LIKE THE THELMA CHARACTER --

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.419
YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS A POSITIVE CHARACTER,

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.354
AMONG THE ODDS, YOU KNOW?

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:11.857
LIKE MY REAL FATHER
ALWAYS TOLD US GROWING UP,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.261
"WHAT'S AROUND YOU
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE IN YOU."

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:17.630
AND I CARRY THAT WITH ME
ALL THE TIME.

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:20.666
AND I DID -- AS A YOUNGSTER,
I DID ON "GOOD TIMES,"

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.868
AND I TRIED TO BRING THAT
TO THAT CHARACTER,

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.671 line:0%
THAT SHE COULD STILL
BE EDUCATED,

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.607 line:0%
A GOOD GIRL WITH MORALS,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.077 line:0%
TRYING TO BE THE BEST
SHE CAN BE, YOU KNOW?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.312
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT'S AROUND HER.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:34.647
A LOT OF THELMA IS ME,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.416
'CAUSE I WAS THAT GIRL
IN THE GHETTO, YOU KNOW,

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.852
TRYING TO MAKE IT,
TAKING DANCE CLASSES,

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:43.089
TRYING TO STAY IN SCHOOL,
YOU KNOW, NOT FOOLING AROUND.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:46.292
I GREW UP IN BROOKLYN
IN BROWNSVILLE IN THE PROJECTS.

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:49.161
THE WAY I WAS RAISED,
AND IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:53.499
THERE WERE A LOT OF DRUGS,
A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THAT,

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:59.438
A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON,
AND I STAYED FOCUSED.

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.675
I GREW UP AROUND IT,
SO I WASN'T SURPRISED ABOUT IT.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.845
SO, WHEN I WENT TO HOLLYWOOD
AND ALL THAT STUFF WAS GOING ON,

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.781
IT DIDN'T FAZE ME [Chuckling]
BECAUSE I WAS USED TO IT.

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:11.050
I KNOW HOW TO FOCUS
AROUND THAT STUFF.

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.418
SO IT DIDN'T EXCITE ME.

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.920
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS
IN THE "IN" CROWD,

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:16.489
THE "OUT" CROWD -- NOTHING.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:18.090
I WAS BERN NADETTE, YOU KNOW?

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:19.392
AND I STAYED FOCUSED.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:23.996
WELL, MY DAD WAS AN ACTIVIST
IN THE COMMUNITY, YES,

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.300
AND, YOU KNOW, HE WAS, LIKE,
A MANAGER IN A STORE.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.567
I WON'T NAME THE STORE.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.503
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.405
BUT HE WAS BASICALLY
AN ACTIVIST.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.439
HE WAS A MUSICIAN.

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.107
HE PLAYED THE SAXOPHONE.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.611
HE DID A LOT OF DIFFERENT GIGS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:40.846
AND HE WAS DETERMINED
TO MAKE SURE

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.648
HIS CHILDREN WERE EDUCATED --

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.351
THAT WAS VERY MUCH PART
OF HIS WHOLE THING.

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:47.019
AND BEING AN ACTIVIST,

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:50.489
HE MADE SURE THAT
THE RIGHT THINGS STAYED RIGHT

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:53.326
AND THAT HE FOUGHT FOR PEOPLE
TO HAVE THEIR RIGHTS.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:57.229
WE WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL,
AND MY BROTHER AND I --

00:04:57.262 --> 00:04:59.231
BOTH MY BROTHERS AND I.

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:02.335
AND I THINK I WAS IN
THE SECOND GRADE OR THE THIRD --

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:03.636
I WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.638
MY BROTHER WAS
IN THE KINDERGARTEN --

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.573
SOMETHING LIKE THAT --
FIRST GRADE.

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:10.176
AND WE HAD TWO FRIENDS.

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:13.713
I WON'T SAY THEIR NAMES,
BUT THEY WERE ITALIAN.

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:19.218
AND I LOVED MY GIRLFRIEND,
AND MY BROTHER LOVED HIS FRIEND,

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.619
WHICH WAS HER BROTHER.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:23.122
AND WE WERE THE BEST FRIENDS
IN SCHOOL.

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:26.359
SO, ONE DAY -- SHE LIVED, LIKE,
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:29.428
AND ONE DAY, SHE SAID,
"COME ON OVER FOR LUNCH."

00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:31.597
SO, WE WENT OVER FOR LUNCH,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.668
AND WHILE WE WERE THERE,
HER DAD CAME IN.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:39.572
AND I COULD SEE, LIKE, ALL THE
COLOR DRAINED OUT OF HER FACE.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.240
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:42.975
AND SHE'S LIKE, "COME ON.
WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:43.976
WE HAVE TO LEAVE."

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.711
HE DIDN'T WANT US IN HIS HOUSE.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:47.346
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALLY --

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.983
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, BECAUSE
THEY WERE SO SWEET AND NICE.

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:53.686
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
SHE HAD PARENTS LIKE THAT.

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.355
AND THAT HURT ME SO BAD --
I NEVER FORGOT IT.

00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:58.691
ANOTHER INCIDENT,
WHEN I WAS REALLY YOUNG --

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:02.027
I WAS ABOUT 5, AND THERE WERE --

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.197
SHE WAS JAPANESE,
AND HER HUSBAND WAS BLACK.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.168
AND MOST IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,
IN MY BUILDING WAS ALL BLACKS.

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.670
BUT IT WAS A JAPANESE LADY,
AND HER HUSBAND WAS BLACK.

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:13.572
AND SHE HAD THREE BEAUTIFUL,
YOU KNOW,

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:15.841
JAPANESE-BLACK CHILDREN
WITH LONG, BEAUTIFUL HAIR --

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:16.842
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:18.010
AND WE WERE IN THE ELEVATOR.

00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:19.211
I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS.

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:20.913
AND MY MOM WAS THERE,
AND HER MOM WAS THERE.

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:24.650
AND ANOTHER LITTLE GIRLFRIEND
CAME FROM ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:26.051
AND SHE WAS VISITING.

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:27.453
AND SHE WAS BIRACIAL.

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.755
AND SO SHE WAS HALF --
VERY LIGHT,

00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:32.958
AND WITH LONG, PRETTY --
AND I WAS ME, YOU KNOW?

00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:35.361
AND SO, WE WERE ALL
IN THE ELEVATOR.

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:38.097
AND THE ONE GIRL SAID
TO THE OTHER GIRL --

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.632
HER NAME WAS BUBBLES --

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:42.234
SHE SAID, "BUBBLES,
I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU

00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:43.803
TO COME OVER FOR LUNCH."

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:46.138
SO, SHE WAS INVITED TO LUNCH.

00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:50.075
AND I WAS STANDING THERE,
AND I SAID,

00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:53.813
"WELL, I WANT TO COME.
CAN I COME?"

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:57.716
AND MY MOTHER TAPPED ME,
AND I SAID, "NO, CAN I COME?"

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:58.784
AND MY MOTHER TAPPED ME.

00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:00.319
AND WHEN WE GOT
OFF THE ELEVATOR,

00:07:00.352 --> 00:07:01.620
I SAID, "MOMMY, I WANT TO GO."

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:05.090
SHE SAID,
"THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO GO."

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:06.592
SHE HAD TO TELL ME.

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.862
SHE SAID, "BABY,
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO GO."

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:12.064
I SAID, "WHY, MOMMY?"

00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:15.067
I SAID, "BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE LONG HAIR,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.803
AND I'M NOT LIGHT-SKINNED?"

00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:21.040
THAT WAS A REALITY CHECK
I'LL NEVER FORGET.
