Hi everyone, this is Idir from FFDream.com ! 
We are pleased to interview Julien Merceron.

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:35.983
Head of Square Enix France's Technology department
with the help of our partner, JeuxCapt.com

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:39.211
This is a pleasure for me too

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:49.211
The demonstration of Agni's Philosophy – Final Fantasy has just ended, 
and a lot of people assisted to the presentation. What can you tell us about the public's reaction ?

00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:26.983
Julien Merceron, inevitably you're French. 
I think you know very well

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:32.142
that all the europeans fans of Final Fantasy 
Finally for most, started with FF VII

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:39.048
Then now, we will celebrate the 15th years 
of the game and there is a new PC version

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.922
Did you ever sometimes hear talking about 
the remake of Final Fantasy VII in the company?

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:47.714
(laughs) - It’s a game that is very precious
 to me also, surely you will find 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.286
on the internet some interviews that 
I have made in the past that confirmed that. 

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:57.010
For me, Final Fantasy VII, it was one
of the most beautiful experiences also. 

00:02:57.217 --> 00:03:01.445
But there are other Final Fantasy 
released before those were also superb 

00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:07.040
and then still other after.
Of course, for me, as a player I would. 

00:03:07.043 --> 00:03:14.122
There are people in the company who 
decide what they do with the brands 
15
00:03:14,124 --&gt; 00:00:16,641
and what they do and choose with 
the Final Fantasy franchise, 

00:03:16.643 --> 00:03:20.643
what is right and what isn’t good.
Me I simply try to decide on the level

00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:26.463
of technology and I accept their decisions
but as a player as a fan, yes of course,

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:30.463
I would like a remake, but this is only personal.
