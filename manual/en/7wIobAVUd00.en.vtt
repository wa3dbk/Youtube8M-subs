00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
Hana-no-Zundamaru, the third episode, "Flower, socks and me."

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.300
Zundamaru loves biscuits... I lied. I just wanted to say "biscuit."

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
"Biscuit" sounds nice and rhythmic, doesn't it? 
Everyone, let's "biscuit!"

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.000
- Zundamaru! I brought you a secret mission!
- What? Secret mission?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.900
The life of Princess Shiratama in Shiratamarun 
Castle is at risk. Protect the princess!

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.350
It's your chance, Zundamaru! The Princess must be gorgeous! 
Sweet-talk her into marrying you!

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.000
Idiot, don't just assume every princess is cute. 
That was only true until '35.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Now, most of them are ugly. 
What year do you think it is now? Edo era!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.800
By the way, this is Princess Shiratama.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.800
If it's a secret mission, it can't be helped.
 I don't want to do this at all...

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.950
But I'll do it. I'll have to seduce the princess.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.500
If I succeed in the mission, I might marry into her money.
 I'll have to accept it as my destiny. There's no other choice.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.350
- I thought you would say that. 
- Oh, I want to suck on Princess Shiratama...

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.500
What are you going to do with Sayurichan?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.750
Sayuri-chan is the girl that Zundamaru secretly loves.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.000
Sayuri? No, not a chance. Cuz that girl's just a secretary 
in Kouga, right? She doesn't have money.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.900
- You're scum, Zundamaru. 
- Shut up! I wanna suck on someone else's money.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.800
- At the same time, I wanna marry into money. 
- Zundamaru, you are being too honest.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.300
Isn't that Shiratamarun Castle? 
Hi there, I came here to marry into your money!

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.500
I am Princess Shiratama.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.200
- Wow, I wanna suck on her. 
- Zundamaru, wake up.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.200
Excuse me. Princess Shiratama,
 Zundamaru will protect you no matter what.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.000
- Or rather, I would like to protect you all my life as a security guard. 
- Wow.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That means you want to be NEET?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.950
By the way, your skin is so smooth, so sleek and smooth.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.300
- I can't take this! He said he liked me! Kill that girl 
with such old-fashioned socks, master!  - Socks?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.100
Well, I was planning to assassinate Princess Shiratama in the first place...
But uh, socks?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.000
And about the date of the wedding...who is it?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.200
My name is Seibu Gekimaru. 
I'm gonna take Princess's life.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.000
Um, excuse me, I think you're in the wrong animation. 
Why Western now? This is about ninjas.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.400
Plus, a horse's leg is not like that...

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.000
You just shut up! 
Take this: "The Art of Lasso"!!!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.100
- What would you do now? I got the Princess!
- I don't know about that! Look closely at your hands!

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.300
- The Art of Turned-up Chin! 
- You're talking about the Art of Body Replacement. Aw, my chin hurts.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.500
Don't look down on me! How about this? 
"The art of hundred shots, hundred guns."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.120
- "The Art of Matrix"!
- What? Shucks...

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.400
- The Art of "I think I've seen this movement before"
- No way!

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.500
How amusing it is to avoid gunshots!
 I might join them, too.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.500
Enough of making light of me! 
Now, I will take your life.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.200
- You must be kidding me!
- You're too wishful, Kuri-Kinton Toast Wood-maru!

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200
His name is Seibugeki (Western) maru, 
and originally it was Clint Eas...

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.530
The way you avoid gunshots is way too much used already. 
You can't use it on us!

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.800
- You've lost the fight, Sakura Nikumaru.
- He's Seibu Gekimaru.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.300
I'm not confident anymore to continue on as a ninja...
Should I just be the material for horse meat bento?

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.700
There's no intruder anymore. 
Let's now begin to prepare for the wedding.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.050
Looks like you two are getting along so well!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.150
Sayuri-chan! I'll marry Princess Shiratama into money, 
spend my entire life as a house guard and want you as a lover...

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.750
- I don't think in this way at all! 
- Zundamaru, talking too much can do you harm...

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.750
Zundamaru, you are the worst man!

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.030
Who is this Princess Shiratama in the first place? 
I have never seen a girl wearing such old-fashioned socks.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.300
Mr. Zundamaru is not much of a man to choose a woman like her.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.450
But, with all that, I still like Mr. Zundamaru.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.600
Sayuri-chan turns into Kemeko when she gets upset...
She sometimes does and she sometimes doesn't.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600
Girls' feelings are complicated.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.130
Zundamaru, please marry me because 
my socks are cute. Oh, you're dead...

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.800
Life's wicked hard...

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.900
Now that Zundamaru is dead, this is it for this animation? 
Maybe yes, and maybe not.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.800
He may be going to come alive next week.
 Animations are so convenient.
