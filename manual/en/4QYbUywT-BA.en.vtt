00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.460
Now a trip to New York wouldn't be complete
without a stopover at Coney Island.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.080
Coney Island is known for being one of the
oldest and largest amusement parks in America.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.480
It's also a treasure trove of historical landmarks.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.660
Today we're going to take you inside some
of the top must-see sights that make Coney

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.380
Island an American icon.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.340
With me today is my good friend Anna, a local
New Yorker.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.949
She'll also be sharing some of her favorite
things to do here.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:28.949
[#1 Williams Candy]

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.810
So right now, we're outside Williams Candy
store.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:45.580
It is known for it's candied apples and freshly-made
sweet treats.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.149
mmmm.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.680
That tastes good.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.539
You can taste the cashews and the nuttiness
of the cashews and caramel, right?

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.880
And there's marshmellows?

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.660
It's a marshmellow in the center.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.130
[#2 Coney Island Boardwalk]

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.410
Walking along Coney Island Boardwalk is a
must.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.880
The boardwalk is also the longest and widest
boardwalk in the world.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.560
[#3 Boardwalk food]
You can smell the sugar of the funnel cakes,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.730
pizza, hot dogs.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.520
You see people eating ice cream, Italian ices...

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.690
Here's my knish.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.720
I think I'm gonna get some mustard on it.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.560
[#4 Eat a Knish.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:41.770
Knishes were made popular in New York by Eastern
Eurpoean immigrants in the early 1900s.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.770
]

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.810
A knish is actually a .. the mustard.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.600
So nice and spicy and the breading around
the potato knish is deep fried in a nice,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.600
crispy way.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600
[#5 Wonder Wheel]

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:04.510

It's a non-profit arts organization that helps
continue the tradition of sideshow attractions.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.230
Contortionists, sword swallowers, bearded
ladies.. this is where it all took place.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.490
It houses a daily freak show, the coney island
museum and the annual mermaid parade.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.140
[#8 Cyclone Rollercoaster]
Cyclone.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.750
The oldest wooden rollercoaster in America
that is still working.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:41.880
That first drop is an 85 foot 60 degree drop.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:52.080
For roller coaster afficionados, this would
be on your bucketlist.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.190
[#9 Coney Island Beach]

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.090
What do you think we should do next Anna?

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:09.500
I think the next thing we do, head down to
the water.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500
Gotta put your feet in the water.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.500
We're at coney island.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500
Let's go.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.500
The sand is so fine.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
That's really nice.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500
I'm glad we did this.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.560
A definite must.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.091
So at Los Angeles, at Venice Beach they have
a Muscle Beach...

00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:35.870
This is Brooklyn's version of Muscle Beach.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.870
Only in New York.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.020

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.020

The original hotdog stand was built in 1916
and this joint has been a landmark ever since.

They hold an annual hot dog eating contest
every fourth of July.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.319
And that's how you can enjoy Coney Island.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.900
Eat your way through it.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.640
Travel Safe, Smart and Fun.
