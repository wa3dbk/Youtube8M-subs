Hi, my name is Mitra Chester, and I'm here
at Deluxe Resale Boutique in Eugene, Oregon,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.270
and I'm going to show you some techniques
for fading denim jeans. I have a dark pair

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:17.441
of jeans here that will expose the techniques
a little better. If you want to fade an overall

00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:23.580
wash of jeans like a couple shades lighter,
you can definitely wash them in a bleach bath

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.590
or with an over the counter color remover,
that will do a kind of a overall. If you want

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.660
fade certain areas there are other techniques
you can use. For larger areas you can use

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.290
sand paper or a pumice stone. This is a 180
grit sand paper, and I'm basically going to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.969
scrape it across an area that I want to fade
and it will give, basically remove some of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.101
the denim. And different fabrics are going
to experience these processes a little bit

00:00:54.101 --> 00:01:00.020
differently, this one works really well for
this. With any fading, you definitely want

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.130
to wash them and dry them. What you're trying
to accomplish is the look of washing and drying

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.549
jeans over and over and over again, so that's
another way to just do it subtly is wash them

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.380
pretty often. But this, as you can see, is
lightening up the area, and you can get a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.710
larger kind of area if you want. Fading in
smaller areas, like along a seam, you can

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.179
scrape it with a pocket knife or an Exacto
knife to expose some of the white under-threads,

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:39.979
which will have a fading effect ultimately
once it's washed and dried, or just along

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:51.880
a small area to create kind of a small faded
spot, or like some scratch marks. And depending

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.819
on the denim and the way that you move the
blade, it will have different effects. Done

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.670
vertically it will create a small faded spot.
Done horizontally it will expose these cross-threads

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.189
and have kind of a snagged effect. But, again,
once this is done wash them with soap and

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:17.140
it will rinse out the remainder of the dye
and achieve a faded look. And that's how you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.469
fade your jeans!
