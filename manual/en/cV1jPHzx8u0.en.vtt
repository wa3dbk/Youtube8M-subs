Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.330
You’ve decided to change the bake element
on your range.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.560
That’s a pretty easy job; all we’re going
to need is a Phillips screwdriver, and maybe

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.790
a pair of needle nose pliers.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.099
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.380
The very first step we need to do before we
begin our repair is to disconnect the power

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.430
supply to the range.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.250
If it has a cord on it you just need to unplug
it; if it has a disconnect switch we need

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.860
to locate that and turn off the power.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.730
The first step, open our door up, remove any
pots or pans that are in here, and we’ll

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:46.730
take the oven racks out, give ourselves lots
of room to work.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.300
Located just above the brackets that hold
the element in place are Phillips screws;

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:04.830
we need to remove those.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:29.700
Now we can gently pull the element forward,
keep in mind that there’s a wire harness

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.539
attached to the back of this and we don’t
want to inadvertently lose those wires.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.020
Just pull them out enough that we can get
at them.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:59.289
They should come off rather easily, if they
don’t use a pair of needle nose pliers.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:13.590
Want to inspect those wire terminals, make
sure they’re not arched or burnt.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.459
Those two look pretty good.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:29.260
We’ll take our new element, lay it roughly
in place, and reattach our wires.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:50.760
Make sure they’re tight on the terminals
on the element; firmly in place.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.110
Push the element back into the holes through
the back of the oven liner.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:06.249
Line up the screw hole.

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:11.569
Reattach both screws.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:27.069
We can gently bend the element so that it
sits firmly on the oven bottom.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:41.610
Put our racks back in, and our repair is complete.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.639
That’s just how easy it was to change the
bake element; thanks for watching, and good

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.469
luck with your repair.
