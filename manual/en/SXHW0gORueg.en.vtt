00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.350
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to inspect, remove,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.410
and replace your steel brake lines and bleed
the braking system on a Ford Explorer. In

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.769
this step we're going to talk about the proper
jacking procedure for raising the vehicle

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.210
back up and releasing our jack stands and
getting them out of the way. We have to do

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.699
that in order to work on the front and replace
our front to rear brake line. If you are not

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.369
replacing your front to rear brake line you
would go ahead and begin your bleeding procedure

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:47.340
right now. We're going to bleed our at the
end. Alright, I'm going to go ahead and take

00:00:47.340 --> 00:01:02.390
my jack up to the rear axle,
right there, and crank it up just like so.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.620
Once we got the pressure off of the jack stands
I can release the safety mechanisms and set

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:19.180
the vehicle back down. Remove this one. Alright,
once I have it jacked back up I'm going to

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.200
slide my jack stand as far out on the axle
shaft as I can and adjust it up to meet it.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:37.750
I'm going to go ahead and let the vehicle
down onto the single jack stand. You want

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:59.229
to do this very gently,

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.070
just like so. I'm going to go and move to
the front of the vehicle now and jack up that

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.020
portion. Alright, I'm up here at the front
of the vehicle. I'm going to take my heavy

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.690
duty floor jack and place it right on the
frame, jack the vehicle up, and set my jack

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.190
stand on the frame as well. We're doing this
procedure in order to gain access to the front

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:50.260
to rear brake line.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:59.030
Alright, that's plenty high enough. Going
to take and set my jack stand on the frame

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.990
and let the vehicle down very slowly so it
settles easily. You don't want to let it down

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:13.120
all at once; you may damage you, the jack,
or the vehicle. There we go, that's the proper

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.379
way to jack up one side of your vehicle to
change your front to rear brake line.
