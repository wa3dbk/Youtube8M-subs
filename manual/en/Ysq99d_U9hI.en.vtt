Good morning, John, it's a day of the week,
a day of the month, a month and a year. I'm

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.360
not even trying anymore. What it is, John,
is the day after Superbowl Sunday and I'm

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.730
sorry to all you Steelers fans but in your
face!

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.030
This is the first time, maybe ever, that I
cared about a Superbowl. Two reasons why I

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.529
like the Green Bay Packers: one, there's a
lot of Wisconsinites here in Missoula and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.039
so I don't like seeing my friends cry. And
the Green Bay fans take it serious because

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.250
the second reason why I love the Green Bay
Packers: they're owned by people. Tens of

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.080
thousands of people. People don't get anything
in return for buying Green Bay Packers stock

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.039
because the Green Bay Packers are a non-profit
organization.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.370
It's a football team. National football league
football team, just won the Superbowl, big

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.890
deal team: community-owned non-profit. Why
aren't they all like that? It's clear that

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.640
it works! They won the Superbowl! And they
have the most dedicated fans of any football

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640
team in the world.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.210
I love how we say that the winners of the
Superbowl are the "world champions", because

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.379
the rest of the world is fighting so hard.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.719
But anyhow. All the rest of the football teams
are owned by some rich person or a small group

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.860
of rich people. They didn't just win the Superbowl!
They don't have the most dedicated fans of

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.530
any football team! And they're not a non-profit
organization that donates the profits of the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.530
team back into the community.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.000
Actually, I just spent a little bit of time
researching this on the internet. Turns out

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.490
that the NFL has specifically forbidden another
team like the Green Bay Packers from entering

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.030
the NFL. They will not allow it. It's too
successful. How are those rich people gonna

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.920
make money off their football teams if it's
owned by the community? Agh! Stupid!

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.500
Here's a horrible brain crack idea for you.
I had an idea. Take a picture of this or a

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.490
video of this and then annotate or link every
book and also every little knicknacky item

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.700
to a review or the story of that book or item.
It would only take like 200 hours of work

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.700
and then that would be totally awesome right?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.180
Yeah that's just going to sit in there and
chew away at my brain, that one. That's not

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.180
getting out.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.909
I was talking about the Superbowl. It's not
about football really, is it? It's about eating

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.490
food, hanging out with friends, and watching
commercials. And I have to say I'm getting

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.180
really tired of Coca-Cola commercials. Coca-Cola,
I don't know if you know this, is water with

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.920
bubbles and sugar in it. Turns out, water
with bubbles and sugar in it cannot solve

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.860
the world's problems. It cannot defuse a dragon
that is attacking adorable monkey people.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.970
You know what you and everyone else in the
world have in common? A lot more than just

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.970
Coca-Cola.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.910
Stop trying to convince me that bubbly sugar
water is going to solve all of the world's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.690
problems, ah, because it's freaking bubbly
sugar water! You know why we like Coca-Cola?

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.060
Because it's candy in a bottle.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.000
End rant. Counterbalance: amazing story!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.330
There is a black labrador, a dog, in Japan
that can smell colon cancer on your breath.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.440
He can also smell it in your poop, but also
on your breath. This dog is just accurate

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.840
as a colonoscopy, which is the thing where
they stick a camera up your butt and look

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.230
around, at discovering whether or not people
have colon cancer.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.910
One day I want to live in a world where you
can walk into a doctor's office and there's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.290
a black labrador sitting there and he walks
up to you and sniffs you. And he either barks

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.310
or he doesn't bark.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.130
Though, that would be kind of a horrible way
to find out you have cancer.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.230
And he doesn't even have to smell your butt,
he smells your breath and that is just weird!

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.640
Though it is a dog, so it's probably gonna
sniff your butt anyway.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.030
The Katherine, my wife, guest starred with
me in an episode of Hank plays Lego Harry

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.570
Potter. It's hilarious, because she's hilarious,
and you should watch it, because it's adorable.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.660
And me, John, wheezywaiter, Alex Day, and
elmify are all getting together to create

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.420
a linked up vyou.com space. Vyou.com is like
question Tuesdays, except forever and always.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.210
So basically there's links down there. You
go and you ask questions and we will answer

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.980
them in video form and then you can click
on other people's questions and see our video

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.980
replies.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.400
It's lots of fun and if you actually sign
up for the site instead of giving anonymous

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.910
questions I will be much more likely to answer
your questions. But John and Alex and Craig

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.670
and Emma and I will all be answering questions
on vyou.com. You should check it out.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.990
And there's more amazing stuff. There's always
more amazing stuff, but I'm just going to

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.730
link that in the endscreen. John, I will see
you on Wednesday.
