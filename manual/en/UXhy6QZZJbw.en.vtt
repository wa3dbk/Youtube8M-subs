00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.430
How to Pick a Great Airline Seat.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.340
Don't get stuck in a middle seat near a bathroom
on your next flight.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.100
With a little time and effort, you can be
sitting pretty.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.779
You will need Priorities A website with airplane
seating diagrams An early booking and a seat

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.180
upgrade membership.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.340
Step 1.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.070
There is no single "best seat" on an airplane
â€” all have their pros and cons â€” so decide

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.380
what's important to you.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.380
Legroom?

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.380
Peace and quiet?

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.380
A quick exit?

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.540
A smooth ride?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.730
Step 2.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.900
Don't assume anything about a seat without
checking it out.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.640
Some bulkhead seats _don't_ offer extra legroom,
some "window" seats are _between_ windows

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.140
and therefore offer little view, and many
exit seats, while providing more legroom,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.610
are narrower than other seats.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.129
Find out what kind of plane you'll be on and
then visit "seatexpert.com":http:// or "seatguru.com":http://.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.770
Click on any seat to see its pros and cons.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.770
Step 3.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.930
Pay a small fee to ensure you get a seat with
the most legroom.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.939
Many airlines now identify their best seats
on their websites and charge for them accordingly.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.939
Step 4.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.539
Take reclining into account.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.249
If you like to sit back, avoid the last rows
in any section.

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:16.670
If you hate people leaning into your lap,
try to snare an exit seat; the seats in front

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.649
of those rows usually don't recline.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.959
Exit row seats are often not assigned until
check-in.

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.649
To snag one, get to the airport early.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.049
Step 5.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.490
Consider the pitch of the seat, which is the
distance between your seat and the one in

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.490
front of you.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.590
You'll find this information on airline seat
websites.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.590
Step 6.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.270
Take turbulence into account.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.130
If you're a white-knuckle flyer, sit over
the front of the wing; that's where you're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.349
least likely to feel turbulence.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.380
Avoid the back, where you'll feel every bump.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.679
Step 7.

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.020
If you need peace and quiet, avoid sitting
in the back, where the engines are the loudest.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.779
And steer clear of the bulkhead, where families
with babies are usually seated.

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:54.919
Step 8.

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:59.680
When you buy your ticket, be sure to book
your specific seat, either online or by calling

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.729
the airline directly.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.310
Increase your odds of sitting beside an empty
middle seat by requesting a back row where

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.020
either the aisle or window seat is already
booked.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.420
The middle seats in back rows fill up last.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.800
Step 9.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.720
Check back 24 hours before your flight; this
is when prime seating often is released.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.230
Plus, airlines occasionally switch planes,
possibly turning your chosen seat into an

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.820
undesirable one!

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.820
Step 10.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.650
If you're a frequent flyer, consider joining
an airline program that guarantees a good

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.019
seat for an annual fee.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.949
Did you know The average airline seat in coach
is just 17.2 inches wide.
