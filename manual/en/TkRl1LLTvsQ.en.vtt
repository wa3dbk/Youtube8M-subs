00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt;ANNOUNCER: The Eastern European gymnasts
are dominating the rhythmic gymnastics world.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.440
You just have to look at the all-around top
10 from the world championships in Moscow

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.440
last year

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.820
to find that as many as 7 athletes were from
former Soviet republics.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.900
In the 10th spot, we find Belarusian Liubov
Charkashyna, who despite

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.680
only being 23 years of age, is considered
to be a veteran.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.160
&gt;&gt;LIUBOV CHARKASHYNA: [speaking Belarusian]

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.899
&gt;&gt;INTERPRETER: My first Olympic games were
in Beijing, 2008.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.640
I had little experience, and I didn’t end
up in the top 10 places.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.910
But in 2003, at my first world championships,
I won the bronze medal

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.410
with the Belarusian team.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:53.530
I’ve competed at five world championships
and seven European championships.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.870
That means that I’m much more experienced
now and ready to perform in London

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.399
on high professional level.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.160
&gt;&gt;LIUBOV CHARKASHYNA: [speaking Belarusian]

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.020
&gt;&gt;ANNOUNCER: She’s won three team silver
medals at the world championships,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.390
losing out to Italy twice and neighbors Russia
in 2007.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.700
Despite not having an individual medal from
the world or European championships,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.159
Liubov is happy with what she’s accomplished.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.869
&gt;&gt;LIUBOV: [speaking Belarusian]

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.131
&gt;&gt;INTERPRETER: Thanks to rhythmic gymnastics,
I have a chance to fulfill my dream, to

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.170
see the world, and to meet new friends.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.270
Compared to other sports, the emphasis is
on dancing and performing.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.049
I love the fact that I’m competing and performing
at the same time.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.049
&gt;&gt;LIUBOV: [speaking Belarusian]

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.810
&gt;&gt;ANNOUNCER: And now she’s aiming to finally
get that individual medal

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.579
at the Olympic Games in London next year.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.090
But before she can book her tickets

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.630
to the United Kingdom, there’s a necessary
step to be taken.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.810
&gt;&gt;LIUBOV: [speaking Belarusian]

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.420
&gt;&gt;INTERPRETER: To qualify for London, I have
to do well at the world championships this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.420
year.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.190
I’ll compete against gymnasts from all over
the world, and of course against

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.790
my team members, who all want to qualify for
the Olympics.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.560
My advantage is that I’m older, more experienced,
and physically well prepared.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.190
&gt;&gt;LIUBOV: [speaking Belarusian]

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.450
&gt;&gt;INTERPRETER: But the younger athletes are
very talented.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:36.510
However, I will of course do my best to qualify
for the Olympics and to win a medal.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.310
&gt;&gt;LIUBOV: [speaking Belarusian]

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.170
