00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:05.040
Today on our 2014 Jeep Cherokee we&amp;#39;re
going to be test fitting the Thule Crossroads

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.080
roof rack system.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.300
We&amp;#39;ll be using the 58&amp;quot; square bars,
part number THLB58 and the Crossroads foot

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.300
packs, part number TH450.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.130
Now to begin our test fit we&amp;#39;ve got the
front half of our roof rack.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.109
We&amp;#39;re going to place it onto the front
roof line of our vehicle.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.710
We need to do a couple measurements here.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:01:20.270
We need to find a fixed point.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:03:09.819
In our 
case we&amp;#39;re going to use 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:05:24.220
the oval-shaped cover.
