00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:07.002
Hey guys. Nick Drossos here from Code Red Defense. I'm here with

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:13.040
Moose, and I'm wearing a head cam. I want you guys to see exactly,

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:17.268
from my perspective what's happening. And also see, the angles,

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.562
the speed of the attack, okay? So what we're going to be doing is

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:30.367
to start as a parry knife drill, okay? So Moose, his job is to try

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:35.350
to stab me. My job is to move around, come in and not

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:37.364
let him cut me. You use your footwork skills.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:42.868
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:56.581
Now, you can see, coming in, I'm try to work my parrying skills.

00:00:56.582 --> 00:00:59.422
[SOUND]

00:00:59.423 --> 00:01:00.734
Now what I need to do here

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:01.818
Here I start using my low-line kicks.

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:02.682
[SOUND]

00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:04.074
Try to keep him back.

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:05.018
[SOUND]

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.775
Break! Now you see how, environments play a factor. Here's something

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:16.037
that only through live training you could figure out. I almost

00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:20.412
tripped behind this. As soon as I touched it, I realized I had to

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:28.817
move off to the side.
I've seen your environment is a big factor.

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:32.407
Slipping, falling, tripping over things. I remember one of the

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:37.636
clubs I worked outside, there was a parking meter. Not too far

00:01:37.637 --> 00:01:41.559
there was a fire hydrant. Man, I've seen people slip and fall.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.878
[NOISE]

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:45.374
I've been attacked using it.

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.494
Threw them on them.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:51.532
Your environment is a huge factor, right. This is why it's good

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:56.312
for you to train as much as possible outside. Something like this,

00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:59.850
I went here, I knew that if he would've charged me, and maybe I

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:00.518
would've tripped.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:03.949
It just went from standing to on the ground with a larger attacker,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.192
okay? What I was doing here, is when the knife is here, you want to

00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:13.437
move it this way. I don't want to move it here, his punch is right here.

00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:17.514
So, always think, what arm is leading. If it was the arm

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:21.767
leading, no grab the knife with the other arm, I'm doing this.

00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:28.617
Now, let's say, again, Moose is 6'6'' 300 pounds. He's got a knife.

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:31.318
He's got the height, he's got the weight, he's got the size.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.187
If you want to escape, let's do another drill. Okay? My job now is only

00:02:37.188 --> 00:02:42.074
to escape. Nothing's wrong with running against the knife. People

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:46.104
say run, run, run, I would run. Yes, here I can run.

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:51.933
A closed quarter combat environment is a lot harder to  run. But there is a way and strategy

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:54.825
of escaping and running against a knife attacker.
Jimmy go.

00:02:54.826 --> 00:03:00.756
[SOUND]

00:03:00.757 --> 00:03:03.111
[SOUND]

00:03:03.112 --> 00:03:08.751
Okay, what do I do? every time the knife comes, I parry here,

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:15.312
and I run this way, okay? So if he comes here and I do this, you

00:03:15.313 --> 00:03:20.749
could go to the trapping if I want to fight this Moose, this bear

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.336
but I want to escape. What do I do? The knife comes here,

00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:24.487
[SOUND]

00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:38.208
I'm out this way, okay? Now, it's a lot harder, come over here Moose.

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.714
It's a lot harder from here at the corner, okay Go,

00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:49.104
[NOISE]

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:52.050
Now, Moose is also a football player, don't underestimate the big guy.

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.925
I'm sure a lot of people have done that with you, right?

00:03:54.926 --> 00:03:55.620
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:55.621 --> 00:04:00.675
&gt;&gt; They think he's big, he's slow, he's not as fast. I've seen some

00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:04.263
I've seen some big guys move and they're pretty fast. So don't think

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:08.130
because he's big you'll run faster than him. So what you want to

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:12.617
do again is the knife comes here, now he took a different stance,

00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:15.878
because he knows I'm going to run that way, which is all good, so what

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.441
I want to do is I want to be here, If I'm here I start using my legs

00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:23.500
Try to buck him.

00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:24.546
[NOISE]

00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:31.559
And I'm out. So when we talk about running against a knife...

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.730
If I could escape,

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:33.542
[SOUND]

00:04:33.543 --> 00:04:37.574
that's your number one option. The number one option against a knife,

00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:42.466
run if you could run, that means parry the arm to the side and get out.

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:47.426
Two, grab an improvised weapon. Belt, bag, shirt, whatever you can.

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:50.000
Three, parry,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.559
use your legs, escape. Four, close quarter environment, you got to

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.044
trap it, it's as simple as that. Guys, we have a knife defense video.

00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:00.948
It is three hours long.

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.274
We talk about getting sucker punched and getting into a street fight whatever,

00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:07.011
but being attacked, with a knife, in your home, or outside

00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:11.111
your home, could easily cost you your life. All right guys, we

00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:13.972
have a three hour video, go check it out at Code Red Defense dot com.

00:05:13.973 --> 00:05:16.910
