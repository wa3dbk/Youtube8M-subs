00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.210
I friend in this video we are going to cover

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.290
how using a bowling machine too much, can turn you into a robotic

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.990
kind of player and can actually spoil you're
batting game

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.740
and how I think a SIDE ARM or thrown downs
are considerably better

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.740
I'm

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.949
hi guys Jemile of the cricket school here

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.489
in this video I wanted to tackle
something that i am seeing more and more  from coaches

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.329
and something that i am seeing

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.079
happening to players as a result of using bowling machines too much

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.149
don't get me wrong i like bowling machines and i think bowling machines are great, and I think

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.149
the best time for any cricketer to be using

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.090
a bowling machines is in the winter I also think that for club cricketers

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.610
they are invaluable training aid the
beginning of the season When

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.859
a player hasn't faced many balls over the winter and you just need

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.629
lots of red things coming at you and that could go for a keeper as well

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.210
and I think they are great in that situation
but something i am seeing happening more

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.340
and more with young players is that they are turning into robots

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.610
and they are turning into front front bullies and you can see when they are playing that they are always

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.830
going onto the front foot

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.009
there always going onto the front foot and the reason is

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.960
I think is because the coaches that has been
working with those players

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.259
has just been doing a lot of front foot drives

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.390
which is a shot that coach likes to see a
lot

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.420
and that's actually not doing good to
the player I am a firm believer in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.509
you going to switch things up and do

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.159
lots of different things and also do whats hard for a player and not the easy stuff

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.750
in order for that player to improve and I see a lot with bowling machines that people are

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.450
kind of

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.880
just turning into robots - i prefer

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.590
th side arm, i prefer the throw down. i think the side arm is a great tool

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.049
because it basically saves my arm as a coach and

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.719
there is this good variation off that side arm especially the pro

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.100
version its ridiculous the speed at
which he comes off

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.009
this surface is great and really makes the
batsman have to watch the ball

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.690
and it's really lifelike and the closer i

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.400
gets to my player the more
accurate i become and I prefer that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.510
because that variance is more like this
variance

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.569
that a player will have when they're playing on a grass wicket

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.000
and it's more like the variance that the player 
will have to deal with as the ball gets

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.500
older, it's more like the variance that the player will have to  deal with as the bowler bowls slowr balls

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.940
leg cutters. in swing and away swingers and all that kind of

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.400
thing

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.790
So this is just my opinion, this is not just a rant this is just my opinion

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.910
and i've been coaching for a few years and i think i am pretty right on this

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.959
but i would be happy to hear other
people's opinions, on don't get me wrong I

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.040
don't dislike bowling machines but I like
and i prefer the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.500
variance of a side arm as well as throw downs

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.250
more because i think players need that you never know what's coming in a

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.310
game and I think the just keeps helps to
keep a player honest. Thanks for watching
