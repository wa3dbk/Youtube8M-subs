00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.730
MIT researchers studying
brain speech planning just

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.980
came up with the hardest
tongue twister in the world.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:13.870
Anthony and Trace
here for DNews.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.180
Toy boat, toy boat, toy
boat, toy boat, toy boat.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.610
What are you doing?

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.489
I'm practicing tongue twisters.

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.280
It's going to be the
world's hardest tongue

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.650
twister that's just come out.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.680
And I'm going to get it.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.780
I'm going to get it.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.280
OK.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.562
You know, it's weird that
tongue twisters even exist,

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:27.770
if you think about it, right?

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.780
Because these are sounds
that we make all the time.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.920
These are words that
we say all the time.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.280
We're planning what we're
going to say in advance.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.420
Why do we get tripped up?

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.142
That's what the MIT researchers
were looking to find.

00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:39.100
And before you can find
the cause of something,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.980
you have to figure out the
specific effects and what

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.170
actual things are happening
that get our tongues so twisted.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.960
So they got this
group of volunteers,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.251
and they gave them a whole
list of these classic tongue

00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:51.280
twisters, and recorded
them trying to read them.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.750
And they isolated the most
common pronunciation errors

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.020
in an effort to
start tracing back

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.000
the cause of our
brain/mouth confusion.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.891
So do toy boat again.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.390
OK.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.210
Toy boat, toy boat, toy
boat, toboy, toboy--

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.710
See?

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.050
It becomes like toy boy, right?

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.790
Yeah, it's weird.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.629
Now listen to top cop.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.129
Got it.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.620
Top cop, top cop,
ta-cop, ta-cop--

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.380
So the sounds are
blending together

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.270
and they're kind of
sounding crazy, actually.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.644
And there's always
some blending,

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:15.200
but there's also
always some space.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.320
Well, sometimes, right?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.307
And it varies.

00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:19.140
You either crush them
or you space them out.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.140
And that happens in both short
word twisters and longer phrase

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.640
ones.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.657
Like, the sixth sick sheik's
sixth sheep's seek six.

00:01:27.657 --> 00:01:28.990
Exactly what I was going to say.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.490
That's bad.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.020
Or, Susie sits in
a shoe shine shop

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.254
where she shits-- where she sits
she shines, where she shines,

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:37.810
she sits.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.310
OK.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.070
We're really bad at this.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.490
But what's causing
the errors, though?

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.850
They don't know.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.530
But they do know that the
quick blending, like ta-cop,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.490
happens more in
short word twisters.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.700
And the spaced out blending, ta
cop, happens more in phrases.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.930
And that might be because
the toy boat twisters have

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.480
that more-- the shorter
words in a regular rhythm,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.220
whereas the sentences have
more irregular timing, overall.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.210
So both errors happen in both
kinds of tongue twisters,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.870
meaning we use the
same brain processes

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.912
for both parts of speech.

00:02:06.912 --> 00:02:07.745
That is interesting.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:09.699
But the most interesting
thing that they found

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.741
came about when they were trying
to devise different tests.

00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:14.365
They created their
own tongue twisters,

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:16.740
and there was one that they
created that messed people up

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.520
so badly, they didn't even
blend sounds together.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.750
They just locked up and
stopped speaking entirely.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.590
Ready?

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.620
Pad kid poured curd pulled cod.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.630
Pad kid poured curd pulled cod.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.200
[UNISON] Pad kid
poured curd pulled cod.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.350
Pad kid poured--

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.850
Cold.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.480
Curd cod.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.320
Poured cold.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.860
Curd.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.250
Pad.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.020
I don't know.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.144
Does it feel harder to you?

00:02:37.144 --> 00:02:39.039
They are all
extremely hard for me.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.580
If any of you guys
want to record it,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.170
we would love to see you
trying to do it 10 times fast

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.770
and see if you fare
better than we do.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.436
You can leave them
on our Facebook page,

00:02:46.436 --> 00:02:48.180
or you can tweet
them to us at DNews.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.390
And anyone who does it,
they can win five Internets.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.100
Five Internets is
the most Internets

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.450
that we are allowed
to give out legally,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.033
without a license
from the government.

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:56.717
So that is a big prize.

00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:59.270
Enjoy it.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.880
Pad kid pulled cod.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.430
Curd.
