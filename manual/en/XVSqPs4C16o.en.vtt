00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.660
Hotel Infinity: Part Four

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.679
Recap: You run hotel with an infinite number
of rooms. When the rooms are full, you can

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.700
make space for new guests by rearranging your
current occupants. You can even make room

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.119
for a sports team with an infinite number
of players. But one night, an infinite number

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.259
of infinite teams show up at once. Is it possible
to accommodate them?

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.969
Well it is possible, as it turns out, and
here’s how. First, have the players in each

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:36.360
team line up in order next to their bus -- Player
1, Player 2, and so on. Have the buses drive

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.289
away, giving you room to work. The players
are neatly arranged in an infinite number

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.219
of infinitely long lines, and if you can somehow
arrange them into a single infinite line,

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.219
then you’re set.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.530
And you can do exactly that, by cordoning
the yard off into zigzagging, diagonal rows.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.980
The player in the first row goes first, then
the two players in the second row, then the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.800
three players in the third. Every single player
has a place in this new, zigzagging line.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.900
You clear out the odd numbered rooms for them,
and there’s space for all, once more.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.950
Their stay goes swimmingly, and before they
check out the coach approaches you again.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.840
“You know,” she says, “I’m training
a highly competitive meditation team on my

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.751
homeworld, and I’d love to bring them by
next time we’re in the neighborhood, but

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:23.850
I’ve had some reservations. See, they use
a pretty nontraditional numbering system for

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.810
their jerseys. They’re numbered by the positive
rational numbers -- there’s a player ½,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.869
a player 5/9, a player 7, a player 78/11…
For every positive integer and every positive

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.280
fraction, there’s a player who wears that
number.”

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.159
“I’d love to bring them here, but I always
figured you might not have room for them.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.810
But now I’m thinking you just might be able
to accommodate them, after all,” she says

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.969
with a grin.

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.000
“We can!” you say. “We could arrange
them in the parking lot, in an infinite number

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.140
of infinite rows -- first all the integers,
then all the multiples of one half, then all

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.020
the multiples of one third, and so on. Then
use the same tactic as before to arrange them

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.759
in a single line, and it’s done! There is
room for everyone, at Hotel Infinity!”

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.581
You and the coach share a celebratory high
five. But as the echo fades, you notice a

00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:14.360
new light in the sky… a light that’s growing
brighter.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.480
You turn and look, just in time to see a gleaming
ship hurtle out of the sky, then slow itself,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.700
landing gently by your door. A hatch opens,
revealing the President of Space, her eyes

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.920
fixed on you, urgently.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.709
“Just the person I was hoping to find,”
she says. “We need your help.”

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.260
A figure appears beside her, wearing a lab
coat, and smiling giddily.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.069
“This is my Chief Science Officer of Science,”
she explains. “He’s made an alarming discovery.”

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.959
“Highly alarming!” he agrees. “My team
has found a portal to another universe! It’s

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.250
full of wonders -- rocks we’ve never seen
before, bugs we’ve never seen before…”

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.400
“And people,” says the President. “A
group of people like we’ve never seen before.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.060
They traveled here through the portal, and
now… they need a place to stay.”

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.250
A shape appears behind her. A shifting, gooey
mass, like a cookie cut out of a slab of jello.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.270
“And here they are,” says the President.
“All of them.”

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.260
“All of them?” you ask. “I only see
one…”

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.269
“They’re two-dimensional,” says the
scientist. “They’re flat like paper, stacked

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.470
together like a deck of cards.”

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.689
The shape moves, and a mouth opens. Many mouths,
actually, belonging to more creatures than

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.940
you can count, all clumped together like cards
in a deck.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.239
“Hello!” the creatures intone, in unison.
“We are many, and all are pleased to meet

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.909
you. Do you have shelter for us, for our stay
in your vast, strange world?”

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.129
“Pleased to meet you as well,” you offer.
“May I ask your names?”

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.070
The creature closest to you answers first:
“I’m called Zero.” The creature at the

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.440
back speaks up as well, saying, “My name
is One.” A voice pipes up from the middle

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.040
of the stack, saying “I’m called One Half,”
and a chorus of occasional voices speaks up

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.099
from within the mass of people, calling out
numbers.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.950
“Some of our names can’t be spoken in
this world,” says Zero, “Or at least not

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.250
finished before your universe turns homogenous
and cold. But we’re all named after numbers

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.710
-- Zero, and One, and all the numbers in between.
We’re standing in order before you, lower

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.750
numbers in front, higher numbers in back.
No number is missing, all are here, from Zero

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.780
all the way to One.”

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.300
“So,” asks Zero, “Do you have room for
us? One room for each of us, to call our own

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.919
during our stay?”

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.660
The President looks at you, as does the Scientist,
and the Coach, and the Visitors from another

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.280
world, Zero all the way to One. But you’re
not sure what to tell them. Do you have room,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.449
or not?

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.860
In the next and final installment we’ll
answer this question, but try to figure it

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.180
out on your own. Let us know if you think
of a way of doing it, or a reason why it can’t

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.930
be done. Until next time, in Hotel Infinity.
