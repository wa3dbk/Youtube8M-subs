00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.960
Hello and welcome to the second episode of
the Summoner Sewcase!

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.130
With winter slowly clearing the way for spring,
it is time to honor the cold part of the year

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.500
and what better to do that with, than a polar
bear named Tibbers and Frostfire Annie,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.500
after all she can make it burn despite it being
a stormy winters day!

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.200
This Annie Costume was made and worn by Kairii Cosplay for the GamesCom 2011,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.030
and she made it in less than two days!
Kairii has another winter delight to offer

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.430
and so all i can say is let it rain poros!
Just look into their little black eyes which

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.360
are just begging for some yummy Snax!
She has made over 100 Poros to this day!

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.150
That is a number of poros that I would love to
see on Howling Abyss!

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.360
Cant get enough of fluffly little Poros? Then
take a look at this Pixie-Poro accompanied

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.060
by Linnie as Winterwonder Lulu, I can just
hear her exclaiming "yupp - that tasted purple"

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.960
while wearing this costume!
She does a perfect job of catching Lulus playfullness

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.110
in all of her photos and she has already been
in the Summoners Showcase with this picture

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.270
of her and her Pixie Poro.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.259
When thinking of snow and ice in League of
Legends I dont just think of Snowdown and

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.670
the Howling Abyss - the Freljord pops into
my mind as well.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.450
The Queen shows herself in this amazing costume
created by Namie -- who chose a beautiful

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.639
royal setting to display her icy blue cosplay
in.

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:33.170
Take a moment to admire the exquisite details
in namies costume. Looking closely you'll

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.369
see the hand painted gold patterns which embellish
the gown, making it even more dignified.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.920
Ashe is not the only powerful woman of the
Freljord.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.509
You can't underestimate the fighting spirit
and skill of Lissandra and Sejuani either.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.039
All three have many supporters, so now its
time for you to show your allegiance as they

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.500
compete for sovereignty over the freljord.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.909
Let me introduce Sejunai, the Winters Wrath
- Sejuani is a beautiful and strong champion,

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.520
solid in the jungle and allround awesome and
hey she gets to ride a super cool boar as

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.869
a mount! This costume was made by Muzzatheperv.
The editing in these images was done by Baku-project.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.270
Next up: Lissandra - the Ice Witch, like
Sejuani a very under-cosplayed yet epic champion

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.930
that deserves a lot more love than she receives.
Vahris, the cosplayer under this amazing outfit

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.130
needs around two hours just to get into it!
The foundation around her is made mostly of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.440
painted cardboard and foam! Isn't it amazing
to see what you can make when you have your

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.820
mind set on it?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.800
Last but not least in this amazing group:
Ashe - the Frost Archer. This time portrayed

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.130
by Missyeru, with Al as her photographer.
Ashe is definately a favorate in the League

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.140
and has been around long enough that everyone
knows the danger that she emmits. I know that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.350
I for one, would not want to be on the receiving
end of one of those icey Arrows!

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.690
