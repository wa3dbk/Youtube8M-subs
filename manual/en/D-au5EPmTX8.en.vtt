00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.459
Hello,

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.630
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.630
[pause]

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.860
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.850
There are many benefits of skin of color,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.849
but also many specific issues.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.660
Today, I’ll discuss some

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.050
of the intrinsic benefits, and in a future
episode, I’ll cover

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.900
the specific sensitivities.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.189
As a note, when we say “skin of color,”

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.470
we’re referring to the skin of people of
African American,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.309
Asian, Indian, and Hispanic ancestry.

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.349
So let’s begin with the benefits!

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.349
The most important

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:37.620
and most obvious advantage is the natural
photo protective effect.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
For example, medium toned African American
skin has a natural

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.039
“built in” SPF of 15.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.420
This is the result of the increased melanin

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.160
in African American skin.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.230
As you’ll recall,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.579
melanin is your brown skin pigment that is
normally confined

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.200
to the epidermis, your top layer of skin.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.969
The more melanin you have,

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.499
the darker your skin, and the less susceptible
you are

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.930
to the harmful effects of the ultraviolet
rays of the sun,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.950
both UVA and UVB.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.220
So that means fewer skin cancers and also,
less,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.979
or really delayed, photo aging.

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.570
Let’s look at both.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.860
The incidence of all three major types of
skin cancer,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.829
BCC, SCC and even Melanoma, are much lower
in people

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.619
with skin of color and as you’d expect,
even less in medium

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.690
and darker toned African Americans than in
Asians,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.400
Indians and Hispanics.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.700
However, there is one very deadly type

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
of skin cancer that is much more common in
African Americans,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.310
and that’s a type of Melanoma called Acral
Lentiginous melanoma.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.789
It occurs as areas of dark pigmentation on
palms, soles,

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.409
finger or toe tips, under the nails and on
the oral mucosa.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.649
In addition to helping prevent skin cancer,
the extra melanin

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.320
in skin of color helps protect it from premature
photo aging,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.829
so facial wrinkling, dull skin texture, broken
capillaries, brown spots

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.000
and blotchiness are all delayed until a much
older age.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.500
Skin of color also tends to have more of a
luster.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.220
Just remember however, it’s great that skin
of color

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.820
provides inherent protection, but I only mentioned
SPF,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.930
which protects against UVB.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.280
So if you have skin of color,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.670
you still need to apply sunscreen daily to
protect you from UVA.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.790
And while these are some of the benefits,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.740
there are trade offs to the greater amount
of melanin

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.340
in these darker skin types

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:47.700
and I’ll discuss those in another DermTV
episode.
