00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.340
I'm going to do a couple
of lattice multiplication

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.490
examples in this video.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.640
And in the next one we'll try
to understand why it worked.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.235
Let's say we're trying to
multiply 27 times 48.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:18.780
What you do is you
write down your 27.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.650
The 2 and the 7 are going to
get separate columns and you

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.470
write your 48 down the
right-hand side, and then

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.345
you draw a lattice.

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:28.340
This is why it's called
lattice multiplication.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.580
So the 2 is going to
get its own column.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.020
The 7 is going to
get its own column.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.330
The 4 is going to get its
own row and the 8 is

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.900
going to get its own row.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.460
Now the fun thing about lattice
multiplication is you get to do

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.220
all of your multiplication at
one time and then you can

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.930
finish up the problem
with all your addition.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.890
You don't have to keep
switching gears by

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.930
carrying and all of that.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.590
Although there is carrying,
but it's all while you're

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.260
doing the addition step.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.510
So we're almost done
with our lattice.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.800
We actually have to draw
these diagonals here.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.430
We'll understand in the
next video why these

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.330
diagonals even work.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.550
Just like that.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.310
And now we're ready
to multiply.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.440
7 times 4 is 28.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.230
7 times 4 is equal to 28.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.310
So you write down a 2 and
an 8 just like that.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.580
2 times 4 is equal to 8.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.380
So you write down a
0, 8 just like that.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.690
Then you have 7 times 8.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.785
7 times 8 is equal to 56.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:27.240
So we write down a 5 and a 6.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.490
And then finally, 2
times 8 is equal to 16.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.800
You write down a 1 and
a 6 just like that.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.750
And we're done all
of our multiplying.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.070
Now we're ready to add.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.740
So what you do is you go
down these diagonals

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.450
that I drew here.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.930
So this first diagonal, which
is really the 1's diagonal, you

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.110
just have a 6 sitting here.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.500
So you write a 6
just like that.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.140
Then we move over to
the next diagonal.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.600
This diagonal with the
6, 5, and 8 in it.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.360
That's our 10's diagonal.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.960
So 8 plus 5 is 13.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.600
13 plus 6 is 19.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.310
So you write your 9 right here
in the 10's place and now you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.700
carry the 1 in 19 up there into
the 100's place because this

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.900
isn't just 19, it's
actually 190.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.850
It's nineteen 10's.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.580
Anyway, you carry your 1.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.510
You have 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.780
3 plus 8 is 11.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.620
11 plus 1 is 12.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.130
You write the 2 in your 100's
place and you carry the 1

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.020
into your 1,000's place.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.760
1 plus 0 is 1, so you just
have a 1 in your 1,000's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.210
place just like that.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.440
And you get our answer.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:49.730
27 times 48 is equal to 1,296/
Let's do a harder problem.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.310
One that requires more digits,
just to show that this'll

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.160
work for any problem.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.160
Let's say we had 5,479 times--
let's do a three-digit number.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.650
Times 787.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.610
So just like we did in the last
time, we make four columns.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.080
One for the 5, the 4,
the 7, and the 9.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.740
We'lll have 5,479
and then times 787.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.555
So they each get their own row.

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:30.780
787.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.560
Looks like that.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.060
Then we have to
draw our lattice.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.790
Draw the lattice.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.050
Each of these guys get
their own column.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.830
Draw the columns
just like that.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.780
And then each one of these
characters got their own row.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.000
One row for the 7, one
row for the 8, and one

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.280
row for this other 7.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.520
Then we have to draw
the diagonals.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.470
Draw it like that.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.490
One diagonal, two diagonals,
so three diagonals,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.800
four diagonals.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.870
I think you get the idea
and than we have just

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.740
one, two more diagonals.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.110
We're ready to multiply now.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.790
So it's 9 times 7.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.970
I won't do it on the side here.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.240
We know our times tables.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.860
9 times 7 is 63.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.640
7 times 7 is 49.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.560
4 times 7 is 28.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.470
5 times 7 is 35.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.600
Let me switch callers
arbitrarily.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.350
9 times 8 is 72.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.210
7 times 8 is 56.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.970
4 times 8 is 32.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.850
5 times 8 is 40.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.850
I'll switch colors again.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.750
9 times 7-- we saw that before.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.050
It's 63.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.950
7 times 7 is 49.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.290
4 times 7 is 28.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.320
And then 5 times 7 is 35.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.940
We're done all of
our multiplying.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.210
Now we can switch our
brains into addition mode.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.860
Let me find a nice suitable
color for addition.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.270
Maybe a pink will
do for addition.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.520
So we start at our 1's place.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.005
Just have a 3 there, so you
write the 3 in your 1's place.

00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:24.730
You go to the 10's place.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.830
2 plus 6 is 8.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.620
8 plus 9 is 17.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.860
Write the 7 in the 10's
place, carry the 1

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.000
into the 100's place.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.420
I wrote a 1 really small here.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.240
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.930
4 plus 7 is 11.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.060
11 plus 6 is 17.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.590
17 plus 4 is 21.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.480
21 plus 8 is 29.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.780
Write the 9 in the 100's
place and carry the 2.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.690
2 plus 6 is 8.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.396
8 plus 9 is 17.

00:05:58.396 --> 00:06:02.290
17 plus 5 is 22.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.700
22 plus 2 is 24.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.060
24 plus 2 is 26.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.470
26 plus 5 is 31.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.920
Carry the 3.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.460
3 plus 4 is 7.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.160
7 plus 8 is 15.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.930
15 plus 3 is 18.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.730
18 plus 0 is 18.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.950
18 plus 3 is 21.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.110
Write the 1, carry the 2.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.520
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.110
4 plus 5 is 9.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.270
9 plus 4 is 13.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.610
Write the 3, carry the 1.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.450
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.430
And we're done.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.570
That easy.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.370
Well, there's two
advantages here.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.350
One is we got to do all of
our multiplication at once.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.090
And then we got to do all
of our addition at once.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.370
The other advantage is it's
kind of neat and clean.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.160
When you just do it the
traditional way with carrying

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.610
and number places, it
takes up a lot of space.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.850
But notice, we did our whole
problem in a nice, neat

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.130
and clean area like that
and we got our answer.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:09.900
Our answer is 4,311,973.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.870
There you go.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.630
Now in the next video we're
going to try to understand

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.550
why this worked.
