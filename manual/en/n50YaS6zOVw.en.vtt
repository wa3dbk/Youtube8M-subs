00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.600
The new Xbox One reveal, Sony and Nintendo
stock climbing as a result, and Final Fantasy

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.600
VIII for the PC.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.650
Hey guys, I'm Jess, and this is the Curse
Weekly Roundup!

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.610
Well, how 'bout that Xbox One?

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.840
Microsoft's next console opened to...a mixed
audience.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.820
Sure, we've got the die hard Xbox fans preaching
"just wait until they announce more games,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.231
you'll all RUE the day you insulted the Xbox
One!" and then we've got the larger, more

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:32.710
vocal group, saying "welp, I guess PS4's the
way to go!"

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.440
Well, we now know MORE deets about this next-gen
console - first, if you missed the announcement,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.180
go ahead and check out our butthurt-inducing
video recap which we'll link the description.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.950
Go ahead, pause this video for a minute and
go watch it.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.360
K are we all caught up?

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.020
Well, NOW we know that the Xbox One is NOT
backwards compatible, AND after initial installation,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.000
Microsoft will be charging a fee to link that
same game disc to a second Xbox Live account,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.930
meaning it's definitely limiting the market
for used games.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.881
It's also going to be HDTV-compatible only,
so you can't use it with a standard def TV,

00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:08.770
and Microsoft's Azure cloud services will
allow developers to make games that can't

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.859
be played offline, but the always-on thing
isn't a requirement yet.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:17.530
I'm not even gonna touch any of that, I'll
just leave you with this fun fact: Nintendo

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.420
and Sony's stock prices BOTH rose directly
after the Xbox One announcement - Nintendo

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.570
saw an increase of about 2.2 percent that
day, but Sony's stock rose by 9.3 percent.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.799
I think we all know that's PROBABLY not a
coincidence, but what do you guys think?

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.679
Leave me a comment and lemme know - is Microsoft
on their way out?

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.899
Did Sony just win the next-gen console war?

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.070
Moving on from the Xbox One...Final Fantasy
VIII is coming to the PC.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.310
Square Enix announced this week that the PC
version will have hi-res graphics, but no

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.239
news on whether there'll be any new features.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.969
It'll also make the Chocobo World mini-game
easier to access since with the PS2 version

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.219
you needed the PocketStation, which was only
sold in Japan or sometimes at anime conventions.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.679
This news is actually garnering some mixed
opinions - on the one hand, those who never

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.420
played VIII can now do so, but on the other
hand, this doesn't seem have add much in the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.690
way of replay value so it's not really bringing
anything to the table for prior Final Fantasy

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.690
VIII fans.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.690
What do you think?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.910
Pick it up or skip it?

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.910
Lemme know in the comments.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.240
Finally, flying under the radar of many, Dust
514 was released last week....on 5/14.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.720
Get it?

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.390
Well, if you're not aware, Dust 514 is an
FPS that takes place in the EVE universe - it's

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.739
a PS3 exclusive that actually integrates with
EVE Online - things you do in Dust can affect

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:30.909
EVE's world, and vice-versa.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.340
One of the coolest features of the game is
how customizable it is - choose your skills,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.439
weapons, even what kind of vehicle you wanna
use to take the enemies down.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.670
Oh, and did I mention it's free-to-play?

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.750
If you wanna know more about Dust 514, check
out our full game write-up, we'll link to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.750
that in the video description.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.769
And before I let you go, I just wanted to
remind you to check out our latest IRL video

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.080
if you haven't already.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.709
This one features me and James learning moves
from a pro MMA fighter - thanks to Alienware,

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.239
we got to meet Amir Sadollah and have the
workout of a lifetime learning to punch, kick,

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.359
and put each other in a choke hold.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.120
And it turns out, I'm stronger than I look
- watch teh video and you'll see what I mean.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.580
A huge thankyou to Alienware for making that
happen!

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.680
And that wraps up the Roundup!
