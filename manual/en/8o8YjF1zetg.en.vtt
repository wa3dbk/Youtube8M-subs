00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:05.492
please someone help me!

00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:08.421
Is there no justice in this world?

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:13.120
You called for justice, sweetie? Here I am.

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:13.823
What?

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:15.337
Who are you?

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:17.241
Hades, King of the underworld.

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.227
Hades?

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:19.468
Yes, in deed.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.259
But my friends call...

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.234
You have friends?

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.938
Be careful of what you say!

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.510
Whatever,

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.233
I'm here because of your problem, a really big problem.

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:32.323
Your boyfriend is almost dead, how tragic...

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:35.048
It's not fair, he dosen't deserve to die.

00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:39.025
Yes, his soul is very nearly to entering my kingdom.

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:42.486
I could torture him in any way imagenable but,

00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:46.853
I also could do something that would help him...

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:48.441
Could you?

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:50.741
But what do you want for that?

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.781
Oh, you got me.

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:55.029
Of course nothing is for free.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:59.318
But I don't want much, only your soul...

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.024
My soul? Never! I can't sell my soul...

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:04.352
So, you don't really love him?

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:05.637
Of course I love him!

00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:08.054
But you wouldn't do everything for him.

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:09.495
You exploiting him.

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:10.563
LIE!

00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:12.256
I... i...

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:14.434
Okay, you win.

00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:16.435
My soul for his life.

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:18.375
Terrific...!

00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:25.599
That the contract, sign here, here and somewhere down there.

00:01:25.624 --> 00:01:31.191
If you sign now, you get this sun-blocker and a crossing over the Styx.

00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:33.951
You should decide yourself now.

00:01:33.976 --> 00:01:37.031
underworld... new life...

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:38.802
Hey what are you doing?

00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:39.826
I'm reading the fine-print.

00:01:39.827 --> 00:01:42.986
NO! No! um.. No, that's not necessary.

00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:44.845
Just sign, okay?

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.564
Okay...

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:51.031
Um.. And now? Should I feel different now?

00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:55.496
Ah, if you feel any unwanted side-effects, just ask Hades baby.

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:59.272
And now go to your lover and spent the time you have left with him...

00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:00.974
Time I have left? What should that mean?

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:04.189
If you play games with me, you will get to know me.

00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:07.418
Don't worry, I only want the best for you.

00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:09.443
And now go.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.739
No surprise, you got banned for the Olymp, you're really strange.

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:13.432
WHAT!?

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:17.226
Nothing, i most go now, bye.

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.568
I you would know meg, my pumpkin.

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:24.833
You will help me to conquer the Olymp.

00:02:24.858 --> 00:02:26.858
You're mine.

00:02:26.883 --> 00:02:29.952
As soon as you lover leafs you or dies.

00:02:29.977 --> 00:02:33.971
That's what's written in the fine-print.
