hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.710
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.750
we're going to learn how to make coffee and cocoa mix flavor cookies

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.220
these are fantastic you pipe them and
they will come out super so let's go

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.880
ahead and learn how to make this coffee cocoa cookies. For this take 175 grams of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.559
butter, in this add 100 grams of icing sugar or powdered sugar rrr let

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.920
all the sugar fall... come on

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.969
see sometimes this too we're going to
mix this till the whole mixture becomes

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.079
nice and creamy. Here I've got 250 grams of all-purpose flour, in this 15 grams of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.329
cocoa powder

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.100
15 grams of the instant coffee powder okay you know and then we're going to mix

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.329
this you know if you want you can add
pinch of baking powder but this is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.360
optional you know you don't need to add
because we're going to add one egg in

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.570
this and then mix all of this now you
know this is very nicely creamed in this

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.799
add one egg and then just mix this in
this whole becomes a nice creamy

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.909
consistency you know you do not need to vanilla essence in this because we

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.259
want this nice awesome coffee flavor
from the instant coffee powder what we

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.540
add and scrape from the edges and now in this we're going to add this mixture of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.600
flour,  cocoa powder,  coffee powder and then we're going to mix this nicely if

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.030
you look at this mixture the mixture is
not that of a piping consistency see

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.159
what happens is the recipe you may have
to adjust little bit here and there to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.210
get the correct kind of consistency so
depending on the flour sometimes so this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.070
flour is absorbed more of moisture so
this is not ready for the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.960
piping consistency this is when you may have to add you know some moisture,  in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.910
this case I'm going to add some milk and
then mix this and bring it to a nice

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.170
piping consistency

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.280
now look at this mixture now you know with the gun you can easily make these

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.670
cookies but if you want to make it
slightly bigger you can make it slightly

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.849
bigger or make it smaller this ones

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.489
are OK. Pipe them onto this baking tray if you're doing on a regular tray you can

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.170
apply a little bit of fat and then dust it with little flour i'm using

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.640
silicon mats here so this is pretty
easy.  bake these cookies at 180

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.190
degrees centigrade for around 12
to 15 minutes. Dear friends you know

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.610
look at these cookies you know they're
fantastic and nice coffee and little bit

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.370
of mixed cocoa flavor and wow they are
much lighter than I expected

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:08.850
they are just melting away hmm you know
look at this star shape, the edges of the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.330
stars are nice and crunchy inside very
light. Dear friends I hope you enjoyed

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.250
