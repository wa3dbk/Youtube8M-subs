00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.619
the story of shocks

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.400
this is the story of the oldest and most
misunderstood fish on our planet

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.970
and how we miss to rethink our
undeniable exploitation and deep rooted

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.900
mistrust

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.199
to create a mutually beneficial
relationship between us and the shock

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.070
you see shots of kept marine ecosystems
imbalance for over four hundred million

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.379
years they eat all the disease fish and
they help keep cooper snapper and jacks

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.280
and barracuda and countless reef fish
population strong let's take a look

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.950
here's the trophy permits or food web of
the ocean at the bottom we have the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.160
primary producers all the creatures that
may come from the sun

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.929
they didn't like these guys will primary
consumers

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.720
which in turn get beaten but is that in
their consumers make grouper

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.840
which can be eaten

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.220
by the he picks predators like sharks
when they get old in can't swallow it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.869
olya and then there are humans we catch
all the sex for the defense

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.470
or so you think

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.100
here's the earth full of sharks in the
past and here it is now because of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.160
overfishing

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.010
most fishermen just do their best to
make a living so some goin katz acs on a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.600
long line

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.020
since all the money is in the fence
sometimes they're cut off in the rest of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.350
the shack is wasted drop to the ocean
floor

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.370
so they can take over ten years for a
shock to sexually mature

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.660
with another year to produce maybe just
one or two parks

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.760
overfishing really hurts a populations
chance of recovery

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.360
so he goes to a study at home and sells
one set of petrol and dorsal fins for a

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.740
little over a hundred dollars and then
they get shipped to asia

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.960
his friend over there takes the bins and
sells them at a higher price of the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.150
commitments of

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.990
uh... cells correct to back it doesn't
even take such a its so-called

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.880
david sticking defense and noticed
nobody is not that you have no interest

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.600
no none at all

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.850
so why do you get

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.090
it's because of status if you can afford
it you can show your friends how well

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.150
off you are

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.069
soul really fence equal social status

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.049
with the chinese middle and upper-class
growing so quickly

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.889
everyone can afford truck and soap
consequently the shot populations have

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.759
declined by up to ninety percent in the
past two decades due to this especial

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.719
increase in demand

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.219
back to the footwear

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.689
they're lowering the number of apex
predator sex acts which will

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.399
theoretically increase the population of
their prey might these be fish

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.459
or even cooper's

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.480
then the second yr consumers believe all
of their prey

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.729
and caused the crash in

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.349
their populations

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.619
resulting in a crash

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.609
in the grouper populations as well

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.400
when they have nothing left to be

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.269
what's left

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.450
some scientists think that a trophy
cascade like this one will result in a

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.219
lot of primary producers

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.419
seafood out the and other simple
organisms like jellyfish

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.719
so here we are causing a major imbalance
in meaningful systems on a global scale

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.839
is it worth it for some money and
chicken soup

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.009
let's take a closer look

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.639
he spends must be with a lot of money
for us to kill so many sharks

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.779
but how much is a life support

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.029
in the bahamas

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.879
up to two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.319
every year the bingham economy generate
seventy eight million dollars from chuck

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.779
related tourism paul because people want
to see shots and i had with them

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.189
people want to swim

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:22.790
with sharks

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.740
did you know that latest volcanoes
falling out of bed fall of coconut

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.039
and vending machines each kill more
people every year sucks

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.489
if you included the ecosystem services
that charts provide they would be worth

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.329
even more money

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.779
these figures i'd just from tourism
income alone

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.239
and many of these eagle tourists are
willing to pay

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.170
top dollar

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.329
to see healthy ecosystems

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.099
on top of that they put more money
directly into the local economy

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.299
and other kinds of short term tourists

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.290
this business to go to bed and breakfast
sebab operations or even farmers markets

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.359
through this greater involvement in the
economy these tourists help create jobs

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.290
and strengthened many aspects of the
business an agricultural communities all

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.649
thanks to shout

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.339
let's review what we've learned

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:12.239
sharks keep the reef healthy imbalance
leading to stronger fish

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.639
they provide lots of money for the local
economy

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.259
can provide jobs tent increase business

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.030
and they don't really kill people in
reality we kill between twenty six and

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.650
seventy three million tracks every year

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.289
a ball of chicken soup

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.159
in the end alive shrugged is worth more
