00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.870
Smartphones can be very smart.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.339
And while health related apps offer a wonderful

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.599
but dizzying array of ways to help your health,

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.780
can they actually detect Melanoma, the most
deadly skin cancer?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:22.180
Stay tuned!

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.490
There are more than 13,000 health care apps
marketed to consumers

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.640
in the largest online application store alone.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.800
In regards to Melanoma,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.870
many apps offer educational information about
melanoma

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.210
and skin self-examination and attempt to aid
the user

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.719
in tracking changes of skin lesions.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.540
These apps are great!

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.199
But there are also some that go the extra
step

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.370
and actually "diagnose" legions.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.879
Do you think they work?

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.769
What's your gut reaction?

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.449
If you've been watching DermTV, then you know
what my gut would say,

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.429
but more importantly, in a recent, very well
designed medical study,

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.159
the results were scary.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.160
To set the stage, four apps were tested.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.750
Three of the four apps evaluated did not involve
a physician

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.470
at any point in the evaluation

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.860
but instead relied on an automated algorithm
for analysis.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.300
In other words, a computer compared smartphone
pictures

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.870
to a database of biopsy proven melanomas

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.070
to determine if the lesion was ok or a Melanoma.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.570
As you might expect,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.110
these apps had appallingly low sensitivities
in detecting melanoma,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.240
ranging from 7 to 70%.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.360
That means that the app with 7% sensitivity
missed 93% of the melanomas

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.730
and called them benign!

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.180
Even the apps with 70% missed 30% of the melanomas.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.920
How would you feel about being in the 30%
because of an app?!

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.080
Sure, there are the usual disclaimers of “

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.640
for educational purposes only, not for diagnosis”

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.240
up the kazoo, but the reality is people believe
what they want to believe,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.950
which is that their spots are OK... not cancer.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.000
Now why is this so dangerous?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.429
Because if the app is wrong - which they clearly
often are -

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.159
and you're lulled into a false sense of security
about your spot,

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.269
it may result in delayed diagnosis of your
Melanoma,

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.239
which very sadly can be fatal.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.349
On the other hand, most melanomas when discovered
early are 100% curable,

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.459
just like Brandon’s in the DermTV espisode
showing the surgical excision of his.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.549
So don't rely on apps and never delay diagnosis.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.900
Make sure to have an annual skin cancer exam,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.939
and if you're concerned about a spot, see
your dermatologist.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:55.089
It very well may save your life.
