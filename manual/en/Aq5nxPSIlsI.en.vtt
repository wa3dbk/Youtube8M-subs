00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.560
Tada!

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.370
SIGMA 30mm F1.4 EX DC

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.450
It's a lens!

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.290
F1.4, it's this bright!

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:12.809
Oh!

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.400
There's even a len's pouch inside

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:19.930
Ahh, this.. I've waited about a year for this!!

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:23.660
I've wanted this for so so long..

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.370
The lens hood.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.780
I said it just now, but I've wanted this for a long long time!

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:40.890
And I've said before "I want this! I want this" but this was the first time using it..

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:44.730
And.. as expected...It's great!!

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.800
Teeehee!

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.830
It's so clear!

00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:56.130
It's completely light!!

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:09.720
Just now I went to my my other room, and it's completely dark, no light is entering the room...

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:12.590
But the photos are easily visible by anyone!

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.600
This is so suprising! The brightness of the picture is so clear!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.400
The focus is so good!

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.440
Everyone speaks highly about it, but now I understand!

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.380
But there is 1 thing..

00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:51.380
The len's end is about 40 cm

00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:55.420
I'd like it a little longer but after taking photos...

00:01:55.421 --> 00:02:01.700
It really is amazing!!

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.140
Maybe I should use this as my main lens?

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.770
I wonder if I should make a movie with this?

00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:19.180
It was worth waiting the 1 year.. I'm glad!

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:24.170
This was the SIGMA 30mm F1.4 EX DC
