00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.660
Ok, here we are with a fantastic game
called  Bert in Space.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.039
If anyone remembers 
games like Puzzle Bobble

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.259
very very similar but with a few twists.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.929
The idea is you're a little green alien dude
and some nasty aliens have stolen

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:30.999
your family.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.800
So you've grabbed yourself a jet pack
and a gun and now you're going to do 
something

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100
about it.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.440
The idea of the game

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.130
is to destroy all of the monsters

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.440
on each level

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.840
using your various skills

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.460
to complete the level. Very Angry Birds style
you get awarded stars depending on how well you do

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.980
combo points depending on how many
monsters you destroy

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.740
in a very short space of time.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.600
You can jump in the air and then
use your hover pack or your

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360
jet pack, should I say,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.260
to then just stay in mid air for a 
fraction of a second.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.290
Or a little bit longer.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.050
The levels get harder and harder
as you go along.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.010
Spring underneath them...

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.010
A great combo on that.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.540
I've noticed a few nag screens to ask
me to rate the game, download new

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.040
games, share on Facebook etcetera.
I don't mind too much

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.900
It's not too naggy.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.360
It only interrupts a couple of levels 
here and there.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.520
Most of the time it's kept down to just

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.330
the bare essentials.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.820
Don't mind that.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.519
It's actually a very good game I love
Puzzle Ball.

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.019
Trying to remember what the

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.229
other title was.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.979
It was very popular on the Amiga and
Commodore 64.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.790
Just can't quite remember the game now.
Let me know in the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.609
comments if you can remember it.. It
wasn't Puzzle Ball but it had exactly the same

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:26.659
game mechanic

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.539
and guys like firing

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.519
up into the air.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.389
Multiplayer, I think it's big
in the arcades as well.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.549
Maybe I am talking about Puzzle
Ball but I don't think I am.

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.479
Because Puzzle Ball involved the

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.409
oops, bit of slowdown there.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.199
little dragon if the memory serves.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.849
The one I'm thinking of

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.769
had a more human kind of character touch to it. You could play multiplayer in co-op mode.

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.699
I think if you are into these kind of
games or you are looking for something 
a little bit

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.619
different that hasn't really popped up on

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:05.599
mobile platforms too often so far, you might 
want to check this one out.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.309
Mostly because it's so good, just fun.

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.269
A actual game mechanic

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.949
that runs pretty fluidly. Couple of little 
slowdowns we've spotted 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.519
while  we've been playing.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.739
But by and large, very nicely done.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.489
There you can see one of the little nag screens, don't exactly last long

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.419
partly because probably

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.579
I've got a fast phone.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.659
So the load times aren't too irritating.

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.370
Nice graphics as well, very cartoony.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.129
Worries me a little bit 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.109
graphical style point of view

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.579
not a bad thing I don't think.

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.579
I could sit here just playing this for hours.

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.569
Number 13, unlucky for some.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.769
That is Bert in Space.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.559
I'm going to go now so I can try
and beat this level.
