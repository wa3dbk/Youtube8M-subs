Hi. Looking for a great way to enhance your
already beautiful face and body? Well, today,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.269
we're going to show you how to use glitter
on your face and body. Now, you want to make

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.160
sure that you don't overdo it with the glitter
because then you can ruin your look. So make

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.240
sure that you take it slow, apply a little
bit at a time and work your way up to the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.010
desired amount. Now, I have glitter here and
it's great for your face and your body. It's

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.769
not a chunky glitter. It's a very small and
dusty glitter so you can actually build upon

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:44.489
it as you go along. Now you want to make sure
that if you have a lot of fine lines and wrinkles,

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.679
you want to stay away from too much glitter
because the glitter will actually settle into

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:56.339
the lines and then you'll start to look very
prickly, very shimmery and shiny and this

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.510
is something that you don't want. What you
want to do is you want to use the glitter

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.100
to enhance or brighten your already beautiful
face. So a great way to do this is tap glitter,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.210
maybe, along the cheekbone like so, and then
dust away. Very softly. We don't want it to

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.170
be very, very strong. We want it to be very
soft. You can create that same look on the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.689
other side, tapping slowly, and brushing away,
thus creating a beautiful, lit under eye.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.289
You can dust it along the forehead, down the
bridge of the nose as well as the cheek. I'm

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:45.650
sorry, the chin. Now you can also use glitter
under the chin, on the neck, just to give

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.270
you a beautiful, sparkley look. If you're
wearing a low cut dress or a low cut top,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.409
this will just give you that extra shimmer
you need. Remember, don't apply too much too

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.210
soon, take your time, and apply just the right
amount. My name is Sylvia Russell and this

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.340
is how you can apply glitter to your face
and body.
