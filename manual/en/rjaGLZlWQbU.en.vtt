00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.379
Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. Todays recipe is almost guaranteed to

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.830
please the most fussiest of eaters.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.809
It is a lovely dinner recipe and im sure you will enjoy it. So join me today as i make

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.809
my version of cottage pie with sweet potato.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.849
We are going to start of by cooking our blade steak.

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.430
I have a fry pan here on a medium to high heat.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.359
give it a quick grease

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.480
I have cut our blade steak into bite size pieces so place those onto the pan.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.820
We are going to continue to stir fry these for about five minutes

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.550
just until the meat is cooked all the way through

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.090
Once the meat is cooked all the way through we are going to take it of the heat and just place the meat into a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.130
sealed container while we get started on the next step.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.610
next into a pot of a casserole dish

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.410
grease up the pot

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.300
Then to that add in an onion i have roughly chopped up

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.620
two stalks of celery

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.450
and our minced garlic

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.070
and cook these for a minute or two

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.840
just to soften up the onions

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.840
once the onions have softened up add in two hundred grams of diced tomatoes.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.500
then one and a quarter cups of red wine

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.070
Now if you don't want to use wine in the dish thats fine just

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.140
replace it with some chicken stock.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.900
so just mix that through

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.000
Now bring it up to a simmer and let it simmer away for about ten minutes just until the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.350
liquid reduces by half

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.210
What that will do is concentrate those lovely flavours.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.220
The liquid has been reduced by have so we are going to return

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.870
our steak to the pot

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.870
and then pour in our chicken stock

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.030
then add some salt

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.030
and some pepper

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.980
give that a very good stir through

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.540
if has been brought up to a boil so now I'm going to turn it down to a medium to low heat

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.970
and we are going to let this simmer away for two and a half hours

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.989
but after the first hour and a half we are going to place in our carrot

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.809
and during that time we are going to give it a good stir every ten to fifteen minutes

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.739
So place the lid on and let it simmer away

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.069
So it has been an hour and this smell

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.349
fantastic

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.949
so now place in our chopped up carrot

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:31.219
stir that in

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.029
Now place put the lid on and let it simmer away for another one and a half hours

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.909
The is about half an hour to go and what i have is a pot of boiling hot water on the stove

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.829
i have our sweet potato and what i have done is pealed it and cut it into smaller pieces

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.289
so carefully place that into the water

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.949
and we are going to let this boil away for fifteen minutes just until

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.259
its nice and tender

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:56.589
So if has been two and a half hours and again this smell

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.669
is unbelievable. So what we are going to do now is

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.399
grab all the solids out just drain them of and place them into a

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:08.339
another container we are going to seal up

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:12.529
and what we are going to do is bring this liquid back to a boil

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.489
What we want to do is reduce the liquid by half

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.010
now you well be wondering why we don't just pour out

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.399
half the liquid

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.619
The reason is we want to keep the flavours, so by boiling out the water

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.870
we will have less liquid but still have all the flavour

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.170
The liquid has been brought back to a boil and this should take about five minutes

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.049
to reduce by half

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.329
Into a mixing bowl place in our drained sweet potato

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.349
and our softened butter and our parsley that i have roughly chopped up

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.039
now using a potato masher

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.419
im just going to mash these up

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.679
just until their completely combined

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:51.919
The liquid has been reduced by half so now im going to return the meat

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.569
to the pot

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.499
and we are going to cook this through for about one to two minutes

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.449
just so the meat warms up a little bit

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.759
Next i have a baking dish here

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:02.559
now to that we are going to

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:03.879
pour in our

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.589
lovely meat mixture

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.349
and on top of that our mashed up sweet potato

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.279
and just

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.309
spread it out evenly

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.889
don't make it to neat you want it sort of
ragtag

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.110
Now we are going to place this into a pre heated oven at two hundred thirty

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.839
degrees celsius for twenty minutes

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:32.559
I have just taken this out of the oven and the smell that is filling up this room is

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:33.990
Fantastic

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.000
Now it does take a bit of preparation but by the smell alone this is worth it

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Lets give this a try

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.029
i'll tell you what

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.139
that meat was melting in my mouth

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.790
and the taste really is something you have to try

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.069
the time i put into preparing this, worth it

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.990
every single minute of it

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.080
but i can say with all honesty

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.949
This recipe tastes simple delicious

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.190
and its really not a hard dish to prepare

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.240
So give it a go because i guarantee you will not
