00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.110
Today we will prepare Ukrainian bratwurst. We need pork,

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:15.110
which you can grind in a meat grinder .

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.150
We add minced garlic cloves , a little blackpepper and salt.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.440
Salt is added at the rate of 18 grams per kilogram of meat.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.579
And thus prepared stuffing and cover with a lid, we send in the refrigerator for an hour.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:22.579
For stuffing we use collagen casing . 
It is made from natural raw materials.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.719
In my opinion, collagen casing is much more
convenient than the natural casing because

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.970
natural casings should be stored in special
conditions.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.130
Ukrainian bratwurst , which we are doing today, is prepared in a special way.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.030
We put collagen casing on special device (stuffer) on meat grinder for stuffing sausages.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.090
Sausage stuffed and now we roll sausage spiral and tied crosswise .

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.090
Thereafter, it is necessary frying pan or
in the oven at 200 degrees.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.090
Now I send our sausage in the oven. Here she
is ready 20 minutes on one side , and then

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.090
we're gonna get it, merge fat turn over and
fry the other side still 20 minutes.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.050
Now we need it for 6-8 hours to cool at room
temperature, then we have to put it in the refrigerator .

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.010
You can then slice and eat.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.010
This sausage is stored 5 days.
