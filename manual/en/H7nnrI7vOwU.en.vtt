00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.640
THE PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN
QUALITY

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.240
The PSA Peugeot Citroën Quality

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.800
Listening to our customers

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.880
1.7 million customers surveyed
in real time each year worldwide

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.880
My car is my main
means of transport

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.920
because I don't live in Paris.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.320
I don't really want it
to deteriorate over time.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.360
I want my car to stay
as good as new

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.280
and to start in a fraction
of a second

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.760
whatever the weather.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.960
That would be great.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.400
When designing
our ignition systems,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.400
with Stop and Start, with hybrids
and our international presence,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.680
we must answer
our customers' needs

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.320
and offer the same quality
year after year.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.280
Indeed.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.000
PSA Peugeot Citroën is equipped
with climatic testing facilities

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.280
in order to test
this ignition system

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.000
in the most extreme weather conditions
throughout the world.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.480
This helps us meet
our customers' needs worldwide.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.080
This is the Belchamp
technical centre

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.240
where we perform resistance tests

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.000
to guarantee the quality
of our vehicles.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.560
We conduct road tests
here on this speed track

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800
as well as specific tests

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.360
to check watertightness,
corrosion resistance,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.840
spurious noise
and many other aspects of the vehicle.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.680
We test 200 vehicles
over 2.5 million km before each launch

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.760
When I drive,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.520
hearing noises irritates me.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.680
All these clicking sounds...

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.680
I just want to be able
to enjoy the silence.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.800
These problems can be caused
by the sun's heat,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.240
when the car is parked outside
in summer.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.640
The various parts heat up,
expand and warp,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.840
which then creates spurious noise.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.040
That's why all our vehicles
are submitted

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.640
to artificial sunlight tests.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.200
The 4-jack testing bench
"ages" vehicles prematurely.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.320
It simulates every existing
road condition

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.040
and every weather condition

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.800
such as heat, cold and rain.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.040
2,500 hours on the 4-jack
testing bench before launch

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.280
This is the Belchamp
noise testing track.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.520
Our experts assess
our vehicles' quality levels

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.040
in terms of spurious noise.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.920
I would like seats

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.240
that look nice,
that do not wear off

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.920
and that stay comfortable

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.240
even if I use my car every day.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720
Here we are at the seats lab,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.240
where all resistance tests
are conducted.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.120
We have a panel of people
get into and out of the car.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.000
Once this data is collected,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.760
a robot simulates
people's strain on the seats.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.880
The Group has taken 3 steps
to guarantee

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.760
the quality of our seats:

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.360
the use of easier textiles,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.200
denser foam
in the side rolls of the seat

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.040
and in the central section

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.200
and a more traditional
stuffing process

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.880
with hand stapled
heads of seats.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.400
1,800 functional and visual
characteristics

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.480
controlled on each car
as it leaves the factory

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.760
I do ask for a lot of things.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.360
THE PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN QUALITY

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.000
