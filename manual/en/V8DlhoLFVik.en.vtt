00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.900
Welcome to CARP ZWOLLE.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.500
The Carp show, the largest
carp show in the world.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
CARP ZWOLLE is the largest carp show
in Europe, spread over 5 halls.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.000
People come from all over Europe to meet and speak with
their fellow carp fishermen, to look and to learn.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
CARP ZWOLLE is, of course, retailers, wholesalers, fishing
clubs and groups of people who love to fish for carp.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Travel Agencies.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
Everything that a fisherman, a carp fisherman
wants to experience is here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500
It's a real experience.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
We have 145 stands, from 8
different countries

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.500
If it's not here, it doesn't exist!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Guys, this is the way to show the people how
healthy the water in The Netherlands is.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Or how well the carp do here in The Netherlands
and how many people enjoy it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I say, walk round here and see for yourselves, this is really unique.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a much bigger show than anywhere else in Europe.
It puts the English shows to shame actually.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.000
The English shows are much smaller.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.500
You get people from all over Europe here.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We're talking to German guys, Norwegian guys , Polish
guys as well as obviously  Dutch and the Belgian guys as well

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.500
You make friends. You see the same guys each year.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We always have new things to show.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.500
It's a good atmosphere.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000
The first time I came to Zwolle was 2004.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.840
It's like a second home to me now.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.000
I've got a feeling for each show and always the Zwolle show is full, full with people.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.800
There's a vibrant atmosphere in Zwolle.

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.500
That's why I like it here.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.500
You can go to some shows and they're very quiet, but each
day on Saturday and Sunday it's usually packed.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
You can see the crowds behind us now, it's buzzing!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000
I think CARP ZWOLLE is a show like
you imagine a show should be.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.500
Not a small hall with a few stands.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.500
CARP ZWOLLE is a big show with many stands
where people can get information and can see everything.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.000
It's more than worth it to travel so many kilometres
because literally everything is here.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's a meeting place and it's the start of the season

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
After this, we get started.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
CARP ZWOLLE is ...

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
A brilliant excuse to come and meet a load of friends.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's a way of life, it's excitement, it's
experience, it's outdoor adventure.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.500
It's something ...

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.000
If you love and want to enjoy nature, really want
to be in it, then carp fishing is your thing

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.500
I love CARP ZWOLLE. A fantastic show.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
CARP ZWOLLE is the heart of carp fishing ...
