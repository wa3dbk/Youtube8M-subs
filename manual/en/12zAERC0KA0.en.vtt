00:05
COMM: With just a flick of a switch, Â£3000

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.290
of metal bounces up and down 8ft in the air.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.480
25 year old Alex Tuoson creates tees custom
low rider cars that defy gravity at his father's

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.619
shop Hoppos Custom Suspension Works.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.669
00:24
ALEX: we specialise in after market suspension

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.009
particularly Hydraulic air suspension.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.060
00:30
COMM: The low rider community emerged in the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.050
US in the 1950s.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.500
00:35
ALEX: we are actually a small, tiny group

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.290
of family, everyone knows everyone whether
your from Canada, Alaska I mean there are

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.290
guys that are low riding everywhere but overall
I mean it does look like a bigger scene than

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.869
it really is.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:54.480
The reason they got the name low rider is
because they would actually be driving so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.869
low, scrapping up their body and then from
there eventually grew into the culture that

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:00.050
we are in now.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.960
After market hydraulic pumps make the cars
go up and down with a flick of a switch so

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.200
you know it evolved big time.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.140
01:05
COMM: Alex removes the 12 springs from the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.749
car and replaces them with hydraulic cylinders,
the hydraulic system which operated and controlled

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:22.369
with a remote or dial under the dash board,
building one of these cars costs customers

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.130
anywhere between 2000 to a few $100,000 and
can take years to complete.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.219
01:27
ALEX: I personally know some guys that probably

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:38.820
have close to 200, 300,000 to a car and it
always starts off with wheels, paint, polstery,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.640
undercarriage, hydraulic set up and then from
there you start going into detail with everything

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.729
you just bought, so you buy a stock set of
rims and it just looks nice but let me do

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.979
something great here I've even seen a couple
of guys who are currently building impalas

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.389
with like Ferrari motors and stuff like that
so it does get crazy.

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:58.960
01:55
COMM: These heavily customized cars are clearly

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.089
designed to stand out and Alex welcomes the
attention.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:04.929
02:01
ALEX: being west coast you'd think they'd

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.460
kind of be used to it because west coast is
like car culture, its central right here you

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.700
know it never gets old for people when they
see it rolling down the streets I still get

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.920
a thumbs up every once in a while, its pretty
cool you know you get that reaction especially

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.060
because you put all that money into the car.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.140
02:17
COMM: Alex has been in the car business all

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.080
his life, helping his father around the shops
since he was a child.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.290
02:23
ALEX: I've been doing this since i was in

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.540
diapers honestly i grew up around it in the
shop, around the cars, eventually your grown

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.980
to grab the tools, help with this and help
with that, my dad has been a big influence

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.920
in my life as far as the car scene but full
time, full time I've been into it about 7/8

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920
years.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.340
02:43
COMM: And he plans to follow in his father's

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.620
footsteps and running the shop in the future.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.010
02:48
ALEX: My dad owns the company of course he

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.490
showed me the right steps doing in order to
get to the next level and not only building

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.130
a car in the business aspect to so eventually
he's going to hand down the business to me

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.350
when you build one of these you build it for
yourself its fun driving a low rider man you

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.330
cant there's nothing really else i can describe
you know you got to get in one and see the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.960
reaction for yourself.
