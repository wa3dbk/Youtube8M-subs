Get it out of your head. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.980
Don't come to Utah State.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.480
Why would you want to apply, are you mad? 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.880
Really, a degree?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.980
Why would you want to go to college. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.480
Stay exactly where you are, in this little box.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.180
Yeah, why don't you go where everybody else in your High School is going? Don't branch out. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.480
You don't want to make any new friends. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.980
Keep playing x-box. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.480

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.260
Commute.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.480
It's not like gas prices are through the roof or anything. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.480
Why would you want to make something  of yourself. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.520
That's ridiculous. 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.580
The back of your head is ridiculous.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.080
Location, academics....  

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.980
You don't care. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.680
Unless you really want to have the true college experience. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.730
Maybe you should reconsider.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.360
Maybe if you DO care about a quality education. 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.310
If you care  about a place where professor will work with you one-on-one and learn your name

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.440
If you care about meeting people. 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.460
Engineering, Education

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.380

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.080
Aggie Ice Cream. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.180
Good atmosphere

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.480
Going in a shopping cart down Old Main Hill. Riding a couch down Old Main HIll.

Space experiments. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.180
Lots of scholarship opportunities.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.080
Riding anything down Old Main Hill. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.480
Why would you want to go somewhere that would give you such a good deal? 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.980
If you care about getting the best bang for your buck...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.480
Then Yeah, maybe you should apply for Utah State. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.180
Get this! 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.970
Did you know that USU students graduate with the least amount of debt. 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.780
The least debt. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.980
The least amount of debt. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.010
In the whole United States.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.080
Least amount of debt? 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.980
Really? 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.880
They have statistics to prove it. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.480
 {whistling} 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.980
How important is your education. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.980
Think about it. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.180
You can't redo this.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.780
Hey, it's only your future. 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.780
I can't make this decision for you. 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.980
Don't mess this up.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.480
Apply to Utah State. 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.510

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.930
It's going to take you 15 minutes 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.080
to change your whole entire life.  Just 15 minutes.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.400
It's getting online, it's punching a few keys...

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.980
Punch the keys, just punch them. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.380
{It's really easy to apply}

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.680
That was my mom, she went to Utah State too. 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.890
Keep 'em on the home row, just type them in like that. Apply!

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.020
I mean, this is an incredibly important decision, so I'll wait. 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.980
Me too. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.180
I'm gonna be on myspace, or facebook, I don't know.  

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.320
I'm gonna show you what it's like to be a true Aggie.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.080
Hold on....  

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.170
{pbbtttt}

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.780
Deny. Deny.  

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.480
This is what it's like to be a true Aggie.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.610
And don't act like you're not impressed.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.080
{laughter} 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.330
Apply.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.590
Your next step is clear.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.290
Show people this video.  5 people, that's all I'm asking.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.040
If you send it to five people, and they send it to five people. 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.920
Those five friends will tell five friends and they'll tell their grandma

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.580
or they'll tell their dog. 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.280
It'll just keep going, and everyone in America will see me. 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.980
Five friends, do you have five friends? 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.980
I have 727 friends on facebook. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.980
Write on their wall, everybody loves getting a message on their wall.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.880
I'm pretty sure I'm going to send this to all 727 of them.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.980
Do you already go to Utah State, because if you do you should be telling other people about it. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.980
Let them experience what you have. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.980
It's a concept, it's crazy, I know, just tell five people. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.980
One. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.880
Two three

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.080
Four, five. Five. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.880
Five friends.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.630
That's all it takes. 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.980
Your future is in your hands. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.770
Where are you going to go?

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.180
So, this is a really good time to make that decision. Don't put it off.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.600
Investigate, and then make the decision, now.
