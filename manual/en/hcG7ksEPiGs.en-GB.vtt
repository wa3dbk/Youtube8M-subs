00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.500
-Pretty there in pink, I see.
-Thank you.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.450
Now obviously today is such a great event.
Are you honoured to be here?

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.150
Yeah, I'm really honoured to be here. I love
coming to these things just to hear all the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.369
amazing stories and see how the Prince's Trust
has helped.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.300
I've been an ambassador of the Prince's Trust
for about five years now, and I just think

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.200
it's important as a young person to be involved
with a charity because they are helping the

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.200
young people of this generation. And you know,
to just give support to it and spread the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.500
word and help young people feel that they
can have another chance.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.200
And obviously, lots of royals are around today.
Do you remember the first time you met a member

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.240
of the royal family?

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:53.000
Um... Yes. I think it was Princess Anne, I
think, and she was really lovely. It was at the...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Oh what's that show called? What's
that show where everyone performs in front of the Queen?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
-The Royal Variety.
-Yes, that's it! Sorry. My mind went blank.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.200
Yeah, I did that and she was watching, so
I got to meet her.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.920
But if you could go out with one member of
the royal family, who would it be?

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.979
-Go out?
-Go out like on a night out? Take someone

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.079
on a night out with you.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:19.000
Oh, Prince Harry sounds like he knows how
to have a good time. He knows how to party.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now, your new single is coming out. Very exciting.
I've seen you everywhere promoting your single.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.600
How excited are you about it coming out?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.049
I'm really excited. I can't believe it's actually
out, and that I'm just back with new music.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.700
So I spent a couple years away just writing
the album and perfecting it, and I didn't

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.000
want to release until I was 100% happy and
now finally it's out. I can't believe it. I'm excited.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.700
And is it weird being back on the scene again?
Because like you said, you've been writing

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.500
your new album. Is it really nice being back
though?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.439
It's lovely to be back because I get to perform
and do lots of shows again and that's my favourite

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.400
thing. So it's great to be back. I just can't
wait people to hear the work that we've been

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.000
working on for the past couple of years and
to hear the next singles and the rest of the album.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
-And you make an acting debut.
-Yes.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.700
Tell us a little bit more about that. That's
exciting.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.800
That was fun. I love doing things a little bit
different, and acting is definitely a hobby

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.600
of mine. I grew up doing it, so it was fun
to do it just as a little one off. I was in

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.760
a BBC Drama, and it was amazing just to work
with the rest of the cast because they're

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.300
all like fantastic actors and actresses, and
I feel like I learned so much from just that

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.200
little stint. If I ever went to do it again,
I could take all the experience with me.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.500
You're very multi-talented! And just one last
question, Cheryl Cole's back on The X Factor.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500
Do you think that's a good call? Are you happy
she's back?

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.700
Yeah, I think she was so loved when she first
did it. Everyone loved her. I think the nation

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.300
are just going to fall in love with her again.
She's so beautiful.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.400
Would you maybe one day like a role on the
judging panel? Would that be something you'd

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.810
like to do?

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.700
I don't know. I always think I'll cross that
bridge when I come to it because this year

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.000
I just want to focus on my music because I've
been so excited for people to hear it. Um, yeah.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Love the single. It's so good. Lovely to see
you have a great day.
