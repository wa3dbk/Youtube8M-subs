Welcome to Defoe-Graham! A primarily traditional-style residence hall

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.520
that hosts a diverse body of students from all over the world.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.175
Here's the main lobby: located on the ground level of the West side of the building.

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:24.935
On this floor you can find the front desk...

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.100
student mailboxes...

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.900
and a fully-equip kitchen, available for student use!

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.580
The laundry facility is also located on the ground level, and hosts many washers and driers

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.620
that can be operated with quarters, or student-charged with your student ID.

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:47.786
Each floor of Defoe-Graham offers its residents a common area, to study or socialize.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.760
Also available are smaller study rooms, for more focused academic work.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.780
"Nǐ hǎo!" My name is Bao, and I'm from China.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.374
Hi, I'm Tiffany. I'm from Kansas City, Missouri. "Komm herein!"

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.800
Here is a traditional two-person bedroom.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.460
Each unit comes furnished with two bunk-able, height-adjustable beds,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.020
two desks with included rolling chairs,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.980
a one-drawer pedestal,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.000
two 3-drawer dressers,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.180
two bookcases,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.720
and two closets with a shelf!

00:01:24.274 --> 00:01:28.674
In addition to the traditional double-rooms, a limited number of

00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:32.874
traditional single and single suite bedrooms are also available at Defoe-Graham.

00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:36.695
For more information, you can check out the ResLife website!

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:43.375
Though Defoe-Graham in a coed residence hall, the restroom facilities are not, and are designated for the appropriate gender.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.205
These community-style restrooms will feature multiple sinks, toilets and showers for resident use.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.240
In addition, Defoe-Graham has a prime location on campus, as it is located

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.960
right next to the Student Recreation Center, and the Mizzou Market on Hitt Street.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.980
Well, that's Defoe-Graham! Thanks for watching, and see you in the fall.
