00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:07.700
You have a graduated cylinder, which is filled
with water up to the 150mL mark.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.450
So there it is right there.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.150
Then you add a hunk of Iron, and the water
level rises to 425mL.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.039
And the question asks, what is the mass of
the Iron?

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.699
Okay, so we know we’re dealing with density
here so these are the three variables that

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.250
were playing with.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.050
The question asks us what the mass of the
Iron is.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.440
So we know it's going to be mass that we're
solving for, let's talk about how to get these

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.780
other two variables.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.600
Okay, we’re not given a volume for this
piece of Iron, alright?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.860
Instead, we talk about what happens with water
when we add the Iron to a graduated cylinder.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.340
You might remember this is one of the ways
that we can determine the volume of something

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.449
by putting it into water and seeing how much
the water rises, okay?

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.460
We have to do a little bit of math but that's
how we're going to figure out the volume of

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.120
the other piece of Iron by looking at how
much the water in the graduated cylinder moved.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.360
So that's how we're going to figure out the
volume.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.590
Now in order to get mass we are also going
to need to get density.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.800
This tells us that we're dealing with Iron
in the problem but it doesn't tell us the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.260
density of Iron so what do you do?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.970
Well it turns out that it's really easy to
find the densities for common materials.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.300
You can get it off the internet, you can get
them in books and stuff.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.890
Even though the question doesn't give us a
density, we can easily figure it out.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.280
So that's how we can get these two variables
and then we're going to be able to figure

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.890
out what the mass is.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.960
So the first thing I want to do is I want
to figure out the volume of the piece of Iron

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.130
and we can do that by looking at the water
levels.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.750
So we're going to take the final water level
and subtract the initial water level from

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.130
it and that's going to tell us how much went
up and that is going to be equal to the volume

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.240
of the Iron that we put in there, okay?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:12.450
So, volume of the Iron is going to be the
final reading which is 425mL minus the initial

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.810
which is 150mL and how much it changed is
going to be 275mL.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:28.319
Now, when we're talking about volume and density,
we often use cubic centimeters or centimeters

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.430
cubed instead of milliliters.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.999
These units though are exactly the same quantity
so all I got to do is just rewrite milliliters

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:42.159
as centimeters cubed and there is volume for
the Iron, okay?

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.499
So now I have a volume for the Iron, 275 cubic
centimeters and now only the density.

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:54.240
I can just look this up online really easily
and I find out that it’s 7.87 grams per

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.730
cubic centimeter so now I'm ready to go.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.810
I’ve got the two things that I need.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.090
So I’ll start with the volume which is 275
cubic centimeters.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:16.689
Now I like to use the density as like a conversion
factor to go between volume and mass so let's

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:23.010
look at the two ways that we can write the
density as a conversion factor to go from

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.030
volume to mass here, okay?

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:34.670
Density of Iron is 7.87 grams over cubic centimeters
which means we can rewrite this as over 1

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.300
centimeter cubed, okay?

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:47.180
We can also flip this fraction so we do 1
centimeter cubed divided by 7.87 grams.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.400
Which of these do you want to use?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.620
This one or this one?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.260
Well, we're hoping to cancel out cubic centimeters
and be left with grams so that means since

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.660
cubic centimeters is on the top here we're
going to want to choose the version of the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.299
density conversion factor that gives us centimeter
cubed on the bottom.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.299
Here it is right here.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.700
We going to use this one.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.200
So now when I multiply through, centimeters
cubed down the top, centimeters cubed on the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.930
bottom, so they cancel out and I'm left with
grams.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:26.380
I'm going to do 275 times 7.87 divided by
1 and answer’s going to be 2164.25.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.380
What do I round this to?

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.110
I’ve got three sig figs here, three sig
figs here, 1 is a counting number is part

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.960
of the definition here so we don't worry about
it.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.290
So I'm going to do two-thousand, rounding
it to three sig figs, two-thousand-one-hundred-sixty---the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.970
sixty stays the same because there is a four
here and I replace the four with zero.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.050
2,160, what are the units here?

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.980
I canceled out centimeters cubed so I’m
left with grams.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.940
2,160 grams is the mass of the Iron.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.130
Just to review this really quickly, we needed
the density of Iron.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.390
We got that from the internet that was easy.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.280
And to figure out the volume of this piece
of Iron, we had to look at how much the water

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.620
level rose when we added the Iron to the graduated
cylinder and from that we could figure out

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.370
the volume of the Iron, then we use density
as a conversion factor to go from volume to

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.710
mass.
