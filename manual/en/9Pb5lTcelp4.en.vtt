00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.680
Astro Shark is the unlikely love story between
a shark that looks like a killer whale, and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.850
a dog.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.940
Hold on, it doesn't stop being weird there.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.480
So one day the dog is kidnapped and then the
kidnappers escape with it in a rocket.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.970
Not one to let this slide, the shark engages
its hydro thrusters and rockets off into the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.540
cosmos after it.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.440
Apparently whale sharks can breathe in space.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.670
So on the surface this game seems like another
orbital flinger where you use the momentum

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.730
of traveling around planetoids to traverse
the universe, but as a positive surprise,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.050
Astro Shark is a game that expects mastery
of its mechanics as each level throws progressively

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.000
harder challenges at you.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.960
This was not expected from this style of game.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.460
Each level you need to follow the cries of
Laika only to find out from another space

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.010
animal that she's in another galaxy.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.440
Tapping and holding the screen on an asteroid
will cause you to circle around it until it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.030
crumbles (as not all are stable) or till you
release your finger and fly off in an arced

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.030
direction.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.690
As you fly around, the kidnappers shoot missiles
at you.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.500
You either need to gain momentum by weaving
through asteroids to escape them, or trigger

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.870
a mine (or an ice planet) to disable them.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.469
This weaving and gaining speed by tapping
asteroids for a second on your way through

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.242
while adjusting your direction is one of the
more fun aspects of the game, and you will

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:21.460
need to master this and other little uses
of the game's physics engine to make it to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.310
the end of each stage.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.619
It really is a pleasant surprise to expect
a light arcade game with some physics mechanics

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.270
and find a deeper experience that requires
a certain level of learned expertise from

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.479
its player.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.479
Now it's still not an exceptionally deep experience
so it's not going to pull in that subset of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.229
the gaming population, but it is more difficult
than probably most physics based arcade gamers

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.039
on the iOS are used to.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.990
This might be a detriment, but flying through
space is a lot of fun, and especially in the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.609
later stages, you feel a sense of accomplishment
when you reach the end.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:02:00.520
I'd say give this one a play and see if it
interests you.
