00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.090
During the survival horror boom of the 90s,
developers were thinking up whatever situation

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.860
they could to place heroes in overpowering
danger and have them fight for their lives.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.610
Capcom was great at this with Resident Evil
and decided to make a new series off that

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.270
it, but simply change the enemies.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.930
So many people bash this game as simply Resident
Evil with dinosaurs instead of zombies.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.280
And my argument has always been, holy cow,
itâ€™s Resident Evil with dinosaurs.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.180
What could be cooler than that?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.320
You play as Regina, a soldier sent to a secluded
island with a recon team who are charged with

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.690
investing the facility on the island.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.331
Soon, trouble happens and Regina and company
realize there is more to the island and that

00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.390
they are in for the fight of their lives.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.140
The game plays very similarly to a Resident
Evil game, with the fixed camera and control

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.140
system.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.430
It even has the loading screens showing your
characters opening a door.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.920
But the game does show some new moves, like
the camera will do a cool trick and follow

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.360
Regina down some corridors.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.780
It is little things like this that make the
game feel unique and its own.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.100
But the game does pull a big time bait and
switch on you.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.390
If you ever saw an ad, or read the back of
the jewel case, you would think that this

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.950
is going to be non-stop dinosaur killing action.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.700
Where in reality, it is quite the opposite.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.910
You see, even with all her skills, Regina
does as well one on one against a velociraptor

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.970
as you or me would.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.700
And that is to say, not very well.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.030
So at least for the beginning part of the
game, you will come to fear the dinosaurs

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.500
rather than anticipate them.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.780
You turn a corner and hear a growl, and most
likely you are planning your escape route

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.700
rather than your attack strategy.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.120
And that is one thing I really liked about
this game.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.250
Resident Evil had slow, groaning zombies that
would get you with numbers.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.099
Here, that fear is there when you see one
dinosaur, making the entire game super intense.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.579
Throw in the massive amount of puzzles that
will leave you scratching your head, and a

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.200
climactic fight against a T-Rex, and you have
one very entertaining game.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.700
Dino Crisis is one of the highlights of the
survival horror genre, doing what survival

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.200
horror should, having you grip your controller
the entire time.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.260
You never feel safe which makes you fear the
next encounter because your next encounter

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.739
could very well be your last.
