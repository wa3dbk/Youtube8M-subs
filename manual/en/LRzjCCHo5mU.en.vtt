00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.220
Hi I'm David Tomov-Strock of Boston University's
Food and Wine Experiential Program

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.210
and I'm going to show you how to carve your
turkey for Thanksgiving.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.639
So what I have here in front of me

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.740
is a 14 pound turkey that I've roasted.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.390
It about three hours to roast at 350 degrees.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.230
First thing I want to mention is that you
don't actually

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.460
want to cut into your turkey right after you
pull it out of the oven.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.900
Let that turkey rest.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
Next thing I want to talk about are the tools
you'll need to carve your turkey.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.810
The first thing you need is a carving fork.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.310
It's going to be great for stabilizing the
bird.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.640
The next thing you need is a good, sharp knife.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330
If you can either use a chef's knife like
this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.020
or you can use a long thin knife.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.660
Today I'm going to be using a chef's knife
to do this.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.150
I'm first going to pull of turkey leg.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.970
Stick the fork right into the drumstick, right
behind the bone.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.980
And we're going to slice very gently, where
the skin is quite taut

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.410
between the drumstick and the breast.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.190
Push the fork a little bit firmer

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.830
and pull at the leg a little bit.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.610
that will help you find the joint.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.660
What you'll see is a white piece of cartilage
and that's where you want to cut.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.520
And what we want to do now is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.200
separate the drumstick from the thigh.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.850
With the thigh, we're going to align the bone
so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.710
that it's pointing away from you.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.020
And then we're just going to slice the meat.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.719
and when you get to the bone, just turn it
around

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.219
and the thigh meat isn't always going to come
off very nicely.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.149
It's going to fall into little pieces, like
that and that's fine.

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.290
just gather that up on your knife and put
that right over onto your platter.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.600
Next thing you can do is to slice the breast.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.149
And you can either keep the breast on the
bone

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.700
or what you can do is you can take the breast
off.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.490
First we're going to start with keeping the
breast on the carcass.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.189
So you want to take your fork.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.390
You can stick it in like that or you can push
it along the edge.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.810
It's mostly just to stabilize the bird.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.399
And then you're just going to slice straight
down.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.630
Then as you get the slices, you can put them
right onto your platter.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.479
But the problem with that is you can see right
here

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.670
it falls apart more easily because you are
cutting

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.579
with the grain, and so you are going to end
up

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.420
with smaller pieces like this.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.979
And you'll just keep right on going until
you get to the breast bone.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.290
And you don't have to worry about going all
the way to the bone.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.860
That's the meat you can save for your leftovers
for making salad or sandwiches or to use in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.860
a soup.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.610
Now I'm going to show you the other method
of slicing the breast,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.030
which is to remove the breast from the carcass.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.460
So I'm just going to turn this around.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.720
I'm going to grab hold of the leg with my
fork

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.000
and then slice into the skin until I find
that opening.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.810
So we have that separated.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.670
Now we can cut the breast off.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.340
Find the breast bone which is just going to
be the line right down the center of the bird.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.280
We're going to just start slicing right in.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.440
You don't necessarily need to get the full
breast off of there.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.540
It's ok to leave a little bit of meat on.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.930
Now that you have the breast,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.670
grab hold of it with the fork and just slice.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.910
And this is much neater slice.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.200
The meat will stay together much better

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.310
and you get a little bit of crispy skin with
each slice.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.040
Now that the whole thing is sliced just slide
your knife

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.760
right underneath the whole breast

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.870
and put it right on.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.620
And then you can fan it out a little bit so
that you can see pieces of meat.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.820
So now we have the whole platter of turkey
in front of us and we're ready to serve our

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.910
thanksgiving dinner.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.350
Enjoy.
