Since we're talking about Mexican folklorico
dance, we're going to now incorporate some

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.809
of the steps we learned earlier with our skirt,
the relationship with our arms and torso,

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.041
with our feet, with our spotting that we did
earlier. Our first step that we were doing

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:24.550
where we talked about heel and toe, heel and
toe, flat foot, flat foot. We'll also talk

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:51.900
about the single waltz. So with our skirt.
The double one. We're going to learn a couple

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.420
new steps and we're going to start up with
tornio, which could be translated as screw.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:07.750
What we do is we put our heel right in front
of us, we twist it, screw. Twist it as a screw.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:17.580
We put our left foot with a flat sound on
the back, then we put our right toe back.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:33.020
So we screw with our right, flat left, toe
right. So that's the screw. With our skirt,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.850
we can use it very simple as we were talking
keeping our elbows up. We could turn with

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:55.700
that. We could use only foot or we can use
both. Also, the cross step. It's very simple.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:08.259
You just cross, cross. This is all flat crossing.
Remember to keep your torso moving. Don't

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:18.970
keep it stiff. It's very loose. You can add
your arms. Also, a really, really important

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.170
part of Mexican folkorico dance would be what
is called remate or your finale. Any state

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.610
of Mexico uses that. If it's Jalisco, which
is what we're using and talking about right

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.480
now. If it's Chiapas, Veracruz, if it's from
the north part of Mexico, from the south,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.200
mostly everybody uses this step. Usually what
it is you turn around on yourself, you cross

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:01.900
right over left, and you stamp or do a flat
foot with your right foot. So pam, pam, pam.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:13.599
So right, left. You will cross, right, left,
cross, right, left. What your arms are doing.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:21.470
They're crossing with you. You're keeping
them even. Your skirt is slightly on top of

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:33.640
your elbows and on your hands. So you're crossing
and doing the finale or remate. Let's see

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.599
that again. You're crossing, remate. Right.
