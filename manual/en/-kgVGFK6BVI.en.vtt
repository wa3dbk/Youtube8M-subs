- Ouma condensed milk
(speaking foreign language).

00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:08.585
- Oh, my condensed milk
(mumbling) biscuit?

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:09.191

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:14.191
("Stinger")

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:17.978
- How much alcohol is in this

00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:19.604
because I wanna get turned.

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:21.127
- It's refreshing just to look at it.

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:22.918
- Yeah, it's just gorgeous.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:23.728
- Alright.

00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:25.801
- What do they say in
South Africa, cheers?

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:27.102
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:28.885
- This is very good.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:30.001
- This is fine, whatever.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.972
- Damn, bitters and juice.

00:00:31.972 --> 00:00:34.147
- It's like drinking a soft gust of air.

00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:36.118
- If you told me I was
drinking alcohol right now

00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:36.848
I would believe you.

00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:38.734
- I would too, and I'd get fake drunk too.

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:41.297
("Stinger")

00:00:41.297 --> 00:00:42.191
- [Man in Glasses] Biltong.

00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:43.675
It looks like cool bacon.

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:45.767
- It's like stained glass of meat.

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.510
- When your fingers get
really shriveled from water,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.257
this is what they feel like.

00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:52.569
- You OK there?

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.626
- I could eat all of this.

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:54.601
- It's hard to get through.

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.369
- It tastes like, "It's bacon!"

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:57.425
What is that, Beggin' Bits?

00:00:57.425 --> 00:00:58.177
- Oh yeah. Bacon, bacon, bacon.

00:00:58.177 --> 00:00:59.050
Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.651
- It's like you set up to make some jerky,

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:04.434
but after a day you get impatient

00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:06.076
and so you're just like,
oh it's good enough.

00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:07.946
("Stinger")

00:01:07.946 --> 00:01:09.712
- [Man in Brown Jacket] Peck's Anchovette.

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:11.476
- No, why?

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:14.260
- So, they're only girl
anchovies in there.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.093
Oh!

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:16.571
- It smells like what
they would feed penguins.

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.451
- Uh, this bread was so good until now.

00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:21.071
- I like that.

00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:24.388
- I don't.

00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:25.737
- It just feels and tastes like pate.

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:27.404
- When do they eat this?

00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:29.171
When children have been naughty?

00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:31.689
- A bunch of fish washed up on a beach,

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.904
and then rotted there for a couple days,

00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:35.895
and then we just ate
the sand underneath it.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:39.208
- Pilchards and/or
mackerel and/or anchovies.

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:41.340
Lot of and/or's in there.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.631
- Yeah, so we definitely
just ate some dolphins.

00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:45.891
("Stinger")

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.086
- Rusks, that sounds so
good, right, look at this,

00:01:48.086 --> 00:01:50.382
(laughing) this little old baker woman

00:01:50.382 --> 00:01:52.250
who's just up to no good.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.018
That's what I imagine a prettier version

00:01:54.018 --> 00:01:56.070
of the witch who ate Hansel and Gretel.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.732
- It sort of looks like
Diglett, like the Pokemon.

00:01:58.732 --> 00:02:01.007
This is the evolved form of Diglett.

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:02.917
- Smells like those crackers
you get at the pediatrician

00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:04.421
when you were good,

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:05.843
and they'd be like, "Here's
a delicious cracker."

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:07.752
- Someone had insurance.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:08.606
- Cheers.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:09.479
- Oh my gosh.

00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:10.922
- Holy smokes.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.198
- You gotta have a bite to eat this.

00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:14.072
You have to have teeth.

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:15.208
- I would like to break this up

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:16.672
and crumble it over some ice cream.

00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:17.687
- Oh yeah!

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:19.800
- I feel like I would eat
this under circumstance,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.694
but if I had a choice,

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:23.412
I wouldn't be like, "Give me the Oumas."

00:02:23.412 --> 00:02:24.981
("Stinger")

00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:28.679
- This looks like what
everything we ate becomes.

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.954
- It looks like a giant Slim Jim.

00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:33.372
Or just like, I guess
it would just be a Jim.

00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:36.013
- This is like sausage that
your grandpa forgot about.

00:02:36.428 --> 00:02:37.636
- Oh!

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.104
- Tree bark exterior.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.616
- Nice moss interior.

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:44.008
- Oh, what's that flavor?

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:46.559
- Woah.

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.102
- If you heat this up, you
put some ketchup on it,

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:50.155
and maybe some mustard and a bun.

00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:51.576
Get a pretzel bun.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:52.673
- Put some anchovette on it.

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.796
- Ohh, I wouldn't do that.

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:57.630
("Stinger")

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.398
- Right off the bat these remind me of

00:02:59.398 --> 00:03:02.161
Flotsam and Jetsam, or
his little evil friends.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:02.893
- Is it fried?

00:03:02.893 --> 00:03:04.392
It smells like anything
that you fry in oil.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:05.615
- It definitely is fried, right?

00:03:05.615 --> 00:03:06.449
- OK, Minsby.

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.317
- Mmmmm, finally.

00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:09.780
- These are even better than the rusks.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.430
- Dog food.

00:03:11.122 --> 00:03:12.218
- Kinda, right?

00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:13.438
- Straight up dog food.

00:03:13.438 --> 00:03:15.062
- This is (bleep) wonderful.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:15.753
- What?

00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:17.068
- Everyone loves dough.

00:03:18.638 --> 00:03:20.467
If I could eat the Dough Boy, I would.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:21.909
- [Man in Glasses] I feel
like everything we ate

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.307
was something you eat when
you're exceptionally drunk.

00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:27.131
- Every single South
African food is amazing.

00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:28.065
It's so good.

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:30.032
- [Woman with Black
Hair] This is a miracle.
