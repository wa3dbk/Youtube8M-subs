00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:18.099
A cash investment is really a very safe way
to invest your money so it grows and earns

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.140
a little bit of interest.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.990
Now let me give you a few examples, bank savings
account is a cash investment, a money market

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.519
fund is a cash investment.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.500
In other words with cash investments the value
of your account is not going up and down each

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.180
day, but you are earning some interest on
that money.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.430
The drawback of a cash investment is that
you're really not earning a lot of interest,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.690
so if you want your money to grow at a greater
rate, then at 1 or 2 %, they you really have

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.000
to look at other types of investment to do
that over the long term.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.920
So, what is a cash investment appropriate
for, any money that you have set aside for

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.780
an emergency fund or a rainy day fund that
should be in a cash investment.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.489
You don't want to invest that money in a stock
market where it could be tied up or there

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.250
could be big fluctuations in value.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.320
You want that somewhere where you can at that
right away if you need to.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.930
Another good use of a cash investment would
be the down payment for a home or an apartment

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.500
that you're buying.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.679
If I had $30,000 set aside for the down payment
on a home purchase, that I'm buying a year

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:22.679
from now.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.160
Again, I can't invest that money in the market
in a way where it could go up and down and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.850
put it at risk.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.510
But I do want to earn as much as interest
as I can in the mean time, so that would be

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.610
appropriate for a cash investment.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.240
Now if I'm saving money for my future, my
future retirement, twenty years from now and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.690
I put my money in a cash investment that's
earning 1 or 2%, and the cost of things are

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.520
going up, that's called inflation and inflation's
3 or 4 %. I think you can see where I'm going

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.041
with this, I ‚Äòm earning 1 or 2%, the
cost of things are going up at 3 or 4% and

00:01:57.041 --> 00:01:58.720
every year I'm falling behind.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.020
And so a big mistake people make that have
a long time until they retire is they're often

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.629
investing their money in their cash investments,
because they're not sure what else to do with

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.629
it.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.130
And I've seen plenty of clients where ten
years go by and the money only earned 1 or

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.170
2% a year and their retirement savings really
isn't growing at all.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.750
So remember for cash investments stick to
something really safe, bank savings accounts,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.270
money market accounts a really good place
to look, earn as much interest you can in

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.030
the mean time, but make sure that money is
only for short term goals, money that you're

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.340
going to need in the next year or two.
