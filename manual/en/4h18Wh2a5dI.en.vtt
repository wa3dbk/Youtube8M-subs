00:00:01.906 --> 00:00:04.009
-No, no... Gentle butterlflys...

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.269
No ! No ! No ! Minute Papillon(Hold on Butterlfy) !

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.954
-Hold on Butterfly !

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:07.665
Yesterday, I had a dream.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:08.873
I have a Dream...cast !

00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:09.740
When I farted, I teleported !

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.906
Well, I know, it's a bit rubbish : but one doesn't chose his dreams !

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:14.189
Sometimes, they're nice.
Other times... Well, they're nice...

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.202
No no no : the really cool stuff was that I became
a movie star in (English accent) L.A !

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:19.505
L-A... La... Los Angeles...

00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:22.234
Yeah no, cause strangely,
I didn't dreamt of becoming a movie star in France.

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.237
Though we have a very big 
cinematographic production...

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:26.336
But it lacks wonder ! Sparkling eyes !

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:29.249
You will admit that, 
if you chose the French movie,

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.234
you got a chance to see what happened to you that morning.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:35.218
For the sake of realism the starring actress is
as seductive as your neighbor... Hello sir !

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:39.573
And humor is on a level with your drunk friend...
When he's too drunk... [mad laugh]

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:40.897
But it's true that he's funny this idiot.

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:43.104
No no no no no no no !
Here, in my dream, it was... [fart]

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:44.418
Hollywood !
-Hollywood...

00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:45.941
-It kicks some mexican ass over the border !

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:47.379
Hollywood : capital of dream.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.341
Los Angeles : capital of stars.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.162
California : capital of excess !

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:53.263
United States !... Huh... Capital of... fat ?

00:00:53.263 --> 00:00:56.857
It was a little bit Mr Helicopter hollydays.
-HELICOUPTAIR ! HELICOUPTAIR ! [fart]

00:00:56.857 --> 00:01:00.875
-I had just became a very big star !
-Yeah that's right, I live in Los Angeles.. Correct : Like Dany Boon.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.243
Huh ? What ? No. Dany what ?
-Hello neighbor !

00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:04.623
Wait wait wait wait ! I've nothing against Dany Boon :
He's really funny !

00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:06.408
But as the most payed French actor, it is not dazzling...

00:01:06.408 --> 00:01:11.031
-HELICOUPTAIR ! HELICOUPTAIR !

00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:12.610
-Sacred monsters have deserted our screens...

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.780
De Funes, Bourvil, Coluche, Jean Gabin !
Well, it's true that these ones are dead...

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.159
Delon, Belmondo !
Well, them, maybe they're a bit old now.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.898
Ah, Depardieu !
Note : He really has deserted... [fart]

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:24.353
Nowadays, you have to have done stand-up comedy or television 
to be under the spotlights, and it's often a shame.

00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:28.652
For example, nostalgics of Pierre Richard's movies, 
or "Le DÃ®ner de Cons" with Villeret or even "Le Placard" with Daniel Auteuil...

00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:30.298
You have to admit that recent Francis Veber's movies are pathetic.

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:32.184
Look, why cast Gad Elmaleh,
one of the most attractive French man,

00:01:32.184 --> 00:01:33.700
according to French women : I don't care about that,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.700
to play the role of FranÃ§ois Pignon ?
It doesn't fit for one second !

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.069
On the contrary of Patrick Timsit, he's got the looks for the part...
But his acting sucks.

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.788
In fact, he can only play Patrick Timsit...
And Patrick Timsit, his acting sucks...

00:01:41.788 --> 00:01:44.137
At least Dany Boon, why not.
-FranÃ§ois Pignon, buddy !

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:47.148
But they might very well put him with Arthur those pricks...
Uh ? What ? Already done ? [fart]

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:48.404
Yes, I'm criticizing Gad Elmaleh !

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:50.087
Yeah, I like to criticize guys that everybody like !

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:51.983
Yeah, I'm a prick ! Huh ? No !

00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:53.939
But hey, that's what it takes for producers
to invest money in a movie.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.445
It's even way more important than scenario !

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:57.647
Wait, why am I doing that ? And what are we doing here ?
But who wrote this ?

00:01:57.647 --> 00:02:02.001
-And here's Dany Boon introducing his latest trendy K-Way,
it totally reflects his character ! [fart]

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.645
-We give crap to the CEO that leaves with
millions of euros in golden parachute,

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.182
when he made his company 
win 100 or 1000 times more !

00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:10.368
First, put 10 million in a parachute, even a golden one,
I think it's a bit silly.

00:02:10.368 --> 00:02:11.920
If anything, the guy doesn't even own a plane !

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.171
-HELICOUPTAIR ! HELICOUPTAIR !
-Oh yeah, maybe he's got a helicopter...

00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:19.316
But as for the humorist, self promoted actor, who's paid 
the equivalent of the movie's entire benefits, not a word !

00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:21.984
Ah, but you gotta have some common sense my litle lady ! [fart]

00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:23.823
I completely agree with cuting off golden parachutes,

00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:26.124
but gotta keep a bit of rationality between different domains.

00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:27.836
To keep alive the French cultural exception, yes !

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:29.945
But maybe stop paying millions 
people who are not worth it.

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:32.384
For sure, they're not yet paid as much
as the biggest American actors, like me...

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:35.421
But when we make a movie, hey, the movie cashes in !
And blam ! And... [fart]

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.057
On the same subject, there is soccer players :

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:39.392
why give millions to somebody
who can't even count that far ?

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:44.114
Mister Benzema ? Stay up : let's talk seriously...
How far can you count... 25 ?

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:46.872
Yes, because you are 25, of course...
Then it will be your salary !

00:02:46.872 --> 00:02:51.338
-Wassup, Ribery ! Loverboy ! I earn more than Benzema
because I'm older, that's all what I say ! [fart]

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:54.430
-The perk of being a star is to be cuddled.
You can even take advantage of the situation...

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.579
And people owe you respect ! Let's go, thanks girls !
I got a movie to shoot. Action ! [fart]

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.705
We often criticize GŽrard Depardieu, 
but I think he's planing to play the role of DSK for free.

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:02.820
And that's not the first time he's doing it to help a movie come to life !

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.966
Yeah, however, this movie will be shitty for sure,
on account of the crappy story...

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:07.273
-Come on, get in...
But I hope you don't mind that I stay,

00:03:07.273 --> 00:03:08.552
DICK OUT, while you clean the room...

00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:11.781
Personally, I like Depardieu's loathsome side :
half drunk, half dirty. [fart]

00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:17.233
What ? Oh, toilets ? Uh yeah, too much teleportation,
it was bound to happen... [crazy laugh]

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.343
I'm not anti-French though...
On the contrary, I'm even a bit chauvinistic !

00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:21.539
COME ON BLUES !
I love our culture, our humor... [fart]

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.139
Our culinary arts and our wines...
And I don't recall if I said it : our humor... [fart]

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.447
And yet I only watch
foreign movies and american TV shows.

00:03:26.447 --> 00:03:28.382
And I'm sure it's the same for most of those
watching this video !

00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:30.339
Paradoxically, I watch essentially 
French Internet videos... [fart]

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.969
When you see the quality of videos like 
"Le Joueur du Grenier"(Gamer of the Attic)
or Fran ois Descraques's, "Le visiteur du futur"(Visitor from the Futur),

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:35.425
no need to go peek at the americans !

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:38.269
And this may be from where our salvation will come :
from a generation raised on action rather than depressiveness...

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.620
-HELICOUPTAIR ! HELICOUPTAIR !
-Also "Visitor from the Futur" is a bit like me :

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.115
He can teleport ! Well ok, for him it's in the futur...
And yes, he doesn't need to fart... Well ok, it's nothing like me ! [fart]

00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:51.382
[disgusted sigh]
-Sometimes it stinks, but anyway it's pretty convenient : 
I don't even need my private helicopter !

00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:55.409
-HELICOUPTAIR ! HELICOUP... TAIR ?...
[crying] Helicouptair...

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.784
-Sorry where are the Youtube Space ?
-A gauche(on the left) !

00:03:57.784 --> 00:04:00.982
Wait... Is it real here ? Are we in Los Angeles ?

00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:06.106
[laugh] Wait wait wait ! It means that when I fart for example I... 
[fart] Spoil my undies like everybody...

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:10.237

00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:15.062
Aaaah, just have to upload the video now...
-NO ! Above all, do not publish this video !

00:04:15.062 --> 00:04:17.911
-But why ?
-Because if you upload it, HERE is what's gonna happen !

00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:21.581
By criticizing French movies and actors, 
you will shut the theatres world's door close for you !

00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:25.686
And from "no French movie" comes "no Hollywood movie" :
you will never be in "X-Men 9",

00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:28.624
with Omar Sy and Patrick Timsit !
-Oh well, cause if I don't, you think that--

00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:31.498
-NEH, just kidding ! Whatever you do, you'll never be in a movie.
You can go ahead untroubled...
