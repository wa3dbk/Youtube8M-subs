00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.120
We're here at Plage de Tronoan

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.220
in the west coast of Brittany

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.959
to have a look at the dune system here

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:11.389
and to think about how the dunes are formed

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.400
right up to how they're managed and how people can have an effect on them

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.419
dunes, well first of all, to a dune formed you need

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.109
three things to be in place

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.180
first of all you need sand

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.279
because out sand there won't be a dune

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.929
you also need the space to put the sand, so the accommodation space

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.529
and then you need the wind

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.019
the weather conditions to be able to

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.550
pick up the sand to move it and to deposit it

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.020
and the way that the sand is moved is by three different methods or mechanisms

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.130
the first one, if the wind is strong enough, it can actually pick the sand up and blow

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.700
it along in suspension, something we call suspended transport

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.300
however, if the wind isn't strong enough to
keep it in suspension

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.820
it may be able to get the grains to
hop up into the air

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.250
to bounce into the ground again and they might hop up again

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.260
a leap-frog sort of motion across the beach and up into the dunes

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.280
that's something we call saltation

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.030
and the third mechanism by which sand can move

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.450
is when the wind is just strong enough to move it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.500
along the ground as a blanket, if you like, something we call surface creep

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.930
now when the sand is moving

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.770
by any one of those three mechanisms

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.900
it will only come to stop and be deposited

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.400
when the wind velocity that is transporting it
decreases

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.400
and that can occur when the sand encounters an obstacle

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.320
like a strandline at the back of the beach

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.049
composed of driftwood, seaweed, maybe the odd dead dolphin, or so,

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.790
and the sand can then be

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.160
deposited in the lee side. and sometimes also on the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.000
upwind side of the object

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.729
to start creating an accumulation of sand

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.630
something we call a shadow dune

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.490
and at this point the shadow dune

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.470
doesn't have any vegetation on it

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.750
it's just sand around a particular piece of debris

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.239
but if the sand accumulates enough and it gets above the influence of the waves

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.610
then vegetation can actually start to colonise

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.799
that shadow dune

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.759
to produce what we then call an embryo dune

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.650
and an embryo dune can be a very small

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.699
round, circular accumulation of sand

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.519
with a bit of tufty vegetation on it

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.859
centered on a piece of debris

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.469
but eventually, if it's along a strandline,

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.489
these individual embryo dunes

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.209
through continued accumulation of sand

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.629
and the increased trapping ability of the vegetation

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.229
they can actually start to coalesce and to merge along

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.129
the strandline, so you have these merging,

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.739
coalescing embryo dunes

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.939
which eventually form a linear dune feature

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.510
and it occurs right at the front of the dunes

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.729
and because of that we call it the foredune

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.049
now once a foredune has been created

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.149
you can have another strandline deposited by waves in front of it

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.689
and the whole process

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.239
can start all over again producing another foredune

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.729
in front of the older foredune

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:16.419
and in this way, if sediment supply is
constant and continuous

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.620
then we can have a whole number, a whole series of foredunes

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.619
growing out seaward from the original position

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.529
and we call that process dune progradation

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:32.309
so the dunes can prograde out towards the sea if the sediment availability is high enough

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:33.819
now once that happens

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.240
the old foredune that is left behind

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.350
becomes what we call a hind dune

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.469
it's behind the foredune

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.339
so we call it a hind dune

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.169
and the foredune is the one at the front

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.039
now, eventually with progradation, those hind dunes

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:52.189
are going to become more and more ever distant from the beach and the source of sediment

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.189
so they effectively become starved of sediment

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.489
when that happens they are vulnerable to incision and disturbance, perhaps by

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.629
rabbits burrowing

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.889
by goats or sheep grazing, or indeed by tourists walking across the beach

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:12.479
across the dunes rather to the beach and incising pathways as we have here

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.449
when that happens

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:20.530
the wind can actually get into
those pathways and start to undercut the dune

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.970
on either side, releasing the sand from underneath the vegetation

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.000
which, in this case, we have marram grass and sedges

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the sand is liberated and can be blown further inland

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.100
and in this way these hind dunes, the sand can be transported from the dune ridge

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.379
to behind the fragments that are left

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.789
so the whole dune can be reorientated

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.830
from what was parallel to the coast

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.969
to actually become

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.379
perpendicular to the coast - at right angles

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.089
and when that happens we call them secondary dunes because they are no longer

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.470
in their original orientation

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.400
and, of course, when they are in their original orientation

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.449
we call them primary dunes because they are in their primary position

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.149
so by looking from the air at a dune system

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:08.270
the dunes that are

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.469
still parallel to the coast are primary dunes

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.759
those that have been reorientated
through sand starvation

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.629
and blow-out formation

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.610
and undercutting though deflation by the wind

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.910
they become perpendicular, and they are secondary dunes

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.960
so, there's a whole evolutionary

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.279
process going on there with sand dunes
