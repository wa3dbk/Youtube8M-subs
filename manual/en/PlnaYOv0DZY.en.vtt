00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.850
[Mitt Romney] We're going to have a stronger
economy because I'm going to be Governor.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.359
I have experience in the private sector.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.860
I know how jobs are created and how jobs are
lost.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.769
I'm going to work tirelessly as Governor to
bring more good jobs to Massachusetts.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.889
I know how to solve a budget problem.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.889
I stand very clearly for lowering the taxes.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.779
Jobs and the economy is what I know.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.079
I spent my life in the private sector. I know
why jobs come and why they go.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.940
My number one job will be to see that America,
once again, is number one in job creation.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.589
I will finally get America on track to have
a balanced budget.

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.949
I will cut marginal taxes across the board.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.929
People want to know what I stand for? They
can look at my record as Governor.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:52.109
[John Barrett] Mitt Romney was not an effective
leader in Massachusetts, and the proof is

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:52.710
in the pudding.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.940
[Jay Kaufman] I had worked only under Republican
Governors, and I worked really well with all

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.600
of the others.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.429
There was really not much working with Mitt
Romney.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.159
[Rob Dolan] When Governor Romney became governor
of Massachusetts, many of the issues that

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.650
our country faces were at our doorstep.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.160
High debt, a need for jobs, the need to support
a working middle class.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.700
There were great opportunities, and there
was great hope that Governor Romney could

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.460
deliver.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.990
He didn't deliver.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.340
[Mitt Romney] We need a jobs revolution. We
need to have more jobs in Massachusetts.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.610
More good jobs. That's the key to our future.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.610
[Karen Spilka] There was that promise - a
hope - that Romney would deliver with jobs.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.930
And grow the economy here in Massachusetts.
And that did not materialize.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.500
[Jack Yunits] Massachusetts' growth stopped.
Companies stopped coming. They knew jobs were

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.440
not being created.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.090
[Jeffrey SÃ¡nchez] We knew that we were losing
manufacturing jobs.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.810
And he never found any solutions to try and
figure out: How do we keep them?

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.340
By the time Mitt Romney left office, we were
47th in the nation in terms of job growth.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.570
[Rob Dolan] During Mitt Romney's tenure as
Governor, wages dropped 5% his first two years,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.040
which really had a very negative effect throughout
Massachusetts.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.850
[Mitt Romney] I will fight to keep our tax
rate.. not going up, but to keep it where

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.140
it is.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.060
And then bring it down by the end of my first
term.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.629
[Jay Kaufman] What we heard from Mitt Romney
during the campaign was the "No New Taxes"

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.879
pledge.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.709
And he found, very quickly, once he was in
office,

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.769
that he couldn't deliver on any services without
having sufficient resources.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.120
So he raised our taxes by raising our fees.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.480
[Rob Dolan] But a rose by any other name is
absolutely still a rose.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.439
Fees are an increase out of the pockets of
every Massachusetts resident - that's a tax.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.510
Let's call it what it is.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.670
[Carl Sciortino] Struggling working families
- they were paying more under his administration.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.939
They were paying at the Department of Motor
Vehicles.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.370
They were paying for marriage fees and burial
fees.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.629
[John Barrett] Every fee that he put in place,
or increased, impacted mainly the average,

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:49.420
middle-income person.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.790
[Carl Sciortino] The only place that I remember
Mitt Romney actually cutting taxes

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.650
was for the 278 wealthiest families in our
state.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.249
[Mitt Romney] I've indicated what my position
is on how to balance the budget.

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:05.249
And it's by cutting out waste and inefficiency,
and taking advantage of great efficiencies

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:06.389
that I think we can capture.

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.709
[Jay Kaufman] Under the Romney Administration,
we accumulated the greatest debt build-up

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.799
of any state in the country.

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.269
That's after a campaign promise to do exactly
the opposite.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.159
[Carl Sciortino] He used the debt to pay for
annual operations costs.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.930
That's like paying your rent on your credit
card.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.819
And that was Mitt Romney's way of paying for
the way we maintained our highways,

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.370
for the way we cleaned our streets.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.709
It was a really flawed way of addressing basic
operations - to go deeper and deeper into

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.840
debt.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.939
[Rob Dolan] Governor Romney's plan for America
right now

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.859
Is the same plan that he sold to the people
of Massachusetts in 2002.

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.499
Less government, less debt, better business,
and less taxes.

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.069
The result? It was the opposite.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.150
More fees, less business, more debt, and bigger
government here in Boston.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.969
[John Barrett] He just did not get the job
done. He just didn't walk the talk.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.469
[Paul Sciortino] There are times when I watch
Mitt Romney saying the exact same things

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:03.480
now that he said here in Massachusetts in
2002 in a robotic way that is completely hollow.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.319
It didn't work here. So I'm not quite sure
why he thinks it might work nationally.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.819
[John Barrett] Romney economics doesn't work.
It didn't work in Massachusetts, and it's

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:11.979
not going to work in Washington.
