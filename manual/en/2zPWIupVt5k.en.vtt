00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.880
So i start of by sectioning my hair of from
the top of my head down to the ear

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.370
[Music is playing]

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.680
Then i clip the rest of the hair back

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.170
[Music is playing]

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.300
In the section we just made, you are going
to make a french braid, but instead of going

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.359
over and into the middle, we are going to
go under so the braid is going to be on top (a dutch braid)

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:35.620
[Music is playing]

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.540
I´m only gonna put another section of hair
into the braid every second time, so the part

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.239
thats by the for head, thats the part i put
another section into

00:00:45.239 --> 00:01:05.819
[Music is playing]

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:07.630
So now you are just gonna secure the braid

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.450
[Music is playing]

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.340
So now you are going to pull out in the braid
a little bit, so it gets a bit more volume

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.119
and a bit more messy

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:35.639
[Music is playing]

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:38.249
and now you sre just gonna do the exact same
on the other side

00:01:38.249 --> 00:02:16.540
[Music is playing]

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.100
So now you are gonig to tease the top of the
hair just to get a bit more volume

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:57.600
[Music is playing]

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.040
Now i´m going to take my toni and guy heat
protection and spray that into my hair

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:44.820
[Music is playing]

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.480
so to curl the hair i´m using the remington "Pearl pro" curling iron

00:03:48.520 --> 00:04:01.060
[Music is playing]

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.629
So i take a small section in the back of my
hair and wrap it around the curling iron away

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:06.349
from my face

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:15.829
[Music is playing]

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.900
So when i take the curl of the curling iron
i´m just gonna hold it in my hand for a few seconds

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:31.480
[Music is playing]

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.199
so im just gonna continue curling my hair
on both sides

00:04:34.199 --> 00:06:28.539
[Music is playing]

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.919
So now i´m just gonna take my elnett hairspray
form loreal and spray that in the curls

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:50.139
[Music is playing]

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.400
so because i want a bit more volume i´m taking
a few sections and tease them again

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:10.759
[Music is playing]

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:14.629
so im just gonna pull out the braid a bit
again, just to get them more volume and them

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:19.060
i´m gonna take 2 bobbypins and secure them
at the back of my head

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:49.280
[Music is playing]

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.580
