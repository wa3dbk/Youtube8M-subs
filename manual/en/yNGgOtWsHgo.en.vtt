00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.680
Hi!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.160
Let me tell you a story

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.700
for those morons who still think they can do without voltmeters!

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.300
There once was a guy named Alex.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.600
He had a nickname - Burner.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.160
It originated from his last name and the shit I'm gonna tell you right now.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.200
Anyway, that moron... Ooops...

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.200
[Sasha]: How do I put it right? Nay, that's abusive, isn't it?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.760
[Sasha]: Do I bleep it? You think?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.360
So this... emm... a very precious client of ours at the moment...

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.720
Later a friend of Arty's. What twindiots, huh?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.680
Anyway, the guy came to us for a sumboofer.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.280
He comes, like, 'Hey, guys, I need a sumboofer!'. Not a shit - that's how much he knew about subs!

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760
So he bought a sumboofer for â‚½20,000.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And burned the hell out of it.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.960
Voltmeter

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.720
he had not installed by then yet.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.680
What's the connection here, to your mind? No connection, you say? Okay.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.960
So he comes to buy another sumboofer. Well, it's not really how it went.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.200
He asked us to repair the first sub.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
And while it was being repaired, Alex the Burner asked for another one to listen to.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.160
We gave him another one. A GroundZero.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.280
It was a GZ 15S-AL. A good one. HE BURNED IT, TOO!

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.760
WITHIN AN HOUR!!!

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.560
We gave him another one. After all, he was a good client of ours. We gave him an Audio Extreme.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.760
He burned it, too.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.040
Then we repaired the DB. He burned it, too.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.920
And then, while figuring which sub is the most fckin' expensive in the world, he burned a Hannibal!!!

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.520
All this time, there was no voltmeter in the picture.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
What's the connection, you say? No connection, you say? Well, HAHA!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.440
When we put in a voltmeter, turned out that moron had had 10.8 V.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.520
He had just been frying the subs! Why, you ask?

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.840
Because that moron decided he could do without a voltmeter!!!

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.760
He had no idea what was the voltage in the system. It was freaking 10.8 V! Sometimes even lower!

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.520
Some people believe the Burner can listen to music WITH NO CURRENT AT ALL!

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.200
Which is, with ZERO voltage!

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.360
We don't believe that shit.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.480
On the other hand, it's Alex the Burner. I guess, he is capable of that, yeah.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.040
Anyway, that idiot broke down the ceiling on his BMW. Well, not the ceiling but the roof hatch.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.400
And the windshield. The last sub he would install was a fcking 15'' Orion.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.080
Burned down, too, aha.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.400
Anyway, this is a proverb teaching you that a voltmeter is not an option but a necessity.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.520
Although, here, in LoudSound shop we would only profit if you did not install any voltmeters.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.880
The more you burn that shit, the more you come and buy that shit!

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.440
So... Nay. No need in voltmeters.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.400
Okay, ciao, everyone! If you wanna order a voltmeter - you're welcome!

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.800
If you don't wanna order a voltmeter, order a couple more subs right away!

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.160
That's fckin' it!
