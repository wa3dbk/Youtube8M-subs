My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.451
to shuck an oyster and prepare them a couple
of different ways. Now, I just want to turn

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:12.980
the heat down to half. We're going to add
all our spinach in here. That sure does looks

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.910
like a lot, now doesn't it. Give it a second
and it won't look like nearly as much. There's

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:28.570
all of our spinach. And now, we're just going
to stir this spinach into our mixture. And

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.280
the real important thing here is to make sure
that you don't have any chunks of Parmesan

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.399
and what we're looking for here is our consistency
too. You can see we're still a little soupy

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.410
that's because the moisture came out of the
spinach. The spinach is actually really, really

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.560
moist. Don't be afraid if it turns green like
this. What we're going to do now, is we're

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.210
just going to wait a second. I'm going to
go ahead and turn the heat back up because

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.490
so much moisture came out of the spinach that
it turned it runny again. So, what we'll do

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.860
is we'll just kind of evenly space our spinach
out here and let the heat go for a second.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.920
Now, I've seen variations on this with American
cheese. I've seen cheddar cheese versions.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.170
I've seen versions where they actually make
chili con queso and put that on top, which

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.440
is pretty interesting. I've seen versions
where you fry the oyster first. There really

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:33.520
isn't a be all end all recipe. Actually, there
is one, the original recipe that came from

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.020
a very famous restaurant in New York City,
which I will not mention because you can look

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.079
it up on Wikipedia. That's seen as the definitive
recipe although the problem is that no one

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.270
knows for sure if the recipe that they tell
everybody is the right recipe is the right

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.230
recipe, because they say they guard the secret
of that one so closely that no one would really

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.600
know what is in it except for the chef who
makes it. So this should take about another

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.170
twenty seconds or so to thicken up. And also,
I wouldn't recommend using frozen spinach

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.500
either. Because frozen spinach, all the moisture
is going to fall right out of it and it'll,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.119
if you're going to use frozen spinach, you
may as well use the roux to thicken it up,

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.000
and you want to make sure it's almost like
a paste before you add the spinach to it because

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:23.810
so much water is going to come out of it.
Alright, so I'm going to make one more pass

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:35.090
with the salt and pepper. And you can tell
now how it's not bubbling up, it's kind of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:48.340
bubbling down. You see the consistency there?
Nice and thick and as that cools, it will

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.500
thicken up too because of the cheese in there.
So let's move on to our throwing them in the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.020
oven stage.
