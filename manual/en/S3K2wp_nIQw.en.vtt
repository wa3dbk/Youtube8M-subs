00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.700
Hey guys!

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.700
So today I wanted to do a really quick video
and it's going to be really brief and short,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.170
but I'm not too sure if it's something you
guys are looking forward too and I'm not too

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.740
sure if you guys are even starting out in
college this...semester. But I just wanted

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.599
to do really quick and easy tips for those
of you who are starting college and for those

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.560
of you who don't know, I already graduated
college this past semester with my business

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.290
bachelors in finance. And, I've learned a
lot of things though out my semester and I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.210
wished that there was someone there who was
able to give me these tips, because...you're

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.610
kind of just on your own when you go to college.
It's not like high school, you're not you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.100
know...with a team of people and you guys
all move up together. You're basically on

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.180
your own, and it's really easy for anyone
to kind of just fall back...lose motivation...or

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.060
even just drop out. So, I do want to give
you guys some tips and pointers when it comes

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.050
to back to school. The first thing that I
do recommend is that you see your advisor.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.810
Now, a lot of people just dread having to
see their advisor because it's just a waste

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.380
of time to them, or they don't even know what
they want to do so they don't feel it's necessary

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.880
to see an advisor, or you do feel that you
do know what you're doing so you don't feel

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.580
like you need to see an advisor. But, a lot
of times people think they know what they're

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.659
doing by word of mouth from other friends,
but, in college, there's so many different

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.740
tracks on what you should be on. Just because
your friends are doing one thing doesn't mean

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.110
you're going to do that too, because everyone
wants a different major. So I really do feel

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
that it's important to see your advisor. You
can ask them anything. If you have any questions

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.479
or concerns, just talk to them. And you do
kind of want to just be a familiar person

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.270
to them. They'll definitely help you out,
it's their job, they're not going to reject

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.680
you. Those appointments are really, really
helpful. I felt that, I felt so much more

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.880
confident in knowing what I wanted to do after
I saw my advisor. I mean there's so many different

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.190
majors that you want to kind of look into.
Say...you like Marine Biology or Zoology or

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.020
Psychology....Business related things...just
ask them questions so you kind of know what

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.920
classes you want to take. A lot of students
during their first and second semester just

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.390
take random classes that they think are easy
or that their friends are taking, and it kind

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.099
of just wastes those 2 semesters, or that
year. And then you kind of start to get serious

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.890
in what you want to do. The second thing I
want to recommend is to be aware of what programs

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.450
and facilities that are available to you at
the college, and make sure you use them wisely.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.340
There are a lot of different services that
are provided at my college, and I didn't even

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.270
know of it until the second year of my college
time. And you know what, those services are

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.680
very, very helpful. You may not know, but
maybe in your library, there's tutoring sessions

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.879
on certain classes that certain professors
have for free and you can just go in and do

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.180
that. There's also writing services where
you can go in and if you have trouble writing

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.420
a resume or even a paper, they're there to
kind of just help you out and guide you into

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.129
the right direction. It is just important
to know that it's a really big campus at college

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.319
and you're not alone. There's so much people
that you can go to for help, and it's easy,

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.750
you just go on the website and ask for help.
Also, you can go to the library, if you're

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.450
looking for a book. Make sure you ask someone
how exactly does this library work? Where

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.590
can you find things? Sometimes there's even
textbooks that you can look at the libraries.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.920
Computer labs! You may not even know, but
if you're bringing your laptop for no reason,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.730
I mean, why carry that extra weight when you
can go to the computer labs, and sometimes

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.220
you even get free prints so you can print
papers out for free. Even things that are

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.849
not really my cup of tea such as the gym,
if you have your college ID with you, you

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.790
can go ahead and use the gym as well. Just
be aware of what there is available to you

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.349
and make use of it, because college isn't
free. You're paying a big amount of tuition

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.069
every single semester so make use of everything
that's available to you. Another thing that

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.840
people must hate doing because it takes up
so much time is joining clubs. I didn't really

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.470
join clubs during my time in college; however,
I did for the last 2 semesters. But I cannot

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.680
explain how important it is to join clubs.
Now a lot of clubs are available and they're

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.130
kind of geared towards specific majors. For
example, the club that I was in, in FMA, was

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.240
geared towards finance majors so they had
like mock interviews, they also had financial

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.229
gatherings. A lot of people from certain companies
that worked in banks came and talked to us

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.949
and we were able to ask questions and get
them answered. So, it's just a really...knowledgable

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.630
experience. The last tip that I do want to
recommend is probably going to be something

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.190
where you guys are going to be, "uh duh obviously,
this is college. Of course we're going to

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.699
do that". But, I guarantee you, sometimes
you may find yourself to be very intoverted

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.810
when it comes to college because you're scared
and you don't want to just meet new people

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.440
and you just want to be a little turtle in
your shell and believe me... a lot of us are

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.440
like that, even those of you who are really
loud during high school. You'll feel much

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.729
different in college. Make new friends, and
I don't mean like..."Hey what's your name,

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.080
we should get together and get drunk and do
al this ridiculous stuff". No...I mean like

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.720
make friends...If you're like majoring in
psychology, join a club, make friends with

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.210
people in those clubs, and you know, just
do stuff together. For example, when I was

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.040
in finance, I tried to make a lot of friends
that were the same major as me so that when

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.680
we're taking a class that was really hard,
you can have study groups together, meet up

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.699
at certain times at the library, or at night
time and study for exams together to kind

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.300
of just share information together and just
help each other out....tutor each other...It

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.150
was just a really great experience. And on
top of that, it's important to have these

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.520
friends so that when you're out of college,
you know those people. For example, again,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.009
with my finance major, I developed these friends
so that when we all graduated college, I was

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.690
able to talk to them and be like, "Hey, so
what are you doing now? What track are you

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.100
going for?". Because, even if you all are
majoring in this one specific major, there's

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.169
a lot of different careers to go into, and
this is for any major, not just finance. So

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.490
I went ahead and did that, and it's just a
really good experience. You meet new friends,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.940
you meet new people, you get more motivated,
you get inspired. It's just really, really

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.900
important to just make new friends, and don't
just stick to the friends that you had in

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.780
high school. I mean, if these were your friends
in high school, they'll probably be your friends

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.470
for life. So, it's not a crime to go and meet
new people, and kind of just share the same

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.240
interests when it comes to education. So yea!
I hope these tips were really helpful for

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.389
you guys...when it comes to you new college
people whoa are becoming freshmen. It applies

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:59.699
to basically all colleges...and...yea! I hope
