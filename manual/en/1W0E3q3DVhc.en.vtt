Hi this is Drew Finn for expertvillage.com
we are going to talk about cleaning and maintaining

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:16.990
a deck. This video is presented by Black Dog
Video and you can visit us on the web on blackdogvideo.biz.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.191
Now if the handrails are loose we've got to
secure it to the post. This particularly one

00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:28.769
is secure. This one has screws here and here
which you can tighten up if it was loose.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.460
Also another thing to tighten up it would
work real good it is a metal bracket you can

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.760
add one in here you can paint it the same
color. But that would make a very secure connections

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.340
a metal bracket like this a flat metal and
we but a couple of screws here and a couple

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.059
of screw here, If you did have one that was
loose. So now we have tighten the post up,

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.710
we have tighten up the handrail up, so we
have a secure base for child safety, for you

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.780
pets, and for you guest because some people
lean up on the handrails and stuff. Remember

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.970
they are suppose to take a two hundred pound
force this way leaning on the handrail and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.570
if so the connections here are absolutely
critical it would be good and firm and tight

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.000
and secure. You want to look if just little
finishing nails some times people just tack

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.030
them up and make them look good. You got to
make sure that there is a screw in there.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.900
Not even a nail; nails can loosen to easily
so make sure that there are screws in there

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.680
and that there are snug and adequate and the
wood around them has not split. That way we

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.000
have nice safe handrail, safe deck, and that
is probably the most important things in maintaining

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.820
your deck. Now when you test the handrail
if it is loose due to the post the post could

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.520
be moving back and forth we got to snug down
the post. If they are originally constructed

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.990
in a pour fashion where they nailed them in
you can try to tighten them up but they would

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.220
loosen again very quickly. I would put lag
bolts if that was the case. In this case we

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.670
have carriage bolts that go right through
with a nut on the back. So can go down and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.379
check the nut. This one is a little loose.
Snug it by hand and then we would take a wrench

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.930
and we will tighten it down. You want to get
it good and snug but you don't want to go

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.960
to the place where the wood starts crunching
because you are just crushing the wood and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.459
it could loosen up again. So what I'll do
tighten this down. This one we got two bolts.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:35.659
That one is snug already. So we just snug
it down to a good amount measuring foot pound.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.870
I pushed on that pretty hard and that is tight.
That would tighten this up. You might notice

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.010
in the construction of this particularly one
there is another board put inside to make

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.370
it even stiffer. On a lot of decks you'll
find that you got the joist here you got another

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.709
one here and the post although you have tighten
it, it still rocks back and forth. What you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.980
could do if you had another one here is put
a solid piece of wood in between the two of

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.760
them nail them together that would stiffing
the outer post a lot. That is good and secure

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.510
now that we have tighten it underneath.
