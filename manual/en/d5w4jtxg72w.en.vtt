00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.950
Okay, so now what you can do is just think
about these elements we've talked about. Okay?

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.170
You know and, still forget about the left
hand for now, I'm just going to hold a C chord

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.840
with my left hand and just kind of forget
about it. Okay. But what are the elements

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.910
we've talked about? We've talked about you
need to separate your thumb from your other

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.760
fingers, just kind of in you head. Kind of
get your thumb on autopilot. Even though your

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.070
thumb is on autopilot, it's always going to
be playing kind of the, you know, on the beat,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.170
right? The one and the two, you know, or on
the one, two, three, four. Right? But not

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.810
beats in between. But you can, remember we
said how you can, you know, you can change

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.480
whether you're playing the root or the third
or the fifth. Okay? So, that's one kind of

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.900
element of all this. And then, we talked about
how, with the other fingers, you can either

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:58.640
play on the beat, like this. That's playing
on the beat or you can syncopated, which is

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:08.640
off the beat. The thumb hasn't changed. And
notice how you can change the sequence of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.000
these notes and it sounds different. So now
I can go, same notes, just kind of a different

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:43.450
pattern. Oops. Right? So, I'm playing same
notes, just in different ways. And, to me,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.560
that's really the key of learning how to become
a good fingerpicker, is to really just become

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.760
comfortable and fluent in doing things in
a lot of different ways. Because in the next

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.030
step, is to learn how to combine them. Okay,
so, rather than saying, alright, well, okay,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.049
my thumb's going to be doing, you know, root
fifth, or root, third, fifth exclusively,

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.979
or I'm going to playing on the beat or syncopated,
exclusively with the hand, just mix it all

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.560
up. Okay? So, now I'm still just going to
hold a C chord on my right hand, but I'm just

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.190
going to start kind of free form creatively
combining all of these elements that we've

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:28.850
been talking about already with the right
hand. So,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.560
that might seem a little complicated, but
it's really not. All I'm, all I'm, you know,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.481
all I'm doing is sometimes I'm playing on
the beat with the other three fingers and

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:42.400
sometimes I'm playing off the beat, syncopated.
And, you know, I've practiced enough where,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.870
you know, it just sort of becomes second nature
after a while to know that your thumb is kind

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.450
of just doing this bass line. And your other
fingers can play on the beat sometimes or

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.990
syncopated and just kind of learn how to combine
things in different ways. Again, I'm not changing

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:19.270
my left hand at all.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.270
So.
