00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.110
Math games for middle school. Well, Math is
a hard subject and how do you, what kind of

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.730
games can you make to make Math more interesting
to learn? Hi, I'm Jimmy and we're here to

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.180
discuss a few ideas on how you might want
to get started. Now, one kind of game you

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.039
might want to consider is sorting games. Sorting
games really helps folks understand how to

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.090
combine like terms, what you can combine,
what you can't. I have in front of me here,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.800
three kinds of note cards. If you were to
scramble them, what you might get the students

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.839
to do is again, put the color cards and, so
that they all match. For example, have the

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.440
orange cards go with the orange, the green
go with the green and the pink go with the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.610
pink. Have them be careful of not to interchange
the different colors because the cards are

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.150
not alike. That's an example of using like
terms and having a game with it. Money games

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.080
are specially effective because just about
everybody can relate to money. It's a great

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.600
tool for helping you determine addition, subtraction
as well as decimals because as you know, money,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.210
the dollar bills and the coins use a lot of
decimals. Arithmetic games. The ideas if you

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.600
take some pieces of paper, cut them up, You
might have two groups of paper, each have

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.380
from zero through nine representing the ten
digits, but have two stacks because you're

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.740
going to have a third stack with four pieces
of paper each involving an operation. One

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.370
for addition, subtraction, multiplication
or division and then that way, you can get

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.310
them a quick ideas as to how mix and match
and use the different operations. For example,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:50.130
9 X 3 or 5-2, those are just some other examples.
And finally another quick suggestion is, if

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.950
you know of a popular game show that a lot
of your students watch, you might want to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.480
use a game show to incorporate that into a
game like jeopardy, millionaire. So for example,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.200
if you want to use jeopardy, under a certain
category, you might have to say, the answer

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.120
to 7 X 9 and the student might say, what is
sixty three. So it's a good way to involve

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.280
the students as much as they possibly can.
So I'm Jimmy and there are some ideas to incorporate

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.110
games in middle school for Math.
