00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.540
John Vigiano Sr: There were a couple of days
each year

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.820
you were allowed to take
your children to work,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.960
and Joe loved it.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.400
That was his birthday present,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.260
that he would spend the night
in the firehouse.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.940
We'd have a cake,
and the guys I worked with,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.540
they would take
a milk container,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.980
and they'd cut out a facsimile
of a building,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.660
and they'd put it
on the top of the cake,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.960
and then they would light it up.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.420
And they would tell Joe
to put it out,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.580
and he would throw
a pot of water on it.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.460
The birthday cake was
a little soggy.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.760
But this is what he wanted.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880
Joe started dating
a young lady

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.420
whose father was
a police officer.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.440
And he come home one day,
and he says,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.240
"I'm taking the police test."

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240
I says, "Joe,
you're only 17 years old."

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440
He says, "No big deal."

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.480
On the other side of the room,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.360
my son John wanted to be
the next Donald Trump.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.480
He was going to make
a million dollars

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.580
and take care
of his mother and father.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.700
But in 1984, I came down
with throat cancer.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.420
He noticed then how my unit
took care of us,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480
and he says,
"I want to become a fireman."

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680
I says, "You're kidding me.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.880
"Firemen don't make
millions of dollars.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.660
How'm I going to live
like a king?"

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.120
But I was very happy,
very proud.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.560
My father had been
on the fire department,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.860
and he was the first one to be
issued badge number 3436.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
And they reissued it
to my son John.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.380
So the badge was only used
by two.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.180
Both the boys would call me
when they were working.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.240
John would always call
around 3:30, 4:00.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.700
And that particular night,
September 10th,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.120
we spoke for a few minutes,
and I says, "I love you."

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
And he says, "I love you."

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.400
Joe called me in the morning

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.120
and told me to turn on
the television,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.120
that a plane just hit
the Trade Center.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.200
And he says, "I'm heading south
on West Street.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500
This is the big one."

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.660
And I just says, "Be careful.
I love you."

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.960
He says, "I love you, too."

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.960
That was it.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.900
We had the boys for --
John for 36 years,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.520
Joe for 34 years.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.480
Ironically, badge number 3436.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.460
I don't have any "Could've,
should've, or would'ves."

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.000
I wouldn't have changed
anything.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.700
There's not many people that,
the last words they said

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.940
to their son or daughter was,
"I love you,"

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.940
and the last words they heard
was, "I love you."

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.280
So that makes me sleep
at night.
