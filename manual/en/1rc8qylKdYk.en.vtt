00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.149
Motorola ROKR EM35.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:15.240
Continuing Motorola's ROKR line of music handsets
is the EM35 slider, a GSM-only device with

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:24.130
a 2.2" QVGA display, a 3.1 megapixel fixed-focus
camera, 110MB of internal memory (expandable

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:32.340
up to 32GB using a microSD card), stereo Bluetooth,
internal stereo speakers, an FM radio with

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.180
RDS and a standard 3.5mm audio socket.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.680
As with most recent ROKR handsets, the audio
and video playback capabilities are pretty

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.320
good, and there are dedicated media keys and
a FastScroll navigation key.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.850
The ROKR EM35's "Linux Java 7.4" (MOTOMAGX)
operating system allows you to download various

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.060
applications (called "widgets") and these
days the user interface is much improved over

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.230
Motorolas of old.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.430
It's not a bad handset if you are looking
for a phone with excellent music playback

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.740
support and a reasonable camera, but there's
no 3G support and the camera is a lot more

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.659
basic than the megapixel count might lead
you to believe.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.359
Ultimately though, the Motorola ROKR EM35
comes with very little to make it stand out

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.719
in a crowded marketplace.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.789
We really can't see why anyone would want
this particular handset, unless Motorola can

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.060
keep the price low enough to make it interesting.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.459
As it happens, the MOTOMAGX platform that
the ROKR runs on is capable of a lot more

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.840
than just playing music.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.850
But since Motorola are going to be concentrating
on Windows Mobile and Android phones during

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.630
2009, this is probably one of the last phones
running MOTOMAGX to market.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.740
Motorola say that the ROKR EM35 will be available
during Q4 2008, but did not give any exact

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.429
details on availability or pricing.
