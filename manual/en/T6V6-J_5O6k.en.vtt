00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:05.541
let us now discuss about the sign convention
for mirror formula. as we have recently studied

00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:17.931
that. mirror formula. is given as 1 by u plus
1 by v is equal to 1 by f. and here u. and

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:22.681
v are object image distances from pole and
f is the focal length of the mirror and we

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:42.651
have. studied that here. (u v). and f. are
used. with proper signs. according to the

00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:54.870
sign convention used. now there are verities
of sign conventions, which are generally used

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.541
in. various situations but here i am going
to discuss about 2 sign conventions either

00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:13.471
of the 2 you can use. and here the sign convention.
for proper signs of u v and f we use is. sign

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:36.231
convention 1. we use. by. taking. pole of
mirror. as origin. and, we consider. direction

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:47.811
of incident ray on mirror. as positive direction.
like say we are given with a mirror like this.

00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:55.771
and say this is the concave mirror. here we
consider the pole of mirror at origin and,

00:01:55.771 --> 00:02:01.911
the 2 sides there are 2 axis and if say an
object is placed here incident ray will be

00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:07.921
moving. from right to left. then in this situation
this direction we consider as plus x axis

00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:16.461
and this as minus x axis. and for the orientation
of. object and image we can also consider

00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:23.610
plus y and minus y axis but these are rarely
used. so this is the way how we used the sign

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.350
convention in this situation as object is
located on minus x axis. here we take u to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.751
be. negative. and as focus of this mirror
is also on negative x axis here f will also

00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:44.981
be taken as negative. on substituting the
values of u and f in the mirror formula whichever

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:49.731
value of v we are getting correspondingly
we can locate the image if it is positive

00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:55.403
then. image is virtual and located behind
the mirror if it is negative then it is on

00:02:55.403 --> 00:03:01.800
the right side of mirror. this is the most
common coordinate convention which is used

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:14.670
in, verity of books. another. sign convention.
we use is the simple coordinate convention,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.850
this is based on direction of incident ray.
and in the second sign convention again the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:32.671
first point remain same here. taking, pole
of. mirror. as origin of the coordinate system.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:45.090
and beauty of this sign convention is you
can consider. any direction as. positive and,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.770
other. negative. and, in this situation you
must be very careful about the whole reflection

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.060
process whichever direction you chose. that
should remain same like for example in the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.951
same situation here. if this is a mirror.
a general convention. which we take is from

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:10.160
the origin on the righthand side we consider
plus x axis on lefthand side it is, minus

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.791
x axis. so no matter whether mirror is facing
toward right or facing toward left. in general

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:23.261
you can always take right side as positive
x axis and left side as negative x axis this

00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:29.131
is always be comfortable for use similarly
for y axis if require you can take these as

00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:35.571
plus y and minus y. so here if an object is
placed on the plus x axis here we take u as

00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:43.061
positive. and the focal length as focus point
is, located on plus x axis here we can take

00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:49.611
f as positive. if the mirror would be facing
on the lefthand side we could have taken both

00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:57.651
u and f negative because, the points. o as
well as f, will lie on a negative x axis.

00:04:57.651 --> 00:05:03.651
so depending on various situation we can change
the direction also. and in these analysis

00:05:03.651 --> 00:05:09.771
of lectures for image formation by spherical
mirrors i am going to use the second convention.

00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:14.631
where as if you wish by using convention 1
you can verify the results, and whichever

00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:16.971
convention you are comfortable you can use
that.
