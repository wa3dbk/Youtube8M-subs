Alright, let's talk a little bit about snacks.
I subscribe to the dietary plan of three meals

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.770
and two snacks per day. I think that's important
to maintain the blood sugar. You don't want

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.789
to go more than about four or five hours tops
without eating otherwise your blood sugar

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.710
is going to go down. So be very aware of that
and if you're not going to be eating for awhile

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.930
it's important to have a healthy snack. What
is a snack? Well a snack is anything healthy

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.090
between one hundred and two hundred calories.
People of course like convenience. So for

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.840
convenience, I would say fruit of course makes
a good snack and puts us in that calorie range

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.190
for about a hundred calories. Nuts make a
great snack. Even provide protein, too, which

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.780
is going to carry you a little bit further.
Trail mix of course. Trail mix is a combination

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.869
of nuts and seeds and dried fruit. A very
good choice. Have you ever tried turkey jerky?

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.330
This is another convenient healthy snack.
You could even keep some of these snacks in

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.119
your car if you're driving. There's also a
fish jerky that's actually pretty good. It's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.509
made from salmon. Salmon jerky. So I suggest
you try that one. And how about edamame? Are

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:41.189
you familiar with edamame? These are soy beans
in the shells and we just heat these or eat

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:51.619
them cold. A little bit of healthy unrefined
salt makes a great snack.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.770
Vegetable sticks and pieces in little zip-loc
bags. You can make those ahead of time. That

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.799
makes for a good snack. You can use, this
is a eight ounce serving of soy milk. This

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.660
makes a good snack, too. Going to provide
some protein as well. Here is one of the meal

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.060
bars. These make good snacks. I would suggest
not the breakfast bars but the meal bars that

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.360
provide more protein and less sugar. And if
you like a number I would look for something

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.970
that is around 15 grams of sugar or less.
That would be low sugar. Yogurt makes a good

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.660
snack, too. Very convenient. Sometimes it
helps to have a snack at bedtime. If you find

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.550
that you're waking up during the night it's
possible that your blood sugar could be going

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.159
down. You might try having a healthy snack
before bedtime. So that's the deal on snacks.
