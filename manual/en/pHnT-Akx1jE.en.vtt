00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.530
Just days before summer break,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.760
the kids are bouncing off the

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.900
walls--

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.730
Because they can't wait to leave

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.470
Middle School behind.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.570
But before the final bell rings

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.240
in Urbandale, the 6th, 7th, and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.800
8th graders got an early morning

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.340
surprise that's new at six.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.180
IN CAFETERIAS THIS WEEK, YOU

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.880
DON'T NEED A CALENDAR TO TELL

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.020
IT'S MAY. Uh, we have three days

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.220
left. I'm ready to get out.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.250
EVERY KID WILL REMIND YOU. I

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.320
just want it to be over. WE ALL

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260
REMEMBER THAT FEELING - BUT

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.890
MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS WILL TELL

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.420
YOU, IT'S NOT THE SAME. And just

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.390
the culture's a little bit

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.030
different. It's sort of a more

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000
rough, mean kind of culture out

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.700
there. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHYTHEY

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.340
MADE THEIR MOVE LAST NIGHT. I

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.540
was really confused at what was

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.400
happening. WHEN URBANDALE'S

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.140
MIDDLE SCHOOLERS SHOWED UP THIS

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.710
MORNING? I walked in the door

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.740
and all I see is a bunch of

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.570
notes. THEY WERE ON EVERY

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.810
LOCKER. I appreciate the way you

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.010
dug in and worked ahead in math

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.540
to reach your goal. I appreciate

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.050
your positive attitude and

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.850
awesome character. You are a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.220
great role model. I love how

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.190
kind you are to everyone.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.890
PERSONALIZED NOTES SO

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.450
IMPRESSIVE, SOME GUYS SCOTCH

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.050
TAPED THEM TO THEIR SHIRTS.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.890
Reid. I notice that you get a

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.860
lot accomplished when you apply

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.260
yourself. I was like, 'Oh my

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.660
goodness. Who wrote

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.500
my note?' THEY WEREN'T MUSHY

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.430
ENOUGH TO BE FROM A CRUSH. BUT

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.500
THAT LOVED FEELING? It really

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.770
made my day. IT WAS ALL OVER THE

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.610
HALLS. It made me feel really

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.840
good inside so I wanted to know

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240
who like cared that much. THE

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.610
TEACHER PENMANSHIP GAVE 'EM

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.250
AWAY. THEY'D COORDINATED IT TO

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310
CONNECT WITH ALL 904 STUDENTS. I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.320
just want to say thank you to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.850
whoever wrote it to me. MIDDLE

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.550
SCHOOL YEARS CAN BE TOUGH.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.860
Sometimes I have, like, bad

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.220
days and this really made me

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.860
happy and stuff. PROOF THERE'S

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.430
POWER IN A POST-IT AND A PEN. It

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.960
makes you feel good about

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.730
yourself. It kind of like amazed

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.000
me that someone cared that much

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.940
about me.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.040
Urbandale's teachers got the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.900
idea from other schools who've

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.250
pulled it off before. They're
