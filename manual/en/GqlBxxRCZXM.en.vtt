Hello, today I am making 3-ingredient no-machine green tea ice cream.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.000
First, mix 4 ½ teaspoons of green tea powder in 3 tablespoons of hot water 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.040
and let cool.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.240
Then whip 1 cup of cold heavy cream until stiff. 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:44.540
Heavy cream contains more than 36% of milk fat and should be whipped to stiff without sugar. 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:53.940
Now mix  green tea mixture with ½ cup of cold sweetened condensed milk. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.560
And add in green tea and (sweetened) condensed milk mixture into heavy cream 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:07.370
and fold carefully until combined. 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:19.160
Now transfer to a container, plastic or baking pan. 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.970
And cover with plastic wrap.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.470
Then freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.670
Voila,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.570
Homemade 3-ingredient no-machine green tea ice cream.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.560
Just like all the other no-churn ice cream, it’s a little fatty.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.260
Yet this is seriously easy and good. 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.170
Bon appetit.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.560
The ice cream is green enough but the bitterness of green tea is not overwhelming. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.270
And after-taste is okay because it’s only just sweet.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.660
You can add this ice cream in my iced green tea latte. 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:10.870
I have more recipes for Summer: rainbow popsicles, watermelon popsicles, and cookies &amp; cream popsicles.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.270
Thank you for watching. Bye for now.
