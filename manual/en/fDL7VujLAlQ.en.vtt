00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.160
It has already been a hot busy morning in
Namibia in search of game.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.770
We are guests of Zeiss sports optics who have
taken over Blaser's Sney River ranch in Namibia.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.160
As part of the management plan here in Africa
- and part of Zeiss's marketing over there

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.160
in Europe - Spanish Zeiss dealers have been
offered a trip of a lifetime.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890
They're allowed to shoot oryx, red hartebeest,
zebra and wildebeest as long as it's with

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.340
a Blaser rifle, Norma ammunition and of course
some quality German glassware.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.820
As with any hunting the added bonus is being
able to see plenty of wildlife - but there

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.079
is nothing that is going to feed the guests
and staff or look good on the wall.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.040
Juan and Fernando are taking it in turns to
hunt and there has already been some success

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.009
- with this oryx but the day is drawing to
a close so once more we leave and head off

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.150
in search of African Game.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.420
Eventually we come across a young blue wildebeest
bull - he doesn't stick around long - and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.620
runs in front of us.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.220
Juan is used to driven game and gets a shot
off as he runs in front of us - but this strong

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.110
animal keeps powering on.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.200
And we need to make sure he is down because
the sun is dropping and the one thing they

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.450
won't accept here is lost game.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.320
We found blood and we are now trekking the
game.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.820
Let’s see where it is, may be we find it,
may be we just need to get the dogs now at

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.820
the moment.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.180
But both shots were quite good, so hopefully
we will find it immediately.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.240
The animal must be hard hit - he's spotted
by the tracker and we race to keep up.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.730
A few hundred yards later - Juan puts the
bull on the ground.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.240
Ohlay!

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:16.280
That is the first wildebeest for him, even
though we had a little bit of a run we finally

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.230
got him and actually I am quite exhausted
now because we were just running through the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.910
thick bush and now we are here, so well done.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.430
Juan was using the new Blaser R8 professional
success - with the pistol grip which seems

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.940
to be one of those design concepts that just
make sense.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.770
This model here is with thermo elastic inlays.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.760
We also do a pimped up version of this one
with leather inlays.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.200
As you can see it is a thumbhole stock.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.160
It has been used in the sports scenes for
many, many years.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.750
So if it has been so successful on the sports
scene why shouldn’t it be successful for

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.060
the hunter.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.780
I personally have also switched to this model
for the pure reasons for my self confidence

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.400
of actually shooting from free hand.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.660
With this thumbhole system my hand is actually
into the rifle so I feel more of a connection

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.950
and being part of the rifle.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.459
Also another advantage is my finger is completely
around the trigger there is no side ways movement,

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.000
so it is also a good aid against flinching.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.370
We are expecting this to live up to its name
and to also be a success.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.430
Certainly Juan felt comfortable with the R8
on this young blue wildebeest...you can tell

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.620
he's young by the distance between his horns.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.790
When it becomes bigger and bigger, when it
starts to close here and you cannot put your

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.930
finger in, it is a really big trophy, but
this is a young one.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.909
Of course there are the all important photographs
- but it's vitally important to get this animal

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.150
gralloched and in the back of the truck - each
of the staff here get three kilos of meat

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.580
a week as well as their accommodation and
wages.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.680
And Juan will be adding to that pot when this
handsome trophy is mounted and shipped all

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.090
the way back to Spain.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.470
