00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.740
Let's talk about finding every note on the
guitar.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.270
So, if you know anything about music, the
musical alphabet goes from A to G, then it

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.270
starts all over again.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.840
It goes on forever.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.340
You have A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and then it
starts again on A. So in order to find any

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.340
note on the guitar, and really any instrument,
you have to remember just a couple of things,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.890
a couple of rules, right.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.150
So on the guitar - between every letter is
2 frets.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.970
That's called a hold step, but it's just 2
frets.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.170
So, between G and A--2 frets.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.730
Between A and B--2 frets, right.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.589
The only exceptions to the rule are between
E and F, and between B and C, it's only 1

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:52.800
fret apart.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.750
For instance, here's B. Here's C, right next
door.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.750
All right.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.530
Here's E. Here's F, right next to it.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.309
So if you can remember that ‚Äì there's
2 frets between every letter except B and

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.730
C, and E and F - you can find every note on
the guitar, as long as you know the starting

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.060
point of every string.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:19.830
So, if you remember, we have E, we have A,
D, G, B and E ‚Äì those are your starting

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.830
points.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.380
This is E, so remember what I said- right
next door is F. That was one of the exceptions

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.130
to the rule.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.719
And then we're going to find after F, of course,
comes G.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.579
Now remember, between F and G is 2 frets.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.880
Here is F. Here is G, right.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.539
So if this is G, the next note in the musical
alphabet is A, right.

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.250
So, from G to A - 2 frets.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.799
From A to B ‚Äì 2 frets.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.909
And from B to C, that's one of the exceptions.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.040
So from B to C is only 1 fret.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.040
So there it is.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.670
Here's B. Here's C, right.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.920
So now we're up to C. Here's C. 2 frets away
from that is D. And then here's D, and 2 frets

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.619
away from that is E.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.500
If you notice we've skipped some frets and
those are the black keys on the piano.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.150
They're called sharps and flats.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.140
So let's talk about that for a second.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.260
Sharps raise a note 1 fret for us.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Flat does the opposite.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.350
It lowers the note 1 fret.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.690
So, this is raising-- going this way.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.310
This is flat- this way--lowering.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.400
So, we have F.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.990
We have G right.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.420
We talked about that.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.350
In between F and G is F sharp or G flat--same
exact note.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:51.420
So, here's E. Here's F. Here's G, but in between,
F sharp or G flat, right.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.900
If you remember, we went that far.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:06.990
Here's G to A, but in between there we have
a black key, G sharp or A flat.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:14.580
Here's A. Here's B. But in between there is
A sharp or B flat.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.600
Now here's where you can get a little messed
up.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.440
Here's B but here's C, but there's no black
key between B and C. -- Remember the rule,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440
right.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.480
-- So between B and C there's no sharp or
flat.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.440
Here's C and here's D, but in between there
is C sharp or D flat.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.060
-- Same exact note.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.400
-- Here's D and here's E again.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.350
We've reached the double dot, the 12th fret.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.600
That's where the guitar starts again.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.480
So here's D. Here's E, but in between there
is D sharp or E flat.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.040
So, now you know the rules, right.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.620
-- Between every letter- 2 frets, except B
and C, and E and F. -- And then between those

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.230
you know that there are sharps and flats.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.040
You can use that to find any note on the guitar,
as long as you know the starting point of

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040
every string.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.090
So, let's say we're going to find all the
notes on the G string right.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.710
So here we are on the G string, and we know
from G to A there's 2 frets.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.710
Those are part of our rule.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.959
So here's G [boom, boom] there's 2 frets,
and there's A. Let's say that we wanted to

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.959
continue.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.629
Here's A. Well, we know that to B it's 2 frets,
right.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:27.050
So there's B. Let's find notes on the 2nd
string, the B string.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.110
So here's B, imagine it's a little spot back
here.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.229
Well B to C, that's one of those special ones
right.

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.320
So we're going to go from B to C. It's only
1 fret, right.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.919
Let's see if we can figure out what the next
note is, right.

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.020
We know from C to D is 2 frets, so, what is
that note?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.970
Well, it's C sharp, right, or D flat.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.249
Now, you can find any note on the guitar.
