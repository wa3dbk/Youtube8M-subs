00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.910
Keeping your riding mower in top shape isn't
hard--and with the right maintenance it can

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.290
run reliably for years.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.340
When working on your mower, do it in a well-ventilated
area on a hard, flat surface.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.369
Also, disconnect the battery.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.120
And be sure to read your owner's manual for
instructions specific to your mower.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.070
Every time you mow you should check for loose
or missing fasteners, shields, and deflectors.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.449
See that the tires are fully inflated and
test the brakes.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.219
Also check the oil level with the dipstick.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.850
After you’ve cut your lawn, it's important
to brush off the deck and engine.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.079
Be careful, the motor may be hot.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.660
A couple of times a season, lubricate the
spindles and pivot points, and check the air

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.660
filter.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.760
If it's dirty or damaged, put in a new one.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.260
If your mower uses an air filter pre-cleaner,
wash it with detergent and water, rinse and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.260
dry.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Also, make sure the blades aren't bent or
broken, and if they are replace them.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.149
Next, change the oil.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.079
Run the mower for a minute to make it easier
to drain.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.729
Turn it off, and disconnect the battery.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.570
Remove the drain cap, and drain the oil into
a pan.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.890
Always replace the oil filter when you change
the oil.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.240
Wipe around the canister, and twist it off.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.020
Then, wipe some clean oil on the new filter
gasket, and screw on the canister until the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.119
gasket contacts the base.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.330
Then tighten one half turn.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.909
Be sure to dispose of the old oil and filter
properly.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.970
Add oil until the level settles at the full
mark.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.090
DON’T OVERFILL.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.510
Reconnect the battery and run the engine to
check for leaks.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.549
Check the level one more time and add oil
if necessary.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.939
Now, here are some things to do at the end
of every season.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.939
Clean the engine cooling fins with a brush
or compressed air.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.929
And check that the muffler and spark arrester
aren't rusted or loose.

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.770
It’s a good idea to replace the spark plugs
once a year.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.649
With the engine cool and the battery disconnected,
remove the plug wires and unscrew the spark

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.939
plugs.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.240
Screw the new plugs into the engine and replace
the wires.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.950
Next, replace the fuel filter.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.470
Do this when the tank is empty.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.280
Put a pan under the filter and slide away
the hose clamps.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.320
Then pull off the hoses.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.530
Connect the new filter with the arrow pointing
in the direction of the fuel flow.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.140
Install the clamps and check for leaks.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.030
Now remove mower deck.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.030
Thoroughly clean it—including underneath—and
check the condition of the drive belts.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.260
Replace them if they're cracked or worn.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.010
After a season of mowing the blades will be
dull.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.470
It’s easiest just to replace them with new
ones.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.120
Start by blocking them with a piece of wood.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.840
Remove the nut, along with the blade and washer.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:00.220
To reinstall, position the blade on the splined
shaft with the cutting edge facing the ground.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.330
Install the washer and replace the nut.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.140
With the blades blocked, tighten with a wrench.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.280
Reinstall the deck and check that it's level.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.180
To store your gasoline-powered mower for the
winter follow the instructions for your mower

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.560
and engine.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.840
Manufacturers may instruct you to run the
fuel system dry or to store the mower with

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.000
the tank full of fuel mixed with a fuel stabilizer.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.230
Then, remove the spark plugs and squirt about
an ounce of oil into the cylinders.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.670
Put the plugs back in and crank the engine
a few times to distribute the oil.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.250
After that you can remove the battery and
store it where it will not freeze.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.750
Store the mower in a dry, protected place.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.780
And that's it.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.930
Some simple maintenance will keep your mower
in top shape.
