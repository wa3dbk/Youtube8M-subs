00:00:02.478 --> 00:00:03.753
Hi, my name is
Lee Tiernan and

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:04.926
I'm here in
Chicago with my

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:07.018
friend the local barman,
Jessica Tessendorf.

00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:08.451
And today we're going
to show you how to

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:09.154
make a Southside.

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:17.002
[MUSIC]

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:18.100
&gt;&gt; So the way I like
to make a Southside.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.750
We're going to be using
fresh citrus juice,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.010
sugar, gin, and mint.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.870
So you can think of it
in terms as kind of like

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.110
a gimlet with mint or
a gin daiquiri with mint,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.090
however you wanna see it.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.580
We're gonna do
a three-quarter pour

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.725
of your fresh juice,

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:34.960
three-quarters ounce of
one to one simple syrup.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.197
It's one part sugar
to one part water.

00:00:37.197 --> 00:00:38.199
You don't even need
to heat it up,

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.174
just as long as
it's warm water.

00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:39.917
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:41.456
&gt;&gt; Then we pass it
through a chinois to

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:42.850
make sure there's
no pieces.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.940
Beefeater London dry gin.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.580
And then depending
on the size of your

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.550
mint leaves four,
five, maybe six.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.922
I usually do
a nice pinch.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:53.959
And then we'll do
shaking it on nice

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:55.381
cold draft ice.

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.157
&gt;&gt; You don't actually
have a shake face.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:57.819
&gt;&gt; A shake face?

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.978
&gt;&gt; You'd much rather
not have a shake face.

00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:01.549
&gt;&gt; I think I'd be in
the wrong industry if I

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:02.270
had a shake face.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah well, yeah.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.415
&gt;&gt; So to garnish both of
these lovely Southsides,

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.619
I'm going to be using
a fresh mint leaf.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.654
And a few drops of
Angostura bitters to

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.590
make it smell really
nice and refreshing.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.280
And you can serve it in

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.350
a variety of
different ways.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.660
To make a Southside you
could do a Southside Fizz

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.770
and serve it in
a Collins glass,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.890
over ice with
some soda water.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.610
You could do
a Southside Royale and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.720
instead of using soda you

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.585
could use some sparkling
wine or Champagne.

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:30.581
For you
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:31.207
&gt;&gt; Cheers.

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:32.018
&gt;&gt; Cheers.

00:01:36.024 --> 00:01:36.685
&gt;&gt; It's pretty ripe.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:37.266
&gt;&gt; That's good.

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.442
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That is good.

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:42.958
[MUSIC]

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.110
But is it called
a Southside in

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.222
other parts of
the country?

00:01:45.222 --> 00:01:45.843
&gt;&gt; It is.
So

00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:47.620
as with a lot of
cocktail culture,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.767
there's no agreed
upon circumstance for

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:50.759
where it started.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.424
I think here we like
to believe that it

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.412
started on the south
side our frame of mind,

00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:56.294
it's a popular cocktail,
rather than,

00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:57.667
on the south
side of Chicago.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:58.863
&gt;&gt; Well it's
delicious anyway.

00:01:58.863 --> 00:01:59.409
&gt;&gt; Well good.
