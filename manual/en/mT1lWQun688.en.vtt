00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:21.410
When a 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.370
game goes through an on-again, off-again development
cycle, that’s usually a bad thing.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.360
Delays are one thing, but cancellations almost
never bode well for the game being shelved.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.940
And frankly, they’re usually cancelled for
a reason.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.050
This is one of those games.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.460
Originally planned as an Xbox release, it
was cancelled in 2003 before being picked

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.600
up by a third publisher in 2006...and then
a fourth publisher in 2010.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.630
Ultimately, the game would be finished by
SnapDragon Games for the Nintendo Wii and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.110
brought to the States by Atari earlier this
month in this form.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.100
A form that clearly wears the burdens of its
past.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:14.460
It would feel wrong to call this a bad game
and maybe even incorrect.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.170
If nothing else, there are some interesting
ideas at work in The Kore Gang.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.360
It has a great art style—an occasionally
brilliant one, in fact—and a fun sense of

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.360
humor.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.431
But unfortunately, this is a game that stumbles
over its own two feet, weighed down by the

00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:34.760
apparent scars of a troubled development cycle
that spanned nearly a decade and two consoles.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.760
You play the game as Pixie, a girl who climbs
buildings and is evidently impervious to the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.330
effects of gravity and physics.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.729
She finds herself in the center of the Earth,
where an evil group of creatures is planning

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.060
to conquer the surface.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.000
Obviously, it’s up to Pixie to stop them,
and I say “obviously” because the game

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.390
feels this is obvious enough to warrant no
explanation.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.780
Long story short, Pixie finds a Big Daddy
suit and jumps in it.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.530
She finds friends to join her, none of them
ask questions and they embark on a journey

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.500
to stop the inner-Earth dwellers.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.920
And what all this means for you is an action-platform
game that sometimes flirts with being interesting...but

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.040
never really seals the deal.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.890
The Kore Gang is a 3D game, but only in a
technical sense.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.890
It’s actually very linear, almost 2D in
its feel because you’re essentially just

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.980
going from point A to point B. The cool worlds
the game often creates go largely unappreciated,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.680
since you never get to explore them as fully
as you might like.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.810
Of course, being linear isn’t necessarily
problem...except for when it is.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.340
The game provides a track to follow, and it
might even be an interesting track...if you

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.080
could see what you were doing.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.620
3D games like this have largely solved the
problems that were inherent to them during

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.790
the Nintendo 64 period, but The Kore Gang
seems to have missed that memo.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.910
Its camera is so bad, it actually inhibits
your enjoyment of the things the game does

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.940
right...specifically, some of the platforming
and environments.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.690
Being inside a monster’s stomach is really
cool.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:23.900
Falling to the bottom of it because you can’t
see what you’re doing is not.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.480
But speaking of that stomach, this is—again,
on occasion—a good-looking Wii game.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.720
The art is probably the highlight of The Kore
Gang, and it’s realized through some very

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.220
nice graphics techniques.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.900
The textures are fantastic for a Wii game,
and some of the effects are impressive, too.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.260
Now, the low point of the game’s aesthetics
is its character design, but otherwise, it’s

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.580
a very cool-looking game.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.120
Too bad it doesn’t play quite as cool.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.320
It feels clunky, and the weight of the suit
you’re moving in can make the platforming

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.220
especially difficult at times, but I think
perhaps the most difficult thing is seeing

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.290
potential go unfulfilled.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.690
The Kore Gang is an idea that lots of people
have been confident about, but after all these

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:18.739
years, the game just isn’t as good as 
the idea.
