00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.320
Burnie: Uh, hey Gus, I gotta bring something up, um

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.500
You sent a tweet to me the other day

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.560
something about, that we were - that you were street passing with me

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.860
what was that about?

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.080
Gus: So, yeah. I guess, I don't know if it's like as result of that update or what

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.080
like, I street pass with you every now and then at weird times, like

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.360
Burnie: Yeah

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.180
Gus: I was looking at a house the other day and you popped up

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.460
and uh, like I was going to bed one night, and my light went off, like at, midnight

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.880
so it's like, I don't know where the fuck that's coming from

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.380
Burnie: You brought that up on the podcast and I kind of ignored it when you brought it up

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.860
Hey, can you play the video that I gave you, that I said was a Red vs Blue video

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.820
Can you play that video instead?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.400
Burnie: Okay, explain what we're gonna do.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.460
Well, we're trying to get as many street passes as possible

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.720
luckily, we know a couple that lives nearby

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.800
that likes to streetpass

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.560
That being, Gus and Esther

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.600
So, we figured, if we drive by their house really slowly

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.340
We can not only get our streetpasses

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.740
but hopefully, by doing this repeatedly,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.720
we can freak them out very badly.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.620
Burnie: Well, hopefully these lights will turn green

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.720
and we will streetpass them, and then we'll see that we streetpassed them, in their house

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.920
in the middle of the night.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.940
It's coming from inside the house.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.820
Burnie: And we're gonna keep this up for how long?

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.100
A couple days?

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.000
Burnie: Until Gus goes crazy. Think this is gonna work?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.600
Ashley: Yeah. I don't think they're that difficult to unseat.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
Burnie: Okay we're here. What are we doing?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.040
So, uh, it looks like we're not close enough to streetpass from the truck

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.180
so we're actually just gonna have to go up and stalk on their lawn until we see the green light up

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.500
Ashley (whisper): I just got it. It just flashed green

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.600
I just streetpassed them. They're inside.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.700
We're out in the yard. This is awesome.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.680
Ashley: Okay, okay, okay. We're running

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.140
Burnie: Went and camped out on their lawn and we both got a street pass,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.700
that's what that green light means,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.700
so we picked up, either Gus or Esther or both,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.240
could be the holy grail.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.820
Come on, Esther.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.400
Come on, Esther. Yes! Gus!

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.100
Ashley: Just Gus.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.020
Burnie: I got just Gus.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.400
Successful, high five. Put it up.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.600
There we go. Alright. We did it, day 1.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.440
We're gonna keep this up until it drives Gus absolutely, positively insane.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.020
[Ashley laughs]

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.100
Burnie: Alright, it's now day 2

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.820
We're heading over to Gus'

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.820
to get another set of streetpasses. And it's 2 in the morning now.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.180
Ashley: Dammit.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.060
Burnie: You don't know, hold on. Yeah, just Gus.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.840
Alright, so a good fishing attempt,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.980
but not a great one.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.220
Burnie: Operation night 3,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.320
was a success. We don't know who we got but we definitely got somebody.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.060
Ashley: We're really hoping that we got Esther

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.500
cause I think she's the key to making this whole psychotic plan work.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.340
Burnie: She's way better than Gus.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.280
Burnie: Ohhhh! We got Esther!

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.040
Ashley: It's perfect!

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.360
Burnie: Oh, my God. I'm so happy.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.820
Ashley: We got Esther and not Gus.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.160
Burnie: But, that's okay.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.280
Ashley: Yeah, that's okay,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.300
because this makes it even weirder.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.160
Neither of us have seen Esther for a while.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.780
Burnie: Now we're in business. Now they're gonna be freaked out.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.360
I almost ran into that car.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.740
Alright, now they're gonna be freaked out.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.380
Burnie: We have an entirely new strategy for day 3.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.580
Which we're excited about.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.420
Ashley: What's our new strategy?

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.520
Burnie: I got a hat.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.000
And unfortunately, I've already streetpassed once today,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.980
I got that jackass Jordan

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.940
who makes the Rooster Teeth Animated Adventures

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.720
but now we're gonna go and try and get Gus and Esther.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.580
Burnie: Paydirt.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.660
Ashley: We've been playing too much Payday 2.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.380
Burnie: This is sad that this is like, the most,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.320
criminal thing I think I've ever done in my life.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.880
What's it like to be dating a bad boy?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.300
Ashley: Real turn on.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.260
Burnie: Ugh, jerk. Get out of here.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.780
Oh! Got Gus!

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.960
Ashley: Blah, blah, blah. Get out of the way, Jordan.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.440
Burnie: We just finished the Rooster Teeth Podcast,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.520
but we specifically turned off our DS's on the set,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.900
so we didn't streetpass with Gus but we are gonna go streetpass with Esther.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.560
It's really in depth now, it's a very convoluted mind game at this point.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.180
Ashley: How many people know about this?

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.520
Burnie: Um, almost everybody in the company knows about it now.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.400
Sorry, I just threw everybody in the company under the bus.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.760
Gus, they all knew.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.880
Burnie: Yes!

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.500
Ashley: Just Esther.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.480
Burnie: Just Esther.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.780
Now they have to be getting really freaked out,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.460
and wondering what the hell's going on.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.680
Cause before it was like, 'Oh, you're stalking us!'

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.880
But now, we're - seriously, we're stalking them.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.860
Right, we are? Is this even legal what we're doing?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.960
Ashley: Well, we are...

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.100
no, probably not

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.620
...stalking...

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.080
Burnie: We should probably read up on that before we post this video.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.520
Alright, so we're in Seattle now

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.080
it's the night before PAX

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.460
and we thought we would wrap up our,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.260
street passing prank, with one final street pass.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.240
Burnie: So, the panel is tomorrow.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.300
The panel is tomorrow.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.960
Burnie: They've been going crazy. They've been tweeting about it

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.020
Ashley: They each send us tweets asking us to stop stalking them.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.180
which we, of course, ignored.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.060
Burnie: And we're not even staying in this hotel.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.440
Burnie: We're gonna go to their room.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.760
Gus, that was our last one.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.980
We promise we're not gonna do this anymore

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.900
Probably not ever, now that you know about it.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.660
We're sorry.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.660
Ashley (whisper): We're not sorry.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.440
Burnie: We're not sorry. We're not sorry.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.300
Ashley (whispers): Happy PAX!

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.200
(Applause)

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.360
Gus: So um, you motherfuckers.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.040
Ray: Don't look at me, I didn't do anything

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.480
Gus: He said everyone knew!

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.900
The most creepy thing to me is,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.060
the one that you did at 12:30, my DS was under my television,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.460
and I was watching TV, I don't know what I was watching, and then I saw the green light start pulsing,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.040
and come on, and thought, "I just streetpassed with Esther 15 minutes ago."

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.820
"There's no way that's her. How...?" and then I go up and grab it

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.940
and I'm like, "Burnie?!"

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.900
(laughter)

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.500
Jerks...

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.240
Burnie: Thanks for being a good sport, Gus.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.580
Ray: For now.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.500
Gus: Until I snap and lose it.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.360
Gus: You're all on the list.
