Honeywell Dolphin 6100 Product Review

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.820
Hi, this is Jamie from POSGuys.com,
and this is the Honeywell Dolphin 6100

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.820
Mobile Computer.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.100
It's mainly used for
warehouse applications and inventory.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.480
The Dolphin 6100 has a 2.3 inch
touch-screen.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.820
It also has a 28-key
keypad with directional keys and numbers,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.859
much like a cell phone.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.119
It has 3 scan
buttons, one on each side and one on

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.220
the front.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.210
On the back you see the
hand-strap with the stylus-holder.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.500
And
this is the battery, and you can just pop

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.840
it out for easy battery change.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.320
The
battery is a lithium-ion battery.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.490
It
has 3.7 volts, and it stays charged for

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.500
about 8 hours, and takes less than 4 hours
to charge fully.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.730
The Dolphin 6100 has a 2D imager with an
aiming reticle.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.760
As you can see by the four
corners and the plus-sign for more accurate

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760
scanning.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:16.110
The Dolphin can scan big barcodes
up to 4 or 5 feet away.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.910
And smaller barcodes
about up to a foot away.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.500
It's also
capable of scanning 2D barcodes, including

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.541
PDF417s, which are usually found on drivers
licenses and address labels.

00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:44.159
The 6100 can be paired with numerous different
kinds of inventory software, but for this

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.530
demonstration, we're using Proxis Stock
Manager.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.090
Now, to add an item, putting a new
item in to the 6100.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.462
The barcode, just scan
the barcode that you're adding, and then you

00:01:58.462 --> 00:02:10.590
can use the on-screen keyboard to add your
description.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.550
And then the number pad to add your quantity.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.810
Save it.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.270
And then for just an easy lookup option,
just hit Lookup, scan the barcode you want

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.110
to
lookup, and then it pulls it up so you can

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.190
see
the description and the quantity that you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.370
have
in stock.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.910
The Dolphin 6100 runs Windows CE 5.0.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.459
It also
comes with an IP54 seal, so it prevents any

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.150
water splashes or dust getting into its
internals.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.730
Um, it also comes with Bluetooth,
so if you need to pair it to a printer or

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.790
another scanner, that's available.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.480
Some models
come with WiFi and uh, b and g protocols,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.420
and uh,
the cable and charger are sold separately.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.569
