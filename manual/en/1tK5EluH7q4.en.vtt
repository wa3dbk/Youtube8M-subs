00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.209
I am James Robinson. I am on of the senior
photographers here at John Rylands Library

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.340
which is part of the University of Manchester
right in the city centre. The library opened

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.840
in 1900. It was built as a gift for Manchester,
it has always been a library. There has been

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.429
a photographic unit within the library for
over 100 years. For the whole time the unit

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.500
was here, we have a record of everything they
have used. Obviously, now we have gone on

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.500
to digital and we are using the Phase One
645 body, the IXR body and the IQ180 back.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.430
This is our manuscript and archive store room.
This is where all of our most important

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.230
manuscripts and archives are held.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.230
This is what we call the Giant Koran. 
It weighs 52 kilograms,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.210
it's almost a meter in length. 
We have digitized this in its entirety.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.549
This is some examples of 
papyrus fragments that we have.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:15.080
The library holds every written form ranging from 
B.C. with Sumerian tablets and clay tablets

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.380
all the way up to modern printed 
material and photographs.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.080
Prior to digitization, anything that 
we do has to come through the collection

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.159
care department for assessment.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.659
When an object is required for 
digitization, the collection

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.320
care department assess it's suitability.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.920
They do that by looking at 
the structure of the binding,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.500
seeing if it needs any repair and
also doing any repair if necessary.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.740
This is all of our equipment that we use: Two IXR
bodies, DF body, and we have two Air bodies.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.490
We have a variety of different lenses ranging
from the Schneider 28mm leaf shutter lens,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.990
we got the 80mm lenses. The 55mm is incredibly
useful for photographing large items.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.269
The 120mm macro lens is really good.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.790
We use a number of different set ups. 
What you see here is our large copy

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.190
stand. We mount the IXR on the IQ180 above
the object here. The object sits on the base board.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.549
We got high adjustment using the backslider
there. The camera is all plugged in and tethered

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.630
straight into the computer so all adjustments
can be controlled from over there. We can

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.590
adjust the focus, the aperture, shutterspeed,
we can check the white balance settings and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.790
the color control and of course fire the shutter.
On this kind of setup we use the IXR body,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.790
primarily because it allows us to get through
so much material. The camera is incredibly

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.560
hard wear and you haven't got the mirror in
there. It's a mirrorless body. If we need

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.600
to do any longer exposure on an item we don't
have interference from that. Shooting on a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.600
copy stand setup like this we use the two
Profoto D1 heads. We found that they are the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.070
most durable, most reliable, and gives the
most consistent color temperature output which

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.270
is important for what we're shooting.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.510
Before we get down to any 
actual photography of the item,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.000
we'll take a shot of the color checker.
We'll do that through the computer. That will

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
allow us to get the right white balance and
we'll be able to focus on that.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.000
Now we're in Capture One Pro.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.199
We'll go into the Live View mode. 
We can use the focusing tools there

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:48.650
to get it perfect. We can adjust the settings
of the camera for the correct aperture, shutter

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.940
speed, and ISO pretty much instantly once
that image is in there. We can start making

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.440
checks and after we've done a lens cast correction, we're ready to go.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.440
Once we have everything 
photographed into the computer,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.930
some of the things we need to 
check is if everything is

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.930
in focus and sharp, that all of the color
settings are right. We'll check the straightening.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.100
One of the handy tools we use a lot is the
Keystone Correction Tool to make sure it's

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.810
completely flat and level. We don't put the
images through any other kind of software

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.350
or processing. We try to capture it exactly
how the object is. That is one of the key

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.350
elements for us. Using the IQ180 
gives the incredible detail we need.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.900
My name is Gwen Riley Jones and I'm a senior 
photographer at John Ryland's Library.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.900
One of the projects we are 
working on at the moment

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.660
is one of the biggest projects 
we have ever undertaken.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.650
It is the digitization of Cardinal Newman's
Archive. Working on collections like this,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.990
we need the best kit for the job. For this
setup we're using a traveller's conservation

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.100
cradle and an IXR camera with an IQ180 back
and an 80mm Schneider lens. We use the IQ180

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.290
because it's the highest resolution digital
back on the market. We use the IXR body because

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.210
it's mirrorless and speeds up our workflow,
and Schneider lenses because the glasses got

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.770
uncompromised quality. The great thing about
the setup is that it is portable, we can take

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.360
it with us on location. We can travel lightly.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.770
One of the great things about the cradle is

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.760
that it supports the book throughout the digitization
process. This book is highly illuminated with

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.430
a lot of gold and different color pigments
within the text. One of the great things about

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.740
the IQ180 is that you get almost microscopic
detail. Researchers use this to analyze the

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.740
text in various ways, so they can look at
the handwriting in really fine detail.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.960
Pigment researchers look at how the pigments are 
formed and true color reproduction is important

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.260
for this kind of work.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.200
We have been using Phase One and 
Capture One Pro software as

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.340
a complete package from start to finish. 
From the actual beginning of the shoot all

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.110
the way through to the final 
output which is excellent.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.710
It is an incredibly efficient way to work.
