00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The Gupo Livestock Market has always been in the center of constant civil complaints from the nearby residents and animal protection organizations. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Even an international animal protection organization has visited and asked to stop the dog slaughter and the dog meat culture.  

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The dog traders strongly opposed their appeal.  Dong-Won Jang reports.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is the livestock market at the Busan Gukgu Gupo Market.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is the only market in Busan where dogs, chickens, ducks , rabbits , etc are slaughtered and sold on the spot.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This market has been in existence for several decades but due to the increase in awareness about animals 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the fact that there are schools and residential areas nearby, civil  complaints about this market are made constantly.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The reasons for the civil complaints are the scene of animals in cages, disgusting stench, noise,…etc.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
On April 17th an international animal protection organization visited the Gupo Market and asked for it to change.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They asked to stop the slaughter of dogs and to end the dog meat trade.  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In addition, they pointed out the Korea's culture of dog meat.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
David Neale / Animals Asia, Director of Animal Welfare – “These dogs are exactly the same.  There is no division between the dogs which is raised for meat and the dogs which is raised for pets. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A dog is a dog.  They are exactly the same.  They have the same senses, they have the same emotions, and they have the same feeling."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The dog traders’ position is that they cannot agree with his opinion.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The dog traders argue that for the past 400 years, livestock animals were sold at the Gupo Market and all the dog traders are small merchants 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
so they cannot stop selling dogs without any other alternatives and the dog meat culture is part of Korea’s native culture.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Hong-Seong Dae / Manager of the Gupo Market Livestock Trader’s Association-"Your action to sanction the practice that is not banned by our Korean law is a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
cultural invasion against our nation’s traditional food culture as well as an interference in our domestic affairs and an infringement of our sovereignty.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The animal protection organization stated that they will find a nourishing food that is legal and will suggest to the merchants that they sell it instead.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The merchants showed a willingness to improve(change).

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We have been considering moving the livestock market underground and introducing a state of the art facility for slaughtering.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Yong-Ho Park / President of the Gupo Market Livestock Trader’s Association - "We are all small merchants who carried on this business for many years. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
If we had the money to be in other businesses, we would have.  We have been working in this business for many decades because we don’t have the money.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We are thinking of several alternatives but we don’t have the budget…”

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In addition, they also demanded legislation over the dog meat culture as well as the management of the “disgusting” facility. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
They stated that if operating their business within the current law is a problem, then they demand a new law.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Heon-Young Park / President of the Gupo Market Merchant’s Association - "Our government shouldn’t tell us to stop eating dog meat only when there is a large international event being held here. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
International organizations should put the pressure on our government.  If our government legislates a law we will comply with them.”

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
After the meeting with the merchants, the international animal protection organization visited the organizing committee for the Busan International Film Festival

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and demanded the creation of a program for the animal protection related film during the festival.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Merchant’s view of “animals for the human”, animal protection organization’s view of “animals that coexists with human”.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Their tense conflict continues.
