00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:08.820
David: Several new members I want to say hello
to today, new David Pakman Show members, Evan

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.820
B., Josselin D., Ray W., and of course, Louis's
good friend Scott A. Welcoming all of them,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.740
and everybody else, to the David Pakman Show
membership program.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.600
Let's talk about this birther, Louis, who
has been convicted for refusing to deploy.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.019
Did you hear about this story?

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.820
Louis: No.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.359
David: OK. Our audience may not be surprised
to hear that from you. A military jury has

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.490
convicted an army doctor who disobeyed orders
to deploy to Afghanistan because he questions

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.780
whether President Barack Obama is eligible
to be president. OK, so we've interviewed

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.379
Orly Taitz, the queen of the birther movement,
several times. We've heard a number of different

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:54.900
birther arguments. Here we actually have a
member of the military who is actually acting,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.049
conducting his career, essentially, around
the idea that he questions Barack Obama's

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.940
eligibility and legitimacy as the president.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.539
Louis: Well, first of all, it wasn't... it
was George Bush who sent people to Afghanistan,

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.530
so I don't see...

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.670
David: Right, well, Barack-- but I think this
is a new, this is a new deployment. Barack

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.920
Obama has expanded deployment, is what this
refers to. And this is a jury in Fort Meade,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.460
Maryland, which found Lieutenant Colonel Terrance
Lakin guilty of missing a flight that would

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.619
have gotten him to Kentucky for his eventual
deployment. He was convicted of a charge of

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.060
missing movement by design.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.909
He posted a bunch of videos on YouTube, and
he certainly... to say he aligned himself

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.460
with the birthers is an understatement. And
a quote, I think, is, "He aligned himself

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.439
with those who question whether Obama is a
natural-born citizen as the Constitution requires

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.619
for presidents." So essentially he's a birther.
I think that's fair to say. Would you agree?

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:51.619
Louis: Agreed.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.299
David: He disobeyed court orders... or, orders
to deploy to Afghanistan, and he believed

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.939
that his inaction is justified because as
a birther, he questions whether President

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.619
Barack Obama is actually qualified to give
that order.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:13.890
This reminds me you know of what? Of the Tiller
killer, Scott Roeder, trial, where the man

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.330
who killed abortion doctor Scott Tiller argued
well, I was actually saving lives by taking

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.280
this one, so you actually should not convict
me for this crime. It's kind of the same thing,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.070
where you're just pulling in things that have
no bearing on the actual issue at hand, which

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.670
is did he miss the deployment date or not?

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.390
Now, he told the military jury he had gone
to a chapel to do some, quote, "soul-searching",

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.920
and he felt he simply had no choice but to
disobey the orders.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.720
Louis: Pretty bogus.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.590
David: This strikes me as incredibly hypocritical,
and I'll tell you exactly why. Conservatives

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.390
are all for order, military discipline. All
of a sudden, enlisted soldiers are now just

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.670
questioning whether any order is valid based
on is the president really the president?

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.620
I mean, there's something hilarious about
that, is there not?

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.952
Louis: It's odd. I mean, you're not really
supporting your fellow troops, you're not

00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:11.150
really supporting the mission, you're not
setting a good example.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.150
David: Certainly not.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.350
Louis: It's dumb.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.400
David: Talk about two guys having... or, rather,
guys having to shower with other gay soldiers

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.521
affecting unit cohesion, supposedly. Isn't
a guy not showing up because he says the president,

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:29.340
the guy at the top, isn't really a legitimate
president, isn't that really going to be what

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.960
affects unit cohesion? That's the argument,
I think, that is much more reasonable. Unit

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.080
cohesion? This guy doesn't think that the
Commander in Chief is even qualified or legitimately

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.540
giving orders.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.530
Certainly a conviction here was in order,
but I could even argue that a higher conviction.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.790
Again, the charge was missing movement by
design. He may be instigating a revolt, could

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.120
he not? I think there's an opportunity here
for actually a bigger charge. Questioning

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.040
those... questioning the Commander in Chief's
validity at giving orders?

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.430
Louis: And what would that charge be?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.900
David: I don't know, I mean, I'm no lawyer,
but it just sounds to me. Listen, if we want

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.760
Julian Assange dead or alive and charged with
treason and the death penalty, so on and so

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.739
forth, this has got to carry something, doesn't
it? Something more than just missing movement

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.739
by design.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.110
He faces up to 18 months in prison and dismissal
from the Army when he's sentenced on the first

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.539
charge. Here's his quote: "I believe there
is a valid question that needs to be asked

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.430
and answered," referring, of course, to Obama's
eligibility to be president.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.461
Louis: Well, it has been asked many times
and it has been answered many times.

00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:38.740
David: That's right. It seems that he's just
not paying attention to that.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.139
Louis: Right. Maybe he doesn't have a TV.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.680
David: That could be it. It could just be
a lack of media access that's causing this

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680
whole misunderstanding.
