00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:05.386
(playful music)

00:00:05.386 --> 00:00:06.455
- Hey friends.
- Hey everyone.

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:07.615
- Thank you so much for tuning in

00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:10.309
to cook with April on Tasty Tuesday.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.190
Today I'm gonna show you how to make

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.744
banana pudding with
homemade whipped cream,

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:16.183
so stay tuned and enjoy.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.553
Let's get started with a whipped cream

00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:21.013
that's heavy cream, powdered sugar,

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:23.474
and vanilla extract, I
forgot to show that part.

00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:25.610
And then you're ready
to use your hand mixer

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.630
and you're gonna just keep on mixing

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.393
until it turns into a thick consistency.

00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:33.528
It takes about five minutes or so.

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:34.921
And that is your whipped cream.

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.616
You're ready to refrigerate,

00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:38.659
and now let's work on the banana pudding.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.887
You're gonna go ahead
and cut up four bananas.

00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:44.371
(playful music)

00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:47.274
And in a saucepan, place butter,

00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:48.760
brown sugar,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.269
and some cinnamon.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.917
And that's gonna be a caramel sauce,

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.798
so you're just gonna go ahead

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:55.957
and simmer that to a medium

00:00:55.957 --> 00:00:57.745
until it's completely melted,

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.067
and then you're ready to add the bananas.

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:03.039
And those are caramelized bananas.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.152
Oh my goodness, so good.

00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:08.728
And once you've mixed the
mixture on with the bananas

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:11.073
you are ready to take it out of the heat.

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:12.327
In a medium saucepan,

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:14.481
place sugar, flour,

00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:16.084
eggs, milk,

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:19.032
and you're ready to whisk that.

00:01:19.032 --> 00:01:20.913
And then you're gonna
gradually add more eggs,

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:21.981
and then whisk,

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.396
and you're gonna whisk
that to like a medium heat

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:26.207
and it's gonna thicken after about

00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:28.157
eight to ten minutes or so.

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:29.133
And that's it.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.780
You're gonna just place
your caramelized banana,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.171
and then your pudding,

00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:37.515
and then vanilla wafers next on top.

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:40.022
You're just layering
all that deliciousness

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:41.857
on top of each other.

00:01:41.857 --> 00:01:45.084
And now you're ready to
add more of the pudding,

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:49.774
and my favorite part, the bananas.

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:51.028
And last but not least,

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:56.028
the delightfully delicious whipped cream.

00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:58.319
And that is your banana pudding.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.293
Oh my goodness, this is so good.

00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:02.080
Enjoy, you guys.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.820
Aright, my taste tester's Liam

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.306
and Daddy.

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:07.583
- Is Liam gonna taste test today?

00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:08.117
- No.

00:02:08.117 --> 00:02:09.371
(laughter)

00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:11.554
But he's got a spoon
'cause he eats bananas,

00:02:11.554 --> 00:02:13.109
but not banana pudding, huh?

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.340
- I don't even know how
to attack this thing.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.400
It's so like enormous.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.145
- Ooh, maybe add a
little bit of that wafer.

00:02:17.145 --> 00:02:17.888
- Should I, in the bite?

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.560
- Yeah, the crunch, man, the crunch.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.697
- Let me get some of
the pudding underneath.

00:02:20.697 --> 00:02:22.276
- Ooh, so good.

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:23.832
I ate mine already, you guys.

00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:26.339
Ow, that hurt my toe, the spoon.

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:27.036
- Oh my gosh.

00:02:27.036 --> 00:02:28.824
- How does Daddy like it?

00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:30.031
- I need one more bite.

00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:31.796
- Ooh.

00:02:31.796 --> 00:02:33.189
- There's so many things that this--

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:33.694
(laughter)

00:02:33.694 --> 00:02:35.876
There's so many things that
this dish has going for it.

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:38.035
The pudding, the homemade whipped cream.

00:02:38.035 --> 00:02:39.196
- Ooh, the whipped cream.

00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:40.845
- The bananas, like was it caramelized,

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:41.495
or something like that?

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.795
- Yes, it was.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.281
- With the cookie.

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:44.908
- Ooh.

00:02:44.908 --> 00:02:47.532
- It's so velvety, like
it's really, really creamy.

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:48.530
It's not too sweet.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.170
- Yeah.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.502
- And everything comes together

00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:52.617
to compliment in one bite.

00:02:52.617 --> 00:02:54.033
It's honestly,

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:55.287
I feel like this is something you get at

00:02:55.287 --> 00:02:56.587
like a fancy restaurant or something.

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:57.888
- Thank you.
- You know, honestly.

00:02:57.888 --> 00:02:59.441
- Thank you.

00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:01.995
- The homemade, I don't
usually like custard,

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.387
because it's really sweet, you know?

00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:05.942
But this is amazing, honey.

00:03:05.942 --> 00:03:07.846
- I notice that the pudding
itself is not sweet,

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:09.146
but the caramelized,

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:09.913
ooh, you got a little.

00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:10.911
(laughter)

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:11.747
On his sock.

00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:13.790
The caramelized part is so good.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.021
- This is unbelievable.

00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:16.437
- Oh my gosh, I ate all of mine

00:03:16.437 --> 00:03:18.736
and I was like rolling
the back of my eyes.

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:20.083
I was like, oh my goodness.
- She was.

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:21.406
- You guys have to try this.

00:03:21.406 --> 00:03:22.521
- You really do, it's so good.

00:03:22.521 --> 00:03:24.007
- I say that for all the recipes, but no,

00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:26.070
this one, you guys, this one for sure.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.486
Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:29.113
(laughter)

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:31.922
And I'm gonna give you
a banana soon, okay?

00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:32.944
