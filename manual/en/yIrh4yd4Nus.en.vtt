00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:04.286
Trichotillomania is a disorder that has
been talked about for hundreds of years.

00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:08.366
And it involves people who compulsively
or habitually pull their hair,

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:14.106
to the point of hair loss, either on
their head, facial hair or body hair,

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:16.566
and cannot control this behavior.

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:18.516
It's a little complicated in the sense too

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:21.606
that there are probably several
different subtypes of hair pulling.

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:24.546
Some people are pulling their hair and
they're not even aware that they're pulling.

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:27.936
People will tell me, "I just notice
I've got a pile of hair in my hands."

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:31.556
Other people find it very enticing;
they find it very pleasurable.

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:37.496
For those people, it's probably much more like
a substance addiction, gambling addiction.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.626
We had 50 people come in to the study.

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:41.956
This is the largest study ever
done for one of these types

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:43.706
of compulsive behaviors, such as hair pulling.

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:45.776
Twenty-five got a dietary supplement.

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:46.876
Twenty-five got a placebo.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.756
We didn't know what they were taking;
they didn't know what they were taking.

00:00:49.756 --> 00:00:51.316
They were identical-looking pills.

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.556
On average, it was about 90 percent female

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:58.886
as this disorder is most
likely, more common in women.

00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:01.356
And what we found is after
about nine weeks of treatment,

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.766
people on the dietary supplement
dramatically reduced their hair pulling,

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:10.206
to the point that it was dramatically
different from the people who were on placebo.

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:13.116
And these were people who had said
they had gone through all types

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:14.976
of treatment, and nothing had ever worked.

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:18.006
So the dietary supplement is N Acetyl Cycteine.

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:22.786
People have used it in HIV
folks for their immune systems.

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:26.016
Some people have now used it
for cocaine-addicted adults,

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:31.586
but this is the first time it's been
used in a sort of a habit behavior

00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:34.896
or a more compulsive behavior,
and in a large sample to see

00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:36.326
if it would help in something like this.

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:42.436
The significance of this study is not just that
it helps treat hair pulling, which is important

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:46.036
for the people who suffer from that,
but it's really that it starts looking

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:50.146
from a very controlled way at
a completely different sort

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:53.716
of chemical target for compulsive behaviors.

00:01:54.196 --> 00:02:00.586
In the last several years, people have realized
that maybe glutamate, which is a chemical

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:05.286
in the brain that's sort of all about excitation
- so it gets us revved-up, it gets us wanting

00:02:05.286 --> 00:02:08.236
to do something - and this is why
it's been implicated in addiction.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:13.796
So when it's overactive we really want to do
things, and not always the healthiest behaviors.

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:20.576
And it's this dietary supplement that really
reduces the drive of that excitation chemical

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:25.016
in the brain, and therefore allows people
to start thinking about their behaviors,

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:29.046
being able to control it better, so people
would say, "you know I kind of wanted

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:33.556
to pull my hair a little bit but I
was able to say no, I'm not going to."

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:43.646
It was easier for them to put
the brakes on their behavior.
