00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.900
I heard some gypsies came to town.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.600
Is it true that they are fortune tellers?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.840
That's nonsense. Let's go and see them.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.980
I wonder what advice they could give me?

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.020
Not today. It's getting late and the forest at this time is not safe.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.920
Ah ah. Don't worry, Sir. I will take care of Bob.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.180
I know you will, Alan, I know you will.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.440
Bob is my best friend. I will not let anything happen to him.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.360
Very well, I'm always trusting you. Go,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.580
go ahead and have fun both of you.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.780
Thank you father.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660
(Growling sound)

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.500
Ah did ah did you hear that?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.580
Shh,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.780
it's a bear.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.980
My father was right. It's getting dark and the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.680
forest is not safe for us.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.860
Um..

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.420
We will be fine, um.. don't worry.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.200
Alan look, it's the bear. It's in the middle of the path.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.320
Ah   Oh no, run  run

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320
Run  uh uh

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.100
Let me  the first one to climb the tree.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.020
Fine let me help you.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.920
Get into my shoulders.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.520
uh Give me your hand uh hurry up.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.120
There is no room for the both of us, find another place to hide.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.320
God,  what can I do now?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.820
Hmm. I have heared my father telling me that a bear will not touch a dead body.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.680
So I will lay flat on the ground and pretend that I am dead. haah

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.960
Oh,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.020
Bob

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.220
I thought the bear was going to attack you.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.800
I saw him whispering something to your ear.  Oh

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.410
Oh he he was a fortune teller bear .A fortune teller Bear?

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.780
Uh, Yes, he came along with the gypsies, and he read my palms.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.840
Really? What did he say?

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.480
He told me never to travel with a friend who deserts me at the first sign of trouble.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.560
Just the advice I'd needed.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.940
um

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.940
I'm so sorry.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.840
Okay, I'm going home.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.100
Goodbye.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.380
Dear children, can you guess the moral of the story?  yes.  It's nothing but,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.520
Misfortune tests, the sincerity between friends.
