&gt;&gt; [Background music] My
name is Sarah Eichberger.

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:09.696
I am a student in the School of
Public Health Nutrition Program

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.986
at the University of Minnesota.

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:14.226
I did my undergraduate
in dietetics

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:15.606
at Michigan State University.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.756
I worked as a dietician for
seven years with immigrant

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:21.246
and refugee communities
in an urban environment.

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:24.066
I gathered a lot of these
personal stories about some

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.746
of the barriers individual
people were facing whether it

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:30.566
was gaining access to healthy
food or being physically active.

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:33.386
From those experiences
I wanted to learn more.

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.776
I wanted to do something
on a broader scale

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:39.146
and so that's what really pushed
me to pursue public health.

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:41.396
The masters in public
health program looks

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:45.816
at the system environment and
policy and what you can do

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.896
to be effective on
a-- on a larger scale.

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:55.606
[ Music ]

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:58.046
&gt;&gt; [Background music] I chose
the University of Minnesota

00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:00.356
because of the caliber of
the program and the faculty.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.086
I am a teaching assistant
for Dr. Jamie Stang here

00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:05.086
in the school of public health.

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:07.186
As a teaching assistant
I am available

00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:08.846
to answer questions
from students.

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:11.966
I am providing insight into
specifically the projects

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.356
that the students are working
on throughout the course.

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:16.736
I guess the biggest benefit

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:19.776
for me being a teaching
assistant would be having

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:23.896
that one-on-one communication
time with professor Stang.

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:26.096
Dr. Jamie Stang is a
leader in her field

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:27.726
of maternal child
health and nutrition.

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:30.636
And so having that
opportunity to work with her

00:01:30.896 --> 00:01:32.746
in a professional way
is really beneficial.

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:42.706
&gt;&gt; [Background music]
It's National Food Day.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.626
Inside we have a number of
different tables from businesses

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:49.966
and organizations promoting
some of the work they're doing

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.446
around the good food movement.

00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:56.606
Food day is a national campaign
that was organized by the Center

00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:57.696
for Science and Public Interest.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.926
We organized a student
event aimed

00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:06.196
at developing students thoughts
and posing critical questions

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:09.266
about where their food is coming
from, what good food is to them

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:12.276
and we're really hoping this
event will launch a further

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:13.976
and larger conversation
on campus.

One of the things I took

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:25.016
up this semester is a tap class.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:27.306
Tap is very percussive
in nature.

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:28.056
It's very rhythmic.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:33.026
It's fun to get out your tap
shoes and exercise those muscles

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:35.896
that go from your brain to
your feet and get that going.

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:39.946
I think it's really important
to not only be a student

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:44.186
and focus you know your energy
and time on reading and writing

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:45.776
and everything involved
with being a student,

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:48.806
but its also important to
find time to do the things

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:52.536
that also make you a more
complete person like music

00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:53.906
and the arts or dance.

00:02:55.516 --> 00:03:01.886
[ Music ]

00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:02.756
&gt;&gt; [Background music] Being here

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:05.596
in the twin cities is very
health promoting not only can

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:08.096
you bike anywhere and
everywhere you need to,

00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:11.066
but it's the beautiful
environment to be a student.

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:13.316
So you have the Mississippi
River running through campus.

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:17.236
It almost feels as though
you have the accessibility

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:18.056
of a big city.

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:21.786
You can also venture out into
the wilderness if you wanted to.

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:24.806
I've made a lot of great
friends really doing cool things

00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:27.126
in other programs here in
the school of public health.

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:28.996
They've almost served
as mentors to me.

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:31.716
So I get to learn more
about their discipline

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:34.136
and how it connects to
my work in nutrition.

00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:37.836
After I graduate I would
love to work in partnership

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:39.606
with communities and
improving their environment

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:46.116
and improving their
accessibility to healthy food.
