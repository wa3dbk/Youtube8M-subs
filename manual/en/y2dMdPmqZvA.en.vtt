00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.269
 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.039
i'm mark williams for pickup trucks.com we're here in sunny Arizona with the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.539
2014

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.560
chevy silverado but we've already done a
video on what's new about this truck

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.680
which is basically been reinvented from
bumper to bumper

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.390
what we want to look at here is exactly
what kind of value you get for your

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.430
money behind me

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.550
silverado 1500 double cab LT two-wheel
drive with the v6 for thirty-eight

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.780
thousand dollars

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.300
let's take a closer look under the hood
and all-new ecotec3 4.3 liter v6 direct

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.190
injection variable valve timing and
cylinder deactivation as far as fuel

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.860
economy 18 in the city 24 on the highway
with a 20 combined

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.270
this is probably about as high-tech as
you can get in the segment from behind

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.579
the wheel huge improvements fine-tuning
the front springs and the rear springs

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:08.980
are essentially using

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.240
independent front suspension and live
axle rear end strategy but the

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.260
fine-tuning with the new frame huge
improvement over the vehicle that it's

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.500
replacing as far as engine performance

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.240
we know this is a v6 but a lot of people
will start thinking this is a v8 if they

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.920
don't know what's under the hood

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.420
they're going to think that this
high-tech ecotec3 v6 engine is actually

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.510
a mid-level v8 that's how well it
performs rlt double cab comes with what

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.570
Chevy calls the all-star option package
that includes a unique chrome grille

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.570
18-inch wheels and tires power seats a
rear locking differential and a host of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.510
other features for about twenty seven
hundred dollars

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.550
the interior is probably where General
Motors have made the biggest strides

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.930
quality

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.760
this is the LT package so it's not the
work truck package it's not the LTZ but

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.560
huge improvements over the interior that
it's replacing you can take a look at

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.640
the seams

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.250
it's almost organic looking like
furniture the new 40 20 40 front bench

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.000
seat offers a nice center console that
flips up into a seat

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.500
you also have center storage underneath
and we really like the new gauge layout

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.260
right here in front of the driver other
options on this LT double cab integrated

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:38.350
brake controller sidesteps spray in
bedliner LED lighting underneath the bed

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.640
lip and four unique tie-down spots
inside the truck

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.360
so there it is for a half-ton pickup
truck

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.670
thirty-eight thousand dollars by you
quite a bit but it also includes two

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.670
year 24,000 mile three maintenance

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.739
so that's our oil filters tire rotations
for that entire time

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.239
seems like a pretty good deal if you
want more information on half-ton pickup

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.599
