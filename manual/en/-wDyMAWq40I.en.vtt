00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:22.170
The book that I’ve chosen to talk about
is the Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.660
Indian by Sherman Alexie.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.789
And the book is a story of Junior, a very
bright kid, a budding cartoonist, who is growing

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.190
up on the Spokane Indian Reservation.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.290
He’s had medical – multiple medical problems
and is picked on by everyone except his one

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290
and only friend.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.600
So Junior begins the school year and he is
stopped short “When I saw this written on

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.240
the inside front cover ‘This Book Belongs
to Agnes Adams.’

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.150
Ok, now you’re probably asking yourself,
‘Who is Agnes Adams?’

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.540
Well, let me tell you, Agnes Adams is my mother.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.570
My mother, and Agnes is her maiden name.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.070
So that means, my mother was born an Adams,
and she was still an Adams when she wrote

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.240
her name in the book, and she was thirty when
she gave birth to me.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240
So, yeah.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.909
So that means that I was staring at a Geometry
book that was at least thirty years older

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:25.909
than I was.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.740
I couldn’t believe it.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.799
How horrible is that?

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.930
My school and my tribe are so poor and so
sad that we have to study from the same dang

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.960
books our parents studied from.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.819
That is absolutely the saddest thing in the
world.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:51.179
And let me tell you, that old, old, old, decrepit
Geometry book hit my heart with the force

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.350
of a nuclear bomb.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.759
My hopes and dreams floated up into a mushroom
cloud.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.040
So what do you do when the world has declared
nuclear war on you?”

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.179
Well, he threw the book, and he hit his teacher,
and he was promptly suspended.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.130
And it was then that Junior makes the decision
that he will survive.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.400
He will leave the reservation to attend an
all white school in the neighboring farm town

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.070
some 22 miles away, where the only other Indian
is the mascot.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.980
Parents have taken issue with this book, especially
with the swearing and the mentions of racism

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.709
and sex in the book.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:44.329
Yes, he does use the word boner and yes, he
does talk about erections and masturbating.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.950
And he also talks about poverty.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.000
Such bone crushing poverty where his family
can’t afford to take his cat to the veterinarian

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.750
so it dies.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.560
How his parents worked very hard to scrape
together enough money to pay for him – for

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.269
gas to get to school, for lunch money, a new
pair of jeans, a new shirt.

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.599
And he lied about how poor he was.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.940
He also writes about the assumptions that
white people have about Indians.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.460
The assumption that government just gives
money to Indians – that’s wrong, that’s

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.460
false.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.120
The assumption that Spokanes have lots of
money because they have a casino.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.090
Again, wrong.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.209
The only reason they have money is because
they work at the casino.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.849
He pretended that he was not poor.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:48.760
And to do that he develops this wonderful
list of excuses: he pretended that he wasn’t

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760
hungry.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.700
He pretended he was sick when he didn’t
have money for a field trip or a school dance.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.660
He pretended that Natives were allergic or
diabetes prone, so he couldn’t make purchases

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.950
at bake sales to support a school effort.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.900
He pretended to be old school and listen to
records because his family couldn’t afford

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.799
the – an iPod or the latest electronic gadget.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.030
And then the fall back was that he had to
attend a “cultural event.”

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.390
Finally, when his new basketball team beats
the reservation school team that he was once

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:39.320
a member of, he realizes, “I mean, jeez,
all of the seniors on our team were going

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.360
to college.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.790
All of the guys on our team had their own
cars.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.660
All of the guys on our team had iPods and
cell phones and PSPs and three pairs of blue

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.280
jeans and ten shirts and mothers and fathers
who went to church and had good jobs.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.910
Ok, so maybe my white teammates had problems,
serious problems, but none of those problems

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.510
were life-threatening.”

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.730
And as he looked over at the Wellpinit Redskins,
at Rowdy, “I knew that two or three of those

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.810
Indians might not have eaten breakfast that
morning.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.540
There was no food in the house.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.130
I knew that seven or eight of those Indians
lived with drunken mothers and fathers.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.170
I knew that one of those Indians had a father
who dealt crack and meth.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.730
And I knew two of those Indians had fathers
in prison.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.760
And I knew that none of them were going to
college.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.340
Not one of ‘em.”

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:49.060
Alexie himself has pushed back against critics
who call the content of his book inappropriate

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.910
for young people and he has argued that, “when
cultural critics fret about the evermore appalling

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.580
young adult books, they aren’t trying to
protect African-American teens forced to walk

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.410
through metal detectors on their way to school.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:13.240
Or Mexican American teens enduring the culturally
schizophrenic life of being American citizens

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.660
and the children of illegal immigrants.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.710
Native American teens growing up on third
world reservations.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.410
Or poor, white kids trying to survive the
meth hazed trailer parks.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.050
They aren’t trying to protect the poor from
poverty.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.580
They’re simply trying to protect their privileged
notions of what literature is and what it

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.940
should be.”

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:45.250
But more importantly, he also talks about
hope and love and tolerance.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.300
And because of that, I hope you read the book
– because it’s absolutely true.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.760
I’m Gyda Swaney and I’m a citizen of the
Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.640
I’m an Associate Professor here in the Department
of Psychology at The University of Montana

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.940
and I teach the multicultural psychology course
at the graduate and undergraduate level.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.390
I also direct the Indians into Psychology
program, that trains Natives into the Clinical

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.740
Psychology field; and I read banned books.
