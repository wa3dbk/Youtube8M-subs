00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.920
Evaluate the expression
5y to the fourth minus y

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.320
squared when y is equal to 3.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.830
So every place we
see a y here, we

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.990
could just replace it
with a 3 to evaluate it.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.080
So it becomes 5 times 3 to the
fourth power minus 3 squared.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.470
All I did is every time we
saw a y here, I put a 3 there.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.770
Every time we saw
a y, I put a 3.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.030
So what does this evaluate to?

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.170
And we have to remember
our order of operations.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.780
Remember, parentheses
comes first.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.510
Sometimes it's
referred to as PEMDAS.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.930
Let me write that down.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.850
PEMDAS, PEMDAS.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.400
P is for parentheses.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.150
E is for exponents.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.880
M and D are for
Multiplication and Division.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.800
They're really at the
same level of priority.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.000
And then addition
and subtraction

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.916
are at the same level.

00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:48.820
If you really want to do it
properly, it should be P-E,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.320
and then multiplication
and division

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.528
are really at the same level.

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:54.440
And addition and subtraction
are at the same level.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.960
But what this tells us is
that we do parentheses first.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.720
But then after
that, exponentiation

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.180
takes priority over
everything else here.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.920
So we have to evaluate
these exponents

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.270
before we multiply anything or
before we subtract anything.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.270
So the one exponent we'd have
to evaluate is 3 squared.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.020
So let's remember.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.610
3 to the first is just 3.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.080
It's just 3 times itself once.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.776
So it's just 3.

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:21.020
3 squared is equal to 3 times
3, 3 multiplied by itself twice.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.930
That's equal to 9.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.530
3 to the third power is
equal to 3 times 3 times 3.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.400
Or you could view it
as 3 squared times 3.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.870
So it'll be 9.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.840
3 times 3 is 9.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.580
9 times 3 is equal to 27.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.740
3 to the fourth is equal to
3 times 3 times 3 times 3.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.010
So 3 times 3 is 9.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.360
3 times 3 is 9.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.920
So it's going to be the
same thing as 9 times 9.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.875
So this is going
to be equal to 81.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.500
So we now know what
3 to the fourth is.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.650
We know what 3 squared is.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.150
Let's just put it
in the expression.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.700
So this is going to be equal
to 5 times 3 to the fourth.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.440
3 to the fourth is 81.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.390
So 5 times 81 minus 3 squared.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.130
And we have 3 squared
right over here.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.150
It is equal to 9.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.670
5 times 81 minus 9.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.540
Let's figure out
what 5 times 81 is.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.260
So 81 times 5.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.930
1 times 5 is 5.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.850
8 times 5 is 40.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.350
So this right over here is 405.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.270
So it becomes 405 minus 9.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.530
So that is going to be equal
to-- if we were subtracting 10,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.122
it would be 395.

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:35.920
But we're subtracting
one less than that.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.160
So it's 396.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
And we're done.
