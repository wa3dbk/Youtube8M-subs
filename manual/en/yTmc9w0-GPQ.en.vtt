Hi, my name is Sarah, I am here at Pet Land
in Pembroke Pines tonight, and on behalf of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.259
expertvillage.com, I’m going to speak with
you a little bit about purchasing and owning

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.289
a pet turtle. When you are looking to adopt
or purchase a turtle, there are several things

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.300
to watch out for to make sure that you get
a healthy turtle. You want to make sure that

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.339
your turtle is bright, alert and responsive.
You want to make sure that your turtle’s

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.050
shell looks proportional to the rest of its
body. In older turtles, sometimes malnutrition

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.460
can cause the turtle to outgrow its shell,
and you’ll have a turtle that looks too

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.090
big for its shell. In smaller turtles, you
want to make sure that the scales on the shell

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.620
look healthy and that you don’t see any
peeling or discoloration. You want to make

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.870
sure that if you handle the turtle and you
touch the feet that the turtle tries to retract

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.309
its feet—a turtle that does not try to retract
its feet or head when being handled, generally

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.659
is not a very healthy specimen, because they
are failing to try to protect themselves.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.450
One more thing you want to watch out for,
to make sure that the turtle that you are

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.040
purchasing is healthy, is watch out for any
lumps or bumps. You want to look at all the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.611
limbs as thoroughly as you can and then make
sure, you don’t see any swelling; make sure

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:29.400
that all the limbs feel normal. You also want
to check for any lumps on the side of the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.280
head: that could indicate infection. Other
things to watch out for are any cuts, scratches

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.920
or abrasions on the shell or skin of the turtle.
You want to make sure that you listen to the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.340
turtle as best you can to make sure you don’t
hear any clicking or wheezing noises, I mean

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.579
clicking or wheezing noises can be indicative
of a respiratory infection. Other things that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.100
you want to look at are the conditions that
the turtles are living in. You want to make

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.420
sure that they are in a nice clean pond or
aquarium; you want to try to choose your turtle

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.630
from a pet store that seems knowledgeable
about them. You want to ask a lot of questions

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.000
to the staff, and then make sure that they
are knowledgeable about turtle care. Just

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.970
to make sure that if you ever have any questions,
you can give them a call and then ask them

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.410
or they can properly direct you to a reptile
veterinarian. On behalf of expertvillage.com,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.260
