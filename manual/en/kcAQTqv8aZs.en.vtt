Hey Youtube what's up?

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.320
This is Ben from Should I Get It.com and in
this video we're gonna be doing a review of

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.500
the Nikon Nikkor 85mm F/1.8 lens.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.330
I'll start this review by saying that I am
filming this on a Canon T2i with the Nikon

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.210
85mm lens.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.259
So I used a photodiox Nikon to EOS adapter
and right now what you're seeing is the 85

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.809
at F/3.2 at 1/80th of a second with a 1.6x
crop so I just wanted to let you guys know

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:35.929
that.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.899
Photo quality on this lens is phenomenal.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.800
I bought this lens to add it to my two other
lenses.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.230
I have my 18-50mm F/2.8 and the 50mm F/1.8
and this is just such a great lens for the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.230
price.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.210
It's definitely my primary headshot and portrait
lens.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
Shoot a lot of events with this actually,
this is my telephoto that I use there since

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.160
my max range was a 50 before.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.789
And this lens is just extremely sharp, the
autofocus is super fast and it's really nice

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.869
that you have that manual focus override ring
right on the lens.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.399
Now it's a big piece of glass, pretty sure
it's a 67mm thread.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.049
It is a little bit heavy so I would recommend
having a vertical grip if you're gonna use

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.780
this lens but if you're using a lens like
this you probably already have one or you're

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.500
using a pro body which should weigh it out
pretty nicely.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
The lens itself isn't super special, it doesn't
have nanocoating, doesn't have any of that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.509
special stuff BUT it is a very quick lens.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.229
It's an F/1.8 85mil you guys know that by
the title.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.830
The zooming is really fast and the manual
focus is really smooth, I love the focus ring

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.869
on this lens.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.270
So I'm just gonna show you some images here
and it works very well in natural light and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.119
the lens hood provides good protection from
lens flare and you can actually get really

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.250
nice flares with this lens which I like because
I like having some contrasty images with lens

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.850
flare in there sometimes.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.039
Not always but it is nice to have.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.789
As you can see in these headshots, the eyes
are really crisp and sharp.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.649
You can see a lot of detail and color and
this lens is just phenomenal.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.600
The only thing that I don't like about this
lens is that sometimes it has a few focusing

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.470
issues but I think that's more of my body.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.150
I'm shooting with a Nikon D90.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.380
Otherwise it's a very quick lens, I would
recommend you go to your local camera shop,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.180
try it out and if you like the lens in there,
if you like the focusing speed, GET IT!

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.830
It is a great tool to have.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.490
I've tried the 85 1.4.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.150
I wouldn't say that it's worth that huge price
jump.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.840
I'd rather get an 85mm and a 50mm or an 85
and a 35.
