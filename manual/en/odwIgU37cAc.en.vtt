00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.440
Now we come to the last of the King's pawn
openings that I intend to cover in this brief

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.360
overview. And this is far and away the most
common alternative for black to play as opposed

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.580
to pawn to King's four; it is the so called
Sicilian Opening. And the Sicilian Opening

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.300
is a game that leads to very sharp play. There
are many variants of it, new one's coming

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.700
out all the time, and really both players
have to be very conversant with it if this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.050
opening is going to be played because you
can go under pretty quickly if you play it

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.830
incorrectly. There are, in fact, things like
books written about one single variant of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:59.800
the Sicilian response so it shows you how
key it is in modern day chess. But, without

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.570
getting into all this great complexity, the
basic game starts like this. Pawn to King's

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.440
four again from white; and the black Sicilian
response, Pawn to Queen's bishop four. And

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.060
from here many different things can happen
as I mentioned. Usually the players would

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.860
go into a thing called the classical Dragon,
well, I say usually. Most commonly whites

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.490
next move would be to this; King's bishop
three, which leads towards the so called Dragon

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.250
variation of the opening. And the typical
black response at this point would be this.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:54.890
Now, the idea of this game is that black concentrates
primarily on attacking the Queen's side; and

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:04.690
white continues to focus more on the King's
side but has to, as I said earlier, be extremely

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.549
careful and cautious about what is happening
on the Queen's side of the board. And if you

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.420
do decide, as you develop as a chess player,
that you want to start playing the Sicilian

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.139
defense, you want to study it pretty carefully
before you actually get out there at any sort

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.579
of competitive level and use it.
