00:00:01.346 --> 00:00:03.396
All right, I have been waiting
for the holidays to come around

00:00:03.396 --> 00:00:06.419
to put this pin into action,
suggested a few months ago

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.752
by Alex and liked up by over 100
of you,

00:00:08.752 --> 00:00:13.303
the bokeh heart-shaped
picture-taking image thing.

00:00:13.303 --> 00:00:15.303
All right, what the [beep]
is bokeh?

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:17.455
Bokeh is a style of photography,

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:19.809
and it's defined as—

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.501
what is it defined as?

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.642
The way a lens renders

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:28.313
out-of-focus points of light,
something like that.

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:31.040
So with the right lens
and a simple cut out,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.317
you can make images like this.

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:35.854
The first and most important step
of this whole entire project

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:38.003
is making sure that you have
the right lens.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:43.324
This one is the EF 50mm 1:1.8.

00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:47.710
That 1.8 number, I think the lower
that is the better,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.819
so yeah.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.357
I'm not going to sit here
and pretend to really know
what I'm talking about,

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:54.781
so if you want more information
check the description.

00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.531
Next, I got some poster board,
and, with my lens cover,

00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:59.850
I stenciled out some circles
and, with a pen,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.301
began to draw out various designs
on to the very center.

00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:05.301
Here's the famous heart one,

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:07.626
which makes the pictures look like
that. That's pretty cool.

00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:09.732
And I made this one
that's a cat head.

00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:11.732
You know, people like cats.

00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:13.758
I cut them out
with my X-ACTO blade,
threw on my new lens,

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:15.965
and attached the filter
with a little tape.

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:18.271
I drove around the neighborhood
looking for lights and ended up

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:20.434
at the mall,
which had a ton of them.

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:22.520
All right, let's throw it on here.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.352
Oh yeah, check that [beep] out.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:28.232
It works.
How [beep] rad is that?

00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:30.350
All right, what other fun shapes
did I make here?

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.241
Yes, that is way better
than a heart.

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:36.411
This one definitely feels
a little bit more my speed.

00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:38.431
What else have we got here?

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.857
Oh, yeah, that looks nice.

00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:43.748
Super festive.

00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:45.847
Well, here we go.
Here's the cat one.

00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:48.307
That's cool.
Oh, that is cute.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.428
That is cute.

00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:52.511
I also hit my neighbor's.
I checked out their lights.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.670
I tried a couple other filters.
Oh yeah.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.151
That's the filter right there.
That's the one.

00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:02.209
So good.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.796
Let's see, what is this one
right here? Oh, come on.

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:08.186
Really? Really?

00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:11.565
That is just—
that's a lot of dicks.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.212
That is—
that's just too many dicks
right there.

00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:17.889
Who's going to hell?
This guy.

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.204
Happy [beep] holidays, everybody.
See you next week. [snipping sound]
