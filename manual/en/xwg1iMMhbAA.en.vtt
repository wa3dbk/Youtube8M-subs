00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
In this video, I'm going to show you how to fold

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.380
the number one, designed by Andrey Lukyanov.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.240
Diagrams are published in the e-book

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.780
"All Letters and Ciphers"

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.960
and Andrey also has a youtube channel

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.220
and a fantastic website: loveorigami.info

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.580
which includes diagrams for these numbers

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.420
and much more.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700
In this video, I'm going to use a square sheet of paper

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.360
with a side length of of 7 and a half cm or 3 inches,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.860
and the resulting model then has a height of

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.260
4.7 cm or 1 and 7/8 of an inch

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.520
and a width of 2.8 cm or 1 and 1/8 of an inch.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.360
So let's get started!

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.860
We first have to fold a square grid

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.460
with eight divisions on each side.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.220
I've got a detailed video on how to do this accurately,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.760
so I'm speeding through it here.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.320
Once you've folded your 8 by 8 grid,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.380
we're going to fold in one row on the bottom

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.080
and two rows in the top.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.240
And now, we're going to fold in one column right here

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.480
while opening the paper here,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.560
so that a diagonal crease is created

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.660
right from this point right here.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.320
So we're bringing this in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.120
and creasing from that point

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.520
to align this edge with the third crease line right here.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.240
And also flatten right here, adding a crease there.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.140
Now we're going to add a crease on this small square--

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.300
right here--

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.960
just by bringing the point to the intersection.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.680
Unfold.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.980
And then bring that paper inside.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.060
Like this.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.760
And flatten.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.600
Now you have a corner right here.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.880
You're going to fold that, and then just fold it behind

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.000
so that it's in there and it's hidden.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.200
Then we're going to fold behind two columns

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.580
Like this.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.620
And flip the model over.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.500
Now we're going to take that corner and fold it behind.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.820
And counting one, two columns,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.520
we're going to fold this forward.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.380
And then we're going to fold behind one row.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.440
Now you can take this layer

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.900
and tuck it inside there to lock the layers a bit better.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.540
And then your number one is all done.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.440
If you want to have this completely flat,

00:03:16.448 --> 00:03:19.820
simply put it between two heavy books overnight

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.960
or, if you're a bit impatient, you can also use an iron

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.820
on a very low heat setting.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.620
Just put the model between two sheets

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.140
and then go over it a couple of times.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.740
And then your Number One,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.640
designed by Andrey Lukyanov, is all done.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.280
