Hi I’m Scott for Expert Village and today
I’m going to teach you how to make Hershey’s

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.950
Royal Hot Chocolate. Here are some of the
ingredients that we need in order to make

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.010
this delicious treat; two pieces of Hershey’s
milk chocolate, a cup of boiling water, a

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.520
cup of milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.
Now that we have our ingredients we have to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.300
put our saucepan to a medium heat setting,
so that we don’t burn the chocolate when

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.750
we put it in. Now this recipe calls for melting
the chocolate first before adding any of the

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.170
other ingredients. So we’ll take our milk
chocolate now, and we’ll put it in the pan.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.479
Now that we have our chocolate in here and
it’s beginning to melt we can add our next

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:44.360
liquid ingredient, of course that would be
the whole cup of milk, and a tablespoon of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:54.249
vanilla.
Now what’s important to this is to make

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.640
sure that you use a wooden spoon, and to stir
your chocolate so it doesn’t begin to burn

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.920
on the bottom of the pan. Even though we’ve
got that low heat setting there’s always

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.840
that danger that the milk might also curdle
as well, so we have to make sure that we keep

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.950
it moving at all times. What’s great about
his recipe is that it’s pretty much finished;

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.950
only thing we have to do now is add some boiling
water. After you add the water, keep stirring

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.020
it till it seems like it’s mixed up pretty
well. Once that’s complete go ahead and

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.789
turn off the heat on your oven, and then it’s
done. You just need a cup to put it in. So

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.200
right now I have this glass right here, we’re
just going to take this finished product and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.560
we’re going to pour it into the glass. What
makes this Royal, is what’s left at the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.170
bottom of the pan. You’ll see that there’s
some giant chocolate chunks still here on

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.159
the bottom. Little kid’s love chocolate,
so just scrape those off into the bottom of

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.420
the cup with your spoon here and when they
get to the bottom of their cup it’s a royal

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.350
treat. All we need now to finish this off
is some good old-fashioned whipped cream.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.159
You’re going to shake it up, put it in the
center and there you go, those little kids

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.710
are going to be merry as field mice. And it’s
that simple to make Royal Hot Chocolate. For

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.439
Expert Village, I’m Scott.
