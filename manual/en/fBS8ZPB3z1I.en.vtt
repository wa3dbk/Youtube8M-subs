00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.310
大家好 欢迎来到EnjoyZ评测组球鞋简介
Hello.Welcome to EnjoyZ Review

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.970
我是小唐
I'm MR.Tang

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.270
出现在屏幕上的这双Morelia Neo
Here comes the Morelia Neo

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.740
作为美津浓Morelia的速度型分支
As the speed category of Mizuno

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.970
超轻量袋鼠皮球鞋这个称呼
So called 'Superlight Kangaroo'

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.640
显然瞬间吸引了无数目光
Appealing to lots of interests

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.430
它最早在2011年末上市
Having been released at the later of 2011

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.970
可是后来因为鞋钉设计上的缺陷
But according to the defect of studs design

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.460
导致它在人草上频频出现断钉事件
Leading to the frequency studs broken on AG

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.770
于是美津浓痛定思痛
Hence Mizuno recalls the lessons

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.930
在今年年初推出了改进版的二代鞋钉 就是它了
Revealed the redisigned second generation of studs

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.350
美津浓官方也自信的在官方网站声明它人草适用
Confidently,Mizuco declaimed that it should be well suited on AG

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.140
但评测组的建议呢是它适合质量中上乘的人草
But in our opinion,we suggest you wearing it on smug and superior AG

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.100
垃圾人草还是不行
Muddy AG?Damn it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.620
这个天蓝配色在刚刚曝光的时候
Since the early glimpse of this fresh blue colorway

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.520
曾获得评测组的成员一致的赞叹
We feld all in love with it

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.930
因为图片上的蓝色实在是太漂亮了
The fresh blue is so brilliant

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.100
但是拿到实物之后我们发现
But now that we get the real shoes

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.640
其实这个蓝色并没有宣传图上那么地鲜艳
The blue is not as shining as the images posed

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.390
而且不是很耐脏
Besides the shoes would be caught mud easily

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.220
不过那么漂亮的颜色 管他呢
But,it could be forgiven

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.720
既然是速度型战靴
As speed boots

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.890
那么重量就是很致命的环节
The weight is the whole we really concerned about

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.080
以JP 255的尺码为例 重量是165克
Take a look at the JP 255(EU 40),the weight is 165g

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.360
显然入选世界最轻足球鞋排行榜前十
Must be the Top 10 of lightest Soccer boots

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.140
可以说是毫无压力
Undoubtedly

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.580
在说鞋形之前先谈谈Morelia Neo的两个产地
We should talk about the two places of production first.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.310
一处是老家日本
The one is the basis of Mizuno,Japan

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.350
另一处则是东南亚的印尼
The other is southeastern Indonesia

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.560
我们都知道美津浓的鞋子
As we know

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.890
日产有分别专供本国的版本
Mizuno "Made in Japan" includes two versions

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.390
和供应国际市场的国际版两种
One for the inland and one for the interational market

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.600
就拿这双来说
Take these shoes

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.060
它的日产和印尼产均为国际版
The JP outputs and ID outputs are all international version

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.400
从鞋形上和专供日本市场的Estrela Neo一对比就可以看出
We can destinguish it from the JP only Estrela Neo on the outline

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.320
为了适应欧洲人的脚型
In order to adjust to the European size of foots

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.850
Morelia Neo的国际版显然比专供日本市场的Estrela Neo要窄
International Morelia Neo is thinner than the JP only version at the forefoot

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.020
但稍微比一般的欧美系品牌略宽一些
But a bit wider than the common Western brands

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.640
如果穿Estrela Neo正好的朋友在选购这双鞋的时候要注意了
Anyone who fits Estrela Neo well should be cautious while consider buying these

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.470
这双鞋秉承了美津浓的一贯作风
These shoes are typical Mizuno

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.810
特别是这个有收紧设计的鞋口
Especially for the tight designed shoe throat

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.120
我们在Estrela Neo的简介视频中有提到过
We have referred it in the review of Estrela Neo

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.020
制作这种鞋口需要制鞋工艺精湛的鞋匠才能完成
This kind of shoe throat must be completed by the top level artists

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.440
由此可见 美津浓确实是很认真地在对待他们出品的每一双球鞋
Mizuno is very into every shoes they made indeed

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.060
无论产地在哪里
No matter where it could be produced

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.810
Morelia Neo的鞋面采用的是前段袋鼠皮和后段人造材料的设计
Morelia Neo is combined by Kangaroo at the front and the rest of synthetical leather

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.350
前段的袋鼠皮从按压的感觉来看
According to the pressing feel of the forefoot

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.770
和我们之前测试的Estrela Neo一样并不是很柔软
It is not very soft same as the reviewed Estrela Neo

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.200
这种选材显然是为了平衡触感和发力
This construct should be made to balance the touch and converting power

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.860
按压时还可以感觉到Morelia Neo的袋鼠皮
You can feel it while pressing the forefoot

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.850
比Estrela Neo要厚一些
The forefoot material is thicker than Estrela Neo

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.600
这个对触感的影响其实并不大
That should be hard to effect on the touch

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.640
按照个人喜好判断即可
Take one as you like

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.020
后段的人造材料和Estrela Neo一样
The synthetic material is the same as Estrala Neo

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.810
这种设计的好处就是鞋口不容易变形 松垮
That kind of design assures the shoe throat should hardly be twisted or loosened

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.800
保持脚外侧支撑的同时
While keeping the outstep support

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.700
能够让球鞋更加包脚
It makes the shoes fit your feet better

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.270
所以大家再别迷信全袋鼠皮的鞋子了
So do not keep your stubborn in the Kangaroo boots

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.780
除非它在这个位置提供了内衬补强
Unless it could offer the same support with interlining

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.760
在这里要跟大家说明一下
We should emphasize here that

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.860
日产和印尼产的Morelia Neo使用的袋鼠皮
The Kangaroo used in JP and ID version Morelia Neo

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.700
触感上是同等质量的
Expressing same level of touch

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.700
不过日产会对皮面进行抛光处理
But the outside of JP version has special polishing treatment

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.800
所以看起来更加高端一些
So on glance it could be seen as high-end

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.100
而且日产的价格比印尼产贵了不少
Besides that the JP output is much more expensive than IN output

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.460
以这双为例
Take a look at these

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.280
淘宝日产的价格1400元左右
The JP output would cost you RMB 1400 on taobao.com

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.930
而且还没有天蓝色可以选择
In addition,you can not get a fresh blue one

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.140
印尼的呢才九百多
But the IN output is just a little less than RMB 1000

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.390
性价比来看
Considering the cost performance

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.470
印尼显然更有优势
Maybe IN output is better

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.800
Morelia Neo的大底使用了轻量化球鞋的标配
The soleplate of Morelia Neo inports the common design of Mizuno light boots

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.460
尼龙与TPU复合
Combined with nylon and TPU

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.470
大底大面积采用尼龙
The soleplate is mainly made from nylon

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.380
而鞋钉为了增加耐磨性和硬度则选用了TPU
While the studs are made from TPU for better fricktion tolerance and hardness

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.600
说到鞋钉 我们之前已经说过是使用了改进后的新一代设计
We have said that the studs have been redesigned

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.850
所以官方宣称可以在中等以上的人草使用
So that Mizuno declaims that it could well fits the beyond average quality AG

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.720
但是具体会不会断钉还有视个人踢球习惯而定
But,whether the studs could be broken agains remain to be judged by your style

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.080
所以各位也要考虑自身的膝盖安全
So,watch out for your knees

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.720
体重太大的我劝你还是放弃吧
For the fatass,screw it

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.680
不得不说 对于美津浓来说
In my opinion,speak about Mizuno

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.360
日本产与印尼产的差距之小令人佩服
The differences between JP out and IN output could be ignored,maybe

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.890
但仍然有一定的差距
But the gap is still there

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.360
鞋身有多处溢胶以以及线头
We have found lots of overflow and ripped thread

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.100
但是需要声明的是
But we could declare that

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.270
溢胶其实恰恰证明了胶水的量足但看起来不美观
The overflow proves Mizuno did not fake their work

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.310
很讽刺吧 今后我们会在EnjoyZ Lab中给大家普及
What a sarcasm,maybe we will talk about that in EnjoyZ Lab

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.680
既然它是轻量化球鞋
As light speed boots

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.020
那么可以减轻球鞋重量的半中底设计便是必不可少的了
The design of cutting half midfoot to reduce weigh is essential

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.890
至于加强梁的硬度我们在Estrela Neo的视频中有具体说明
As for the strengthen beam,we have specific reviewed it in Estrela Neo

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.770
这里就不作赘述了
Chaka Chaka

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.480
后跟和鞋口采用了防滑的麂皮材料
The heel and throat are made from skid-resistant suede

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.800
这可以让球鞋更加跟脚
That assures the shoes fit well

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.260
不过鞋垫依然是普通的发泡材料
But the insole pad is still polyurethane foam

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.810
让人很是无语啊
Suck it

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.640
再来看看鞋带
Then we take a look at the laces

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.640
前细后粗的鞋带已经成为市场主流
Slim front and wide end laces are the common choice nowadays

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.540
但美津浓依然没有在鞋带上面做出什么改进
So that Mizuno improves no more than that

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.020
所以如果有意入手的朋友担心鞋带会松动的话
If you consern about the loosen laces

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.800
我们还是推荐你换上EnjoyZ  Lab自主研发的
I suggest you buying a pair of EnjoyZ Lab homemade

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.310
Control+魔控鞋带
VEZi Control+ laces

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.970
那叫一个好评如潮哇
That is amazing one

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.560
总结一下
In conclusion

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.890
虽然Morelia Neo的印尼产离日产在做工上还有一定差距
Although ID output Morelia NEO could not match the JP output in making

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.970
但是这差距仅仅在少数细节上
But the differences are ignorable,just some details

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.060
并不影响实战中的表现
That would not make much defference in court

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.270
价格上与日产便宜得不是一点半点
The ID output Neo is far more cheap

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.520
如果合适的话
Appropriately

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.890
这款球鞋我们推荐入手
We would recommend it

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.760
好了 关于这款球鞋的介绍就是这么多了
So,that is all about the Morelia Neo

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.280
这里是EnjoyZ.com
