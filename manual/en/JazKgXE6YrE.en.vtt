00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.500
This is Gracie's first vintage - I got Rappin'
Rockin' Barbie. Rappin' Rockin' Barbie. Saw

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:18.200
her on eBay, she real rap - she has a real
rap beat boom box. Wow. What year is from?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.670
Let's see if it has a year on it. Gracie
said she's so old, how old is she? She's so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.060
old, this is before Kajinkers were invented.
Wow, 1991. Whoa. I was thinking like the '80s.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:39.200
It was almost the '80s. 1991, I had just graduated
from college and was working my first job,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.820
and we could also get Rappin' Rockin' Teresa,
you know, if we could find her. Ken, with

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.460
the hat on...

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.120
[laughing]

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.280
This is Barbie, and this is Christine. I guess
we don't make Christine anymore. And I love

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.860
this because Barbie's got the, they've all
got the scrunchy socks like we used to wear.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:15.670
Look at Ken, with the bling bling decklace!
Oh my God. Oh, wow. Oh. That is just... crazy.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.899
This is a live doll review right here. Oh
my - it is, it's like a total live doll review.

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:29.759
Totally unplanned doll review, but I just,
I can't believe how like epic she is. So how

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.990
does she - oh! She's got the crimped hair.
That's why you liked her, right, because of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:44.119
the crimped hair? Yeah. Wow. Oh my God, look,
it says, it says on the box "yo!" - Yo, what

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:54.959
up! Barbie's got a ring, ooh. Rappin' Rockin'
Barbie says "Yo, what up, y'all." Wow. Oh

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.779
wait, does the boom box still work? It looks
like it needs new batteries. Oh, it probably

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:04.299
needs new batteries, cause it hasn't, it has
a "press here" thing. So we'll have to find

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.880
out what kind of batteries Rappin' Rockin'
Barbie's boom box needs. That's epic. Put

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.460
all her gorgeous accessories on her. Her hair's
pretty cool actually. Look, her earrings actually

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.460
dangle. Oh my gosh, let me, move your finger
for a second so I can show everybody. Oh my

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.470
gosh, those earrings are enormous! Says the
woman who used to wear earrings that big in

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.459
1991. Wow. What do you think? She's fab. Yeah?
Turn her around. I'm gonna go get a modern

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.879
day Barbie so they can meet each other. Okay.
Let me just give everybody a, here you go,

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:45.650
a totally impromptu doll review of - Now this
hair might look a little excessive to you,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:54.150
so I'm gonna insert a picture of Mommy in
1991. Because this is what our hair looked

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.150
like. Even though her waist was like abnormally
small, at least the rest of her was proportionate.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.340
There's her bling bling necklace. Look at
the bling bling. I love this leather -- The

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.420
evolution of Barbie. The evolution of Barbie.
There we go. It's just her face is really

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:20.660
changed. Really. Rappin' Rockin' Barbie meets
Safari Barbie. I got her at Rainforest Cafe

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.640
actually. I got her in a two pack with Skipper.
Yeah, she's really cute. Cause apparently

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.120
they sell Barbies in the Rainforest Cafe now,
the Safari ones. Apparently, yeah, they have

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.900
the Safari Barbies at Rainforest Cafe. I love
her outfit, and she's got this cool ring...

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.129
It has like the, illuminati! Wait, does it
not have screws, can you just slide that open

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.249
and get to the battery compartment? Ha! Look
at these old Energizer batteries. Look at

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:52.840
these old Energizer batteries. Alright, let's
get some new batteries, and so we can hear

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.980
the boom box for Rappin' Rockin' Barbie. I'm
so excited! Why don't you get her cool shoes

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.670
and socks on while I get new batteries.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.790
So Rappin' Rockin' Barbie is now dressed,
we got her -- Wait, make sure you're filming.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:11.249
I am filming. And now we've got her really
cool scrunch socks. We've got modern day Safari

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:17.239
Barbie. Okay, can you, can you, okay. And
now we've put batteries in the boom box, so

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.150
we can rap and rock with Rappin' Rockin' Barbie.
Are you ready?

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.520
[music plays]

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.960
Uh huh, dance party up in here!

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.960
So you have to hold the button to make it
do the beat? Wow. Wonder if we're gonna get

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.460
Content ID for these sick beats.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.140
Sick beats!

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.360
I don't think they own the rights to this
music anymore.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.910
This music is so fly!

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.410
I don't even think they can Content ID us
for this cause I don't think they own the

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.240
rights to this song anymore!

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.700
Check me out, I am too legit to quit, uh huh!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! You wanna go watch In Living

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:12.460
Colors, Safari Barbie? What? C'mon! Let's
go jam to more, to more, uh, boom boxing!

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.780
Uh nope. Check out my - like, can you believe
the sound you get out of this little radio?

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.930
That is like the size of my entire body? One
of your shoes fell off. Oh, that's cause I

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.520
was just, was just jammin'!

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.220
Okay, Ma Nikki's here, because Ma Nikki was...
alive. Were you alive in 1991, Ma Nikki? Oh

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.440
yes I was! Yeah, does this sound familiar?

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.560
[music plays]

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.260
Do you miss those beats?

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.900
Dance party! Dance party!

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.880
[laughter]

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.440
Boom box. Oh yeah. I don't think we're gonna
get Content ID because I don't think they

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.080
own the rights to this song anymore. No, I
don't think this song ever really existed

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.680
as a tune, and... I can't believe that's all
it does!

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.420
What do ya think, Ma Nikki?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.560
Awesome!

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.270
What do ya think, Barbie?

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.330
Sick!

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.650
Sick? I don't think they said sick back then.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.830
I think I'm sick.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.060
[laughter]

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.650
So that, that is uh, Barbie, Rappin' Rockin'
Barbie from 1991. Gracie's first - and I'm

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.460
going with vintage, not retro on this, because
1991 was a whole long time ago. No, you gotta

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.940
leave on her fly hat, with her fly earrings.
Swag.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:43.640
She's so swag. She's so swag, I love it! You're
so swag, Barbie. Okay, thank you everybody

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.040
for watching this impromptu --

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.910
[music plays]

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.910
Uh huh. Barbie doll review. Uh huh.
