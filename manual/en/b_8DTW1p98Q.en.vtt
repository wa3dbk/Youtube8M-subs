00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:22.053
The Cayman has spent its life in the 911's shadow.

00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:28.099
But the GT4 shows its true mid-engine potential.

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:35.812
It carries GT3 parts and a Carrera S engine. Fun times!

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:57.939
How does the GT4 differ? The chassis has GT3 components.

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:10.770
It's wider and 30 mm lower. And it has 45 PS over the Cayman GTS.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.035
That has turned the Cayman into a really sharp sports car.

00:01:21.236 --> 00:01:30.631
You noticed that without going fast. There's so much going on.

00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:40.080
It only has a short-throw manual 'box. Very extreme.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.969
These ultra-low seats are from the 918 Spyder.

00:01:50.493 --> 00:02:01.869
And dynamic engine mounts. It all unites you with the car. 

00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:07.005
When you're on the road, you notice its harshness.

00:02:10.857 --> 00:02:19.198
Even on Normal setting. They did 7:40 on the NÃ¼rburgring with that.

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:29.458
Hard is only fit for really even circuits, like here on Portimao.

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:41.420
Let's put on the sports exhaust. There's also an auto-blip.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.036
Let's set the damping to hard as well. Let's party.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:02:53.211
7800 RPM - just like a Carrera S!

00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.843
The nose hugs the inside of corners.

00:03:00.843 --> 00:03:14.657
Less power than a Carrera S because of a different configuration.

00:03:14.657 --> 00:03:19.984
But as a mid-engined car, its so well-balanced.

00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:32.764
It's so very responsive. Always. Unlike a 911!

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:56.646
The Cayman finally has the power it needs. 385 PS.

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:58.901
It weighs just 1300 kilos after all.

00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:10.607
The Cayman R and GTS do lack power, not this one.

00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:14.209
Oooh, what a car.

00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:25.343
It's a car to throw around without getting unmanageable.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.871
Listen to the blips! Proper drivers can do that themselves.

00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:38.466
This system helps doing that. Right at the entry.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:45.297
Not when the nose gets light, what an MR car tends to do.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:55.994
It's so pure. No PDK. Just a manual. Great!

00:04:59.928 --> 00:05:05.022
The GT4 takes the Cayman to another level.

00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:13.578
What gets close? A Lotus Evora 400? I doubt it.

00:05:13.578 --> 00:05:23.752
Really, this is the best car to drive in 2015. For sure.
