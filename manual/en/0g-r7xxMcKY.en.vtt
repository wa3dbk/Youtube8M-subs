00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.790
This is a male magnificent riflebird.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.040
He’s got this incredibly clear, powerful
whistle that just carries great distances

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.510
through the dense lowland forest where he
lives.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.239
And here’s a male black sicklebill.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.920
He also makes an incredibly powerful sound
from his courtship display territory.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.060
In both cases the males are using these calls
to advertise to females a great distance that

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.410
this is their courtship display area.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.040
But they’re also announcing their presence
to other males who have territories nearby.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.100
And clearly, as you can see, both of these
sounds are vocal, meaning that they are created

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.980
with the same vocal apparatus that all birds
use to produce sound – their bill, their

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.620
trachea, their syrinx.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.780
Another thing these two species have in common
is that they both produce nonvocal sounds,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.720
that is they make sounds with parts of their
body that we don’t typically associate with

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.930
sound production.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.280
Let’s check out how they do it.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.180
This is the male black sicklebill again.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.960
His nonvocal sound is a knocking, it sounds
like a distant machine gun.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.409
From this view you can tell he’s not making
that sound with his mouth.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.490
His bill is closed.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.080
But it’s a little bit hard to tell where
it’s coming from and what’s going on.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.910
Fortunately on this day we had two cameras
recording at the same time.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.920
What you can see from this other camera is
that as he does this display and he comes

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.959
upright, he actually opens his wings across
his back.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.790
It’s a little hard to see what’s going
on there, but those are his wings and those

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.069
primary feathers are spread across the back
and as he lunges forward he closes those wings

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.190
across his back and somewhere there either
between the feathers rubbing against themselves

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.650
or perhaps against the base of the tail, that’s
where he’s creating that nonvocal sound.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.090
So now we’re looking at the male magnificent
riflebird.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.320
He makes his nonvocal sound in courtship display
somewhat like the black sicklebill, but he

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.960
does it in a very different way.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.440
As you can see, he’s opening his wings up
and he’s moving his head from side to side.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.060
And when he’s doing that he’s moving his
wings.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.099
That sound that you hear is being produced
by the opening and closing of the wings.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.539
It sounds like a pronounced rustling.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.100
Another really cool aspect of this nonvocal
sound is how directional it seems to be.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.220
Notice when he turns around the sound gets
louder.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.200
And that’s because he’s directing that
sound towards the female, and in this case

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.360
it also happens to be directed towards our
microphone, so it’s picking up the sound

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.460
as well.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.180
Although there’s never been any good research
on this, it’s possible that the shape of

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.330
his wings would have something to do with
projecting that sound in the direction of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.120
where the female is; almost like it’s an
amplifier or like a megaphone.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.120
What’s cool is, is when we think back to
the black sicklebill, he also seems to have

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.470
this curved kind of megaphone aspect to his
courtship display.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.550
And we know that the female, just like on
the magnificent riflebird, she also sits right

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.009
in front of the male when he makes his knocking
sound.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.360
So it’s possible that both of these species
have this directional element, directing that

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:40.360
nonvocal sound right where they want it to
be, where the female is when she’s watching

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.760
their courtship displays.

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.429
Clearly both these species have extraordinary
vocal sounds.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.260
But it’s these nonvocal sounds that they
make in their displays that really sets them

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.090
apart from other birds-of-paradise.
