00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.660
My name is Pinkie Pie (Hello!)
And I am here to say (How ya doin'?)

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.670
I'm gonna make you smile and I will brighten
up your day-aaay!

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.420
It doesn't matter now (What's up?)
If you are sad or blue (Howdy!)

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.380
'Cause cheering up my friends is just what
Pinkie's here to do

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.340
'Cause I love to make you smile, smile, smile
Yes I do!

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.379
It fills my heart with sunshine all the while
Yes it does!

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.320
'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile,
smile

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.379
From these happy friends of mine!

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.420
I like to see you grin (Awesome!)
I would love to see you beam (Rock on!)

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.430
The corners of your mouth turned up
Is always Pinkie's dream (Hoof-bump!)

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.280
But if you're kind of worried
And your face has made a frown

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.280
I'll work real hard and do my best
To turn that sad frown upside down

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.040
'Cause I love to make you grin, grin, grin
Yes I do!

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.100
Bust it out from ear to ear, let it begin
Just give me a joyful grin, grin, grin

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.500
And you fill me with good cheer

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.510
It's true, some days are dark and lonely
And maybe you feel sad

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.950
But Pinkie will be there to show you that
it isn't that bad

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.650
There's one thing that makes me happy
And makes my whole life worthwhile

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.650
And that's when I talk to my friends and get
them to smile

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.700
I really am so happy
Your smile fills me with glee

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.110
I give a smile, I get a smile
And that's so special to me

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.329
'Cause I love to see you beam, beam, beam
Yes I do!

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:26.019
Tell me what more can I say to make you see
That I do!

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.019
It makes me happy when you beam, beam, beam
Yes, it always makes my day!

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.549
