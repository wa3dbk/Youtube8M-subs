00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
(intro music)

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.180
(Rage Quit theme)

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.700
This week on Rage Quit, I'm playing Massive Cleavage vs Zombies.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.820
I'm so scared right now

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.160
Of the massive cleavage

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.780
Level One: The fridge

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.620
Oh My God

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.800
Oh My God!

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:38.080
(Michael screams)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.760
Holy Shit that was close

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.400
I almost got cleaved!

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.660
That's my low attack

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.980
Alright

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.860
(in woman voice) What-- How did i do that? What did i do?

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.480
(Normal voice) Take that kid. Take that kid. I just killed the twins

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.960
She's got some swagger in her step, look at that

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.620
Bustas ain't gonna do shit

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.160
'Cause you get cleaved! In the dick!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.560
(singing) eight five two zero zero nine

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.960
(singing) eight five two zero zero nine

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.140
(Normal voice) It's a town full of one armed kids

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.460
They're everywhere

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.960
Look at all the dead kids

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080
Is there something in the sky that I should be looking at-- nope nevermind

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.580
OK

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.560
And thats a-- ughh

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.000
Oh Shit!

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.460
OH YEAH! HYDRAULICS!

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.680
OH! FUCKING CHEETAH!

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.800
DOG! WHAT WAS THAT!

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.400
I CUT HIS HEAD OFF!

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.660
FIDO NO!

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.160
Oh my god, I just obliterated that dog. He's not even- he's gone

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.980
His body disappeared

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080
Golden Retriever right?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.320
BYAAA! Why don't you retrieve your fucking head?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.900
(Woman Voice) You in there?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.880
Are you in here?

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.980
Are you down there?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.180
Are you over here?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.280
Are you in here?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.540
Is that you over there?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.140
(Normal Voice) Man thank god they got the uhh sneeze guard on this food

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.240
Because you are not gonna want to eat it after this

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.040
Unless its a Chinese restaurant

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.820
Then you're fucking set

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.400
I wanted massive cleavage, not dead dogs!

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.400
(Woman voice) I don't know, I'll check it out

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.880
You stay back here

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.400
You big strong man

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.700
I'll Investigate

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.220
WITH MY MASSIVE CLEAVAGE! CHOP!

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.840
(Normal Voice) I'll kill you in the streets

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.220
I'll kill you at the buffet

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.560
I'll kill you in an alley!

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.320
You come at me, you're dead!

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.180
You hear me?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.320
You're dead!

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.500
Again!

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.300
'Cause you're already dead

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.720
You're double dead!

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.840
A zombie outbreak ever occurs, you know what to do, get the cleavage

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.140
And then get the meat cleaver

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.600
Big tits and a big knife

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.040
That's how we're gonna solve this zombie outbreak situation

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.820
Is this it? Is this like...

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.440
There's nothing else?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.140
I don't get to drive a car on the beach?

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.300
Or go swimming under water or anything like that?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.800
I'm just...

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.600
Killin...

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.060
This woman

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.080
This kid

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.940
This dude with no skin

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.920
That guy

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.220
This guy

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.320
And that corpse

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.500
For the entire time

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.340
No that's literally every single character skin

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480
What am I doin?

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.160
Oh, pro tip: don't pause the game.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.380
76% of players who pause the game die soon after un-pausing.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.620
Well guess what bitch

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.340
I ain't joining the statistic

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.020
24% MOTHERFUCKER!

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.280
Hey Kids! It's past your bedtimes!

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.540
IN HELL!

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.040
We get it ok? I can chop!

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.960
I'm good!

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.440
Dog's dead, the guy's dead, the chick's dead, the kid's dead

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.100
The chick's dead, the thing's dead

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.100
Give me something else to do!

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.960
Can I go bang one of the survivors?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.160
Turn that into a minigame

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.000
I'm mashing buttons all over the place

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.480
Like God of War

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.820
It's games like this with ultra-realistic graphics

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.340
That make me so desensitized to violence in the real world

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.680
It's a problem

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.860
CHAAAA!

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.600
Oh shit

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.880
Now we're in an alley with some dogs

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.740
This is Lightning round

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.460
LIGHTNING ROUND!

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.000
You think this chick volunteers on the weekends at the animal shelter?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.980
You think she doesn't

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.580
There is barely any road left under all of these dead dogs

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.520
HOW MANY ARE THERE?!

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.280
Oh my god, fucking finally

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.100
I think, yep

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.960
And it's the SAME SHIT!

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.780
WHAT THE FUCK?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.780
Can I just walk off this comic strip?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.400
Can I get the fuck outta here?

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.960
Please someone, just make it end

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.620
I don't want to do 38 levels of this shit!

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.320
(singing) It just goes on and on my friends

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.900
This is the horde that never ends

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.980
You just keep, killing bitches left and right

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.940
They never stop

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.160
They're gonna fucking get you then

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.440
Your tits are gonna pop!

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.900
This the horde that never ends...

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.360
Let the city streets, run red with your blood!

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.120
The blood of children and women and businessmen alike!

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.320
Man I wish I could die

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.260
Holy Shit

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.900
I wish it was possible for this fucking nightmare to end

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.700
At some point

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.000
But it just...

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.220
It doesn't seem likely

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.740
It's just too fucking easy

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.880
That's the nightmare of this game

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.100
It's so easy that you just keep fucking playing it

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.160
For no reason!

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.400
Can we get a street sweeper over here?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.740
Or somethin'

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.200
'Cause people are not gonna be able to park

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.860
For a while

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.520
Ok

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.920
And GODDAMN IT!

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.360
I keep expecting something

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.340
I don't know why

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.300
Everytime I'm surprised, I expect some sort of fucking change!

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.540
AH!

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.420
FUCK!

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.700
GOD DAMN IT!

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.820
I actually wanted to fucking beat that shit!

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.100
FUCKING LEVEL 14? I'm not even halfway there!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.620
Who made this piece of shit?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.180
Alright

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.340
That answers that question

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.160
Oh and now-- I'm-- I'm at the fucking

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.160
The old farm

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.960
The old abandoned shithole

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.380
Man I miss those cutsences

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.860
I thought they sucked at the time but

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.260
Easily the best part of this entire game

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.540
'Cause uh the entire other part of the game is this

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.340
It's left, right and the fucking X button

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.220
And the Y button

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.160
I hope this guy is not protective of his lawn

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.660
You know as people like to ball rolls on their lawn

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.840
And they run out and they grab it?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.680
This guy would be pissed

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.680
Get those 57 dead dogs off my lawn!

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.860
You crazy kids!

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.360
So I'm at half health here

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.160
If i can die

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.040
Ahh. That would be swell

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.900
Oh. Oh my god it happened

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.460
Oh I'm fucking dead

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.820
Jesus Christ!

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.800
I wasn't even halfway through the game!

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.260
Fucking 16 Levels of that fucking shit

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.200
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.400
Fuck You...

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.340
Craig Page! You son of a bitch!

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:39.400
