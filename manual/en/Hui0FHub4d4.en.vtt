00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.810
Propecia or Finasteride is a very good medication
for men, only men, who are suffering from

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.140
hair loss.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.710
What it does is it blocks the DHT, which is
the bad actor.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.929
It's the conversion of testosterone to DHT,
and that DHT causes your hair to fall out.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:28.199
So with taking Propecia once a day, we can
often stop this process and reverse sometimes

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.740
the miniaturization, or the small wimpy hairs
that you get, and turn those hairs around

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.020
into thicker, fuller hairs.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.640
However, some of the down sides of this medication
are that it does have some side effects.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.010
It normally affects no more than two percent
of the population and often those are sexual

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.010
in nature.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.320
It can decrease your sex drive or it can give
you some breast tenderness sometimes for men.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.199
However, the majority of the time the side
effects go away with continued use, or if

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.570
you stop the medicine, they'll go away anyway.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.910
It is a good medication to use.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.090
However, I'd like to caution people.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.250
Propecia is a one milligram tablet.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.330
That's what the studies were done with and
that's how it was FDA approved.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.490
That's the ideal dose to give the maximum
effect for the pill, however, to minimize

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.220
the side effects.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.860
Some patients try to take the Finasteride
five milligrams, which is in it's pure form

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.550
is called Proscar, which was designed for
prostate enlargement, to treat prostate enlargement,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.060
and they break it up into quarters thinking
that they'll get 1.25 milligrams of active

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.360
ingredient in each tablet.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.270
However, unless a pill is scored, which means
it has a line in it, it really can't be divided.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.060
Because if you divide it, the medication or
active ingredient is not evenly distributed

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.100
in the tablet.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.910
And it's effective by keeping those levels
of one milligram every single day.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.549
So if you take a five milligram tablet and
cut it into fourths, it's conceivable that

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.080
you get 1.25 milligrams one day, 3.5 milligrams
another, and zero the next two days.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.890
So you really can't do that if you want to
be effective with this medication.
