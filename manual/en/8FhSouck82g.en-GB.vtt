00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.830
If you're riding the Etape du Tour this year,
then you've come to the right place. Here

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.730
are our tips for preparing for and riding
this great event.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.730
In cycling, it pays to be prepared, so have
a good look at the route of the Étape in

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.140
advance. You tailor your approach in training
when you know what's in store, and if you

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.839
know the route, you won't get caught out.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.120
One of the first things you should have considered
when you looked at the route for this year's

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.840
Étape is your gearing. We don't doubt that
you've ridden over similar gradients to the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.120
Tourmalet and Hautacam before, but of course
your local climbs aren't going to be anywhere

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.230
near as long. As a guide, your front inner
chainring should be about a 34 tooth, and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.260
your rear cassette should span from 12 teeth
up to at least 28. If you're in any doubt,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.330
you should keep your gears on the low side.
It's better to have one or two left in reserve

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.660
that you don't use rather than potentially
having to come to a complete stop on one of the climbs.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.830
 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.370
While our mental images of the Tour de France
might be of riders baking under beautiful

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.440
July temperatures, the reality is that in
the Pyrénées, even in the middle of summer,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.470
conditions can vary wildly. However, with
the right clothing, you should be able to

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.180
cope with almost anything. When it comes to
packing your kit bag, along with the standard

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.720
jersey, shorts, mitts and socks, you should
pack some stuff for inclement weather conditions.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.000
By that, I mean things like arm and leg warmers,
a gilet should always be packed, along with

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.600
a thicker rain jacket if it does get really
bad. You can also think about things like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.190
long-fingered gloves and something to wear
under your helmet, like a casquette or perhaps

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.670
a skull cap. If it all ends up just sitting
at the bottom of your kit bag unused, then

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.520
all the better. However if you do have to
use it, it could be the difference between

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.750
finishing and pulling out.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.380
Check weather forecasts before you ride. You
can gain a further advantage on the day by

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.270
looking at a detailed weather forecast and
making the necessary adjustments to your clothing to suit.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.940
 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.229
Decide on your nutrition strategy well before
the day of the event, and get used to any

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.219
energy products - bars, gels or drinks. A
lot of people forget that an event this long

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.959
can be just as hard on your stomach as it
is on the rest of your body. An upset stomach

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.599
can really mess up your day...and your chamois.

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.670
Many mechanical issues, even punctures to
an extent, can be avoided if you make sure

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.200
everything on your bike is in good condition.
Pay particular attention to the condition

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.959
of your tyres and brake blocks up here, and
also your chain, cassette and chainrings down

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.829
here. A mechanical issue can potentially ruin
your day completely, so do everything you

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.999
can to avoid it happening.

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:47.560
And if you want one final expert tip: make
sure you start your event with a spotlessly

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.829
clean bike. If you've ever wondered how the
pros go just that fast, well it's just because

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.019
they start with a clean bike. OK, it might
not JUST be that, but it will give you a boost

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.230
in morale to look down at a spotless bike,
and it will be that last step towards making

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.010
sure everything is running smoothly.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.129
It can be a daunting task, approaching 148
mountainous kilometres in the Pyrénées,

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.370
but a great tip is to split the route down
in your head into more manageable chunks,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.090
focussing only on the immediate task in hand.
On the last climb, for example, focus on just

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.289
one hairpin at a time, and then the kilometres
will tick by before you know it.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.689
When your start time finally rolls around,
it's so easy to get carried away with the

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.219
occasion and set off far too hard. But you
risk putting your whole day in jeopardy by

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:42.449
doing this. It takes quite a lot of willpower,
but be really strict with yourself and keep

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:47.099
your enthusiasm in check. If you struggle
with this, you could try wearing a heart rate

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.960
monitor and keep an eye on that, staying well
away from your max heart rate in those first few hours.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.680
 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.799
Even if you keep things to a minimum so as
not to weigh yourself down, there are still

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.269
plenty of things that you'll need to remember
to take with you on the Étape itself. You'll

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.939
want to put some kind of saddlebag on the
bike, and this will include our essential

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.439
tools and spares.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.019
You should always take some kind of waterproof
jacket with you. These days they get very

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.949
lightweight and they can be wrapped up very
small, and also if you don't have your pump

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.479
attached to your bike it's a good opportunity
to wrap it inside the jacket. That way it

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.060
won't dig into your back, and it'll fit snugly
into the central pocket. What you put in which

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.860
pocket depends very much on which arm you're
comfortable taking off the bars while you're

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.940
riding. For me, that's my right hand, so I
tend to put any bars, gels or any other nutrition

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.409
into my right pocket so I find it easy to
access. That leaves the left pocket, which,

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.610
for me, is where I put my mobile phone plus
some sort of identification, along with some

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.830
cash just in case you need it.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.750
It's worth taking over essential tools and
spares, just in case things go wrong beforehand.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.389
So firstly I'm thinking things like a pump.
Also think about things like pedal spanners,

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.300
lubrication, and then get on to spare parts,
things that might be hard to come by if things

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.689
go wrong at the last minute.

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.720
Riding in a group is a lot more efficient
than riding on your own, particularly on flatter

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.009
roads, which is of course what we'll find
at the start of this year's Étape route.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.000
Any energy that you can save here will pay
you back in dividends when it comes to the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.680
final climb of the Hautacam. Whenever possible,
shelter behind other riders in a group, although

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.629
if you're feeling strong enough, don't forget
to pull your weight and do the occasional

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:28.580
turn on the front.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.479
And even when the road turns skywards, you
might not be slipstreaming so much, but you

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.169
can use the riders around you to spur you
on and motivate you. If you're not used to

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.889
riding in a group, try to find the opportunity
to practice before the Étape, either by riding

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.089
with your local cycling club or entering a
sportive as training.

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:52.669
Don't push yourself beyond what you feel is
comfortable. Take it steady and concentrate

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.479
on being as smooth as possible - it's an opportunity
to recover after all.

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.569
Don't ride too close to riders around you.
Give yourself room to allow other riders to

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.419
make mistakes.

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.650
Finally, it's not just the other riders that
you need to look out for. The local sheep

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.509
have a habit of occasionally wandering onto
the road, so cover your brakes at all times.

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.919
Try not to get yourself too worked up or nervous
about the task in hand, you can only ever

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.189
do your best. But remember to soak up the
occasion. Crossing the finish line at the

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.069
Étape du Tour is rewarding and an accomplishment
no matter what level of cyclist you are, so

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.159
make the most of it and soak it all in.
