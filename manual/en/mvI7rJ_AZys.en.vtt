00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.663
Hi! I'm one of the 
developers...

00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:07.357
behind the Apertus - Open 
Source Cinema project.

00:00:07.386 --> 00:00:09.516
In these few videoclips, 
I want to give you...

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:12.969
a brief introduction of the most 
important aspects of the project.

00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:17.885
First, what does Open Source Cinema on 
Free Software/Open Hardware really mean.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.243
Before the Digital Cinema revolution 
in the last couple of years...

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.294
with the RED or cameras from 
Arri and other companies...

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:29.144
Directors of Photography had a clear 
vision of what was going on...

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.091
inside their 
cinema camera.

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:33.459
They had film and 
mechanical parts...

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:37.304
and they knew how to manipulate 
parts of the camera...

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:39.591
to achieve their 
creative look...

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:42.086
and what they wanted 
to have on film.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.520
With the introduction 
of digital cameras...

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.600
that has changed 
drastically.

00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:50.400
The camera turned 
basically into black box...

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.320
that had a few buttons and 
ways to influence the image.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.395
In reality, the DOP had no idea of 
what is going on inside the camera.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.088
With Apertus, we want to do 
things completely different.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.400
We encourage Open Hardware development 
as well as Free Software.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.748
We want to create 
a tool, a camera...

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:07.772
that we, as filmmakers, 
love to use.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.746
With Free Software, the 
entire source code...

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:11.178
is published on 
the Internet.

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:12.925
It is freely available 
to anyone.

00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:15.798
Even though not everyone in the 
project is a software developer...

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.803
any one benefits from the work 
done by all contributors...

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:20.651
forming a community.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:22.775
Now, let's take a 
look at the camera.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.032
The core component is 
manufactured by Elphel Inc.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.915
This is the main hardware 
they produce.

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:32.277
The key components 
here are...

00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:33.888
the lens...

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:35.478
the lens mount...

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:38.262
It's a C-Mount with 
a CS adapter ring.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:43.769
On the back of the camera, 
we have a SATA port.

00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:45.591
This particular model 
also has...

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.302
 a built-in hard drive 
in the enclosure...

00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:49.163
but this is optional.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:50.496
Ethernet...

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.232
USB 1.0...

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:54.421
And on the side 
of this model...

00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:56.866
we have an additional 
sync port...

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.841
And a serial console 
interface.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:03.568
The three main components 
inside the camera are...

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.514
the sensor front-end, where 
the lens is mounted...

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.984
it hosts the 
image sensor.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:11.314
The image sensor 
is connected...

00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:13.755
to the second PCB 
inside this camera...

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.195
which holds the other two 
main components.

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.596
The first one is the 
so-called FPGA.

00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:21.417
It does the image processing 
at high speeds.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.442
Then the third component 
is an embedded CPU...

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.277
with Linux Operating 
System running on it.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.499
It deals with interfaces and 
outside communication.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.706
Apertus now builds everything 
around this core camera...

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.107
to turn it into a full-featured 
Digital Cinema camera.

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:38.221
For example, we connect 
the hard drive...

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:39.441
it can also be an SSD...

00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:41.678
directly to the camera
SATA port.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.178
We have a 
battery pack...

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.609
that powers both the
camera and the hard drive.

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.403
And over Ethernet, we have 
a viewfinder computer...

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.993
which can be any Desktop, 
Laptop or, in this case...

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.159
a Netbook with 
touchscreen interface.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.003
It runs our custom 
Viewfinder software...

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.450
which can be used to control all 
camera parameters in real-time...

00:02:59.475 --> 00:03:02.475
as well as view real-time 
video feed from the camera.

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:04.839
In the future, we also 
want to support...

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.349
an Android version, which can 
run on your favorite tablet.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.560
This is the Apertus Viewfinder 
software we developed.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.097
I want to give you a quick run 
down of the main features...

00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:18.043
and show you 
some dialogs.

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:20.733
In the middle of the 
main dialog we use...

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.258
we have live video feed 
from the camera.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.931
It's real-time.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.157
We have an information 
area on top...

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.753
that shows us the resolution 
we're recording...

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:32.381
the frame rate, 
white balance...

00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:33.740
compression ratio...

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:36.168
how much free space our 
hard drive still has...

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:38.455
and the status 
of the camera.

00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:41.269
Currently, at stand-by, 
not recording.

00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:43.633
On the left side...

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:48.040
we can alter the settings marked 
on the lower bottom side.

00:03:48.387 --> 00:03:52.027
For example, I can now 
alter the electronic shutter.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.296
I'm increasing 
the shutter time.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:57.742
The image 
gets darker.

00:03:57.864 --> 00:04:01.894
I can increase the 
gain to 6 dB...

00:04:01.977 --> 00:04:03.485
and it will be 
bright again.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.886
Also introducing more 
noise, of course.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.241
Down here, we have 
a live histogram.

00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:12.701
The Playback button can be 
used to view video files...

00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:14.815
that are already 
on the hard drive.

00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:18.364
Here I can record a still image 
or start a recording.

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:21.346
On the right side, we have 
the so-called 'quick menu'...

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:24.083
for features that are 
hidden in the menu.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.885
For example, I can scale the 
video in the middle here...

00:04:27.944 --> 00:04:29.721
for advanced 
focus pulling.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.707
 I can zoom to one-to-one 
pixel mapping...

00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:35.565
or to the image fitting into 
the screen size here.

00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:37.889
I have a datarate 
indicator...

00:04:37.995 --> 00:04:40.147
and you can switch 
color modes...

00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:42.636
to RAW-mode, which 
I'll explain later.

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.231
And for stereo 3D 
rigs, we can also...

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.001
switch between 
left and right eye.

00:04:48.282 --> 00:04:50.948
Now, let's take a look 
at the main menu.

00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:53.370
We can select 
resolution...

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:54.854
appropriate frame rate...

00:04:54.978 --> 00:04:56.993
Both have the 'Custom' 
button as well...

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:59.395
where we can set 
advanced features...

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:02.875
like mirroring the image 
or shooting rotated...

00:05:02.924 --> 00:05:04.160
in portrait-mode.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.558
We can type any custom 
resolution we want...

00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:09.089
with this touchpad here.

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.162
On the second 
settings dialog...

00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:14.058
we can adjust Gamma 
and Black level.

00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:16.877
we also have a 
real-time video here.

00:05:17.574 --> 00:05:20.223
There's a bunch of stuff 
that's not implemented yet.

00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:22.067
This is just a place-holder 
for now.

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.704
Now shooting in color 
mode is, of course...

00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:27.272
very convenient as you can 
see a real-time image here.

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.917
And it's basically what 
you get in post as well.

00:05:30.092 --> 00:05:33.408
A much higher quality is 
possible if shooting RAW.

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.023
The RAW mode here is 
called JP46, or just JP4.

00:05:38.073 --> 00:05:39.848
These are actually two 
different modes.

00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:42.736
But what you see when I 
switch the modes here...

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:45.568
is that I lose part of my 
real-time preview.

00:05:45.642 --> 00:05:47.701
It turns into a black-and-
white image...

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.556
that is somehow 
distorted.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.818
This is how it is 
actually recorded.

00:05:51.876 --> 00:05:53.590
So you get more 
information that way...

00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:55.759
but you lose the ability 
to view the video.

00:05:55.932 --> 00:05:58.969
Currently, we don't have any 
software that can demosaic...

00:05:58.987 --> 00:06:02.281
this RAW image in real-time, so 
you can also view it in color.

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:04.126
That is planned 
for the future.

00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:06.643
And the second, 
the JP4 RAW mode...

00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:08.667
has an additional 
advantage...

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:12.346
since certain image processing steps 
inside the camera are skipped.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.627
Therefore it allows even higher 
quality at lower datarate.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.110
But, in this case,
if we press it...

00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:21.226
we don't get any real-time 
preview any more at all.

00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:22.978
it's not even 
black-and-white.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.463
Also, the software that 
is able to display...

00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:28.027
this mode in real-time is 
not developed yet.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.041
With my Apertus 
prototype here...

00:06:30.163 --> 00:06:32.384
you see that some features 
are already implemented...

00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:35.228
some are still missing and I'm sure 
there are bugs somewhere.

00:06:35.398 --> 00:06:37.350
But I hope I was able to 
give you a preview...

00:06:37.468 --> 00:06:38.861
of what could be 
possible in the future.
