Today well be reviewing the Swagman XP folding
three bike carrier for inch and a quarter

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.460
and two inch hitches, part number S64950.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.500
Normally, well load the bike on the cradles
closest to the vehicle, but for todays demonstration

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.821
purposes we will be loading the bike on the
end cradles so you can see the function of

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.470
the bike rack.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.759
This bike carrier features a heavy duty steel
design that carries up to three bikes.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.790
Note that vehicles with Class I hitches will
be limited to two bikes.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.080
Before we begin our review, well first show
you how to remove the two inch adapter for

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.080
our bike rack.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.640
Well use the included Allen key to take out
the bolt of the shank of the carrier.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.800
Now, for todays review, we will be using the
vehicle that is equipped with a two inch hitch,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.600
so well put the adapter back on.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.830
To begin our review, well start by installing
the carrier to the vehicle.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.710
Well slide the shank of the carrier into the
opening of the hitch, line up our pin holes,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.409
thread our anti-rattle bolt through the pin
holes and tighten with a wrench.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.950
You can also lock this bike carrier to your
vehicle with the Swagmans anti-rattle hitch

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.399
lock, sold separately, part number S64029.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.439
The cradles on the XP secure the bikes to
the rack using thick Kreton vinyl cushioning

00:01:28.439 --> 00:03:07.930
and steel plates.
