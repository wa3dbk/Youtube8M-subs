00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:13.720
Sure. No worries. Oh, look, I gotta go. The cavalry just turned 
 up. OK, bye. Corporal, what can I do for you?

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.480
Listen, Jerry, you gotta get rid of that stuff. It's making me nervous.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.320
I'm not into drugs, and I don't...

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.080
Chill the fuck out, my friend. You're really getting on my nerves.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.120
Besides, who are you going to get in trouble with? 
 I'm your superior officer...

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.640
And you told me you needed the money.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.480
I do need the money...

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.520
Uh-huh! But you don't like drugs?

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.400
I don't think they're a good scene.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
Me neither.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.480
But you like guns, huh? They don't give you a moral problem I mean?

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.460
No.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.800
Good, cause I know a guy who can sell all the guns 
 we can get him. Which is, trust me, quite a lot.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.280
I don't know Sergeant, this is getting heavy.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.240
You'll make a whole pile of cash, for nothing. 
 Buy that sick brother of yours a whole lot of candy.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.950
What do I have to do?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:22.200
Nothing. Just go and pick up the money from him. 
 He's down over by the docks.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.960
Hey Vic! You want some of this, huh?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.180
You must be Vic. Jerry told me about you.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.000
Hey. I used to be in the service...

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.680
Yeah, listen, he said you'd have some money for me.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.900
Sure. Sure...

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.680
Well, I ain't a bank... I don't have it 
 on me. But I'll take you to it.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.160
I've been having trouble with them Cholo boys. 
 Some of them have been...

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.320
What the hell is a Cholo?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.240
Bunch of Mexican Gang-bangers. Bad boys, 
 trying to take over all the gun running in town.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.190
Look. Where's the money Phil?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.640
Yeah, well, funny thing, you see, it's like this...

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.200
It's under the floorboards at my old place.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.840
But the Cholo evicted me and now I can't get to it.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.300
I'll get to it.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.000
See you around.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.380
What the fuck is this?

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.700
Cholo kill you good, pendej√≥.
