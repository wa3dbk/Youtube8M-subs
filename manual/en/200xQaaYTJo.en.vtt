Hi my name is Daniel.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.780
I am a fourth year collaborative Nursing student
at York University.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.619
The program here at York offers an excellent
combination of both academic and practical

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.210
skills and you can't have one without the
other.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.220
A big part of nursing is the research foundation.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.519
And that's a good strong aspect that York
provides because it gives you the research

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.519
and

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.860
the knowledge you need to effectively practice
when you're in a clinical setting.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.079
So one of the great things about this program,
is it allows

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.840
you to experience different avenues of nursing.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.380
So you may work in a pediatric placement,
geriatric placement, and you may have mental

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.380
health settings

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.680
as well as community settings.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.539
So you get exposed to a wide variety of nursing
placements which can allow you to figure out

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.699
exactly what you'd like

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.140
specialize in.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.879
So I was part of the Joint Seneca-York Collobarative
Nursing Program so for the first two years

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.950
of the program, I spent it at a small

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.260
college setting.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.079
So one of my biggest worries when I came to
York was this transition, culture shock into

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.140
a big university setting.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.420
What I found helpful

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.000
was the orientation I had when I came to York.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.950
There were fellow Nursing students from third
or fourth year who were able to give us a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.740
tour to show us

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.091
where things were especially buildings and
classes that would be specific for the nursing

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:29.189
program.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.590
I've taken the opportunity to involve myself
in extra-curricular

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.780
activities such as health ambassadors which
help future nursing students as well as current

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.980
nursing students in their academic endeavours.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.980
I found this to be

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.979
an excellent opportunity for leadership skills,
team building exercises, and to create professional

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.229
relationships with faculty members and directors
which can

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.799
help open doors later, in your nursing career.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.000
So after I graduate I'm looking forward to
working in pediatrics at Sick Kids and also

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.300
furthering my career

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.869
in nursing.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.479
I'm considering taking a master's program
and becoming a nurse practitioner.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.390
As well, I'd like to start teaching in the
University setting because

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.069
I've personally found that several of my professors
here at York have made a significant impact

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.920
on my life and my career and I would like
to have that same

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.379
opportunity to help future nursing students.
