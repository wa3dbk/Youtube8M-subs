00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.510
what's happening some pilots are
allegedly having the sham divorces so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.900
their spouses can collect this pension
money and then they really stay together

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.120

i'm

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.129
by the way they actually paid out ten
million to eleven million dollars in

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.250
pension distributions to these pilots
movement a significant amount of money

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.430
now they took the situation of court

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.509
and and even though they to get all the
way to appeals court federal appeal

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.610
p_p_o_'s court

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.670
add the kills quite has decided that no
continental airlines can not do an

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.220
investigation into their pilots or into
the pilots divorce

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.610
uh... maids unlock all its ron uh...
because a privacy issues you're not

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.320
allowed to do investigations europe
lawyers personal life much i don't

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.630
understand but at the same time if this
is something that's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.730
seriously a problem for the company and
they're losing ten to eleven million

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.610
dollars because of something that people
are doing that's illegal then

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.360
and there needs to be something to
protect the company and you know me i'm

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.950
not someone who's like that protect the
corporation owner miss colbert america

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.430
here i know i g rosalva corporation has
on their side by seriously that

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.479
their in your corporation and the
question uh... and i'm sure i saw it

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.389
sorry

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:07.279
began i'm kitty look this is a very
hungry one one one i think this will be

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:12.269
problematic for other pilots and because
if they had these abuses continue

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.359
apparent ease alleged abuses i should
say

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:19.129
uh... what continental airlines will do
is build take away their on pension

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.360
program and not have the federal
government

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.549
odd that acts disastrous but that's all
you can abuse the system so my ruling on

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.480
it which of course will override
whatever legal system that there was in

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.269
that case

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.859
uh... is that look if they're getting
the actual divorce

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.290
so that they can collect the passion but
then there's a living together

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.959
well whether he had given to me within
legal proceedings

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.629
and if they can and also wall opinion
adventure money okay and that's why

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.270
freight but every day didn't actually
get divorced and it's a scam

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.550
and offcourse u got 'em let the company
look into that film and the last person

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.140
on earth that one of some private
corporations to put into our brother

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.659
uh... ash is a public or gracious to be
into our private lives

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.099
i mean it doesn't mean you're allowed to
run scams on company expenses that i

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.689
mean i think that's crazy dot right and
he said he's behind me i don't know this

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.549
is being fair but these pilots can get
the voices like

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.519
legal divorce inside with in a moment
ago but they stay together

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.189
no i know i mean like clearing my room
very clear and i i think that that's a

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.199
legal divorce

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.159
bipartisan accel

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.119
and our own in this is an area that you
really feel like a family together and

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.199
there is evidence that you're living
together and

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.879
you basically get and it's obvious that
you didn't know bidding union has all

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.319
but there will kill your technically
divorce for you still living together

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.899
all he had to prove it immediately

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:46.749
lives for our area of

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.159
of sally has settled bob locating your
freedom no now i'm on the judge's site
