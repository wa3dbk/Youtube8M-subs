00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.400
Hello and welcome back to module 5 of this
European Schoolnet Academy course on games

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.029
based learning in schools.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.770
As I have mentioned, this is module 5.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.760
You should have already completed 4 modules
to get to this stage.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.450
Module 1 “Why use computer games?”, module
2 “Using games for Thematic Learning”,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.011
module 3 “Learning Games”, module 4 “What
can we learn from games?” and once you have

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:42.879
finished this module, next week we will be
opening up the last module, module 6 “Why

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.880
is it important to teach about games?”.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.420
As I have mentioned, this is module 5 and
this is all about Designing Games.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.000
Just like the other modules, we will split
this module into a number of sections.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.960
In a minute, I will give you an introduction
to Games Design.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.410
Before we start though, I wanted just to point
out what this module is not.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.810
This is not a module with micro tutorials
telling you how to specifically use Games

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.920
Design software.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.290
Instead, what it is, it is a way to showcase
some of the great games design work which

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.460
is already going on across Europe and also
to point you in the right direction of some

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.180
Games Design tools, and also some tutorials
that are available elsewhere on the web.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.590
Let’s get started with the introduction,
shall we?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.979
Fundamentally, I think Games Design is all
about trying to create a generation of creators

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.890
of digital content.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.020
We already know that we have got a generation
of consumers of digital content across Europe,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.429
but it is increasingly well-known that actually
we need more and more young people to be able

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.310
to create digital assets, as well as just
to consume content from the internet or digitally.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.740
If we are going to do this, it is really important
that we think about some type of progression

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.270
when we look at games design.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.530
I get frustrated sometimes when people say
that designing computer games is a domain

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.950
for the secondary school or the high school.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.929
The truth of it is young people can start
designing computer games from a very young

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.460
age and there are a number of tools and software
packages that can help us do this.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.450
In any games design course that you will put
in together for your school, your educational

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.739
authority or your State, always consider what
the progression is.

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.410
When do you want to start introducing the
building blocks of good games design, and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.180
how can you help young people develop these
skills as they progress through their school

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.239
years and indeed progress their curriculum.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.900
One of the other great things about games
is it provides a real hook to get young people

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.370
interested in coding.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.430
Again, across Europe, there is a big focus
at the moment about trying to get more young

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.209
people to be able to code digitally.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.540
The problem of this of course is that actually
lots of young people do not like coding, so

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.280
really hard thing to do and it can include
quite a lot of complicated maths.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.830
However, if we take the context of a video
game, then this can actually be used as a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.069
really useful thing to get young people interested
in coding in the first place.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.840
But again, it is important that we start from
a very early age.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.849
One of the other things that games design
allows us to do is that it allows us to introduce

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.390
Cross Curricular projects.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.521
Because of course, if we think about a good
computer game, it is not just about the code

00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.010
in the game itself.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.780
Good computer games also have lots of characters
in them.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.120
Have a look at these 4 silhouettes here for
example.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.010
Even though you might not have ever played
a computer game, all created a computer game

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.580
for that matter, I bet that you can name some,
perhaps all of the characters that are available

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.900
here in the silhouettes.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.110
The reason of that of course is because games
characters are incredibly culturally relevant

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.340
and they are now really inbuilt into our society.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.439
When we talk about games design, that is not
just think about the coding, but that is also

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.310
trying to get young people to think about
how story or even characters have developed

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.310
over time.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.160
Here is a great example of character development.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.799
Take a look at old Super Mario back in 1985
and let’s look at how he has evolved over

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.530
time as different games and consoles have
evolved over time.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.019
All the way up to the most modern games that
are available for the Wii U and on another

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.000
hand old consoles.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.870
So if we think about computer games, let’s
think about also dividing young people into

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.390
teams to develop things like Character, Story,
Scenery, or even play around with some other

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.410
more sophisticated and physics engines that
are available in games, so that we can adjust

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.830
the Variables.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.470
Throughout this module, I am going to be referring
to some of the courses which are available

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.660
from the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.790
One of the reasons I am going to be referring
to them is because (A) they are very good,

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.530
(B) they started to be translated into a number
of languages, and (C) they are available to

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.470
use freely for anybody that is interested
in using them for educational purposes.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.620
So the Royal Society of Edinburgh and its
the Computing Science curriculum.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.490
That is the end of my introduction.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.750
What I would like you to think about before
we move on to the next video, I want you to

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.320
have a think about what are the components
of a good video game, and also what could

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.900
games design teach young people about working
in teams?

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.900
Will see you in the next video.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.350
Thanks very much.
