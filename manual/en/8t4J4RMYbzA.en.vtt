00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.120
This is the second video in a 3 part series
called, the path of an architect.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.219
When it comes to coursework every school has
different requirements for graduation.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.670
In my experience as a student and teacher
of the Studio portion of architecture school,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.149
its definitely the most time consuming course
&amp; a common feature at most universities.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.860
Studio is a design course where the students
are typically given a design problem and the

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.850
instructors work with the student over the
course of the semester to develop and refine

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.039
the solution.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:45.160
The design problems will vary greatly but
in the end tend to focus on real design projects

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.940
like a home, theatre, community center, school,
shops, museums, etc...

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.850
As a student it is likely that most of your
time will be spent in the facility where this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.379
course is attended.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.269
AT some point you may even feel like you live
there.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.210
The architects education is also filled with
more mainstream coursework that pertains to

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.810
architecture such as classes on Art and Architectural
History, Structures, Materials, Building systems,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.750
Visual arts, Computer software, as well as
requirements like English and Mathematics.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.890
One of the most valuable things about education
is learning beyond your major.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.979
Taking coursework in subjects like Astronomy,
Anthropology, Philosophy, Literature, Language

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.570
or History will broaden your mind and prepare
the way for a capacity to enjoy and appreciate

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.719
much more than just architecture.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.320
Beyond coursework as a student youre also
going to want to consider how to use your

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.130
time between semesters.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.200
If youre not attending a work study college
you should definitely be working in an architects

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.680
office between semesters or even before you
get to college.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.210
It will help to define your direction in terms
of where and what you would like to be focusing

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.460
your attention.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.530
Conversely, the experience may simply steer
you away from the profession and into something

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.299
your more interested in.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.500
Either way, experience in an architectural
firm during college is worthwhile.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.250
See you for part 3.
